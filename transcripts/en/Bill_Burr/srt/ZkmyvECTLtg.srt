1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:05,270
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:08,330
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:13,331
And I am just checking in on you.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,700
Who's that checking in on you? You
can't, sorry. I'm in New York, you know,

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,420
all of a sudden you just got to start
doing your little sin, natural vibe. Um,

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,340
Joe and I'm going out and I'm buying
a new pair of fucking sneakers today.

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,480
Go Away. Are you going to get you? Do
you gotta get the Jordan Five's? Dude,

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,160
I know what I'm going to get.
You know I'm going to, I,

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,890
I'm getting some old man running sneakers.
I need some workout sneakers.

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,870
You know about the ones that were on
better call Saul for the old ladies.

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,200
Did you guys watch the rest of
that a series? Did you see it yet?

12
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:51,980
Can I ruin it for you?
I've got to tell you in the last episode,

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,580
in the last scene when the guy says,

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,810
just trying to get all you guys to scamper
for your fucking pause buttons. No, no,

15
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,940
no.
I didn't watch it yet.

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,130
People literally run out of the room.
People run out of the fucking room.

17
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:11,370
When you'd start talking about a show,
they haven't seen the last episode yet.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,170
Have they do that?
You know what I mean?

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,540
But if you just sit there and you're
fucking, somebody rips a fight,

20
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,360
people just put a fucking shirt
over their nose. Oh, who did that?

21
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:24,830
You're literally inhaling air
from this guy's ass. You know?

22
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,650
And that doesn't make you leave
the room. But if, God forbid,

23
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:30,110
somebody brings up the last
episode of a fucking show,

24
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,590
you haven't seen everybody runs
out like the building's on fire.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,740
Um, it is a perfect, perfect
day in New York City.

26
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:44,741
The breeze don't this breeze
top five breezes ever.

27
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,050
This breeze,
my top five ever.

28
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,950
That's a verse you think for as you
would actually rank his breezes top five

29
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:56,000
reasons ever. Dude, I was sitting there,

30
00:01:56,001 --> 00:02:00,080
I had on a pair of Jordan's sexes with
the Fucking v Neck with the chain on the

31
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:05,000
outside over, over. Waitress came up
to me. She could barely take my order.

32
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,580
She couldn't,
she couldn't even like she was taking in.

33
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,170
The whole thing was ridiculous.
New pair of guests, jeans over.

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,510
Oh fuck. Anyways, um, yeah, so
I'm up in fucking port Chester.

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,720
I didn't know what port Chester is by no.
Westchester,

36
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,290
there's east Chester and Alva daily.
Those port Chester,

37
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,210
which I believe is just Connecticut.
Um,

38
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:38,211
there tonight I'm there Tamara and then
I'm there on Saturday and then I'm done

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,340
and then I'm back. And uh,
I'll tell you right now,

40
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,850
you have not experienced loneliness
till you have a fucking kid.

41
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,660
It meant and then you leave my favorite
part of the fucking days when my kid

42
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:53,640
wakes up.
You know what I mean?

43
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,660
Cause like they're super fucking
rested and they just, you know,

44
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,710
life hasn't beaten down yet.

45
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,360
They don't have any credit card debt then
know got some psycho blowing up their

46
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:08,800
phone. They don't have this shit.
They got to do some fucking receipt.

47
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:13,390
They have to find, they got, they got,
they the look of contentment on her face.

48
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,880
You know when you go down,
when you go to give her a kiss,

49
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,280
like she lifts all of her limbs come up

50
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,050
like a baby's ability to do leg lifts.

51
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:27,280
I don't know how the fuck if I tried
to do what she did, just straight up,

52
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:30,740
just lift some write up.
I don't get it.

53
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,090
Sit there and suck in their toes.

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,070
Evidently hours that flexible at one
point tell you that a couple million miles

55
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:40,540
in the back of the fucking plane,
that'll,

56
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,040
that'll take the infant right out of you.

57
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,630
That'll take this Flaco
right out of your eye. Um,

58
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,760
that's what I missed the most,

59
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:56,620
so that I won't always face time
with my lovely lady. And um,

60
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,330
as the best. It's the best, but
it sucks and I'm on the road,

61
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:06,040
but I just out here being like, you
know what? I'm earning money someday.

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,970
So when she has to go to private fucking,
uh,

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,110
kindergarten for 90 grand a year
or whatever the hell it costs,

64
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:17,440
because evidently if she goes to a public
school, she's going to get stabbed.

65
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,480
You know what happened?
What happened to the public schools?

66
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,620
Was that the computers? Is that what
it was? Everybody had to have a tablet,

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,030
a laptop, some sort of
interface. Is that what happened?

68
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:33,430
And went right through the fun and all
of a sudden we couldn't keep up with

69
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:33,791
China.

70
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,440
How to fuck is China beaten
us the overhead of a fucking
billion people alone?

71
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,820
I mean,
we should be like,

72
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,990
we should get everything at a 60% discount
over here as far as educating our own

73
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,750
people.
Does it make any sense?

74
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,810
Does any of it make any fucking sense?

75
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,740
Does it make any sense how so many people
are fucking struggling out there and

76
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:58,741
they just keep building these luxury
apartments and he's fucking giant goddamn

77
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,480
houses who, oh, right. And they, oh yeah,

78
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,890
it's money from Russia.
It's Ronnie from China.

79
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,760
It's oil money from the Middle East.
Now listen,

80
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,350
I don't know what to do about China.

81
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:14,440
I don't know what to do about Russia
and I don't know what to do about the

82
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,441
Middle East,

83
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:18,460
but that's not gonna stop me from telling
you what to do about all these things

84
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,640
I just ate. Why is my
stomach grumbling? Um,

85
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,920
this is all you've got to do for the
Middle East. Okay. All we do is we just,

86
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,230
you fucking, you embrace
solar power. That's it.

87
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,430
How do we do that? How do we do that with
the oil companies? If somebody fucking,

88
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:36,821
and we'll be,

89
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:40,750
if we actually went to solar direction
when a bunch of planes start crashing

90
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,630
that had the leaders of the
solar movement on them. Yes,

91
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:47,020
that would definitely happen.
They would definitely take them out.

92
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:48,790
So what do you do?
This is what you do.

93
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,620
You give the son to the oil people.
Okay.

94
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,340
You draw up a contract and you
say the sun is yours. All right.

95
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,800
Now what are they going to do with
the site? They can't put it out.

96
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,650
They can't touch it.
It'll burn their fucking hands,

97
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,910
but they just make the money off
the book and uh, the solar power.

98
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,930
Okay. And if they could
just somehow handle that,

99
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:15,290
those people in the Middle East is sitting
on a bunch of goop that they can make

100
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,370
money off of. They could just seamlessly
fucking walk away from that Shit.

101
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,231
If I was president,

102
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:25,280
I would literally give oil companies
federal fucking grants to fucking get the

103
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:29,270
solar thing going.
You guys own the sun.

104
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,920
I would just keep walk. But you own
the sun and they'd be sitting, well,

105
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,220
both on your book. There's stuff in this
stuff. When the mill waste over, dude,

106
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,450
fuck that stuff.

107
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,183
All right?

108
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,260
You want that stuff? Is that, that
stuff's like God took an Atari.

109
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,800
It's like the Reebok pump.
Nobody gives a shit. Okay,

110
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,970
this is the new shit.

111
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,750
This is the new shit we're
giving you the fucking son,

112
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,853
son.

113
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,330
You understand that you own
the center of the solar system.

114
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,613
All right?

115
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,410
In every fucking little bit of heat that
comes off that thing that trickles down

116
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:17,860
on a Mike freckled bald goddamn head.
You own.

117
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,260
Yeah,

118
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,620
you put a fucking meat or red on
my back. I don't give a shit. Okay?

119
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,640
And I want you guys to
thinking, Eh, built. This
doesn't make any fucking sense.

120
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:29,130
I don't give a shit. Let's
listen to me. Hear me up.

121
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,330
You give these people the sun,
you give them the God son.

122
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,120
All right? And then what? What
happens over in the Middle East,

123
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,930
they sit in on all of this fucking Goop,
all right?

124
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,280
And all of a sudden it's not worth,
it's not worth diddly squat.

125
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,990
Okay. And all of a sudden the
fucking, the bills started piling up.

126
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,220
They don't know what to do. They start
selling their properties over here.

127
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,470
They want to give money
to the terrorist groups.

128
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:01,180
Then I'll get the money to do it.

129
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,610
You have fucking bleed them dry.
Then that's it.

130
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,090
And then they go back to doing whatever
the fuck they want to do over there.

131
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,600
God forbid they live their lives they
way they want to live it over there.

132
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,180
God forbid they're not into Jesus
and Starbucks, God for fucking bid.

133
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,960
They want to walk around and some clothes
that are actually functional for the

134
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:28,740
part of the world they live in.
You just leave them the fuck alone.

135
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,670
And then all they gotta do is just keep
driving around in cars and all of that

136
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:35,250
shit. So they, you know,
they'll make a lot less money,

137
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,470
but they won't have us over there going,
hey,

138
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:41,730
you should do this and you should do that.
We just get the fuck out of there.

139
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,650
Then we're over here,
solar powered everything

140
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,403
right?

141
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,520
Just think about everything
and think about your shirt.
Solar powered everything.

142
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,640
Everything fucking solar power. I
know what you're thinking. Well, Bill,

143
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,620
what happens at night?
You go to bed.

144
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,393
Okay,

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,790
what do people do in Alaska
during the winter? Fuck them.

146
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,530
We got to get out. We
got again, that place.

147
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,020
If it's the last thing we ever do,
it's bankrupting us.

148
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:23,770
It's making it very few people,
a ton of fucking body is bankrupting us.

149
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:28,390
We're not going to seek,
cannot solve that shit.

150
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,160
Okay,
so now that we know you can't solve it,

151
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:34,800
because I said you can't solve
it without doing any research.

152
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,920
Now that now that I've established
that as a fact on my own podcast,

153
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,970
the only thing, other reason to be over
there is it sitting on all that goop,

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,080
but now we don't need the group. The
group, the group, the group is on fire.

155
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,750
We don't give a fuck.
Keep it

156
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,633
right.

157
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,930
You give the son to the oil companies,

158
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,480
that's it. Just go total
solar power. You know Jimmy,

159
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,550
that Georgia peanut farmer, he
said it 40 years ago. He said,

160
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:07,030
we are addicted to oil. We've had. We
just kept going and going and going,

161
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:10,360
and now look at us now.
Look at us now.

162
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,670
Look at US spending all this
fucking money over there.

163
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,820
They're giving it to the constant
of shooting shit at us, right?

164
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:17,140
And then when shooting back at them,

165
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,320
they're making all this money and then
they'd come over and they buy a 50

166
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,100
fucking thousand square foot
house overlooking our shit.

167
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,860
Oh look in RJ. Hey, we overlook you.

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,100
We're up on the hill.
Not the other way around.

169
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,013
Huh?

170
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,800
You give them the sun. Oh God,
you guys, I'm telling you,

171
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,860
I would have to,
I would fucking sell those oil guys.

172
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:48,430
I would have a meeting under a mountain
or wherever the fuck do you meet with

173
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:51,550
these fucking people that really run shit.
You know,

174
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,540
you're underneath the mountain.

175
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,560
You got this fucking underwater
waterfalls and shit. Right?

176
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,010
There's like these planet of the apes
plucking things walking or whenever the

177
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:04,820
fuck goes on underneath that thing.
Right. And you just tell them,

178
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,640
is that shit flow?
And I can't,

179
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:10,640
I can't do a waterfall on my fucking
the dude from police academy.

180
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:15,190
I can't do that. Sound effects?
Yeah. Gentlemen. I came here.

181
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,400
I came underneath this mountain tonight

182
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,420
to keep me as a son. I'm sorry. I don't
have my proper recording equipment here.

183
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:27,030
I can't. I can't do my illuminati
media. You give him the fuck him.

184
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:27,930
The fucking Sun.

185
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,263
Yeah,

186
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,060
give on the fucking Sun.

187
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,140
[inaudible] that's what I would do.

188
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,400
Instead of going over there and
talking about evil doors and doors,

189
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,620
the evil and fucking this,
that and the other.

190
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,760
You pack the whole fucking Shit Up.

191
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,510
That's it. You pack it all up.
You sent over 10 cargo planes.

192
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:59,860
You bring the men and women of the
Arab forces. You bring them home.

193
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,020
All right.

194
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,240
You say you can keep your Google,

195
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,780
you can keep you safe,

196
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,830
but I want some of those cool clothes.
I like the clothes they wear over there.

197
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,210
The Jane Open ended one, Z,
whatever the fuck you call it.

198
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,330
I think those things are cool. Matt.
I wish I want, I want one of those.

199
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,670
Can I buy one of those
without offending Muslims?

200
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,550
Could I talk my way out of a beheading?
If I put one of those on, just went,

201
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,670
look man, I'm a, I'm a red head. It
was hot out. I look on page. Am I,

202
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,030
what am I supposed to do?

203
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,883
Yeah.

204
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,760
Then they get my face.
You'll blow away. Um,

205
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,830
that's it. That's all I wanted to say
today. Give the oil companies, this son,

206
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,250
he gave it to them and then the
whole fucking thing is over.

207
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,413
Whatever.

208
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,620
I believe I can fly.
Um,

209
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,710
so I got to get here tonight
and I'm going to go, well,

210
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:04,560
I'm going to go play some drums, is a
little rehearsal studio down the street.

211
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:07,200
I'm going to go play my fucking
drums for a couple hours.

212
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,860
I was going to go right around and one
of those fucking Citibank fucking banker

213
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,550
cut bicycles, but there's never any,
they got like 14 for the whole city.

214
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,880
And then also what kind of an
asshole rides a bicycle in a city.

215
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,890
You know what I mean? What am I in Europe?
How many people die a year in Europe?

216
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:25,440
Just riding around on
bicycles in a fucking city.

217
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,180
So is fucking cars go by walk.
We bought, we bought, we bought,

218
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:35,020
we fucking yet another ambulance going
over to pick up some fucking, yeah.

219
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,251
Six foot,

220
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:42,251
three inch fucking 110 pound European
that taken out on his bicycle that has a

221
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,550
basket on the front.

222
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,743
MMM.

223
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,660
I like riding bicycles. Oh, you know what?

224
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,140
I watched this documentary
called ovarian psychosis.

225
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,530
Right.
How do you not click on that?

226
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,580
I first clicked on this action movie
and it was just the same fucking shit.

227
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:03,600
The one guy who beats the
fuck out of everybody. Nobody
ever, they all have guns,

228
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:06,330
but they never think to use it.
And I was just like,

229
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:08,490
I've seen this a million times.
It's really loud.

230
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,660
And look at that nice classic car.
They're wrecking the fucking thing. I,

231
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,190
I can't watch this shit.

232
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,960
So I shut it off and I saw this thing
called Ovarian psychos and I was like,

233
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,800
I want, I want, I got it. I to see what
this is about. It was about some, uh,

234
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,780
some women in east La,

235
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,840
mainly Mexican who are sick of fucking
being scared women and they started their

236
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:34,590
own group when they ride around
these women's only, um, you know,

237
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,370
riding bicycles when there's like
a full moon or some shit. I Dunno.

238
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,340
I Dunno. So I was watching this stuff
and of course typical guys look, Whoa,

239
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,200
women's all we go slow

240
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,710
or the fire guys only bug,
right.

241
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:53,690
I hate when people act like
it's a level playing field,

242
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,180
you know what I mean?

243
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,390
It's like they're having this thing
because it's not a level playing field.

244
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,470
One of the women,

245
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,350
and there was this like everything's kind
of full fucking men only. What's your,

246
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,210
it really is when you really look at it.
Okay.

247
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:10,570
I don't want him to fucking come off as
like a, a complete God damn liberal here.

248
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,180
All right. But you know, it
really is, it's, it's just,

249
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,570
it's there for the taking for
you. When you're a guy, you know,

250
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,870
not saying you're going to get it.
Nine out of 10 people still fail.

251
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,120
That's one thing that feminists
don't realize. You know,

252
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:26,610
when you listen to them talking about
what it's like to be a guy that had this

253
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,750
cartoonish idea of what it's like
to be a guy, you just show up. Oh.

254
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:35,610
And the classic one, the more you act
like a Dick, the more people respect you.

255
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:39,180
I love that one. If a women of a woman
does it, she's considered a bitch.

256
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:41,250
If a guy does it,
it's like,

257
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,110
have they ever done a survey?
Just ask the general public, Hey,

258
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:51,100
if you had your choice between working
for somebody nice or working for a

259
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:54,550
complete fucking asshole who treats
you like shit, which would you pick?

260
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,620
Yeah.

261
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,100
Yeah. Nobody does. I think the,
when I meet successful people,

262
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,760
truly successful people that get it.

263
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,260
Yeah.

264
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Successful in there, personal life
and in their professional life,

265
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,340
those people I always meet, their
always humble. They're self deprecating.

266
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:19,250
They walk into a room, you want
to be around him and they, they,

267
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,020
they're good at talking to people.

268
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,430
They don't come in like fucking
Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen Ross.

269
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,070
Um, that bullshit that men respect a guy
like that fucking record of fucking with

270
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,970
him. No, I don't,

271
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,260
I don't respect anybody like what I see
as an insecure asshole who's afraid it's

272
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,660
all gonna go away by the
afternoon. Um, anyway,

273
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,540
so I'm watching this documentary,
check it out. It's actually really a,

274
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,170
you only get bothered me
about the documentary is the
way they spelled psychos,

275
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,910
ovarian psychos. It's
like, but you're on cycles.

276
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,530
So why didn't you spell the first half?
Like cycle and the rest like psycho,

277
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,110
you know, a little word play
there. Nothing. All right. Anyways,

278
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,130
so I watched it and it was interesting
and actually it's this one woman said in

279
00:17:06,131 --> 00:17:09,860
it, you know, cause she'd been through
all this shit when she was, uh,

280
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,170
a little girl with their mother and
then she had a daughter, I believe she,

281
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,240
and at least she had a kid, she became
a mom. And then her mother said, well,

282
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:24,190
now do you at least understand me?
I bet you understand me a lot more.

283
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:26,110
And she said to her mother,
no,

284
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,590
actually I've never understood you less.

285
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,700
And actually cringed when I, when I
saw that and I was just like, you know,

286
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:36,160
that's something if you feel it,
you don't say to your mom

287
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,060
like, what do you get out of
saying that's your mother?

288
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,050
All you're gonna do is devastated her
and make her feel like she completely

289
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:51,660
failed as a mom and it doesn't
get you any real estate.

290
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,750
That's something you say to your
friend and now that I have a kid,

291
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:56,291
it's just like,

292
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,750
I don't even understand what the fuck my
mother did to me even more and have it

293
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,360
in your fucking clink your wine
coolers and then that's it.

294
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,310
You don't say it to your mom

295
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,650
or checking callers.
Um,

296
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,700
I just watched the Schick
hydro transformer ad that
made those dollar shave club

297
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:17,110
ads make even more fucking sense.

298
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,400
The blade literally turned into
one of those fucking robots.

299
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,100
Okay.

300
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,170
Why is my tumble wagging his finger at me?

301
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:29,370
Like he just blocked a shot in a mobile
one commercials. Is he out of NBA Money?

302
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,680
Where the fuck did he
come from out of nowhere?

303
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,450
Did he buy one too many fucking gold
chains is some shit and then easily called

304
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:40,380
up as agent or I need to work again.
Is that Schwartzenegger? I don't know.

305
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,270
Okay.

306
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,630
I don't have no idea.
Um, I don't have my ads.

307
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,810
I'll have to read the ad at the end
of this fucking thing. Whenever that,

308
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,320
whenever the fuck that thing comes
in, I have no idea. Oh, by the way,

309
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:57,760
I forgot to bring this up. Season three
of f is for family is going to happen.

310
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,080
Thank you so much to everybody
who watched, we are now, um,

311
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,190
breaking stories for season three.
It's animation.

312
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:09,940
So season three ought to come
out somewhere in late 2019.

313
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,900
Now we're hoping that we can
have a come out. You know,

314
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,540
we came out May 30th
of this year, so we're,

315
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,160
that's what I'm personally,
that's what I'm shooting for it now.

316
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,010
I haven't communicated that to
anybody I've worked, I'm working with.

317
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,480
I'm just assuming that they already know
that. And then if it doesn't happen,

318
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,540
I will just get quiet for
no reason around them.

319
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,470
That's the way I was taught to
communicate with others. While growing up,

320
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,760
do all the math in your head,
do not communicate it to anybody.

321
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,650
And when they don't see it,
the way you see it,

322
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,790
you just stopped talking to people.
That was the way it was done.

323
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,420
And then you just don't talk to
him for like three days. And then,

324
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,800
then when they finally like,
well,

325
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:53,500
I guess I'm not gonna fucking talk to
you again. You then out of nowhere,

326
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,580
it bring up whatever game happened last
night and you start talking about it

327
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:59,740
like the last three days.
Never fucking happened.

328
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,610
That's the way it was done

329
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,800
when I was growing up. Um,
they, one of these days,

330
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,100
I'm actually going to fly up
to port Chester and helicopter.

331
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:15,430
I'm trying to convince this guy
to put dual controls. I mean,

332
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,440
it's the whole fucking
purpose of me going right.

333
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,700
Fly over the George Washington bridge.
I just want to see how you, uh,

334
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,510
transition through all this
fucking commercial airspace
where you have j f k you

335
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:30,700
have LaGuardia and you have new work.

336
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,390
But I see helicopters all the time
going up and down the Hudson Bay.

337
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:38,050
So there's gotta be some corridor
that they're allowed to fly,

338
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:41,560
like probably I would
guess no higher than like,

339
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,370
I dunno the flight really fucking low,
but I never know if it's like sightseeing,

340
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,730
but I wouldn't think you'd be any higher
than a thousand feet and you just Kinda,

341
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,010
you know, and then just look out
for sully when he comes to landed

342
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,560
in the Hudson Bay. Um, I do know with lax,

343
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,990
you either transition along the beach
at a below one 50 or you go along

344
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,400
supported a boulevard,
which I never do that one.

345
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,120
That one always scares the shit out of
me because you look down and there's a

346
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:12,460
jumbo jet underneath you.
And I always think like,

347
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:16,870
what if she aborts is landing and
just fucking yanks back on the stick.

348
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Then I got this fucking 300 person missile
coming right at me and my little art,

349
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,194
22,

350
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,143
you know,

351
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,760
you ever see a cheetah
running down a baby, whatever.

352
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,790
That's what it would be like accepted.
See Aviation version of that.

353
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,380
And I would be the baby gazelle,

354
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,660
not even out a baby turtle.
How slow is a baby? Turtle.

355
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,590
Is there anything sadder than
watching that documentary?

356
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:46,830
When those baby turtles try to make
it to the ocean and all those fucking

357
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,740
seagulls come down and pick
off nine out of 10 of them.

358
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,890
I fucking love turtles.
I had a pet turtle when I was a kid

359
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,120
and um,

360
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,330
used to feed it like dead grass offers
and shit. I love this fucking thing.

361
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,560
I love cleaning the tank,

362
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:08,070
making sure it's shell stayed fucking
wet and all that so it wouldn't crack.

363
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,920
And uh, had my little tank set
it up. I fucking love this thing.

364
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,140
I love watching it coming up
for air and all that shit.

365
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,590
So one time I went to church because
that's what I used to do every Sunday.

366
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:22,020
Right. So I went to church
with my family baggy shirt.

367
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,810
So we go to church and uh,
I came home.

368
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:29,570
Yeah.

369
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,140
And the turtle was the way I'd
position the rock. The turtle

370
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,880
had gone head first into the water and
it's turtle ass was out of the water.

371
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,290
Yeah.

372
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,570
And I mean we went over and I picked
it up and its head was sunk all the way

373
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,404
back.

374
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,273
Yeah.

375
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,490
It's like Shell and its
eyes would close in.

376
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:52,500
His mouth was open and it wasn't moving.

377
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:53,730
Yeah.

378
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,350
And I was like, Oh fuck, is
it dead? Did it drown? And I
went downstairs and I said,

379
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:01,020
dad, it's my turtle dead.
And he goes, yeah, he's gone.

380
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,020
And I was fucking devastated.

381
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,020
So I took a red and take a brown,
you know,

382
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,750
you put your lunch in the Brown, like
lunch bags, put the turtle in there.

383
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:19,380
And then I went out in the woods and
dug a little grave and put the marker up

384
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:23,010
and then that was it. And then my dad
was like, we'll get you another one,

385
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,860
we'll get you another one. I was like, no,
I don't deserve it. I blame turtles. I,

386
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,770
it was my fault. I set up
the fucking, the rocks wrong.

387
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:34,380
And that was just said San Jose.
That's it. That's it. I'm done.

388
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,610
You know,
I've done,

389
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,770
I'm not going to kill another fucking
turtle. And it was so weird, like,

390
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,590
like four days later we were driving
down the street and it was a turtle

391
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:46,580
crossing the street. This is when
there was actually animals, you know,

392
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:48,560
before we fucking killed and
ate all of them. You know,

393
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,410
I blamed the food network for that.
You know,

394
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,470
when all these fucking assholes
going around eating bizarre foods,

395
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,260
I'm in Timbuktu,

396
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,200
Wheaton magnets right now all of a
sudden everybody's gotta Eat Maggots to

397
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,830
servant grasshoppers at fucking Mariner
Games or whatever the hell they doing

398
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:07,490
out there, um, was America.

399
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:10,790
We don't eat grasshoppers.
We Doritos,

400
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,710
Taco Bell.

401
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,423
Yeah.

402
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,031
You give them the sun.

403
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,790
Everybody I'm telling you that
would turn this country around.

404
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:24,320
Turn this country route.
Just give him a son.

405
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,730
That's it. So anyways, I
flew the other day on a,

406
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,650
on Tuesday.

407
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,010
I hadn't flown in like a month and I
flew like a fucking champ to the point.

408
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:39,011
I actually got a God damn compliment
from my instructor with unsolicited said,

409
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:44,240
you're flying great today.
Made me feel really good. Okay.

410
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,360
I've done my auto rotations.
I'm ready to get back out there and solo.

411
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,310
So there's a flight I want to do.

412
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,700
I want to fly up to San
a fucking Barbara solar.

413
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,420
So that's what I'm working towards. And,
um, I'm really looking forward to it,

414
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,170
but flying a lot in the
valley and everything, getting
to know all of that stuff.

415
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,910
Um, it's so fucking cool. Yesterday we
will actually going to two days ago,

416
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:12,080
we're going to try to fly over to Santa
Monica airport cause I know that they're

417
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,810
gonna they're allegedly
closing it in five years.

418
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,930
We'll see what the fuck happens. So I
was like, well, I never landed there.

419
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:20,390
I might as well go over there and check
that place out. But what we wanted to do,

420
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,400
like pad work,
they don't let you do that over there.

421
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
Noise abatement's and all that.

422
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:26,450
They don't want some helicopter
flying around and all that shit.

423
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:27,610
So we just said fuck it.

424
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,880
We flew up along the coast and went
by the Pacific Palisades and you just

425
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,210
sitting there, look in this. What this the
whole give them the son Shit came from,

426
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:37,760
I looked, I said, look at that
fucking house they are building.

427
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,420
This house was the size of this house.

428
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:43,310
I looked at it and I said
to the instructor, I go,

429
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:47,830
that looks like if the building of fucking
mall that I would never go into going

430
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,330
like that's going to be too crowded.
And it was somebody's house.

431
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,710
It was going to cost half
a fucking billion dollars
and there was some prints of

432
00:25:56,121 --> 00:26:01,040
some fucking country in the Middle East,
you know,

433
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,540
was going to move. That's like his fucking
house on the other side of the world.

434
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,830
That's his cottage. And that
right there, I was just like,

435
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:12,020
how much fucking money we
give it to these people.

436
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,063
Yeah.

437
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,530
It's time to give the oil companies
to son. That's, that's all you do.

438
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,840
So they're still in control of everything.
You know,

439
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:26,240
they could give us empty threats, well
shot at, you know, like they could do it.

440
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,910
Um,
so anyways,

441
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,290
you were flying over there and I'm just
looking at all these fucking houses and

442
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:37,010
I look down, I see this one,
it was fucking beautiful
house. I got Jesus Christ.

443
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:37,630
Look at that one.

444
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,540
I'd have this glass where you
couldn't see in at all like ceiling.

445
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,860
The floors is fucking look like a yet.

446
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,970
But it was a house and uh,
and those guys,

447
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,010
they was give tours so they know
all the celebrities like, oh,

448
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,110
that's so and so's fucking
house. And I was like, wow,

449
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,110
that's what 20 million a movie gives you.

450
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,380
And I'm not going to say the guy's name
because he probably has enough fucking

451
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:01,920
people looking at his house. Although
recently they said that he sold it.

452
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,020
So I have no fucking idea.
But anyways.

453
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,113
MMM.

454
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,830
I had a great time.
I did have a great time.

455
00:27:08,831 --> 00:27:11,350
The only thing is whenever
I land off airport, I all,

456
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,250
all the fucking shit that I
know to do the downwind checks,

457
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,500
you know, all of that. I forget to do all
of it. That's the only part I fucked up.

458
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,040
So we're doing like this
pinnacle landing and I, you know,

459
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:27,850
you set up downwind base and
then go final and I fucking,

460
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,800
you know, always coming in for a
landing. I was still doing like 65 knots.

461
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:37,430
Like I'm supposed to be down to like 30
you know, slowing down and shit. Guys go,

462
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,500
no,
you go on a little fast.

463
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,730
They want to do some s turns
here. But anyways, Amr, yeah,

464
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,190
very excited to do that type of shit.
And a,

465
00:27:48,191 --> 00:27:51,190
this is the time when I would
usually read some advertising there,

466
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,100
but I don't have any, what else can I
talk about here? Let's look it up, man.

467
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,280
I have to have my
password. I'll say, can't,

468
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,360
you know I got in here late and they
watched the little at the end of the

469
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:02,390
fucking Yankee scheme,

470
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:07,180
the BB bombers over there fucking
kicking the shit out of everybody. Um,

471
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,451
Oh,

472
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:12,040
you know I love about my building here
in New York is we have rooftop access and

473
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,163
Tim,

474
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,800
I feel like that's part of,
uh, the New York spirits.

475
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:21,310
She gotta be up on a fucking roof.

476
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,700
The only thing that sucks is you
can't smoke up there. You know,

477
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:28,540
they just have like chairs. I don't even
think he can smoke. I just said smoke.

478
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,830
I don't think you can eat.
You know what I mean?

479
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:33,760
I think you just can go up there and like
read books. It's like, what the fuck?

480
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,110
You know what I mean?
It's probably camera's up there.

481
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,660
Can and go up there and bang your bride.
Huh? You like this going like, Huh,

482
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,970

that anymore. Back in the day,

483
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:49,510
back in the 90s when I was there,
I got pine sharp on in the background.

484
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:52,480
Somebody is trying to
sell a Murray eliminator.

485
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,740
Yeah, it looks like that looks
like an Apollo three speed. If he,

486
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,800
I don't know if you guys noticed,

487
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:01,970
but bill on f is for family has a bike
like that and there was a bike I always

488
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:03,320
wanted and my parents were like,

491
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:13,130
We're going to get you one of the fucking
nerdy once you know beach rambler.

492
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,350
Let's see what the fuck this guy's
asking for this the f three eliminator.

493
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,220

what are you going to do?

495
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,240
How much you're going to get through this?

496
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,500
Okay.

them over. Actually the seat. Uh,

498
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,290

see, has a little scratch on it.

499
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:48,700
So I'm going to give you one 90th
of what your asking price was.

500
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,083
MMM.

501
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,710
You don't kills me. Those fucking bikes
were like, I don't know what to do.

502
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,370
They were probably 60,
70 bucks,

503
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,700
which is a lot of money back in the day
and now they're worth like hundreds and

504
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,240
hundreds of dot. Yeah. Dot.
It's called inflation. It's
called the Federal Reserve.

505
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,370
Um, all right. I just went down the
rabbit hole. All right. Um, that is,

506
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,840
I was just checking in and you guys,

Um,

509
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,780
I guess I'll do the advertising read
whenever the fuck I get that and I'll just

510
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:20,920
splice it on the end of this,

511
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,660
which is what you're gonna
listen to in two seconds.

512

00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,380
At least it'll be a gentleman robot.

573
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:56,540
So it's like this usually retail for 1200
bucks today, but as the black trucks,

574
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,180
they started just $95

575
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:00,630
yeah.

576
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,320
Why would you say 1200 bucks?
Yeah,

577
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,240
just start at nine five
not the $1,200 one. No,

578
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:12,150
she says if you have any questions
or issues, their expert customer,

579
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:15,120
Kitty,

580
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:18,300
After ordering your suit will
arrive 14 days before your event.

581
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,010
If anything is less than perfect,

582
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,400
the black Tux will send you a
free replacement right away.

583
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:27,600
When your event is over,
just drop your rental back in the mail.

584
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,070
Shipping is free both ways.

585
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:33,870
How easy is that stand out at your event
for the right reasons with laptops to

586
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,670
get $20 off your purchase,

587
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:40,671
visit the black trucks.com/

$20 off of your purchase.

589
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,990
All right, lift. Everybody.

590
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,800
Lifts knows that their drivers are what
keep them moving so they do everything

591
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:57,210
they can to make sure that drivers
are happy on every trip. Man.

592
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,620
Lyft is the ride sharing company that
believes in treating its people better

593
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,800
lifts. This is so much shade
against Uber. It's hilarious.

594
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:07,350
We actually treat our people like people.

595
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:12,210
Lift believes that being a ride sharing
drivers should be fun and you're having

596
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:15,330
a good time if you're out at a good time.
So are your passengers.

597
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,190
While I mean within reason

598
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,990
listless can think of some scenarios.

599
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Well I would fall with was the first
offer in activity when you drive for Lyft.

600
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,460
If you keep 100% of the tips,

601
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,200
drivers have been paid over $200
million in tips since the feature was

602
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:38,760
introduced. Express. Hey lets
drivers paid almost instantly.

603
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:42,980
Instead of waiting for Weise
lift as either taking the
guesswork out of pickups,

604
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,320
the new [inaudible] and device use color
coding to help passengers find finding

605
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:50,430
drivers. You can earn hundreds.
That's actually really cool.

606
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,560
I always wonder why they
will lit up differently. Uh,

607
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,920
you can earn hundreds of dollars a week
plus tips, monitor, earn more money,

608
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,650
drive forward. It's never been
easier to give yourself a raise.

609
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:01,710
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

610
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,520
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 with
rides get a perfect five star rating.

611
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:10,530
Go to lift.com/birth today and you
can get a $500 a new driver bonus.

612
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,330

Then as he adds for this week,

615
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:27,571
please enjoy the music and a half hour
of a special Thursday afternoon podcast

616
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,650
from a Thursday afternoon. Then went
by or maybe never happens. So yeah,

617
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,703
just

618
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,503
one day.

619
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,333
Gotcha.

620
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,240
This is

621
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:25,970
[inaudible].

622
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,270
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
and this is the Monday morning podcast.

623
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,960
For Monday,
June 29th,

624
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,330
2009 and that was an MP three
by one of my listeners, uh,

625
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,190
kind of an old school one, which
I kind of liked. Uh, you know,

626
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:44,410
a little old school, a
little new school, you know,

627
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:49,411
still have had the eighties heavy
metal radio station sound to it.

628
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:54,390
And then it also had like that, the
newer sort of a, what do they call that,

629
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,310
that cookie monster
singing where people were

630
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,850
red, red, red, red, red, bro.

631
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,800
You know,

632
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,210
I really respect the musicianship
of being able to play that fast,

633
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:08,860
but I have to admit, I, maybe I'm too
old, but I just can't listen to something

634
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,600
guy go, Rawr, Rawr, Rawr,
Rawr, Rawr, Rawr Rawr.

635
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,180
Without laughing or it just
seems ridiculous to me. But, uh,

636
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,770
but maybe that's me. I don't
know. But uh, thank you for the a,

637
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:21,690
I know those things take a
long time to put together,

638
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:24,570
so I appreciate anybody who does one.
And I actually got a,

639
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,580
I got another one this week was, so, uh,

640
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:30,630
next week there'll be a different intro
and a, if you're new to my podcast,

641
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:31,920
that's one of the things.
Um,

642
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:35,700
every once in awhile one of my listeners
will put together an MP three and then

643
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:40,400
it takes me eight days to figure out how
to fucking sink it up in garage band.

644
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,090
I just wish I knew a way where I,

645
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,040
I could play it and talk over
it like you would on like a, a,

646
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,140
a fucking a I guess a radio show
if anybody knows how to do that.

647
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:53,730
You know what?

648
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,510
There was a fucking question I was going
to ask you guys some sort of computer

649
00:39:57,511 --> 00:40:01,560
question. God Damn Man, I gotta
I gotta write these things down.

650
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,090
I really going to write these things
down anyways. I'm still in New York City,

651
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,960
everybody. I am down to my, uh,

652
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:14,280
the final week.
I just have one more scene to shoot.

653
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,780
I got two lines, that's
all I got left. And then I,

654
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:22,890
then I'm out of the movie and
it's been, uh, it's been great.

655
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,890
It's been a great experience. And, uh,

656
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:31,200
but I am going a little bit nuts because
I've been away from my life for so

657
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:33,860
long, which, uh, I dunno,

658
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,750
I think a lot of you guys maybe don't get
to experience that if you have more of

659
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:41,550
a real life where you get to just go to
work and then come home. Um, you know,

660
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:45,900
like when you go on vacation, how it's
fun for the first fucking week, you know,

661
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,470
and everything's cool.
Maybe takes a couple of days to relax,

662
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:52,380
but then they comes to that point where
you get in a vacation where you kind of

663
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:55,650
ready to go home and you know,
you need to, you need to,

664
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,500
you just need to sleep in your own bed.
Yeah. I just want to go home, you know,

665
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,950
see my dog and fucking, you know,
put them in a fault pauper, you know,

666
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,240
put it in a full Nelson. Maybe give her
a couple of jabs to a little doggie nose.

667
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,220
Uh, yeah. It's another thing.
If you new to my podcast,

668
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:15,540
I really love kicking the shit
out of my dog. Um, it's uh,

669
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,820
I'm kidding. You know, now, you know
what this really is. This is me,

670
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:24,750
my inability to say that I miss
people in my life. Okay. This is my,

671
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,500
my fucking Irish Boston,
you know,

672
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,520
inability to hug right now to say
that I actually, uh, you know,

673
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,320
maybe some people in my life,
see I have to have an ambiguous right now.

674
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,270
So anyways, yeah. So I've been
fucking staying here in New York,

675
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,570
you know, going into the same
goddamn diner every morning. And uh,

676
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:51,020
I know this is a really hacky premise
and I say that every week as I throw out

677
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:56,060
hacky shit.
But what is the deal with ordering orange,

678
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:01,010
orange juice and they charge, they charge.
I had a small, they charged me 450.

679
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,440
You know,
I got a couple of eggs.

680
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:07,430
So I thought it was going to come in
and about like fucking uh, you know,

681
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:10,760
the $13 range.
And next thing you know,

682
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:14,930
it's like I owed like 25 bucks is
cause I ordered a fucking orange juice.

683
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,790
Is it? Cause everybody loves it. You know,

684
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,890
there's no shortage of
oranges. It's, I don't know.

685
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,060
Jesus Christ is podcasts socks.
This re this podcast really sucks.

686
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:33,200
Thank God I had an intro
cause I, I literally just
ran out of steam right there.

687
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,330
You know what is the deal
with oranges bill? Huh?

688
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,960
All right. Let's talk about
some fucking topical Shit.

689
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,870
Jeezy you would think that I would bring
up some other shit. Maybe some other,

690
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,920
let's just backtrack with all the
crazy shit that's happened this week.

691
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:53,390
All right. Bernie Madoff just
got a 150 fucking years in jail

692
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,040
for being the piece of shit that he
evidently is because the guy got convicted

693
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,720
for a, you know, that whole Ponzi scheme.
I think that's great. I totally back that.

694
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,240
The fact that they gave
him the maximum amount,

695
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,780
I was already getting pissed
when his lawyer was like, well,

696
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,930
he's this age now and so he's probably
only going to live another 13 years,

697
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,700
so we would like if he just
gave him 12 years, what,

698
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:26,540
why should he get out at all? He's
going to live another 13 years. Well,

699
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:30,950
let's give him 14 to make sure he
fucking dies in prison. You know,

700
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,730
I'll tell you out of all the fucking
things that you can do short of like

701
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:37,580
physically assaulting somebody is,
you know,

702
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,650
if you steal old people's money,
okay.

703
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:45,980
And they worked their asses
off their whole life. You know,

704
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,400
especially some of these
ritual people who, you know,

705
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:53,600
worked really hard taking advantage of
sweatshop labor and you come in there

706
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,360
and no, I'm just fucking around. But
seriously, you know what I mean? Like,

707
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,000
and then they ended up
having to eat dog food.

708
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,590
You took their whole life's work
away, man. I can't imagine that.

709
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:09,680
I mean God bless those old people for
not coming down there and just literally

710
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:14,630
killing the guy. I would actually
contemplate that. You know,

711
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:17,450
what kind of jail do you think that they
would send to you and send you to if

712
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:20,480
you like an 85 year old guy
who had worked his whole life,

713
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,810
you're 85 they means you probably
fought in at least one war.

714
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:28,670
So you're a veteran. So you already got
at the like right there. Everybody's like,

715
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:32,070
well fuck that. That guy used
to be a marine, you know?

716
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:33,700
Yeah.

717
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,660
Fought for our freedom.
He did the right thing his whole life.

718
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:42,690
Then he got burned by this
fucking feathered mullet
jackass and then he shot him

719
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:47,500
in the head. He actually saved
us some fucking, some tax
payer money. I don't know.

720
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:50,230
What kind of jail would they send you to?
They couldn't send you the 11 worth.

721
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,610
It's not like you're fucking fought
dogs like Michael Vick. Right?

722
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,420
So anyways, that guy got 150 years.
I think that's a that, that's great.

723
00:44:58,421 --> 00:45:02,530
But I don't understand why those other
bankers who loaned all of our hard earned

724
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:05,410
money out to fucking homeless people,

725
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,390
you know who then defaulted on loans and
then not only do they not go to jail,

726
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,960
they asked for more fucking money that
they already print and the print and then

727
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:18,060
they charged us the interest on it.
Is Anybody,

728
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,130
did anybody out there major in economics?

729
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:22,050
Can anybody out there explain to me how,

730
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,940
how we keep printing money with no gold
behind it and catch up isn't like $72 a

731
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:30,630
bottle. Can anybody out there?
Can anybody explain that to me?

732
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,390
You know,
and if you listen to this podcast,

733
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:36,660
you know that's a major pet peeve of
mine is when somebody comes up to me and

734
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:40,080
they tell me that whatever I'm
talking about, they majored in,

735
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,530
in college as if that's
some sort of fucking, uh,

736
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,290
uh, what is the expression thorn
in your crown? That's not it.

737
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:52,590
Jewel in your side. I don't know what
the fuck it is. You know what I mean?

738
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:56,670
It's like, dude, you, you, I hate people
who go to college and major in Shit,

739
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,410
and then they think
that that automatically,

740
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,280
that makes them a fucking expert on
the subject. It's like douchebag.

741
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,750
You went there and you read the
books that they gave you. Okay?

742
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,920
The fucking school is aligned
with a certain like viewpoint.

743
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,760
And then you read 50 fucking books
with the same goddamn viewpoint.

744
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,090
All right? They're fucking viewpoint,
which is encouraging you to, to,

745
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:26,970
to go out and pay for a fucking education
that's not even worth what they're

746
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:30,630
charging you. For you to come out of
school and be 80 a hundred grand in debt.

747
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,030
Somewhere along the line,

748
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,520
the banks give you a fucking credit
card with like a $3,000 limit. All only,

749
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,890
even though you're only making 300 bucks
a week at hot topic or whatever the

750
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:42,300
fuck you doing.
So they get,

751
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:46,680
you're buried in that debt and then you're
suppose to knock up some broad by 26

752
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:49,500
28 have a kid and then go buy
a fucking house. She had done,

753
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:54,210
you're on the wheel to your 90
you're fucking done. All right.

754
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,420
So I dunno what I'm talking about, but
I'm just, you know what I'm sick of.

755
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,930
I just don't like when I make a point,
somebody challenges it. That's what it is.

756
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,180
Especially with the college education.
But anyways,

757
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:09,840
I don't understand why those guys
aren't fucking jail. So anyways, let's,

758
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:14,490
let's back up more. Michael Jackson.
I had no idea how big that guy was.

759
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:19,230
I forgot. I don't know if any of the
rest you will like this, but I literally,

760
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,160
I forgot how famous that guy was.

761
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,890
Why I should say more like how
talented he was. Because the last,

762
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,970
really,
to be honest with you,

763
00:47:30,971 --> 00:47:35,971
from about 91 92 the last 1718 years
was so not even about his music or his

764
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:41,200
talent.
It was all about his plastic surgery.

765
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,860
Those trials he went through,
um,

766
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,910
the plastic surgery, you know,
just all the weird stuff.

767
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:53,911
And then another thing about him was I
really felt that he was kind of like a

768
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,880
comedian who stopped writing a
brilliant comedian. You know,

769
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,330
he just kept wearing those penny
loafers and he kept doing that,

770
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,160
kicking his leg up,
you know,

771
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,200
he does that little knee thing and then
the little mine step to the side and he

772
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,420
throws his fucking hand up into the
air, sort of the John Travolta, like,

773
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:18,390
I'm going to disco dance, but
wait a second, I'm stopping,
you know? But anyway,

774
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:23,020
so the guy dies and then they started
showing all his videos on MTV,

775
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:25,840
if you can fucking believe it.
They actually showed videos on MTV.

776
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,980
And I came in from shooting the
movie at like five in the morning.

777
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,100
And I sat there and I watched his
videos for like a fucking hour and I

778
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:37,540
remembered once again, how
would a giant, that guy was,

779
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,520
I don't know if you guys are old like me,

780
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:43,150
but for some of you youngsters out
there when that thriller video came out,

781
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,530
I can't even, it was, it was
fucking great. It was ridiculous.

782
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:51,550
I just wish that you could just
watch all the videos that, that like

783
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,960
had taken place before that video.

784
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,240
Have you ever seen that journey one,
that awful journey video where, I mean,

785
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:02,890
I'm not really into the music of journey,

786
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:07,270
but those were all top notch
fucking musicians. All right.

787
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,530
What's his face there?
Uh, the lead singer,

788
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:15,400
they're unbelievable voice even
though I just didn't like, and uh,

789
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:18,070
they had dramas. Steve Smith
is like, he continued to hit.

790
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,860
He's like one of the greatest drummers
in the world right now. Considered that.

791
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,530
But for some reason when
they made the video,

792
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:26,410
you have all these top
notch fucking musicians.

793
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,760
For some reason they decided that they
should rather than have one of the

794
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:32,830
greatest drummers in the world drum,
they,

795
00:49:32,831 --> 00:49:36,850
that he should air drum and that
all the guitarist should air guitar.

796
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:41,140
And then the worst thing ever,
they had the keyboardist air keyboard

797
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,340
and then they will all fucking
just hunched in together,

798
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,250
like sort of just stomp on their foot.

799
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:52,210
It was fucking embarrassing then.
So anyways,

800
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:57,211
so thriller came out and basically what
MTV would do was they actually had a

801
00:49:57,701 --> 00:50:00,160
debut with the video.
That's how fucking huge it was.

802
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:03,760
I remember they used to do debuts what
it was just everybody fucking watched it

803
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,550
and it wasn't just like they debuted
it and then it was in the rotation they

804
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:10,340
like showed it at like whatever,
like three o'clock in the afternoon,

805
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,910
right as the kids came home from school.
And then they will like,

806
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:17,911
we will be showing it again at six and
then you'd go live your little fucking,

807
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:18,670
you know,

808
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:23,670
I'm 12 year old life and then you'd
come back with fucking five 58 you'd sit

809
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:29,030
there with your jaw on the floor, you'd
it again. And then they'd be like,

810
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:32,380
we're going to show it again at
nine. And then once, you know,

811
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,010
right before you went to watch it again,

812
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,220
and then the next day everybody go
to school today, Short four times.

813
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,260
I show it five times.
No Way.

814
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,130
You'd have to stay up to three to focus
more on like these stupid arguments.

815
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,710
And they did that fill out for
like a fucking week. It was unreal.

816
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:51,020
And I actually watched it a what?
That's the first time I,

817
00:50:51,021 --> 00:50:54,140
they actually showed the full length
one and I don't think I've seen the full

818
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,650
length version of that since
the 80s. And uh, I dunno,

819
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,800
it was fucking amazing. And then it's also
sad because you're looking at the guy,

820
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,780
that's what I was doing. I look
at the old videos, I'm like,

821
00:51:03,781 --> 00:51:07,510
he was a good looking guy.
The fuck did he do or like a,

822
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:12,330
as you're watching them
gradually, you know, have
operations you just right there.

823
00:51:12,331 --> 00:51:16,370
We should have stopped right
there. Right, right there.

824
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:17,710
Yeah.

825
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,490
Stop. Freeze one, two,
three red light. But he,

826
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,600
he just kept fucking
going. And, uh, I dunno,

827
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,960
one of the thing that pissed me
off as I was reading in the post,

828
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,530
there was a guy writing for the post
saying how he actually was at the second

829
00:51:32,531 --> 00:51:37,531
child molestation trial and was saying
how ridiculous it was and how he couldn't

830
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:43,180
even believe it went to trial.
That the charges were such bullshit.

831
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,220
And I just remember thinking going,

832
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:48,370
where the fuck was that story
in the post during that time?

833
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,060
Because I was reading the posts
because I like the sports page.

834
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:55,930
And all they did was just talk
about what uh, you know, they,

835
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,800
they had him convicted in the paper.
So in my mind he was fucking convicted.

836
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:01,660
I hate one papers do that.

837
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:07,190
Like they go all the way to the left
and then when they realize you know that

838
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:10,820
they can't go to the left anymore than
they present the fucking right. You know,

839
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,730
I dunno what the fuck up saying in there,

840
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,380
but all I know is I actually started
believing that he was just a really

841
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,880
gullible jackass and was kind of wide
open to that stuff. But you know,

842
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:25,010
then this is how,
this is how I'm going to leave it,

843
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:28,430
because the guy was acquitted
twice. I'm gonna, I'm gonna

844
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,630
believe that he was innocent,
but this is the deal.

845
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:35,150
I would believe that the guy was innocent,
but if I had a kid,

846
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,940
I wouldn't leave him alone with them
for like three seconds. How about that?

847
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,490
You know what I mean? That's, that's

848
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:47,450
not Mike. I hear you. I totally believe
you. Yeah, those charges were fucked up.

849
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,820
Uh, we're going to go now and uh, yeah,

850
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:55,190
we're going to slowly back
towards the car and a is,

851
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:58,280
I listened for the Choo Choo train as
it goes around your house to make sure

852
00:52:58,281 --> 00:53:03,260
that I don't get run over by it. Uh, no,
I don't want a glass of wine. Thank you.

853
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,550
Thank you very much. Uh, Farrah
Fawcett died. This is a really sad,

854
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:11,150
weak Farrah Fawcett.
I believe that was my first,

855
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,440
um, no, it wasn't. You know what?

856
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:20,441
Kate Jackson was my first fantasy famous
girlfriend and that's when she was on

857
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:23,540
the rookies. You guys
remember the rookies? Ben and

858
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:30,440
[inaudible] at it. Ben In and edit
it. Did it, did it, did it, did it

859
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:32,600
[inaudible]

860
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,240
remember that shit when they
have those great seventies

861
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:40,730
fucking TV shows in all right. Theme songs
like that anymore, right. Number, swat

862
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:46,120
ba but ba, ba Ba ba Ba ba
Ba. But I had to delay,

863
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:50,960
delay, delay, delay, delay.

864
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:54,700
Back when they had musicians.
That'd be a whole fucking orchestra.

865
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:59,800
People used to make God damn
livings ready. TV themes.
But anyways, Kate Jackson,

866
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:02,230
she was like the original to me more,

867
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,570
however you say that fucking cougars name,
Huh?

868
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:09,010
With their fucking lead pipe titties.
Um,

869
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,020
yeah, she played, she was the
whole shared the sexy voice.

870
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,590
Absolutely beautiful eyes, beautiful
hair. The whole fucking thing.

871
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:22,090
She was so fucking hot and she was dressed
like a nurse and there was no fucking

872
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:26,260
Internet. There was no porn.
There was no, I had nothing.

873
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,260
I was a man without a
fucking country back then.

874
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,490
So I would just sit there fucking
Mesmer. It was a, it was a perfect show.

875
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,920
And she's married to the cop.
The cops character's name,

876
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:38,770
I still remember was Mike Danco.
Right.

877
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,780
That's like a classic seventies macho.
I'm fucking hitting it,

878
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,880
right name Mike Danco.

879
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:47,440
Okay.

880
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,200
I'm Mike Danco motherfucker. That's
how we should have said it. There's no,

881
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,080
they should have beeped out motherfucker
every week when somebody said his name,

882
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,590
you know,
and I used to watch that show going on,

883
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:59,380
I can call and that's what I'm going
to do in life. I want to be a cop.

884
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:03,550
I'm changing my name to Mike Danko and
I'm marrying some hot ass fucking nurse

885
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,220
and I'm banging our in
that fucking nurse outfit.

886
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,520
I didn't even think shit like that.
I was like so innocent.

887
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:13,450
I'd even have thoughts like that.
I was literally like in love.

888
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,890
Remember that when you
actually had that in his,

889
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,900
before he ever met some girl who just
fucked up your whole view of women and you

890
00:55:21,341 --> 00:55:24,550
actually viewed them as if they were
like these angels because they were so

891
00:55:24,551 --> 00:55:28,720
gorgeous. You know, before you realize
that a three out of four weeks a month,

892
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,200
they're going to be absolutely
fucking maniacs. But I digress.

893
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,200
So, um, yeah, so Farrah Fawcett
dies. Talk about, you know,

894
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:41,760
out of all the fucking days to die,
you die on a day when a guy, yeah,

895
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,710
do Michael Jackson is so famous.
If you guys seen that thing,

896
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:51,100
an entire prison yard in the Philippines
work nine hours to reenact the thriller

897
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:55,970
dance and they did it and
they put it up on Youtube.

898
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,120
These are prisoners in
the fucking Philippines

899
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,000
that the risk of pissing off all you
white trash, ice road truckers out there.

900
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:10,320
Fuck Elvis Presley. Elvis Presley was,

901
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,800
he just wasn't anywhere near
that. He was, he was huge artists.

902
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:16,710
A bunch of people right now.
Now why are you know minute?

903
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,740
That's the fucking king man.
You don't say that Shit.

904
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,640
Elvis Presley was the king.
You understand?

905
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,590
They had buddy Michael Jackson was the
king of Pop. Do you understand that?

906
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,310
That means his,
his kingdom is clarified.

907
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,680
He's the king of everything. No,
he's the king of fucking pop.

908
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,260
Elvis Presley was a fucking king period,

909
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:46,570
which means Michael Jackson
was his fucking subject. Um,

910
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:47,891
I get that.

911
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:51,670
And also Elvis Presley didn't have
the advantage of the worldwide web.

912
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,080
You know what I mean?

913
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:57,010
Where you can have as little talent as
the chocolate rain guy and you can go

914
00:56:57,011 --> 00:57:00,670
national. So I can only
imagine if, you know,

915
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:03,130
Ed Sullivan could have put that fucking,
you know,

916
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,860
I don't know what the hell
I'm talking about. Whatever.

917
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,290
I had to defend Elvis a
little bit. I, I, you know,

918
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,950
I used to make fun of Elvis and then I
went to his house one time when I was on

919
00:57:11,951 --> 00:57:15,760
the road and I went in there thinking I
was going to get a bit and thinking it

920
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:17,860
was going to be funny. And you
know what? It was just sad.

921
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,420
I just saw a guy who was basically
the original behind the music guy,

922
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,160
um, and who was like, even in death,

923
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,530
we're all white as I felt
like I was just like,

924
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:31,570
I'm just intruding on this guy's house.

925
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,140
And then you walk out back and the his
grave and everybody's taking pictures

926
00:57:35,141 --> 00:57:40,090
next to his grave. It just like, uh,
you know, that house should be haunted.

927
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,960
Like Elvis should literally be haunting
that house and scaring the shit out of

928
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,230
those fucking people. But God knows
they still wouldn't even get it.

929
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:51,340
They would still thinking, you know, he's
singing, he's singing from the grave.

930
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,840
It's a little more vulgar than I remember,
you know.

931
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:00,320
I mean, I guess he didn't ride his own
lyrics. Haley probably fucking stolen.

932
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:04,360
If you believe what some of them people
of color are saying about his music.

933
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,740
Um, all right, what are we doing
here? Let's get on with the, Oh,

934
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:11,590
wait a minute and now we have to go
back. Before that. Who Else fucking died?

935
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,640
There was some Ed Mcmahon died.
Ed Mcmahon.

936
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:20,920
Ed Mcmahon died and I hated after
fucking, you know, Michael, you know,

937
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:25,720
ed McMahon dies. Then a Farrah
Fawcett dies and Michael Jackson dies.

938
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:30,640
And then there's always that Douche
bag who has to be like, Shit. She bad.

939
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:35,440
Things come in threes. You
know. Bad things come in threes.

940
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:40,210
Really? What about David? David Carradine.
You know what about him? He died.

941
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:44,260
That makes for stupid. Some old lady died
of heat stroke. I saw that on the news.

942
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:48,610
That's five. Well, was it all on
the same week? Well, you know what,

943
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:51,590
I got two words for you, Billy Mays. Ah,

944
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,740
Billy Mays and I fucking died too.
So there you go.

945
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,270
That's four famous mother fuckers
in one God damn week. You know what?

946
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,270
Somebody told me some,

947
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,780
somebody wrote me a hilarious fucking
email was saying like, how the fuck they,

948
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:09,170
they couldn't believe that they
didn't see Billy Mays dying.

949
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,390
They couldn't see his death.

950
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:14,330
Come on when he clearly looks like he
ate four pounds of Bacon every goddamn

951
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,800
morning. He really did. He ever
do. I hate when people do that.

952
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:19,690
Like you always predict
some shit after it happens.

953
00:59:19,691 --> 00:59:23,150
But I gotta admit once Billy
died, you were kind of like, well,

954
00:59:23,151 --> 00:59:27,150
he really did have that heart attack
face, didn't he? He just had that,

955
00:59:27,151 --> 00:59:30,320
that bluedot beard and
he was always screaming.

956
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,950
And not only that,
he was around all that cleaner.

957
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,610
How many takes do you think they did as
he was sitting there spraying that oxy

958
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:42,050
washed fucking whatever the hell
it was called, that oxy oxy clean.

959
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,510
Do you guys ever get that shit?
Did you,

960
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:48,470
did you feel that it made your whites a
whole lot wider? I don't think it did.

961
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,710
That's why I think Billy Mays. Dot.
I think it was from all that line.

962
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:56,360
He just couldn't do it anymore.
Screaming about fucking alarm clocks.

963
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:59,870
I can scratch your back or whatever
the hell he had. I don't know.

964
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:04,880
So whenever, there you go, what a
fucking month. Huh? David Carradine.

965
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,660
God bless them. And I really think it's
bad that people actually give them shit.

966
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,100
I have no problem with,

967
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:14,480
with the fact that he liked to put on
fish nets and hang himself. You know?

968
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:20,040
I hope that I'm that much of a freak
at 72 fucking years old. You know?

969
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,300
I just, I just, I got really like a,

970
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:27,080
I got inspired by the fact that he
was doing that, that at that age,

971
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,620
you know what I mean?
Do you just picture your 72 you know,

972
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,440
you just fucking hobbling around.

973
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,240
I'll tell you that paper boy,

974
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,560
he keeps playing with the paper too
far away from your door. That's what,

975
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:46,670
that's what I picture 72 as you know,
you're all excited. You got that.

976
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,470
You can't go up the stairs anymore.

977
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:51,260
You've got to sit in that electronic
fucking thing that brings you all the way

978
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:54,440
up the stairs.
You know?

979
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:58,790
Remember that Shit I was talking about
a long time ago where you have that you

980
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:03,530
have the elevated toilet seat because
anybody can use gravity and get their

981
01:01:03,531 --> 01:01:05,570
fucking old ass down on a toilet seat.

982
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,020
But it still takes the quad strength
to get the fuck back up off of it.

983
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:12,200
But you can't afford somebody to
help you up off the toilet seat.

984
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,390
So you have to have an
elevated toilet seat.

985
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:20,150
So you basically for the rest of your
fucking life, you take a fucking shit

986
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:26,150
standing there like a third basement,
you know at the ready position.

987
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,780
That's how you take a shit,
you know,

988
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:38,630
hands on your knees standing there like
fucking Brooks Robinson waiting this

989
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:41,270
squeeze one out.
Little metamucil wouldn't hurt either.

990
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,210
And then you got David Carradine.

991
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:49,880
See I'm telling you guys that that's
why each stretching is so fucking

992
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:51,510
unbelievable if you want it.

993
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,990
That's the biggest thing you
can do other than eating well,

994
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:58,820
I think to try and still
feel young because if you
don't stretch your hamstrings

995
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:01,850
and everything, if you don't stretch
it out, use it. I guess. Atrophies.

996
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,240
I don't even know what the fuck that
means. All I know is I noticed, you know,

997
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:10,010
I haven't been that good about it and
I've been running with my dog and I was

998
01:02:10,011 --> 01:02:13,670
like, Holy Shit, I am rapidly approaching
the age where I can't run anymore.

999
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,830
You know?
I mean that happens anyways.

1000
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:17,300
At some point you're not
going to be able to run,

1001
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:20,220
but if you stop stretching
that is the quickest.

1002
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,500
I think that is the quickest way.

1003
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,370
And I'm saying that having
absolutely no degree in nutrition,

1004
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,160
physical therapy or anything whatsoever.

1005
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:33,000
So you can take that to the fucking bank.
All right,

1006
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,650
let's get into the podcast stuff
here that you guys send it. Um,

1007
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,540
here's one for you. Last week I was
talking about grenades. I don't know why.

1008
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:47,310
I can't remember why, but I had
somehow as I presented the question,

1009
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:52,080
um, what would happen if I, you know, oh,

1010
01:02:52,081 --> 01:02:53,790
I remember because we
were talking about that,

1011
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:57,240
that guy sent in that email about that
psycho who lived across the street,

1012
01:02:57,241 --> 01:03:01,200
who was in the army and he used to
sneak shit home and try and sell it.

1013
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,730
And the guy was in a bar trying
to sell a fucking grenade. And uh,

1014
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:10,680
be honest, you'd buy it when
you get three Budweisers in,

1015
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:16,680
you're going through a breakup or maybe
you're just young and you have hope and

1016
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:18,130
he just got that one fucking,
that,

1017
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:22,470
that industrial area that they're just
developing in your town, in your like,

1018
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:26,610
all right, this is the deal. We'll
pull the pin, we'll throw it,

1019
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:30,510
and then we'll fucking row. Yeah, of
course you're going to do that. So anyway,

1020
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:32,230
so I presented like,
I was wondering like what,

1021
01:03:32,231 --> 01:03:35,490
what the level of explosion
that concussive force,

1022
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:38,180
whatever the fuck it is
of a grenade. Like, could,

1023
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:42,180
if I had threw a grenade on the other
side of my bed and I dove on the other

1024
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:46,650
side of my bed, blocked up my
ears and it exploded. Okay.

1025
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,870
And I'm talking about one of those
beds, those beds way, you know,

1026
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:50,940
you can't steal it because
they got like the fucking,

1027
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,730
the wood frame underneath it.
Um,

1028
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:58,200
would I be able to survive so
far? Somebody from, uh, the, uh,

1029
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,060
the Marines told me, he said, Bill,

1030
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:05,820
a hand grenade in your hotel room would
definitely fuck your day up with a 15

1031
01:04:05,821 --> 01:04:06,360
mil,

1032
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:11,360
15 meter kill radius inside
of an enclosed space.

1033
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,000
Your head and asshole
would be indistinguishable,

1034
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,830
indistinguishable from one another. I
hope that answers your question. Yeah,

1035
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:24,360
I would say you were pretty
specific there. So anyways,
so you who suck at math?

1036
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,120
Uh,
a meter is a little more than a yard.

1037
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:30,900
And I only remember that from that
commercial back in the 70s when they were

1038
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:33,870
trying to teach us the metric system,
which bombed miserably.

1039
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,360
So 15 times three would be 45 feet,

1040
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:41,520
and that is a radius of 45
feet. Jesus Christ. So then I,

1041
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:46,260
I wrote the guy back cause I
really found that interesting.

1042
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:51,280
Uh, and I guess because it's enclosed that
the ceiling kind of keeps the blast in

1043
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:55,200
and the walls and all that. I guess if
you're outside you have a better chance.

1044
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,320
I Dunno,
I'd have to talk more about this,

1045
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:03,030
but this immediately as opened up a new
podcast thing for anyone who's in the

1046
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:03,864
military,

1047
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:08,160
I want to learn about these fucking
weapons and a what they can do to you.

1048
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:10,920
And I'm going to tell you right now,
anybody with a fucking gun,

1049
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:15,330
there's nothing they like better than
telling you what the fucking gun would do

1050
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:16,860
to you.
Have you ever noticed that

1051
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,920
anytime somebody gets a gun,
what do they say? I, I, you know,

1052
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:25,740
I just got it to go hunting,
right? And then you'd be
like, well, what's, you know,

1053
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:28,570
what's, what's that gun like
in the guys do from here?

1054
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,630
If I shot you right from
here and I shot you,

1055
01:05:30,631 --> 01:05:34,330
a whole fucking shoulder would come off,
you spinal core would be dangled.

1056
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:37,720
They always do that shit. So,
you know, what's the point?

1057
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,990
I have in a weapon if you don't know
what it would do to a human being.

1058
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,880
That's what I say. Huh. Anybody
else? Anybody else or Braveheart fan?

1059
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,430
Um, all right. You know,

1060
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,340
actually set the end of the day watching
the whole history of the machine gun.

1061
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:53,050
It was really fascinating.

1062
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:55,820
Like this guy actually developed the
machine gun cause he thought it was going

1063
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,570
to save lives when he
was in the civil war.

1064
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:01,630
He was a Gatlin was the
guy like the Gatlin gun.

1065
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:05,320
He was sitting there talking about how
he just saw the unbelievable level of

1066
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:07,750
carnage in the civil war.

1067
01:06:07,751 --> 01:06:09,850
And you've gotta remember that
to Americans shooting Americans.

1068
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:13,030
So even if you're winning, you know,
it's, it's just a brutal thing.

1069
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,270
And he was saying that if
you've got a machine gun,

1070
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:20,470
if it could do the work of 15
fucking people or 20 people,

1071
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:26,290
um, then that would be 19 less people
who'd be out on the battlefield,

1072
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:30,940
who could possibly lose their lives. Of
course he didn't do the math of, well,

1073
01:06:30,941 --> 01:06:34,780
if they get one too, then you need to
have another guy with a machine gun.

1074
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:36,310
And then it just keeps fucking escalating.

1075
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:40,750
But I did find it interesting or maybe
that was just the bullshit that he said

1076
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,320
because he felt bad that he was making
money off of creating a weapon that could

1077
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:47,260
just literally mow down
people. Um, anyways,

1078
01:06:47,261 --> 01:06:51,880
so here's the second part of the, uh,
the grenade thing. Um, I forgot what I,

1079
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:56,040
what did I ask him? Um,
oh, I remember this.

1080
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:59,830
So I emailed that guy back and I
said, okay, so what if I had a suite,

1081
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,910
a hotel suite, and I threw it
out into the living room area.

1082
01:07:03,911 --> 01:07:06,940
I closed the door in the bedroom
and I dealt dove behind the bed.

1083
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:11,110
So then he proceeded to take
a lot of time out of his day,

1084
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,080
which I appreciate. Here.
Wrote me a nice long email.

1085
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:19,081
So this ladies and gentlemen is the answer
to what if you had the suite and you

1086
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:21,430
lit up,
you fucking pulled the pin on a grenade,

1087
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:24,430
closed your bedroom door and
dove behind the bed. See,

1088
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:28,300
I asked the questions that America
wants to know. All right, here we go.

1089
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:31,660
This guy said, I did five years
in the marines. Uh, he said,

1090
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:35,030
I got on the Post Nine
11 redneck bandwagon. Uh,

1091
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:37,750
but by the time I got to Iraq in 2006,

1092
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:41,200
we stop using hand grenades indoors.
Normally.

1093
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:44,830
Normally we would just love a few of
those fuckers in a room and not have to

1094
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:48,190
worry about the assholes on
the other side. Uh, he goes,

1095
01:07:48,191 --> 01:07:49,900
I know that's cold blooded,
but hey,

1096
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:53,980
he can have his 73 versions
of an unspecified gender.

1097
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:00,490
[inaudible] you know what, that's
a funny ass fucking loophole.

1098
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:04,750
They really just say he gets 73 virgin.
They don't say that they are women.

1099
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:09,400
Do they? That's fuck, that's
a great analogy. Anyways. Um,

1100
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:14,380
he said, and we replaced them
with a flash grenades. Uh,

1101
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:17,900
basically we didn't want to kill innocent
people in wind up on the cover of Time

1102
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:21,830
magazine as the winner of
Asshole of the year. Um, then we,

1103
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:26,790
after we throw in the flash flash, well,
I just literally lost my place there,

1104
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:30,290
the flash grenades. Then we would
charge into the room shooting.

1105
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:34,520
Like I was a in the Goddamn
Matrix. Um, but anyways,

1106
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,290
I have seen hand-grenades go
off and there are two wait,

1107
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:42,590
there were two ways of standard
fragmentation. Grenade can kill you. One,

1108
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,270
the blast itself,

1109
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,140
which generally projects
in a 15 foot radius.

1110
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:52,850
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody explain to me the,

1111
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,860
the blast itself,

1112
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:59,570
how that kills you if you're
not getting hit by shrapnel,

1113
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:00,620
just the blast.

1114
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:05,620
Is that basically like the most
psychotic invisible front kick?

1115
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:09,860
Is that what an explosion is
in, in that, that the air,

1116
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,250
the force of the blast
just hits you so hard.

1117
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:18,020
It's like getting hit by like an
invisible truck. Is that what it is? Um,

1118
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:21,770
to be honest with you,
I've always kind of thought about that,

1119
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:24,440
but I never really sat down
and tried to figure it out.

1120
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:28,370
And that's basically what I was able
to come up with having not researched

1121
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:30,500
anyways. But anyways, the guy says, ah,

1122
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:35,150
the concussion from the blast turns your
insides into Jello if you're within a

1123
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:39,440
five meter bubble.
So is that what happens?

1124
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:40,971
You know what I mean?

1125
01:09:40,971 --> 01:09:45,971
So literally it's like getting
hit by this invisible fucking,

1126
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:49,220
uh, what, what did Bruce Lee
have? The one inch punch?

1127
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:54,560
It's like getting hit by a like that
times fucking 200. I don't know.

1128
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:56,780
Why don't I read the rest of us
and maybe we'll find out. Ah,

1129
01:09:56,781 --> 01:10:01,320
the second way you can die a
horrific deaths is, uh, from uh, uh,

1130
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:05,780
frag grenade is the fragmentation
from the shell of the grenade and the

1131
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:10,781
fragmentation of all the other shit like
wood and pieces of other people that

1132
01:10:11,091 --> 01:10:15,500
the blast turns into shrapnel.
Wow.

1133
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:18,920
Jesus Christ.
You know what I mean?

1134
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,530
As much as you watched the
beginning of saving private Ryan,

1135
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:26,120
like he's still really can't ever capture
how fucking horrific that must be.

1136
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:27,110
Um,

1137
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:31,970
the amount of damage of frag will do to
you in the next room depends on the wall

1138
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:34,280
and your suite,
what it's made out of.

1139
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:38,090
If the walls are made out of
concrete with rebar and shit inside,

1140
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,140
you're more than likely just
shit your pants. That's amazing.

1141
01:10:42,141 --> 01:10:43,580
So if there isn't like rebar in there,

1142
01:10:43,581 --> 01:10:45,860
which I'm imagining is
those little steal things,

1143
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:48,470
it could still fucking kill you.
Um,

1144
01:10:48,471 --> 01:10:53,030
if the wall is thin and some
of the fragmentation may
or may go through the wall

1145
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:53,864
and hit you,

1146
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:58,890
but you'll be safe from the blast itself
and probably we'll probably live all

1147
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:00,410
just be screaming on the floor.

1148
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:03,950
Like that guy in platoon is Barnes
crawls over and digs the shit out with a

1149
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:06,950
knife. Good Lord. God bless you guys, man.

1150
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,430
I really do not have a difficult
life here. All right, more.

1151
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:12,620
Most stores on hotel
rooms are pretty solid,

1152
01:11:12,621 --> 01:11:15,570
so I think they could take a direct hit
and not damage anything on the other

1153
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,940
side. Also, it depends
on the type of grenade.

1154
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:23,120
American hand grenades are the
largest and the deadliest USA USA.

1155
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:28,020
That's right. Fucking America baby. Um,

1156
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:32,010
the Russian grenades are a
little bit smaller. I liked
this. I like the whole, uh,

1157
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:34,950
the whole Phallic thing going
on here with less fragmentation,

1158
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:38,940
but I still wouldn't want to be in the
same fucking zip code when one goes off.

1159
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:42,330
Um, and then the second
question I asked him was, um,

1160
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:45,200
hearing loss is a big
thing for me because a,

1161
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:47,850
I play drums without earplugs for awhile.

1162
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:52,410
And I also went and saw AACD seen a
bunch of other heavy metal bands in every

1163
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:57,411
other time I wear earplugs and
I have tinnitus in my right ear,

1164
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,510
which is a,
you know,

1165
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:05,190
sometimes it can be a buzzing sound or
it can be just a ringing sound and it

1166
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:09,840
never goes away and it's driven people
to suicide. If it's loud enough,

1167
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,410
mind fortunately isn't.
It's just like,

1168
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:17,760
like right now I can barely hear it.
Like if I actually just stopped talking,

1169
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:21,780
if I stopped like late at night, I can
hear it when there's nothing going on.

1170
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:25,140
If there's no background noise, I just
thought of here like this really low,

1171
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:25,974
just soda

1172
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:28,160
e

1173
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,400
in my ear. And I know a lot of you just
was like, Holy Shit, that must be crazy.

1174
01:12:31,401 --> 01:12:33,410
But you actually,
that's my phone by the way.

1175
01:12:33,411 --> 01:12:36,200
If you're wondering what the other sound
is, that's not the sound in my ear.

1176
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:40,820
That's letting me know that I
have some fucking new Texas. Um,

1177
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:42,201
but anyways,
yeah,

1178
01:12:42,201 --> 01:12:44,840
I was always wondering like how these
guys are in war and they're shooting these

1179
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,910
fucking machine guns and
all this type of stuff.

1180
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:50,120
Like how do you not lose your hearing?
And he said to,

1181
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:54,500
to answer your second question, he said,
I have a condition called Tinnitus, uh,

1182
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,140
which I basically explained, but all
I have them explained it to, he said,

1183
01:12:57,141 --> 01:13:01,310
which is a permanent permanent ringing
in my ears and my left ear is pretty

1184
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:02,330
fucked up as well.

1185
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:05,840
Some dude opened up with a machine gun
right next to my head and I didn't have

1186
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:09,680
an ear plug in my left year. So I guess
you guys wear ear plugs over there.

1187
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,670
But I would think sometimes if you get
ambushed you don't have a men and then

1188
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:16,700
you just got to fucking open up anyways.

1189
01:13:16,701 --> 01:13:20,180
I don't really notice the ringing
unless it's really fucking quiet.

1190
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,550
And since I live in the
middle of a dense urban area,

1191
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:26,660
it's never really fucking quiet.
So it's not an issue in combat.

1192
01:13:26,661 --> 01:13:28,730
We wear ear plugs that work pretty well.

1193
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,940
Shooting aside small rooms is
still pretty fucking loud though.

1194
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:36,140
The loudest thing over there are
aircraft in anything that explodes.

1195
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:39,410
I'm talking about the loudest fucking
thing you would ever hear in your life.

1196
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,161
Also,

1197
01:13:40,161 --> 01:13:44,300
we normally communicate
non verbally through hand
signals and just knowing where

1198
01:13:44,301 --> 01:13:47,900
you should be in a certain situation. Oh,
he's addressing the fact that, you know,

1199
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:49,650
you always watched
those cop movies in the,

1200
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:54,190
in the sort of whisper after they
shot a couple of rounds, you know,

1201
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:56,050
and I've shot a gun
without fucking earplugs.

1202
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:58,940
That's another dumb thing I did when my
hearing and I couldn't hear anything.

1203
01:13:58,941 --> 01:14:02,330
So there's no fucking way I could then
whisper to somebody next to me going,

1204
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:06,320
you go around back and I'll try to keep
them busy here cause they got to be

1205
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:10,970
going like, hey, I can't fucking hear you.
Um, so anyways, he said they use hand.

1206
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,870
Um,
anyways,

1207
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:17,350
besides shouting within earshot of the
enemy is retarded since they counter

1208
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:20,620
attack and the element
of surprise is lost. Uh,

1209
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:25,090
this email was probably longer than that,
ladies.

1210
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:28,270
Oh, that Lady's who've made fun
of your suit on Konan now, dude,

1211
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:31,240
I totally appreciate that man. If
there's anybody else out there that like,

1212
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:32,260
really,
uh,

1213
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:37,060
that's like some time life
books kind of stopped,

1214
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:39,730
you know when they talk about what
it's really like. So if anybody else,

1215
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:43,120
if I have anybody who's a overseas,
God knows you get the Internet over there,

1216
01:14:43,121 --> 01:14:46,510
if you're over there in Iraq or if
you're over there in Afghanistan,

1217
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:50,530
and I'm trying to think of a question of
any of the listeners have any questions

1218
01:14:50,531 --> 01:14:54,370
of stuff over there. Um, I
got one for you. You know,

1219
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:58,600
you sit there and you train and you go
through bootcamp and you do all that

1220
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,880
stuff, you know, and uh,

1221
01:15:00,881 --> 01:15:05,260
you get yourself ready for battle and
then you go on over there. You know,

1222
01:15:05,261 --> 01:15:08,530
I know my biggest fear would have
been like, what am I going to be?

1223
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:13,531
That guy who freezes up and is crying in
the fetal position spooning his weapon

1224
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:19,360
in a foxhole is someone's screaming at me,
private bar for Christ Sake,

1225
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:23,950
get your shit together.
You best on fuck yourself pile.

1226
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:29,280
I mean what happens is does
it just naturally clicking?

1227
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:34,150
Cause I would think even in my first
battle, even if I didn't push you out,

1228
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:39,870
I would still be a spazz and
woo fucking empty in entirety

1229
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,410
clip. I remember talking
to cops about this shit.

1230
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:46,960
We had this cop on my radio show
uninformed and by the way, uh,

1231
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,540
I have a new episode coming out.

1232
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,620
We taped one a yesterday that
will be out on a July 3rd.

1233
01:15:52,621 --> 01:15:57,210
You can listen to that on a
XM two o two and A. Anyways,

1234
01:15:57,211 --> 01:15:58,800
this cop was saying how a lot,
yeah,

1235
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:02,430
he worked with guys the first time
they pulled their weapon. This is,

1236
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,450
this is an old school guy,

1237
01:16:03,451 --> 01:16:08,130
so they still had like the six shooter
and was saying they pulled that gun out

1238
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:12,300
of their holster and by the time they
brought it up level with the suspect,

1239
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:16,020
they were literally out of bullets
because they would be pulling it out.

1240
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,470
But I've had my Bambam like
shooting literally into the
ground in front of them.

1241
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:23,220
They've had guys shoot
themselves in the foot. I'm just,

1242
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:28,380
I just can't imagine the
fucking adrenaline that is
going through your, your,

1243
01:16:28,381 --> 01:16:31,260
your body when something like
that is happening. So, you know,

1244
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,820
if it's not too painful,

1245
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:35,430
obviously I'm not trying to
have a big therapy session here.

1246
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,360
This is supposed to be a comedy fuck.

1247
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,610
So if you've got some funny stories or
anything like that, uh, listen to me.

1248
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:45,720
If you've got any funny stories about
war and engaging the enemy, I don't know.

1249
01:16:45,721 --> 01:16:48,810
Anything that you would think
would be fucking interesting. Uh,

1250
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:51,630
cause I don't think I can, I can
answer any more questions about comedy.

1251
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:55,600
I've pretty much answered them
all. But um, I don't know,

1252
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:56,850
I'm kind of speaking for the group here,

1253
01:16:56,851 --> 01:17:00,930
but I find that stuff really interesting
because my only frame of restaurant

1254
01:17:00,931 --> 01:17:04,560
references when I watch movies
and you see these guys, you know,

1255
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,290
they throw your,
never see that in the movie.

1256
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,180
Like there's a grenade
lands near the guys,

1257
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:13,070
then somebody dies on top of it to
save his buddies life. Now from,

1258
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:16,670
I always thought that you could do that,
but having just read that last one,

1259
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:20,510
evidently if I did that, then
just, you know, all the 200,

1260
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:24,950
whatever bones in my body would just
turn into shrapnel. And you know,

1261
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,260
I don't know if people
would die around me,

1262
01:17:27,261 --> 01:17:30,410
but they would definitely rolling around
on the ground trying to get my femur

1263
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:34,880
out of the side of their fucking neck.
So we all learned something.

1264
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,900
All right,
let's

1265
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:41,200
along with the, uh, the podcast
questions then. You know, it's just not,

1266
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:45,260
the question is obviously post to
all veterans cops, anybody rednecks.

1267
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:46,803
If you got,

1268
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:50,170
knows you probably threw a grenade at a
duck and it's bill came back and hit you

1269
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:54,280
in your foot. Now you've gotta limp. Any,
any of those fucking stories? I, I would,

1270
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:58,260
I would love to hear all right.
Podcast questions of the week. Uh,

1271
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:02,470
this was a really interesting
one. Um, this guy says, ah, Bill,

1272
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:06,760
I come from a family where more than
half of the women have gotten pregnant in

1273
01:18:06,761 --> 01:18:10,070
their teens and almost all of
the men have ended up in jail,

1274
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:14,200
in jail at various points in their lives.
Um,

1275
01:18:14,201 --> 01:18:17,440
so I've seen firsthand how having a
kid when you're not ready and going to

1276
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:19,870
prison at an early age can
really fuck up your life.

1277
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:21,880
And because I'm trying not to,

1278
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:25,990
because I'm trying to end the tradition
of poverty and dysfunction in my family,

1279
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:30,370
I am very hesitant towards trying to
hook up with random women and can be

1280
01:18:30,371 --> 01:18:35,260
considered a bit of a nerd also.
Um,

1281
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:39,940
due to the fact that I don't have like
two or three baby mothers and I'm never

1282
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:42,850
bringing girls around the family,
you guessed it.

1283
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:46,600
I've now been accused of being
gay, I guess by his, his, uh,

1284
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:50,110
his family members. Wow. Okay.

1285
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:54,730
Thought I came from a dysfunctional
family. Um, all right.

1286
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:58,450
I hope you see my dilemma here. Uh, if
I go out of my way to prove I'm not gay,

1287
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,170
then I'm acting, acting like the classic
homophobe. I'm not cool with that.

1288
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:07,150
I'm also giving them power by trying to
conform to their perception of what a

1289
01:19:07,151 --> 01:19:11,590
quote unquote real man is. But if I
ignore it, they continued to talk shit.

1290
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:14,300
It would be different if, um, if,

1291
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:18,340
if it were a collection of Douche bag
jock sang things like this, but it's not,

1292
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,870
this is my fucking family.

1293
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:23,140
The people who are supposed to
love me unconditionally. And yes,

1294
01:19:23,141 --> 01:19:28,080
as sad as it may seem, my family members
are that stupid and ignorant. Uh,

1295
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:31,660
they think being gay is something
that warrants being made fun of.

1296
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:34,870
Although I can, uh, I can
really see the humor in this.

1297
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:38,920
It really does hurt a little doing the
right thing by staying in school and

1298
01:19:38,921 --> 01:19:42,850
trying to make something out of my life
while staying out of trouble has gotten

1299
01:19:42,851 --> 01:19:45,280
me where I'm accused of being gay.

1300
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:49,570
I'm so disgusted with my family that
I'm seriously considering cutting each

1301
01:19:49,571 --> 01:19:54,380
member out of my family life.
Even my own mother, parentheses,

1302
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,120
my, my father's dead. Your thoughts. Uh,

1303
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:03,160
I think you're doing an amazing
thing to be honest with you.

1304
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:08,340
I think one of the hardest things to do
is to grow up in a fucked up and to be

1305
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:14,160
in the environment and be surrounded
by totally immersed in it.

1306
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:19,560
Yet still have the ability
to pull yourself out of it
and analyze it and look at

1307
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:24,561
how other people are living and if they're
living in a smarter way or a way that

1308
01:20:26,011 --> 01:20:26,940
appeals to you more,

1309
01:20:26,941 --> 01:20:31,350
to actually try to go and try to go in
that direction without doing what most

1310
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:31,980
normal people.

1311
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:35,310
What most people do in that situation
is they just look at other people.

1312
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,990
If they're living a smarter life, they
just dismiss them as facts. You know,

1313
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:44,940
well, I want to go to college like
these a bunch of figs, you know?

1314
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,900
Um, yeah, that's a,

1315
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:51,840
that's a lesson I learned late in life
that you really have to watch out who

1316
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:56,400
your, uh, who you surround
yourself with because a,

1317
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:59,100
you basically end up,
for the most part,

1318
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:04,080
you end up doing what they do.
You just get sucked into their vortex.

1319
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,570
So I don't know if that's the right word.
Whatever the fuck it is,

1320
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:09,840
you get sucked into that.
They're little, uh, their world.

1321
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,490
And so if you're hanging out with people
who were doing dumb shit fucking up

1322
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:17,790
their lives, the chances of you fucking
up your life is going to be huge.

1323
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:21,510
And Dude, you don't want two
or three when babies with,

1324
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:25,230
with two or three different women,
you know that everybody knows that.

1325
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,470
And even those fucking retards
who are doing it, they know that.

1326
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:29,520
And you know what it really is?

1327
01:21:29,521 --> 01:21:34,140
I really think this is a classic example
of misery loves company and they,

1328
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,870
when they're laying in bed at night,

1329
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,300
they know that they've fucked
their lives up. And you know what?

1330
01:21:39,301 --> 01:21:41,910
When people fuck their lives up,
you know what you do,

1331
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,880
you lay in bed and you
think about the first day,

1332
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:48,180
that day when you fucked your life up
and you wish you could just go back to it

1333
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:52,050
and make a left instead of making a right.
That's what the fuck they're doing.

1334
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:57,410
And the harsh reality is you can't go
back in time and which leaves you with one

1335
01:21:58,441 --> 01:22:00,030
of two things.
You can even eat them,

1336
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:05,031
man up and admit that you're the
reason and you're responsible for,

1337
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:05,940
you know,

1338
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:10,230
for the fact that your life is fucked up
and you try to make the best of it and

1339
01:22:10,231 --> 01:22:15,231
try to actually help other people
not make the same mistakes you have.

1340
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,280
That's the most noble
thing that you can do.

1341
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:23,060
Or you can take the easy way out like
most people and is try to fucking do that

1342
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:26,160
and misery loves company and
drag everybody down with you.

1343
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:27,630
That's all they're trying to do.

1344
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:30,090
They're trying to drag you down to the
bottom of the swimming pool so you can

1345
01:22:30,091 --> 01:22:33,780
drown in their fucking misery too.
So you're doing the right thing.

1346
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:36,240
And if you have to a,

1347
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:39,030
I don't know if you've got to like
totally cut them out because it is your

1348
01:22:39,031 --> 01:22:42,360
family that is your mom and at some point,
you know,

1349
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:45,180
you know they're not going
to be around forever.

1350
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:49,890
So it's never good to not go for long
periods without communicating with your

1351
01:22:49,891 --> 01:22:50,281
family.

1352
01:22:50,281 --> 01:22:55,230
But you just kinda got to give yourself
a halftime speech or a pregame speech

1353
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:59,550
before you talk to them. To
make sure that, uh, you know,

1354
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:05,410
you basically stay on point and uh,
yeah dude,

1355
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,640
that those are my thoughts. You're totally
doing the right thing. And I think, uh,

1356
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,440
I think you're a really strong person
that you are able to see how fucked up

1357
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:16,240
your family was. That's a hard
thing to do, you know? Um,

1358
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:19,450
and try and correct it, you
know, so it'll be great.

1359
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,460
So then you'll end up
with the right woman,

1360
01:23:21,461 --> 01:23:25,840
you end up having great kids and
then you'll be, you'll break the, uh,

1361
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:29,890
your break that circle,
but the problem is dead.

1362
01:23:29,891 --> 01:23:33,850
You'll then run into is then when you
have kids is then they're going to want,

1363
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:39,340
they're fucked up kids to hang out
with your, uh, enlightened kids.

1364
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:44,710
And that'll be the hard thing because
they are your cousins in, in, in whatever.

1365
01:23:44,711 --> 01:23:47,770
I Dunno, it's a fucking mess. But
Dude, you're on the right track.

1366
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:51,760
So what do I think you should keep doing
what you're doing and try to find some

1367
01:23:51,761 --> 01:23:54,010
middle ground where you keep
them at an arm's length,

1368
01:23:54,011 --> 01:23:57,250
but you don't totally sever ties.
And when they,

1369
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,180
and when they give you shit,
you know about being gay,

1370
01:24:01,181 --> 01:24:04,600
just give him shit right back.
Oh really?

1371
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:08,020
Really? Really? I'm, I'm, I'm gay. What?

1372
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:12,280
Because I don't have some fucking psycho
coming in here trying to burn down my

1373
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:16,150
fucking clothes cause I knocked up
another fucking broad. Now don't do that.

1374
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,490
Don't go for it. That's what I would
do. I'd go for the jugular. Like, dude,

1375
01:24:18,491 --> 01:24:20,410
your life sucks.
Okay.

1376
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,770
What's it like earning $400
a week and giving it in,

1377
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:29,040
dividing up 380 of it and fucking given
it to three different women and then

1378
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:32,440
he'd go on down to the fucking hot
dog truck in and buying you dinner.

1379
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:37,180
You dumb fuck, you know, put a
shirt on and get your shit together.

1380
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:40,810
I don't know. I would just say
mean shit. Don't listen to me.

1381
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:44,500
That for the first part of my advice
was good, but uh, yeah, try to find a,

1382
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:49,600
I dunno, you know what, talk to somebody
else for the second half. I right.

1383
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:51,760
I'm not Deepak Chopra, but I, I got,

1384
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:55,450
I think the first half of the
advice I gave you was good.
All right. So that's it.

1385
01:24:55,451 --> 01:24:58,270
You're doing the right thing. There
you go. Something positive. All right,

1386
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:02,320
next question. Hey Bill. Um,
essentially a pretty big sports fan.

1387
01:25:02,321 --> 01:25:06,130
I was wondering what we are opinion.
What was your opinion of soccer?

1388
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:10,390
Um, I'm not much of a fan. I basically
only watched some of the World Cup,

1389
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:15,550
but today at the restaurant I was watching
Brazil versus USA game and a few of

1390
01:25:15,551 --> 01:25:18,160
my Brazilian coworkers,
um,

1391
01:25:18,161 --> 01:25:21,220
we're watching the game and for
the first task for the first half,

1392
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:23,990
I had a blast watching the game
because basically I got to play out the

1393
01:25:23,991 --> 01:25:26,470
stereotypical over the top clues American.

1394
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,540
They were just dying inside when the u
s scored a the first two goals and I got

1395
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:36,010
to fuck with them. I was yelling,
Shit like a throw the flag. Uh,

1396
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:40,450
I'll tell you what Brazil needs to do.
They should call a timeout and regroup.

1397
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:43,660
And then my coworkers
were taking me serious,

1398
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:48,220
furiously telling me that there are no
timeouts in soccer. Oh, that's great,

1399
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:54,130
dude. They should call a
fucking time out. I'll tell you,

1400
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:57,610
there's nothing more fun than playing
up the ignorant American, you know,

1401
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,330
that's the greatest thing you can do when
you go to Europe and they start giving

1402
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:05,870
you shit that you don't know anything
about their country and brace it and just

1403
01:26:05,871 --> 01:26:08,510
be like, yeah, dude, I gotta be honest.

1404
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:12,170
Nobody talks about your country
in my country, we don't have,

1405
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:15,110
we know who the fuck you guys are.
What do,

1406
01:26:15,111 --> 01:26:17,870
I can't believe you're not all walking
around a wooden shoes over here.

1407
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:22,580
You guys have cars, you know, just
fucking play it up. All right. Anyways,

1408
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:25,580
he said at,
my coworkers were taking me seriously.

1409
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:28,370
If you're a seat telling me that
they want a time out. And he said,

1410
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:32,450
once the US scored the second
goal, I yelled, what are the odds?

1411
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,210
I'd say about a Brazilian to one

1412
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:41,300
dude. I actually wish I was there to
see that you really signed up noxious.

1413
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:44,330
That must've been great. Is there anything
goes? It goes, but then in the long run,

1414
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:49,010
uh, they ended up giving me shit because
a, as I was watching the game, um,

1415
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,170
I was thinking, why, why not
have Brazil take a, Oh, this is,

1416
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,950
this is a big conspiracy theory. He
goes, but as I was watching the game,

1417
01:26:57,220 --> 01:27:01,720
I thought it's something that,
uh, I'm amazed that the F F I f a

1418
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:06,640
didn't arrange this to make it happen.
I was thinking,

1419
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:11,620
why not have Brazil take a dive against
the US, but you know, make it look good.

1420
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,930
And then the next year when
the World Cup came around,

1421
01:27:13,931 --> 01:27:16,990
the interest in the US would
be through the roof, you know,

1422
01:27:16,991 --> 01:27:21,670
let the u s beat Brazil and then you,
uh, you spit out a bunch of t shirts,

1423
01:27:21,671 --> 01:27:24,760
you split them 50, 50, with the
Brazilian, you know, the whole,

1424
01:27:24,761 --> 01:27:27,430
we kicked Brazilians ass,
uh,

1425
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:31,180
Brazil's acid in 15 years when
everyone has forgot about the game.

1426
01:27:31,181 --> 01:27:35,590
That's when you make the movie. What do
you think about the idea of bill? Well,

1427
01:27:35,591 --> 01:27:38,470
I think, uh, if I read it a little
bit better when it made more sense,

1428
01:27:39,010 --> 01:27:43,690
you think it would have worked? Um,
yeah. I think we beat Brazil in us.

1429
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:48,560
The U s team started, uh,
building up, you know,

1430
01:27:48,561 --> 01:27:49,341
something.
Actually,

1431
01:27:49,341 --> 01:27:52,250
I don't think it would've worked because
those people down there take soccer way

1432
01:27:52,251 --> 01:27:56,360
too seriously. Brazil takes it really
seriously, but they're not like,

1433
01:27:56,630 --> 01:28:00,950
like Columbia or was it Columbia?
Like, uh, was it the Venezuelan team?

1434
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:04,460
Somebody accidentally put the ball in
their own net and the guy went home and he

1435
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:09,200
got fucking machine gun, like the
fucking Saint Valentine's Day massacre,

1436
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:10,993
you know?

1437
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:12,543
Yeah.

1438
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:13,870
Um, so no, I don't think it would work.

1439
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:17,620
I think would work in America because
we don't give a fuck about soccer.

1440
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:21,280
Um, all right. I think that's the
end of the questions that I have.

1441
01:28:21,281 --> 01:28:24,640
Anything else here? I'm a
little disorganized. Uh,

1442
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:27,730
all right.
How about this?

1443
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:31,420
How about a movie review and then I'm
going to end this podcast because, oh man,

1444
01:28:31,421 --> 01:28:35,380
I have to end it for now.
This is too fucking lock.
I'll read one really quickly.

1445
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,820
Uh, the punisher movie review based on
the marvel comic character Thomas Jane,

1446
01:28:39,821 --> 01:28:43,450
who was in the midst of the dream catcher
in the thin red line stars is Frank

1447
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:46,240
Castle, who is a former Greenbury
that becomes an FBI agent.

1448
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:50,500
Castle has one last bus to
make that involves stolen
weapons. And during the bus,

1449
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:54,790
the son of a mob boss, Howard St,
played by John Travolta, is killed.

1450
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,810
St wants vengeance on who got his son
killed and finds out the castle is one the

1451
01:28:58,811 --> 01:29:02,310
one who caused saints son's death.
Not to spoil, but shit happens.

1452
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:07,580
And castle gets in his Camaro
to fuck shit some shit up.

1453
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:12,390
I give it two out of four stars. It's a
movie that tries to be a real realistic,

1454
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:16,710
which is great compared to the over the
top cliche Aquins action sequences and

1455
01:29:16,711 --> 01:29:17,460
the SQL.

1456
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:22,460
It's definitely worth the
rent or a purchasing as how
it's $5 on DVD and $10 on

1457
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,900
Blu Ray at best buy or Walmart.
And there are two versions,

1458
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:29,400
the three theatrical and
the extended edition.

1459
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:33,390
So this guy gives a two out of four
stars basically saying the punisher is a

1460
01:29:33,391 --> 01:29:36,240
good rental. All right. And
that's the podcast for this week.

1461
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:39,590
I hope you guys enjoyed it. Uh,
there's going to be one more podcasts.

1462
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I'm out here in New York City and then I
will finally be back out in Los Angelis

1463
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:48,660

1464
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:51,240
or maybe actually I'll be
in San Francisco. Yeah.

1465
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:55,080

be doing two shows at the punchline in

1466
01:29:55,081 --> 01:29:59,400

1467
01:29:59,590 --> 01:29:59,670
uh,

1468
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:04,670
the next big date I have is I'm going
to be doing the comedy works in Denver,

1469
01:30:06,091 --> 01:30:10,740

23rd, the 24th and the 25th. So, uh,

1470
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:12,120

1471

when I get the exact time. All right,

1477
01:30:34,861 --> 01:30:36,270
so that's it for the podcast.

1478
01:30:36,271 --> 01:30:40,410
