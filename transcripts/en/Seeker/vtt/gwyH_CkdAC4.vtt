00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.340
It’s the kind of question that sort of breaks
your brain when you even start to figure out

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.220
how to think about it: what shape is the universe?

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.349
No one can be sure; until we can step outside
of the universe and walk around it somehow

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.420
-- we can’t actually do that ever -- the
best we can do is take what we know to model

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.450
the likeliest scenario.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.160
The idea of the shape of the universe comes
down to the key insight from General Relativity

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.080
that says mass warps space, and that objects
moving through space have their paths curved.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.140
Here’s a simple way to think about it: imagine
there’s a bowling ball on a trampoline.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.660
That’s the sun warping space around it.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.710
Now roll a marble past the bowling ball to
mimic a planet in orbit.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.790
From the marble’s perspective it's rolling
in a straight line, but we can see that its

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.250
path is curved by the bowling ball depressing
the trampoline.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.480
Now imagine that the universe is a giant trampoline
covered in bowling-ball stars, medicine-ball

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.080
black holes, and little planet marbles.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.969
This means that masses are warping space all
over the place, and the combined force of

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.220
all that mass has the capacity to shape the
universe.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.060
So really, when we talk about the shape of
the universe we’re talking about the density

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.060
of the universe.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.420
The simplest shape to get your head around
is the flat universe, which isn’t flat like

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.859
a two dimensional piece of paper, it’s flat
because it has no curvature.

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.069
This is the shape the universe would take
if it has the exact amount of mass to stop

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.729
the universe expanding after an infinite time.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.600
It will have no bounds and expand forever,
slowing but never stopping.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.560
If the universe contains more mass -- more
than critical mass so enough to stop its expansion

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.049
— it will have a positive curvature.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.609
In this scenario the universe is closed and
looks a little like a sphere.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.200
It would be finite but without a beginning
or end.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.090
Eventually, the mass will cause the universe
to collapse back in on itself.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.859
If, on the other extreme, the universe has
insufficient mass to stop its expansion, it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.729
will have no bounds and expand forever in
an open shape sort of like a saddle.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:56.770
So, which is it?

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.399
Well, current cosmological observations say
the Universe should expand forever, so the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.020
positive curvature isn’t likely.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.239
But, it also doesn’t seem to have the right
conditions for negative curvature.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:12.640
Data from NASA’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe mission of distant supernovae show that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.040
the universe’s rate of expansion is accelerating,
but that rate is balanced by the mass of dark

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.040
matter.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.780
In short, the Universe is likely ever so nearly
flat.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.390
But it’s possible that’s the observable
universe.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.019
Because the speed of light is a fixed value,
we can only see 13.8 billion years back.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.409
It’s possible we just can’t detect a complete
curvature with the instruments we have, or

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.159
in ways that the laws of physics will allow.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:52.359
So while we all know the Earth isn’t flat…
it looks like the universe almost is.

00:02:52.359 --> 00:03:07.409
It’s been almost FOUR YEARS since I started
here, and I’ve loved every single episode!

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.430
Especially that awkward naked cold open and
fun time with chimerism!

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.189
But I’ve got some exciting new things in
the works so I’m not going to be around

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.189
Seeker as much.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.719
I’m still doing Vintage Space, so if you
want to keep up with me and see what I’ve

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:25.709
got coming -- and Pete pics! -- be sure to
follow me on YouTube as well as Twitter and

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.749
Instagram.

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.439
And of course be sure to Subscribe for more
Seeker.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:46.769
Thanks for watching.
