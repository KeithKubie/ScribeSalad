missing all these opportunities it's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
missing all these opportunities it's
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.979
missing all these opportunities it's
just crazy making and this is by the way

we're spending about 0.4% be nice if it
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.390
we're spending about 0.4% be nice if it
were 0.5% but we're spending a

were 0.5% but we're spending a
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.859
were 0.5% but we're spending a
reasonable amount of our intellect and

and the Planetary Society it works very

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
and the Planetary Society it works very
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.200
and the Planetary Society it works very
hard to direct that expenditure in what

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
hard to direct that expenditure in what
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.999
hard to direct that expenditure in what
we think is the best most efficient way

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
we think is the best most efficient way
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.819
we think is the best most efficient way
today by the way right now is the press

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
today by the way right now is the press
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.490
today by the way right now is the press

change the world
with that said climate change keeps me

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
with that said climate change keeps me
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.760
with that said climate change keeps me
up at night the the opportunities that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
up at night the the opportunities that
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.130
up at night the the opportunities that
we're missing is just crazy making these

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
we're missing is just crazy making these
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990
we're missing is just crazy making these
people who are in denial of climate

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
people who are in denial of climate
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.530
people who are in denial of climate
change well if you're a denialist and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
change well if you're a denialist and
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.969
change well if you're a denialist and
this will probably find its way to you

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
this will probably find its way to you
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.749
this will probably find its way to you
and you will post these crazy

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759
and you will post these crazy
 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.069
and you will post these crazy
mean-spirited comments about me and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
mean-spirited comments about me and
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.740
mean-spirited comments about me and
knock yourself out it's fine if that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
knock yourself out it's fine if that
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.729
knock yourself out it's fine if that
brings you joy okay but if somebody told

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
brings you joy okay but if somebody told
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.760
brings you joy okay but if somebody told
you that there is no connection what

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
you that there is no connection what
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.140
you that there is no connection what
ever between smoking and cancer would

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
ever between smoking and cancer would
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.780
ever between smoking and cancer would
you vote for that person would that be

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
you vote for that person would that be
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.440
you vote for that person would that be
somebody you trust now 50 years after

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
somebody you trust now 50 years after
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.740

that discovery was made well the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
that discovery was made well the
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.540
that discovery was made well the
connection between humans and climate

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550

change is about that strong and by some

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520
change is about that strong and by some
 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.340

very reasonable modern statistical

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350
very reasonable modern statistical
 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.070
very reasonable modern statistical
reckoning slightly stronger so if you're

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
reckoning slightly stronger so if you're
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.770
reckoning slightly stronger so if you're
a denier out there I strongly encourage

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780
a denier out there I strongly encourage
 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.700
a denier out there I strongly encourage
you to cut it out just change just get

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710
you to cut it out just change just get
 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.700
you to cut it out just change just get
to work there's nobody more passionate

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710
to work there's nobody more passionate
 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.290
to work there's nobody more passionate
about the environment than the guy who

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300
about the environment than the guy who
 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.380
about the environment than the guy who
just built his log cabin there's nobody

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
just built his log cabin there's nobody
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.990

anti-smoking advocate stronger than the
 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.130
anti-smoking advocate stronger than the
person who just quit smoking so if

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
person who just quit smoking so if
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.710
person who just quit smoking so if
you're a denier out there you could

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720
you're a denier out there you could
 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.840
you're a denier out there you could
change and we'd embrace you and we could

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850
change and we'd embrace you and we could
 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.130
change and we'd embrace you and we could
get to work and the opportunities are

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140
get to work and the opportunities are
