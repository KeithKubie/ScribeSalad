00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.530
Whenever unemployment comes down - even if
only very slightly - it sounds like really

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.740
good news. It's great that productive forces
in the economy are growing and there’ll

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.120
be a little more money in people's pockets
soon

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.779
But if one gets more ambitious about human
potential, the picture gets more complicated

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.619
and darker than what governments make out.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.320
Unemployment means being, generically, out
of work.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.279
But let’s coin a new word:
MISEMPLOYMENT

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.949
It means being in work but of a kind that
fails to tackle with any real sincerity the

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.750
true needs of other people: merely exciting
them to unsatisfactory desires and pleasures

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.149
instead; the way Primark, Patek Philippe and
youporn.com might.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.469
This man is misemployed:

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.899
Similarly, a man employed by the Sands Casino
in Las Vegas to hand out flyers to tourists

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.840
in order to entice them to use slot machines
is clearly 'employed' in the technical sense.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.789
He's marked as being off the unemployment
registers. He is receiving a wage in return

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.410
for helping to solve some (small) puzzle of
the human condition of interest to his employers:

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.860
that not enough tourists might otherwise leave
the blue skies and heat of main street to

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.000
enter the air-conditioned halls of an Egyptian-themed
casino.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.400
The man is indeed employed, but he’s also
in truth dramatically misemployed.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.990
His labour is generating capital, but it is
making no contribution to human welfare and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.720
flourishing. He is joined in the misemployment
ranks by people who make cigarettes, addictive

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.390
but sterile television shows, badly designed
condos, ill-fitting and shoddy clothes, deceptive

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.530
advertisements, artery-clogging biscuits and
highly-sugared drinks.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.680
The rate of misemployment in modern economies
is very high.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.840
While we may be genuinely grateful for any
job we’re given, at the back of our minds

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.670
we all - as employees - hope for something
else:

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.509
that our work can contribute in some real
way to the common good; that we can make a

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.770
modest difference.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.149
Governments have, with some success, been
learning techniques to reduce the overall

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.890
rate of unemployment. In the language of the
field, they do this by 'stimulating demand.'

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.169
Though technically effective, this method
fails to draw any distinction between good

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.769
and bad demand and therefore between employment
and misemployment.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.870
The real trick to bringing down the rate of
misemployment isn't just to stimulate demand

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.980
per se, it’s to stimulate the right sort
of demand: to excite people to buy the ingredients

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.980
of true satisfaction, to want the things that
really matter, and therefore to give individuals

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.040
and businesses a chance to direct their labour,
and make profits, in meaningful areas of the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.790
economy.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.389
Employment figures aren’t irrelevant - they
matter a great deal. They are the first things

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:46.109
to be attended to. But these raw figures mask
a more ambitious index we should get around

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.810
to building in the future: one that measures
misemployment and hence shows how intelligently

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.110
and responsibly we are deploying human capital,
that is, using up people’s lives.
