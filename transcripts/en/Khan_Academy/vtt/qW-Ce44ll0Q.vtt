00:00:00.852 --> 00:00:03.185
- We have three different
number lines here,

00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:04.730
and on each number line they mark off

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.233
a couple of these marks,
this is negative two

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:09.960
this is negative 10,
negative five, negative 11,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.985
and then we need to figure out
what the blue dot represents.

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:14.473
And as a little bit of a hint,

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:18.313
each mark here is not
necessarily incrementing by one,

00:00:18.313 --> 00:00:19.730
it could be by more than one.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.543
So I encourage you to pause this video,

00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:22.581
and to try it on your own.

00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:25.517
Try to figure out what number
does this blue dot represent

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:26.883
on these different number lines?

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.631
So let's tackle this first one.

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:31.804
So we're gonna go where
they gave us this mark is

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:33.335
negative two, this is negative 10,

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:34.661
and we need to figure out this blue one

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:37.649
that's further to the left of negative 10.

00:00:37.674 --> 00:00:41.470
Well just going from
negative two to negative 10,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.394
what has to happen to negative
two to get to negative 10?

00:00:45.953 --> 00:00:47.949
Well we'll have to subtract eight.

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.734
And so if we move two to the left,

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:51.798
that's the equivalent
of subtracting eight.

00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:53.797
So if we move two to the left again,

00:00:53.797 --> 00:00:55.709
that's subtracting eight again.

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:57.989
So this must be negative 18

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.062
and so if we move two to the left again,

00:01:00.062 --> 00:01:02.562
that also must be subtracting eight.

00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:07.587
Negative 18 minus eight,
would get us to negative,

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:11.995
that gets us to negative 26.

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:14.821
Now another way we could
have thought about it is,

00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:17.533
if we jump two to the left
and that's negative eight,

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.222
then one jump to the left
is gonna be negative four.

00:01:20.222 --> 00:01:22.245
So you could say "Well
this is negative four",

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:24.125
that would get you to negative six,

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:27.213
then negative four again
gets you to negative 10,

00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:30.325
then this would be
negative 14, negative 18,

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:34.089
negative 22, negative 26.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.653
Now let's tackle this one.

00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:38.141
So here we're gonna, we have to figure out

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:39.924
what this blue dot here is on the right.

00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:44.924
So if we started at 11, you make two jumps

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.690
to go to negative five.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.842
So what do I have to add to negative 11

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.562
to get to negative five?

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:53.746
Well I have to add six.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.890
So if I add six over two jumps,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.370
that means that each of these jumps,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.034
that must be plus three,

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:01.554
and this one must be plus three.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.529
So now each mark we just add three.

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.379
So negative five plus three...

00:02:07.404 --> 00:02:10.836
So plus three is gonna
get us to negative two.

00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:15.084
Plus three gets us to positive one,

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:17.190
negative two plus three is positive one,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.714
plus three gets us to four.

00:02:20.714 --> 00:02:22.498
So here we got to negative 26,

00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:23.969
here we get to four.

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.017
Now let's tackle this one.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.242
So we're at negative seven,

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:30.057
or this is negative seven this is one

00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:32.297
and then we have to figure
out this mark right over here.

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:34.001
So if you take two jumps to the right,

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:35.459
from negative seven to one,

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.097
how much did we have to add?

00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:39.376
Well to get from negative seven to one,

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:41.157
you have to add eight.

00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:42.418
You have to add eight.

00:02:42.443 --> 00:02:45.530
So then if we make another two
jumps to the mystery number

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.402
that means we added eight again.

00:02:47.402 --> 00:02:50.399
So one plus eight is nine.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.495
Another way we could
have thought about it,

00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:54.487
if we added eight over two jumps

00:02:54.487 --> 00:02:57.075
that means we added four on each jump.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.919
So this one must be negative three,

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.750
add four you get to one,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.237
add four you get to five,

00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:06.992
add four you get to nine.
