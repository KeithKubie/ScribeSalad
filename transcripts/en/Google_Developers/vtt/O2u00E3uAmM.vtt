DANIEL WAISBERG: Google
Analytics best practices,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.340
or analytics in
general best practices.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.430
And first of all, I'd
like to talk a little bit

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.870
about snooker.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.810
I know that we are in the UK
and some people like snooker,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.280
especially as we had the world
championship just this week.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.670
And one of the things,
I was born in Brazil.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.130
And back then, when I was
a teenager, that's the way

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.470
we thought about snooker, right.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.260
It's a place where you go
to smoke and drink beer.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.290
And playing snooker is
just to kill the time.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.090
And that's what we thought.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.814
And just going to--

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.120
MALE SPEAKER: Paul
Newman, Tom Cruise

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.521
in a Martin Scorsese picture.

00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.896
FAST EDDIE FELSON: He's got
the eye, he's got the stroke,

00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:50.860
he's got the flick.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.943
CARMEN: Vince is the best.

00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:54.095
[FIGHTING NOISES]

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:57.130
FAST EDDIE FELSON: We got a
race horse here, a thoroughbred.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.669
You make him feel good,
I teach him how to run.

00:00:59.669 --> 00:01:01.460
I'm not your daddy,
I'm not your boyfriend.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.876
So don't be playing
games with me.

00:01:02.876 --> 00:01:03.596
I'm your partner.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.060
DANIEL WAISBERG: So that's the
way I thought about snooker.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.190
And then a new chapter
started in my life.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.970
I moved to Israel
and got married.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.180
And my brother-in-law,
that's him.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.450
He's a professional
snooker player.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.950
And lately, he started teaching
us how to play snooker.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.000
And there are some amazing
things in this game.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.480
And it's a very smart game.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.950
And you need a very
special technique.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.010
You need to understand
the physics about the game

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.475
and how to pocket balls.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.300
And you can make money.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.130
I don't know how many of you
know this Mr. O'Sullivan.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.380
He has been the champion for
the last, I think, five years.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.850
And he won 7.5 million pounds
in just professional games.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.940
But not all of us can be
professional snooker players.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.154
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about how to use analytics

00:02:03.154 --> 00:02:04.070
in a professional way.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.410
So as opposed to
using it as an amateur

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.364
and going to play snooker
just to kill time,

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:12.530
I'm going to talk about
being a professional snooker

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.700
player using analytics.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.430
So first, I'd like to talk
about web analytics, what's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.120
the overall objective
of analytics.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.970
And I like this chart.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.210
It's from the '90s-- a
friend of mine, Jim Sterne.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.970
And he's also the owner
of the eMetrics Summit.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.540
And what I think
as you can see, it

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.870
goes from top left
to bottom right.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.060
And you can see the
three dotted lines.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.950
First one is
acquisition, persuasion,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.110
and then conversion.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.590
So what we see on
the top left chart

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.370
is that we are acquiring
lots of people.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.630
And they are very untargeted.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.940
So we don't manage to
persuade them to look

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.220
at the [? effort, ?] to
sign up, or to buy something

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.390
on the website, correct.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.520
And then as you understand
better the customers,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.810
you can convince them to
get deeper into the product

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.590
and maybe purchase
something from the website.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.980
And the last one, you
can see that maybe you

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.200
have less people, but they're
much more targeted so you're

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.660
bringing the right
people to the website.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.010
Now, this is a web analytics
process that I like to use.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.920
And I think it's a good one.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.720
And I emphasize that it's
a web analytics process.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.890
It's not the web
analytics process.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.929
So basically, what we need
to do is first of all,

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.720
we need to define the
goals of the website.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.150
And that's not as
simple as it might seem.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.110
I mean, sometimes the website
is about selling something.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.070
So selling is the ultimate
objective, so the macro goal.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.940
And then there are all
kinds of micro goals,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.920
which is getting people to
sign up for a newsletter,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.270
getting people to
follow you on Google+.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.460
And then, once you
define the goals,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.340
you start defining the KPIs,
which are the key performance

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.210
indicators.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.550
So they are the
numbers that you will

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.790
use to measure if you're
succeeding with your goals

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.450
or not.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.990
And once you have
those two things,

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.680
you can start
collecting the data.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.220
So people usually, they start
from collecting the data.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.920
And then they look at
what they're collecting.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.089
So first of all,
define the goals.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:26.360
Then building KPIs and
collecting the data.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.940
Once you have all the data,
you start analyzing it.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.530
Sometimes, you'll
start analyzing,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.610
and then you'll go
back to collecting

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.974
because you don't have
everything you need.

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:38.140
After you analyze, you have
to do something with it.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.240
So usually, the
best way to proceed

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.560
is building a test,
an A/B test, and then

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.032
testing different alternatives,
see which one is better.

00:04:48.032 --> 00:04:49.865
Once you do that, you
implement the changes.

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:52.630
And then you can go back
to analyzing or revisiting

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.890
the whole process.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.250
So that's more or less
the [? valid ?] analytics

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.510
process that you
should think about.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.710
But as a startup, I
think it's very important

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.559
to understand that
you need to use

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:09.850
the process that works for you.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.830
So sometimes you might go look
at the data, first of all,

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.720
and see what you have and
what you can do with it.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.550
And then you can start
thinking about the analysis.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.550
So I'm going to talk
about four principles

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.280
that I think every company
should keep in mind when

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.210
they use Google Analytics.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.060
And they are very
important for everything

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.820
you do when managing
the website.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.540
So first one trends.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.840
So this is a data point.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.990
And a data point
is not very useful.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.950
So if you know that yesterday
you had 5,000 visitors

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.880
and they brought 10,000
pounds in revenue,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.050
it's not very useful.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.490
So you need to-- oops.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.990
Sorry.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.823
You need to compare how
it's growing, right.

00:06:03.823 --> 00:06:06.060
Is it growing, or
is it going down?

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.960
And that's a very
important thing.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.970
And if you are in a seasonal
business-- like travel,

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.380
for example-- you
should compare, not only

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.610
see if it's growing.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.360
You should also
see if it's growing

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.730
as opposed to the
same season last year.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.760
So if you look at
summer, for example,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.890
you can't compare
summer to winter.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.870
So you should compare
summer to last summer.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.990
That's a very important point.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.210
Now is there Ernest
Hemingway-- "There's

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.450
nothing noble in being
superior to your fellow man;

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.200
true nobility is being
superior to your former self."

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.287
So it's very important.

00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:44.870
Lots of people, they
are always trying

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.310
to compare themselves
with others.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.980
And I think the
first thing should

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.480
be to compare yourself to
what you have been last year

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.765
or before.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.441
Now thinking about trends,
I think trends is very good

00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:01.440
and it's very important.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.820
But trends is not enough.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.710
So you should also
look at segmentation.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.590
And meaning-- so if you're
looking at how my website grew

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.330
in the last three months, you
should also look, drill down

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:20.660
into what kind of segments
drove this growth.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.650
So there are two
types of segmentation.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.050
And the first one is top-down.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.610
The second one is bottom-up.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.200
So top-down personas
is something

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.300
that you decide-- the management
decides-- and then tells

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.180
everyone to do
what they decided.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.650
Then there's the
data driven, which

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.090
is the analyst discovers
a pattern in the data

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.090
and then tells
everyone about it.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.900
So the analyst is
usually the lowest

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.010
you can get in the organization.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.430
Now, personas, just
to talk a little bit.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.864
Basically, what we
do is you sit down,

00:07:58.864 --> 00:08:01.530
and you think about what kind of
people you're trying to target.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.990
So let's suppose
I'm trying my users

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:10.020
should be someone like
Daniel, a fictional person.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.810
He commutes from Cambridge
to London every day.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.930
He reads his email on the train.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.770
And he reads "The Guardian."

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.580
And then we start.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.890
You give a picture
to this persona.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:31.049
And you start creating people
that you want to target them.

00:08:31.049 --> 00:08:32.590
So there's Daniel,
and there's James,

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.270
and there's Jonathan,
or other people.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.650
And once you do that, you can
create a website based on that.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.260
And we know that there are
four main types of personas.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.790
So there's logical, impulsive,
caring, and aggressive.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.330
So logical are
people that they're

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.399
looking for information.

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:50.940
So they want to know
everything there

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.516
is to know about the product.

00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:53.640
There are impulsive people.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.590
So if they see something
nice on the website,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.640
they will just buy right away.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.250
There's caring people, which
is people that care about what

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.800
other people say.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.810
And aggressive people
that they're just

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.490
looking for the best deal.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.300
So we know, for
example, that Apple

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.870
that they are in the
upper side of this chart.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.280
So they're very
logical, because they

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.720
provide you lots of information
about their products.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.290
And impulsive, because
they designed the website

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.670
so that people will
feel good about it,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.370
and they'll purchase something.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.460
And Amazon is on the
bottom of this chart, which

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.280
is they have ratings and
reviews, which people use

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.515
a lot to buy a product.

00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:34.515
And they're very aggressive
in terms of pricing.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.070
Now, if we talk
about data driven,

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.490
which is what we analysts
we do is analyzing the data

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.800
and trying to find patterns
that will give you information

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.380
to provide a better
experience to your visitors.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.490
So on Google Analytics, we
have the segment builder.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.620
So if I start seeing
that people coming

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.640
on Saturdays and from
the United States,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.382
they have a very
high conversion rate.

00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:07.340
And they're spending lots
of money on websites.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.220
So I should take this
segment and start

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.970
optimizing the website for them.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.000
So everyone that comes from
the United States on Saturdays

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.087
should get specific website,
personalized website.

00:10:22.087 --> 00:10:23.045
So that's segmentation.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.270
"I abhor averages."

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.550
So a person that eats six meals
one day and zero the next day

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.600
and a person that eats
three meals one day

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.160
and three the other day, they
both have a three meal average

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.890
a day.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.720
But of course, it's
not the same thing.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.909
And so never ever look
at the aggregate data.

00:10:44.909 --> 00:10:46.950
So every time that you
log into Google Analytics,

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.690
you should definitely look
into segments or your customers

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.312
so that you understand what
is good for each of them

00:10:54.312 --> 00:10:56.645
and what's bad for each of
them so that you can optimize

00:10:56.645 --> 00:11:03.000
the website, or personalize
the website for your visitors.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.040
Now, something that is really
important to Google Analytics

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.800
is context, right.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.760
So we have a way to
annotate the data.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.810
So we have this data.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.990
You can see a
spike on the chart.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.670
And what happened on that day?

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.290
So of course, if it was a week
ago, I can look for someone

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.080
and just find out what
happened last week

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.000
that we have this huge spike.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.850
So if I'm looking
at last year's data.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.160
So I won't know what happened
that day, especially,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.000
for example, if there was an
offline event, if you presented

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.760
on a big conference
or something.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.570
Of course, if it is there
was a post on TechCrunch

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.050
about the website, you
can find it on the data.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.410
Because you know people
are referring traffic

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.400
to your website.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.840
But if it was an
offline data, or maybe

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.560
there was a hosting problem.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.830
And not in this specific one,
but if you have a down day,

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:05.070
you could write, for example,
that the server was down.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.900
So those are things that
you can't see on the data.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.610
Now, another way to enrich
data, to provide context.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.160
So if I have this
website, Banana

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.080
Republic that I'm
selling clothes.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.030
And as you can see here,
they have a customer.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.990
By the way, default
implementation on Google

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.570
Analytics.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.990
You would see just
which page you're in

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.240
and what happened on this
page, how long people stayed

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.020
on that page, what was the
bounce rate of this page,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.370
and this kind of information.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.180
Now, there is a whole lot
more to learn about this page.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.850
And what Banana
Republic they have,

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.954
for example, they have
different types of models.

00:12:40.954 --> 00:12:43.120
So they have a white model,
they have a black model,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.830
and they have an Asian model.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.160
So there are three people.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.630
And then they have shirts where
the default is black and shirts

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.560
where the default is gray.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.670
And they have shirts for men,
shirts for women of course.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.920
And all kinds of information.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.150
Now, what we can do, we
can take this customer ID.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.330
And of course, I have this
customer ID in my database.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.240
And with all this current
data that I'm talking about.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.420
And now, what I can do,
I can upload this table

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.627
into Google Analytics.

00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:14.210
And then I'll have
all the information

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.830
available to make decisions.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.490
And then suddenly, I will
be able to answer questions.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.019
Like what's the conversion
rate of this model?

00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:22.685
What's the conversion
rate, for example,

00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:26.710
of pique shirts as
opposed to vintage shirts?

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.190
And should the default
be black or gray?

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.290
So I can start answering
more instant questions

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.050
based on website behavior
and the information

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.350
that I have on my database.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.290
So this is a very good
way to enrich data

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.190
in Google Analytics.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.610
And you can upload
also anything that you

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.150
have in your CRM
into Google Analytics

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.970
using dimension widening.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.790
So that's a very important
feature to keep in mind.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.390
Now, cost data upload.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.370
Some people for
some reason, they

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.660
use platforms other than Google.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.800
I don't understand why.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.420
I mean, everyone should be
using AdWords to advertise.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.980
But there are some people
that use other tools,

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.340
like Bing and Twitter and
Facebook and LinkedIn.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.970
So they advertise
on those tools.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:16.550
And it's very, very easy
to take your campaigns

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.240
so that you know when people
are coming to the website

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.870
through, for example, LinkedIn.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.500
So if you don't do that, it's
really important if you're

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.110
building marketing campaigns,
it should tag your links.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.610
So just look for
Google Analytics

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.650
campaign tagging on Google.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.110
But once you do that, and
it's a very easy step,

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.920
you will start learning what
kind of things people coming

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.640
from LinkedIn, for example,
they're doing on the website.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.830
So how many people
came to the website?

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:44.917
What was the bounce rate?

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.500
How long did they
stay on the website?

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.690
How much did they
buy on the website?

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.950
What was the revenue
of this campaign?

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.300
Now there is one very
important thing missing,

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.670
which is how much does it cost?

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.322
Because if I don't
know how much it costs,

00:15:00.322 --> 00:15:02.990
it dropped 50,000
pounds in revenue.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.220
But if it cost
100,000 pounds, it's

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.270
different from if it
costs 5,000 pounds.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.570
So what we have on
Google Analytics now

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.280
is called cost data upload.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.390
So you can upload
your cost data.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.890
That's exactly what you can do.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.180
So you just upload the
table into Google Analytics

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.260
that can enrich your campaign.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.750
So it gives you context
on your marketing efforts.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.170
So it's really important
to change Google Analytics

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:35.430
into a marketing optimization
tool for all campaigns.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.090
And just to mention,
of course, we

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.410
have integration
with Google AdWords.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.490
So that would be different.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.960
You don't have to
upload anything.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.062
Now the last one, sharing.

00:15:47.062 --> 00:15:48.145
Because sharing is caring.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.980
So we just published a blog
post on big black smoke

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.900
with a few things at the can
share on Google Analytics

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.357
and I think it's there.

00:16:03.357 --> 00:16:05.940
That's something that we believe
it's really, really important

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.660
is to share data
with your colleagues.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.010
Because each person
has a perspective.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.070
Each person knows something
about the company.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.570
And it's really important
that everyone sees the data

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.370
and knows what's happening.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.540
So we have a few things.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.210
I'm going through all of them.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:27.420
And then I won't get too
deep into any of them.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.220
So first one segments, as
I mentioned previously,

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.650
the segment builder.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.930
You can build segments.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.300
So if you have, for example, you
build a segment of people that

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.950
came to the website,
added something to a cart,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.850
and then left the website,
and came back to the website,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.256
you can build multiple
visit segments.

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.130
And then you have
something really important,

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:53.440
because you're building a
segment that means something

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.630
to people in your company.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.940
So you can share this
segment with your colleagues

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.220
to just send them a link.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.530
And then they will see that
on there Google Analytics

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.630
account as well.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.849
Second one's dashboards.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.160
So if you build
a nice dashboard,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.160
you want to share with your
manager or your colleagues

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.339
so that they see the
same data, they're

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:17.490
tracking the same data as you
on a daily basis, hopefully

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.040
a weekly basis.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.089
And third one's custom reports.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.859
So you can build in Google
Analytics custom reports.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.180
So if you have
this table that you

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.251
can choose the
dimensions that you want

00:17:29.251 --> 00:17:31.000
and then the metrics
that you want to see,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.320
those that are important to you.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.090
And you can share
these so that people

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.760
look at the same numbers as you.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.500
Goals.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.890
So when you have multiple
views in your Google Analytics

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:47.040
account, you can share
goals so that you

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.700
have the same goal defined
in each of your views.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.540
So that's a very
important thing as well.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.450
Now, custom channel
groupings is something

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.062
that you see on the
multi-channel funnels.

00:18:00.062 --> 00:18:01.520
So you can see on
Google Analytics,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.000
for example, that when
people came to the website

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.280
multiple times
before conversion.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.120
So for example, they
came through social, then

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.010
through organic, and then
through a paid campaign,

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.550
you can see all the
steps that draw people

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.570
until they converted.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.390
And what you can do with
custom channel groupings is,

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.360
for example, you have
different websites

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.570
that you want to group them into
specific campaign, for example.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.770
So you could use channel
groupings to do that.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.240
And then you can share with
your colleagues as well for them

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.020
to see the same data
that you're seeing.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.600
An attribution
models is something

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.730
that I'm not going to talk too
much about attribution models.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.640
It's a subject by itself.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.450
But basically, attribution
is about giving credit

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.590
to campaigns that brought
people to your website.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:01.180
So basically, if you
advertise something and then

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.580
people come to the website,
and they come back again

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.955
in a few weeks using
Google organic.

00:19:06.955 --> 00:19:08.580
And then in a few
weeks they come again

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.260
using an email that
you send to them,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.280
then you can use attribution
to provide credit

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.090
to each of those source that
brought people to the website.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.250
And you can create a
custom attribution model

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:30.630
that you can use based on what
you know about your visitors,

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:36.500
and how each campaign
added to a conversion.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.610
So some take aways.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.950
First of all, create a process.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.650
So create something that
works for a company.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.090
There are multiple models.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:54.160
And you can find on Google
search, multiple models

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.290
that you can use
for web analytics.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.060
Look at trends.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.460
Don't look at data points.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.800
So when you look at the data,
always look at at least one

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.220
of the rules of
thumb that I like

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.900
is looking at least
for-- first of all

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.640
looking in weekly periods.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.670
Because sometimes, there's
a very big difference

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.400
between middle of the
week and end of the week.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.590
So always to look at weeks.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.620
And I like the rule
as well that look

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.990
at four plus one, which means
a little bit more than a month,

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.610
or a little bit
more than a year.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.610
So 13 months or five weeks.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.700
Segment your customers.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.660
First, there are multiple ways
to do that on Google Analytics.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.850
And you can create views.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.270
You can create
custom dimensions.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.050
You can build the segments.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.690
So there are multiple ways.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.310
And try to segment
every time that you

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.590
log into Google Analytics.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.600
Then enrich your data.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.854
So I mentioned Google
Analytics annotations,

00:21:00.854 --> 00:21:02.770
dimension widening, and
of course data upload.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.120
Those are three ways
that you can enrich data

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.920
so that it will have more
context for you to analyze.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.710
And sharing is caring.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.800
It's really important to share
the data with your colleagues

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.300
so that everyone
in the organization

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.880
knows-- the startup--
knows about what's going on

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.370
with the data, how is the
company going, and-- thank you.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.670
And happy analyzing.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.864
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:30.864 --> 00:21:32.030
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:32.240
DANIEL WAISBERG: Yes.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.270
AUDIENCE: Does anyone
have questions?
