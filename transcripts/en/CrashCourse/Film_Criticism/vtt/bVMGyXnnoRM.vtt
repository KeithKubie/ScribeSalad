00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.210
There are war movies, and then there’s Apocalypse
Now.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.690
In the late 1970s, Francis Ford Coppola hauled
a film crew into the jungles of the Philippines

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.910
and barely emerged with his sanity intact.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.330
And, he emerged with a film that – after
two years of work in the editing room – is

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.429
as much about one soldier’s journey into
his own mind, as it is about the American

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:22.529
war in Vietnam.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.589
It’s an ambitious film that, on its face,
shouldn’t work.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.280
And yet it does, on so many levels.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:41.960
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.800
Director Francis Ford Coppola was riding a

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.290
wave of success when he went off into the
jungle to make Apocalypse Now.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.600
Over the previous seven years he’d made
three bona fide classics: The Godfather, The

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.670
Conversation, and The Godfather: Part II.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.860
He’d proven he could tell intensely personal
stories with the scope and scale of myths.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.160
His fascination with rituals, his daring camerawork,
and his ability to put viewers into the heads

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.530
of his characters had made him very successful.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.500
Critically, commercially, and artistically.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.340
As the 1970s drew to a close, the major Hollywood
studios were being gobbled up by multinational

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.340
corporations.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.090
So executives were becoming more hesitant
to gamble on the personal, ambitious visions

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.271
of filmmakers like William Friedkin, Martin
Scorsese, and especially Francis Ford Coppola.

00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:26.649
Nevertheless, Coppola leveraged all the clout
he had, threw in a bunch of his own money,

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.930
and headed off to the Philippines to make
his dream film.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.899
He planned to use the Joseph Conrad novella
Heart of Darkness as the basis for a story

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.820
about the American war in Vietnam.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.810
Conrad’s book follows its narrator Charles
Marlow up the Congo River in search of an

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.680
enigmatic ivory trader named Kurtz.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.660
It’s the tale of Marlow’s growing obsession
with Kurtz, as well as a broader critique

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.549
of colonialism, and especially British imperialism.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.770
In Apocalypse Now, an American Army captain
named Willard is dispatched by a shadowy group

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.320
of senior military officers (including Harrison Ford)to find a Colonel Kurtz and kill him.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.009
Kurtz, we’re told, has gone insane.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.240
He’s surrounded himself with an army of
Montagnard troops and fled

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240
upriver into Cambodia.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.210
When we first meet Willard, played by Martin
Sheen, he’s suffering some kind of post-traumatic

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.720
stress dream in a Saigon hotel.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.610
It’s a stunning opening – dissolving from
a lush jungle ravaged by napalm, to thumping

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.010
military helicopters, to Willard’s violent
outbursts in the hotel – all scored to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.120
“The End” by the Doors.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.010
This reveals Willard’s damaged psyche, but
also what caused it: the horrors of war.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.700
Then, Willard begins his journey upriver,
traveling on a Navy patrol boat manned by

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700
a motley crew.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.140
There’s the earnest captain known as Chief,
played by Albert Hall.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.870
Sam Bottoms plays the California surf dude
Lance.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.940
Chef, played by Frederic Forrest, is a saucier
from New Orleans who gets wound tighter as

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.940
the film continues.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.319
And a baby-faced Lawrence Fishburne plays
Clean, the youngest member of the crew.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.110
Together, these guys ferry Willard deeper
into Vietnam, encountering everything from

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.330
a USO show starring Playboy Playmates to a
surf-loving, Wagner-playing Air Cavalry officer

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.120
played with gusto by Robert Duvall.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.640
Killgore: If I say it's safe to surf this beach, Captain... It's safe to surf this beach!!!

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.500
The sights and sounds of their voyage grow
increasingly absurd.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.750
And the ship’s crew becomes more unbalanced,
as they all look for ways to cope with the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.000
madness of war.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.360
When they finally reach Kurtz’s compound,
they discover macabre temples decorated with

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.750
hanging corpses, heads on spikes, and thousands
of silent Montagnard warriors in white paint.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.480
With them is a manic American photojournalist
played by Dennis Hopper who warns Willard

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.520
that Kurtz has plans for him.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.720
Photojournalist: He's got something in mind for you. Aren't you curious about that?

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.360
Kurtz himself, played by Marlon Brando, remains
an enigma right to the end.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.099
Part warrior, part philosopher, and part tormented
soul, he’s mostly kept in shadows, looming

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.040
over Willard.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.840
Kurtz: Are my methods unsound?

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.120
Willard: I don't see... any method... at all, sir.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.480
Kurtz beheads Chef before he can call in an
airstrike, but keeps Willard alive, reading

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.970
him poetry and attempting to justify his actions
in whispered monologues.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.299
Eventually, Willard decides to take action.

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.340
And as the Montagnards slaughter a water buffalo
in an elaborate ceremony, Willard uses the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.270
same kind of machete to kill Kurtz.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.190
Willard then emerges from the temple to face
the warriors, who kneel before him as he takes

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.680
Lance by the arm and pulls him back to the
boat.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.420
THE END!

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.350
Now, the production of Apocalypse Now was
in serious trouble from the start.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.060
Coppola was behind schedule and over budget
almost immediately.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.690
He fired his lead actor within the first months
of filming.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.110
And the replacement, Martin Sheen, was in
the midst of his own alcoholic breakdown

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.110
at the time.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.790
Not to mention, he suffered a heart attack
in the middle of the shoot.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.910
The crew, who was scrambling to keep up with
Coppola rewriting the movie as it was being

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.870
shot, returned to the hotel each night for
drug-fueled parties.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.220
Much of the military hardware used in the
film, including the helicopters of the Air

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.300
Cavalry Unit, were on loan from the Filipino
military.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.010
More than once, the real army needed them
back to fight their own war.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.990
And partway through production, a typhoon
struck and wiped out nearly all of the sets

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.990
and equipment.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.760
The stress of it all became so intense that
Coppola threatened to commit suicide more

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.400
than once and even suffered an epileptic seizure.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.550
You know, just your average film shoot…

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.550
Except not.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.550
It wasn’t.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.550
Like, at all.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.581
In the end, Coppola shot an unprecedented
one-and-a-half million feet of film, which

00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:24.820
comes out to about 240 hours of footage.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.430
It took a team of four editors more than two
years of work to cut the film together, tear

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.280
it apart, and reconstruct it.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.160
War journalist Michael Herr was brought in
to co-write Willard’s terse voice over after

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.680
test audiences couldn’t understand the story.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.130
But, after all that, the film finally debuted
at the Cannes Film Festival – a year late

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.190
– and took home the top prize, the Palme
d’Or.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.770
Apocalypse Now is a movie that emerged out
of a really complicated production process.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.120
And it’s not a film that’s going to be
satisfied with a single interpretation.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.390
One way to look at films is through the lens
of genre.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.990
And the most obvious way to think about Apocalypse
Now is as a war movie.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.530
But what if we look a little deeper?

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.400
American scholar B. Ruby Rich makes a compelling
case that Coppola’s film actually moves

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.660
through several different genres as it unfolds.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.990
She sees the first part of the film as a western.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.680
Willard is our silent, stoic white man, venturing
into the wilderness because so-called civilized

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.650
superiors don’t want to get their hands
dirty.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.320
Rich writes, “There remaining no frontier
for today’s cowboys in the USA, men like

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.870
Kilgore must turn instead to Vietnam...

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.960
The eastern bankers and railroad tycoons of
yore become here military brass, those shrimp-eating

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.710
creatures far from [the] action.”

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.240
In place of Native American warriors fighting
to protect their homeland, the American soldiers

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.620
in Coppola’s film do battle with a largely
faceless North Vietnamese army.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.620
The military fights with machine guns and
napalm, rather than rifles and small pox,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.190
but the game plan is the same: slaughter the
dehumanized enemy and take their land.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.490
This first part of the film even culminates
in an actual cavalry charge, led by Robert

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.680
Duvall’s Kilgore character in his ten-gallon
hat.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.160
It’s even complete with a real life bugle
call.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.470
Rich identifies the second section as a traditional
war film.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.150
And it’s during this section that Willard
fires his only gunshot of the whole movie.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.220
The patrol crew pulls over a passing Vietnamese
sampan, a flat-bottomed wooden boat.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.040
In a tense stand off, Chief orders Chef to
board the boat to inspect its cargo.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.040
Chef: There's nothing on it, man!
Chief: Get on it!

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.250
Chef: Alright!!!

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.880
Chef finds no contraband, but the stress of
the encounter starts to break him.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.680
The confrontation escalates until a Vietnamese
woman rushes toward Chef.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.220
Before it’s clear she’s only worried about
a puppy hidden in a basket, Clean opens fire.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.970
The high-strung Americans spray the boat with
bullets, killing most of the Vietnamese crew,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.520
and leaving the woman barely alive.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.470
Chief orders her to be brought aboard and
sets a course for the nearest field hospital,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:53.660
when Willard fires a single shot with his
pistol, killing her.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.050
He shows no emotion other than annoyance.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.050
His mission is Kurtz, and everything else
is a distraction.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.580
Rich identifies this as a central turning
point for Willard’s character:

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.080
“Fed up with a code of honor that could
massacre a boat and then feed on its remorse,

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.650
Willard remarks [in voice over] that ... in
this moment … he has begun to feel close

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.610
to the mysterious Kurtz whose fate lies in
his hands.”

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.480
In this scene, Coppola also abandons the special
effects, the darkly funny absurdist touches,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.280
and the rock-and-roll songs that play under
much of the action.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.380
Instead, he presents war in direct, unsentimental
terms.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.640
As senseless, barbaric, and arbitrary.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.240
These soldiers aren’t portrayed as heroic,
like in some war movies.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.820
Instead, they’re weary – losing hope,
mental stability, and, in many cases, their

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.820
lives.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.100
But that’s just one way to view the film.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.160
Seen through a psychoanalytic lens, Apocalypse
Now is the story of one man’s journey into

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.980
the depths of his own troubled mind, a mind
ravaged by war.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.221
In this reading, the opening of the film dissolves
the boundaries between time and space, as

00:08:50.221 --> 00:08:52.320
seen from Willard’s damaged point of view.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.260
As writer Maruerite Valentine puts it, “Willard’s
mind … has lost all capacity to differentiate

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.160
between the inside of his head, and the external
– the room, the hotel, Saigon.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.890
Fantasy and reality have become one.”

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.130
The other characters Willard encounters on
his trip up the river, then, can be read as

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.850
reflections of himself.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.900
The boat crew might represent other coping
strategies he’s tried while in the military,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.840
while Kilgore could be a projection of his
war-loving feelings.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.440
Even the commanding officers who send him
on the mission display the same calculated

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.590
dispassion that Willard shows through the
film.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.320
Which means Kurtz could be a reflection of
Willard’s psyche too.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.780
Kurtz is depicted in mostly darkness, as if
seeing him fully would be too much for Willard

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.780
to handle.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.070
And he speaks in whispered, fragmented monologues
with unclear meanings.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.240
In a way, he’s what Willard could – and
maybe does – become: pure ruthlessness,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.200
entirely untroubled by morality.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.630
This way of looking at a film is fairly common,
especially in the Slasher genre.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.910
The prolific horror director Wes Craven once
posited,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.680
“...I even think the characters that are
around the hero are elements of an uber personality.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.630
And in this sense it’s like a Folk Tale
that says,

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.620
‘Okay, the part of you that’s going to
have sex when something really dangerous is

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.620
around?

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.620
That part is gonna be killed off…’”

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.020
Apocalypse Now’s ending has always divided
critics, some of whom believe the movie loses

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.290
its way in the last half hour.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.230
But if we take this psychoanalytic reading
to its logical conclusion, the climax makes

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.230
sense.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.910
When Willard gets to the end of his mission,
he recognizes himself in Kurtz, and he isn’t

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.440
sure he can go through with the kill.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.610
That hesitance doesn’t make much sense in
a western, a war movie, or even a myth.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.970
But if the story is of a man trying to root
out his worst impulses, to slay the dark,

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.910
powerful dragon in his own mind, the final
moments of the movie fit.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.310
Because how do you destroy a piece of yourself,
however terrifying it might be?

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.950
As he’s dying, Kurtz utters his famous last
words.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:42.280
Kurtz: The horror… the horror…

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.090
But maybe he’s not talking about the horrors
of Vietnam, or even his own death.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:51.000
Instead, maybe he’s speaking as part of
a deeply troubled mind at war with itself,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.030
fractured by his particular experience of
post traumatic stress.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.870
Whether you choose to read Apocalypse Now
as an exercise in multi-genre filmmaking,

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.051
a journey into a damaged mind, or through
some other lens, one thing is clear: This

00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:04.280
is a film that invites multiple interpretations.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.530
It’s a bold, messy masterpiece that nearly
broke its crew, star, and director.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.760
And it remains as relevant today as it did
the day it was released...sadly.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.060
Next time, we’ll trade the jungle of Vietnam
for the Spanish countryside as a little girl

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.220
unlocks a fantasy world that just might help
her escape the brutal aftermath of the Spanish

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.430
Civil War in Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s
Labyrinth.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.550
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
