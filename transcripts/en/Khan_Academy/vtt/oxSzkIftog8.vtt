00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
- Let's do an example

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.544
on the performing translations exercise.

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:07.121
Use the translate tool to find the image

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:10.940
of triangle W I N for a
translation of six units,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.680
positive six units, in the X direction

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.180
and negative three units
in the Y direction.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.174
Alright, so we wanna go positive six units

00:00:18.174 --> 00:00:20.809
in the X direction and
negative three units

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:22.322
in the Y direction, alright.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.085
So, I click on the translate tool.

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:28.185
Click on the translate
tool and I wanna go,

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:31.751
so, I wanna go positive six
units in the X direction.

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:34.055
So, I can pick any point
and go six to the right

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:36.017
and everything else is gonna come with it.

00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:41.017
So, one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.097
So, I did that part, I
translated positive six units

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:47.593
in the X direction and
negative three units

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:50.890
in the Y direction, so everything
needs to go down by three.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.650
One, two, three and notice,
I focused on point N

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.691
and this is it's image now,
or the image of point N,

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.698
this whole triangle is the
image of this entire triangle,

00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:05.258
the triangle W I N after
the transformation,

00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:08.982
but you see that every point
shifted six to the right,

00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:10.629
six to the right and three down.

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:13.130
This point over here, six
to the right would take you,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.688
let's see, it's at one
and a half right now.

00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:17.220
It's X coordinate is one and a half.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.285
It's new X coordinate is seven and a half,

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:21.414
so it's X coordinate increased by six

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.867
and it's old Y coordinate,
or the original Y coordinate

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:25.828
was six and now, in the image,

00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:28.300
the corresponding Y coordinate is three.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.261
So, it has, we have shifted it down three.

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:34.773
So, we see that that's
happened to every point here

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:36.084
and we're done.
