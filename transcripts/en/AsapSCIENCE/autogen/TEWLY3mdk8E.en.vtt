00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Have you ever participated in a controversy where you were right? 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Despite all your eloquent arguments 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 The facts are supportive of you, but you have not been able to convince anyone. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Is it an effective way 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 To impress someone and change his mind? 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 First and foremost inhibitors, which you should accept 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Is that these facts do not convince people, especially if they are convinced of another opinion in advance. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 All of us wish to believe that 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Any information or reliable study will convince us in any discussion 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 However, successive studies show that some of the facts are incompatible with our beliefs 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Makes our brains happy to ignore those facts or to simply dismiss them 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 In one study, scientists asked people whether they thought humans were responsible for climate change 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 They then categorized them as supporters and deniers. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 They then told some of them that the scientists had reviewed the data and found that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Future predictions are much worse than before 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 While others were told that the situation was not as bad as we expected. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 However, these facts had important implications for their beliefs. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 People who do not believe in climate change are told that the situation could get worse 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 They completely ignored these facts and their views were not affected. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 If they were told that the situation was not as bad as expected 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Their beliefs tend more towards this perception. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 The same goes for those who believe in climate change. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 If they are told that things will get worse 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 They held more to their belief, 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 If they are told that they will not go wrong, they will not change their minds at all. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Facts make people more polarized. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 It is clear that people's views and impressions can not change once they are formed. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 As cognitive scientists say. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 The whole thing is related to our human capabilities to cooperate among us, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 A skill that is not enjoyed by any other living being 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 To the extent that human beings have been practicing since ancient fishing and picking up to agriculture and modern computers. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Our cooperation allows us to rely on each other's experiences instead of verifying everything 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 It is therefore difficult to determine where our own perception ends so that another realization begins. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Beliefs are not fundamentally rooted in our deep awareness of the truth. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 This is known as (the depth of interpretation). 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 If you are asked to evaluate your understanding of something as a water cycle 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Or fasteners, or computer probabilities 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Your conviction that you know about her is much more than you already know. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Come on, try to explain step-by-step and detail the functions of the water cycle or cloud, for example. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Sometimes this simply reveals to us the lack of opinion and opinions of others to any basis of health. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 In one study, when participants were asked to assess their public policies 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Such as health care, and were later asked to explain it as far as possible 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 And the impact of their application 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 They were quick to soften their beliefs 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Because they were prone to ignorance. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 How can we overcome these tendencies and convince others in a debate? 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 There seems to be a need to focus on common motivation 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 According to the world of cognitive perception Tali Sharot 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 That is, focusing on common motives and the things we agree on 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 In one study on parents' fears of vaccinating their children 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 For fear of autism 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 I have come to know the facts 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Which says that science has shown that there is no relationship between the two, but they do not listen to it. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 But when they focused on the common goal of protecting their children 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 The protective purpose of the vaccinations was clear 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 To avoid diseases such as measles, scoliosis, polio, and tetanus 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 And how these diseases affect children without autism 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Were more likely to vaccinate their children later. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Finally, human beings are known to have biases called internal association biases and external association biases 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 We tend to be strangers, or different people from what we are 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 This is reflected in images such as race, religion, form, and gender. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 It also comes in the form of ideas and therefore people who disagree with you in your thoughts 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Belong to your external group. Studies have also been conducted showing that 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 If you can communicate with others in any way and make them see you in a different picture 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And prepare you as part of their own group, they will be more eager to listen to you 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 The opposite is true if you do not look like them. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Find the group you belong to and belong to you and use this feature as your own hub 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Now, if you want to put your opinions to the test, or become more aware of opinions contrary to your opinion 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 All you have to do is search for a company, 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 A wonderful new company that loves me, uses automated learning techniques 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 To send you things you love but with the trick of sending other purposes 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 It will push you out of your selective bubble 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 It's a nice way to check you out, analyze your interests, your questions, your photos, and your video clips 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And then you have to flex your mental muscles 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 With some purposes that are not normally within your holdings. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 It is a very good way to try to see the world at a wider angle 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
