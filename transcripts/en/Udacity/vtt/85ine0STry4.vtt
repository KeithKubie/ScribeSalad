Thanks Susan. Now, Andy, would you mind telling me and the viewers at home a

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:04.612
little more about this event.

00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:08.710
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Lauren, that's a great question. So, at its core what we have here is a weight

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.068
difference threshold competition. What that means is, let's say I took these

00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:16.899
two mugs, they're identical, they have the same weight. So, if I gave them to

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:18.978
you right now, what would they feel like?

00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:20.302
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The same!

00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:23.455
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. And what if instead, I put a gram of water into one of these mugs, and

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:27.270
you're blindfolded, remember. Could you tell the difference?

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.020
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't think so, it's just one gram of water.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.750
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But if there was, let's say 100 grams of water?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.253
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I think I'd be able to tell the difference between 100 grams of water.

00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:39.155
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You probably would. So the question is, where is that threshold? At what point

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:42.270
can you tell the difference in weight?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.036
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How exactly are they going to measure this though?

00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:47.568
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, what we're going to be doing is making a lot of comparisons. We're going to

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:51.078
have our 100 gram reference weight and our atheletes are going to be comparing

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:54.318
that to 101 grams and then a 102 grams, and for each of these comparisons,

00:00:54.318 --> 00:00:59.010
they'll identify, or try to identify which is heavier.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.738
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's fascinating, Andy.
