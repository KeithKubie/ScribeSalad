00:44:05.239 --> 00:44:05.249
call it but they probably wouldn't be
 

00:44:05.249 --> 00:44:07.969
call it but they probably wouldn't be
mirror images each other and that that

00:44:07.969 --> 00:44:07.979
mirror images each other and that that
 

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:09.529
mirror images each other and that that
would be the interesting dialogue to

00:44:09.529 --> 00:44:09.539
would be the interesting dialogue to
 

00:44:09.539 --> 00:44:13.309
would be the interesting dialogue to
take a document like this and then think

00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319
take a document like this and then think
 

00:44:13.319 --> 00:44:15.499
take a document like this and then think
about other players in the world and how

00:44:15.499 --> 00:44:15.509
about other players in the world and how
 

00:44:15.509 --> 00:44:17.779
about other players in the world and how
they would describe that I bet they're

00:44:17.779 --> 00:44:17.789
they would describe that I bet they're
 

00:44:17.789 --> 00:44:20.239
they would describe that I bet they're
far apart but perhaps that's the

00:44:20.239 --> 00:44:20.249
far apart but perhaps that's the
 

00:44:20.249 --> 00:44:22.639
far apart but perhaps that's the
necessary steps to overall understanding

00:44:22.639 --> 00:44:22.649
necessary steps to overall understanding
 

00:44:22.649 --> 00:44:24.859
necessary steps to overall understanding
so forgive me for not going down to the

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:24.869
so forgive me for not going down to the
 

00:44:24.869 --> 00:44:27.109
so forgive me for not going down to the
exact details but time is short and I

00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119
exact details but time is short and I
 

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:28.880
exact details but time is short and I
thought this overall perspective might

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:28.890
thought this overall perspective might
 

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:36.109
thought this overall perspective might
be of some value to you thank you yeah I

00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119
be of some value to you thank you yeah I
 

00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:39.229
be of some value to you thank you yeah I
open with a just one or two questions of

00:44:39.229 --> 00:44:39.239
open with a just one or two questions of
 

00:44:39.239 --> 00:44:43.299
open with a just one or two questions of
my own and then go on because I also was

other serious question is also that I

were also empires so there was hierarchy

00:45:44.029 --> 00:45:44.039

pluralistic meant there was never one so
 

00:45:54.869 --> 00:45:56.989
pluralistic meant there was never one so
I mean what's not new is that there are

00:45:56.989 --> 00:45:56.999
I mean what's not new is that there are
 

00:45:56.999 --> 00:45:59.589
I mean what's not new is that there are
states that are not democracies an init

so we discovered it wasn't so I think

the question is is that it's important

the question is is that it's important

there's not much issue about

there's not much issue about
post-colonial stuff but but I I wonder

post-colonial stuff but but I I wonder

post-colonial stuff but but I I wonder
if the meaning and the validity of

all of this when actually something else

all of this when actually something else
was going on so I just I just suspect

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:16.360
was going on so I just I just suspect
 

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:20.750
was going on so I just I just suspect
that this sort of that that the question

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760
that this sort of that that the question

that this sort of that that the question
yeah we're in a post Western world that

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:23.850
yeah we're in a post Western world that

but that simply means that it could

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720
but that simply means that it could
 

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.500
but that simply means that it could
simply mean that once British and then

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:31.510
simply mean that once British and then
 

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.260
simply mean that once British and then
American hegemony is over and so the

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:34.270
American hegemony is over and so the
 

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:36.660
American hegemony is over and so the
question is is is how to understand what

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:36.670

supposed to do now I guess I'll just
 

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.090
supposed to do now I guess I'll just
leave it and ask and so that's for

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:45.100
leave it and ask and so that's for
 

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.070
leave it and ask and so that's for

to the maritime routes and then you look
 

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.420
to the maritime routes and then you look
at the nine dash lines basically that

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:03.430
at the nine dash lines basically that
 

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:05.069

an insecure power and that is always a

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:37.630
an insecure power and that is always a
 

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:39.660
