life-changing experience through the
 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.319
life-changing experience through the
best class that I ever had it was a

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329
best class that I ever had it was a
 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.899
best class that I ever had it was a
class called nutrition ecology and I bet

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909
class called nutrition ecology and I bet
 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.250
class called nutrition ecology and I bet
that most of you out there are not

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260
that most of you out there are not
 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.470

familiar at all with this concept and in

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
familiar at all with this concept and in
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.059
familiar at all with this concept and in
fact nutrition scientists are not

familiar with this concept I learned a

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170
familiar with this concept I learned a
 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.080
familiar with this concept I learned a
bit from not surprisingly from an

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
bit from not surprisingly from an
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.559
bit from not surprisingly from an

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.920
ecologist this was in 1995 the concept
was coined in 1980s and she had been

was coined in 1980s and she had been
 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.490
was coined in 1980s and she had been
talking about it of course since 1960s

when it comes to what you eat it is not
 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.589
when it comes to what you eat it is not
just about you and of course the word

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599
just about you and of course the word
 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.559
just about you and of course the word
new is in quotes because it is not a new

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569
new is in quotes because it is not a new
 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.809

concept at all as you just heard however

it's slowly beginning to take hold as we

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310
it's slowly beginning to take hold as we
 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.379
it's slowly beginning to take hold as we
know because I think you might have

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389
know because I think you might have
 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.909

heard already today from some my

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919
heard already today from some my
 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.770
heard already today from some my
colleagues that people are increasingly

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449
thinking about the environmental aspect
 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.720
thinking about the environmental aspect
of why what we eat matters in addition

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730
of why what we eat matters in addition
 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.640
of why what we eat matters in addition
to of course many of the other public

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650
to of course many of the other public
 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.430

health and influences of why what we eat

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440
health and influences of why what we eat
 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.129
health and influences of why what we eat
matters so then I'm go went on to focus

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139
matters so then I'm go went on to focus
 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.140
matters so then I'm go went on to focus
on health in addition to my love of food

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150
on health in addition to my love of food
 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.719
on health in addition to my love of food
and cooking I also did grow up and very

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729
and cooking I also did grow up and very
 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.459

much interested in health so of course

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:23.469
much interested in health so of course
 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:25.380

I decided to focus my training on
 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.140
I decided to focus my training on
obesity because as you all know in this

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150
obesity because as you all know in this
 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.980

room it is an epidemic proportions and

that was increasingly recognized

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639
that was increasingly recognized
 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.030

so I knew that I wanted to get dedicate
 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.379
so I knew that I wanted to get dedicate
my time there because of course obesity

I came to Harvard there were colleagues
 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.490
I came to Harvard there were colleagues
there who were starting to think about

there who were starting to think about
 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.820
there who were starting to think about
the concept of dietary patterns so let's

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830
the concept of dietary patterns so let's
 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.800
the concept of dietary patterns so let's
go to that action I'm gonna go back for

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810
go to that action I'm gonna go back for
 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.970
go to that action I'm gonna go back for
a moment before I get to that slide

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980
a moment before I get to that slide
 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.430
a moment before I get to that slide
dietary patterns are sort of as they

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440
dietary patterns are sort of as they
 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.650
dietary patterns are sort of as they
sound it's looking at the complete diet

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660
sound it's looking at the complete diet
 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.450
sound it's looking at the complete diet
rather than just single nutrients or

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460
rather than just single nutrients or
 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.660
rather than just single nutrients or
single foods so it was a very exciting

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670
single foods so it was a very exciting
 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.730
single foods so it was a very exciting
time and I was pleased to learn from

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740
time and I was pleased to learn from
 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.010
time and I was pleased to learn from
colleagues and since that time it has

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020
colleagues and since that time it has
 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.560
colleagues and since that time it has
really taken off I still study obesity

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570
really taken off I still study obesity
 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.270
really taken off I still study obesity
and other chronic diseases but I've

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280
and other chronic diseases but I've
 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.490
and other chronic diseases but I've
spent much of my career developing these

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500
spent much of my career developing these
 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.250
spent much of my career developing these
dietary pattern methods and they really

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260
dietary pattern methods and they really
 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.080
dietary pattern methods and they really
started to take off in the 1990s and

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090

so harkening back a little bit to

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.030
so harkening back a little bit to
 

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.210
so harkening back a little bit to
nutrition ecology but this is how risk

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:40.220
nutrition ecology but this is how risk

works as well so in fact diet is part of

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:43.160
works as well so in fact diet is part of
 

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.370
works as well so in fact diet is part of

this whole host of factors that together
intersect and in turn acts dynamically

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160
intersect and in turn acts dynamically

now so I take dietary patterns and I

used system sciences to look at overall

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160
used system sciences to look at overall
 

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.850
used system sciences to look at overall
risk and development of obesity so these

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:12.860
risk and development of obesity so these
 

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.400

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.470
environmental and agricultural sciences
have shown that that very same diet is

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480
have shown that that very same diet is
 

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.750

where does that leave us well in closing

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:08.270
where does that leave us well in closing
