00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:04.203
Opposers, I work very hard
preparing this show.

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:05.571
I think it shows.

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.707
But like any elite athletes,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.475
I need a break
every now and then.

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:11.778
So I'm going to take this time
to catch up

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.148
on some of my relaxing
court mandated art therapy--

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.582
painting--

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:18.584
and I'm going to respond
to some calls

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:19.886
from loyal Opposers.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.322
Now, these have been gathered
by my crew,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.358
and I have not had a chance
to listen to them

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:26.692
until this very moment,

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:29.362
but I'm sure they've all been
screened for profanity

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:32.498
and this segment
will be a total success, so...

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:35.068
Chuck, let's fire up
the first call, shall we?

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.303
-(phone beeps)
-MAN: Uh, yes, hello, Jordan.

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.972
-Hello.
-This is Neil from Miami.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.508
I got into a fight recently
with my dad,

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.744
who says you're
a conspiracy theorist.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.679
And I think you're not one,

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:49.615
and now I'm never gonna speak
to him again.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.318
So how do you deal
with situations like this

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.253
-when you disagree with your
family members? -Neil...

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.421
Neil, great question.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.557
First of all,
I am not a conspiracy theorist.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.525
Secondly, are you sure
that's your dad?

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.561
(laughter and applause)

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:06.032
Just 'cause even just
from the tenor of your voice,

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.667
I feel like
there's something amiss,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.170
and something that most fathers
should have inside

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:13.539
is complete love and affection

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.742
and care and trust
in their child.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.377
If that's something
you don't get

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.346
when you're small
and growing up,

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.248
it can lead to some cracks
in your life

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.784
that you have to spackle over

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.954
with things like fear
and anger and bullshit.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.188
And you wouldn't wish that
on anybody

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:31.858
'cause it could turn them
into a (bleep) monster.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.860
(laughter)

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:37.563
I'm saying maybe just talk
to your dad a little more.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.899
Let's get back to this painting.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:41.400
Chuck, give me another call.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:42.835
-(phone beeps)
-Hey, Jordan. This is Charlie

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:43.870
-from Bristol, Rhode Island.
-Okay.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.104
I got to say,
I was just on vacation.

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:46.606
I had this sandwich-- a falafel.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:47.940
Have you had this thing?
It was hot,

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:49.342
it was crispy, it was delicious.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.943
And I got to say, I'm worried,

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.845
'cause if this thing
makes it over to our shores

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:55.948
across the oceans and whatnot,
this thing could take over.

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.750
You know, like-like a plague.

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.952
And I'm sort of worried
about hot dogs

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:02.021
and what's gonna happen to them,
because I love those,

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.123
and I don't want
to see them-them go away,

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.725
but I can't get this taste
out of my brain.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.461
So, uh, you know, I'd love
to hear what you've got to say.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:09.729
It was probably a BLT.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.831
Next call.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:15.368
-(phone beeps) -Yeah, Jordan,
this is Chelsea from Cleveland,

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.569
and I was just wondering

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:19.472
what the worst state is
in our country.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.641
I mean,
I would say probably Canada,

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.809
but I'm open to your opinion.

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.612
I mean, California,
New York City--

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:28.014
what's the worst one?

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.815
Yeah. The worst state?

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.852
Denial.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.488
And no, it's not just
a river in Sudan.

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.323
(scoffs)

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.325
(laughter and applause)

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.894
All I can tell you
is wake up and understand

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:44.697
the worst state is New York
combined with California.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.165
Next call.

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:47.867
-(phone beeps)
-WOMAN: Hey, Jordan.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.538
-Yeah. -It is Mary
from Morgan Hill, California,

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:55.675
Bay Area strong, and I had a...

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.376
Like, what is this Russia thing?

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.645
Like, am I supposed
to love them, hate them?

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:03.082
Like, they're...
I just don't know if...

00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:04.717
what we're supposed to do,
Jordan.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.554
Oh, by the way, Putin--
super cute.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:09.922
Like, how old is he?

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:11.490
He's not, like, dad age, right?

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:13.326
Like... younger.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.494
I-I don't know. Fangirl.

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:18.497
Great.
Russia's a confusing thing.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.400
I think you need to think
of Russia as a weapon.

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:23.569
Uh, do they attack America?

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:26.672
Perhaps.
In which case, Russia bad.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.841
Do they support Trump-a?
Trump? Trump-a?

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:31.711
Um...

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.412
You know,
you might take that as a slip-up

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:35.715
that makes it sound
like I've taken the word "pa,"

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.049
which means "father,"

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:40.586
and I've attached it to "Trump,"

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.555
which means "leader,"

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:47.126
and then I've connected
those two things subconsciously

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.694
because there's some hole

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:50.997
because I-I'm missing something
with my father.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.999
(laughter)

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:55.067
That there's a crack
deep inside,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.069
that there's a connection
that I didn't have

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.705
when I was small,
and so in moments of stress,

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:02.742
where, perhaps, I'm reaching,
I take those feelings,

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.810
and I connect them
to other authority figures,

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:05.945
and they slip out,

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:07.246
and they reveal something
about myself.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.749
But you'll never get inside.

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.285
(laughter and applause)

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:13.719
So, I think
we're running out of time,

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:16.956
and I got to go clear some space
in my bathroom to hang this guy.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.159
But I think it's coming along
pretty well.
