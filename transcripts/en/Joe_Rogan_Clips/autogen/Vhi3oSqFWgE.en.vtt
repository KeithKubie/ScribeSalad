00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240
here's an interesting idea why do we die

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250
here's an interesting idea why do we die
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.670
here's an interesting idea why do we die
at all why is natural selection never

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680
at all why is natural selection never
 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.289
at all why is natural selection never
given us an immortal species have you

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299
given us an immortal species have you
 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.580
given us an immortal species have you
even thought about that yeah yeah I have

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
even thought about that yeah yeah I have
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.499
even thought about that yeah yeah I have
never reached a conclusion but I was

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
never reached a conclusion but I was
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.589
never reached a conclusion but I was
figured you live long enough who will

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599
figured you live long enough who will
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.260
figured you live long enough who will
especially up until recent history only

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
especially up until recent history only
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.330
especially up until recent history only
long enough to recognize it was all

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
long enough to recognize it was all
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.240
long enough to recognize it was all
crazy hustle it's a philosophical I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
crazy hustle it's a philosophical I
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.470
crazy hustle it's a philosophical I
believe or a scientific answer here's

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
believe or a scientific answer here's
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480
believe or a scientific answer here's
here's one answer for why we're not

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490
here's one answer for why we're not
 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.109
here's one answer for why we're not
immortal

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
immortal
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.030
immortal
okay so if you think about it why would

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
okay so if you think about it why would
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.860
okay so if you think about it why would
natural selection not have created a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
natural selection not have created a
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.810
natural selection not have created a
creature that lived forever right not

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
creature that lived forever right not
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.990
creature that lived forever right not
why did why should we die yeah okay so

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000
why did why should we die yeah okay so
 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729
why did why should we die yeah okay so
here's that one answers it's not known

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
here's that one answers it's not known
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.200
here's that one answers it's not known
for sure if this is the answer but this

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
for sure if this is the answer but this
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.389
for sure if this is the answer but this
is a good answer

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399
is a good answer
 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.410
is a good answer
imagine they're two different kinds of

things that can kill you intrinsic
causes and extrinsic causes so things

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
causes and extrinsic causes so things
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.549
causes and extrinsic causes so things
inside your body that result in you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
inside your body that result in you
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.250
inside your body that result in you
dying defects diseases and so forth or

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
dying defects diseases and so forth or
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619
dying defects diseases and so forth or
things outside your body like accidents

things outside your body like accidents
lightning strikes trees fall and you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
lightning strikes trees fall and you
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.619
lightning strikes trees fall and you
just die and so forth because it's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
just die and so forth because it's
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.630
just die and so forth because it's
impossible to eliminate all extrinsic

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
impossible to eliminate all extrinsic
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.609

causes because some people are going to
die from accidents it would be if

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
die from accidents it would be if
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.109
die from accidents it would be if
inefficient from the point of view of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
inefficient from the point of view of

evolution to evolve to be immortal

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
evolution to evolve to be immortal
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.060
evolution to evolve to be immortal
because we would have all this capacity

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
because we would have all this capacity
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.200
because we would have all this capacity
to be immortal we would have these

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
to be immortal we would have these
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390
to be immortal we would have these
bodies capable of immortality which

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
bodies capable of immortality which
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.530
bodies capable of immortality which
let's say would be evolutionarily

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
let's say would be evolutionarily
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.390
let's say would be evolutionarily
demanding like to evolve anything like

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
demanding like to evolve anything like
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.789
demanding like to evolve anything like
an eye or a brain or strong any any

quality lactase right we like we talked

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
quality lactase right we like we talked
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.010
quality lactase right we like we talked
about earlier you you don't have lactase

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
about earlier you you don't have lactase
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840
about earlier you you don't have lactase
persistence into adulthood because it's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850
persistence into adulthood because it's
 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.399
persistence into adulthood because it's
not needed so evolution doesn't waste

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
not needed so evolution doesn't waste
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.810
not needed so evolution doesn't waste
anything there'd be no reason for that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
anything there'd be no reason for that
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.950
anything there'd be no reason for that
so there'd be no the there would there

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
so there'd be no the there would there
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719
so there'd be no the there would there
there would be no reason the argument

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
there would be no reason the argument
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.069
there would be no reason the argument
goes to evolved immortality because

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079
goes to evolved immortality because
 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.170
goes to evolved immortality because
inevitably some people would be killed

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
inevitably some people would be killed
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.740
inevitably some people would be killed
eventually by accidents anyway so unless

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
eventually by accidents anyway so unless
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.030

you can create a world in which there
are no accidents there no extrinsic

the reason we die naturally some people

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
the reason we die naturally some people
 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.240
the reason we die naturally some people
think is that the reason we die

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
think is that the reason we die
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790
think is that the reason we die
naturally is that there are unnatural

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
naturally is that there are unnatural
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.699
naturally is that there are unnatural
causes of death in the world

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709
causes of death in the world
 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.739
causes of death in the world
like accidents if we could eliminate the

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:15.749
like accidents if we could eliminate the
 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.610
like accidents if we could eliminate the
unnatural causes so that no where no no

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
unnatural causes so that no where no no
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.670
unnatural causes so that no where no no
time ever were we ever killed by trees

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
time ever were we ever killed by trees
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.949
time ever were we ever killed by trees
falling or lightening strikes or things

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
falling or lightening strikes or things
 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.220
falling or lightening strikes or things
like that then actually over time we

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
like that then actually over time we
 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.580
like that then actually over time we
would evolve to live indefinitely this

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
would evolve to live indefinitely this
 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.280
would evolve to live indefinitely this
is the theory it's crazy idea

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290
is the theory it's crazy idea
 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.440
is the theory it's crazy idea
it is fascinating but do you think that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
it is fascinating but do you think that
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.839
it is fascinating but do you think that
nature had that sort of foresight well

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849
nature had that sort of foresight well
 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:39.860
nature had that sort of foresight well
it's not a foresight but that's how

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
it's not a foresight but that's how
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.899
it's not a foresight but that's how
natural selection works mmm think about

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909
natural selection works mmm think about
 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.309
natural selection works mmm think about
like if I have suddenly magically

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
like if I have suddenly magically
 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.199
like if I have suddenly magically
transformed your body at great expense

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209
transformed your body at great expense
 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.899
transformed your body at great expense
to make you capable of immortality and

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909
to make you capable of immortality and
 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.640
to make you capable of immortality and
then two days where now you're hit by a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650
then two days where now you're hit by a
 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.939
then two days where now you're hit by a
bus I've wasted all that effort but if

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:52.949
bus I've wasted all that effort but if
 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.740
bus I've wasted all that effort but if
you only done to one person you wasted

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750
you only done to one person you wasted
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.149
you only done to one person you wasted
that effort if you did it to other

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159
that effort if you did it to other
 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.800
that effort if you did it to other
people you have the potential to create

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
people you have the potential to create
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.869
people you have the potential to create
an incredibly wise person with a

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879
an incredibly wise person with a
 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.059
an incredibly wise person with a
thousand years of life and experience

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069
thousand years of life and experience
 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.420
thousand years of life and experience
and education we died he also have died

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430
and education we died he also have died
 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.860
and education we died he also have died
so everyone eventually would die from

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870
so everyone eventually would die from
 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780
so everyone eventually would die from
these extrinsic causes so personal ah

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790
these extrinsic causes so personal ah
 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.339
these extrinsic causes so personal ah
well no that's that's that's the

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349
well no that's that's that's the
 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.349
well no that's that's that's the
assumption in the model yeah if it's not

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359
assumption in the model yeah if it's not
 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.830
assumption in the model yeah if it's not
perhaps if in fact there are no external

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840
perhaps if in fact there are no external
 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.729
perhaps if in fact there are no external
in which you're never struck by

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
in which you're never struck by
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.189
in which you're never struck by
lightning never hit by a bus never a

lightning never hit by a bus never a
 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.189
lightning never hit by a bus never a
tree branch right then then the theory

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199
tree branch right then then the theory
 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.360
tree branch right then then the theory
is that we would have evolved to be

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
is that we would have evolved to be
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.249
is that we would have evolved to be
immortal so that's almost like the lot

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:25.259
immortal so that's almost like the lot
 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.990
immortal so that's almost like the lot
the life that you live you're inevitably

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000
the life that you live you're inevitably
 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.300
the life that you live you're inevitably
going to get killed by extrinsic causes

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310
going to get killed by extrinsic causes
 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.800
going to get killed by extrinsic causes
yes if you extend that life to a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810
yes if you extend that life to a
 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.839
yes if you extend that life to a
