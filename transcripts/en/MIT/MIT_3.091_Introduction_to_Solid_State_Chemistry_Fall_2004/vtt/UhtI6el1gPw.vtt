00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.920
Settle down, settle down.
This is not some other class,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.840
this is 3.091. So, I have an
important announcement.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.760
There won't be a lecture next
Wednesday. Instead,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.690
there will be another celebration of
learning. You're going to come,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.610
and you're going to show us what
you've learned.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.530
It's going to be so festive.
And, I want to make sure we are all

00:00:49.530 --> 00:01:07.993
celebrating the same thing.
I meant to patch in.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.600
It didn't get it patched in.
I apologize. So, let me tell you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.000
what it is. We're going to look at
is the lectures of starting with

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.400
lecture 17, which was on x-rays.
And, halfway through that lecture

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.800
was the break point for the last
test. So, we will start with the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.200
material beginning with Bragg's law.
We didn't talk about diffraction on

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:20.600
the last test.
The coverage talked about

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:39.800
generation of x-rays,
but not their use in diffraction.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So, starting with x-ray diffraction
up through the end of last day's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
lecture. And,
the reason I'm doing this is that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
tomorrow is a holiday.
There are no academic exercises

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
tomorrow. And so,
I didn't think it made a good

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
pedagogical sense to teach you
something today and have no

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
recitation on Thursday.
You don't meet again with your

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
recitation instructor until Tuesday
and then Wednesday's the test.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:57.280
So, being mindful of that,
I'm going to start talking about

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.570
solutions today.
None of that will be on the test.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.850
So, starting with x-ray diffraction
and ending with diffusion,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.140
so as I've got up here, we saw
Fick's laws, first and second laws,

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.420
error function, all that stuff will
be fair game. And of course,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.710
we won't have a test, a weekly quiz,
on Tuesday. We'll have plenty to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:37.753
work on for Wednesday.
So, let's leave it that way.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So, last day, we completed the
discussion of diffusion,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
going through analytical
presentation of Fick's laws,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and how they're used in a
quantitative measure of rate

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
phenomena in diffusion.
Today what I want to do is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
introduce another topic from the
general realm of physical chemistry.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And, this is the topic of solutions.
And, for that,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm going to go all the way back to
the very first lecture in 3.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
91 when we looked at this figure
from the text.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:59.370
And, what we've been doing up until
now is largely working over in the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.740
lower left corner of this taxonomy.
We've been looking at the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.120
properties of elements.
We've looked at a few compounds,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.490
but we really haven't gotten up into
here. Everything has been pure

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.870
pretty much. But,
we have had to make the odd foray.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.240
What we talked about glasses, we
got into the discussion of solutions

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.620
because we were talking about how
you can modify the properties and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:44.973
tailor the properties by changing
composition of a glass.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:33.620
So, that was really in this domain
of mixtures. And we talked about

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.240
doping of semiconductors.
When we dope a semiconductor we

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.870
actually put phosphorus or boron
substitutionally for silicon.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.490
So, in essence, we are making a
solution. So that's all up in here.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.120
But, I'm a little bit uncomfortable
with this broad definition of

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.740
mixtures. So,
I've taken the liberty of refining

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.370
that somewhat.
And so, what I would prefer you

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:14.940
recognize is that there is
two types of mixtures.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.800
There's homogeneous mixtures and
heterogeneous mixtures.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.600
So, homogeneous mixtures are what
we would call solutions.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.400
And, that gives you mixing right
down at the molecular level,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.200
whereas heterogeneous mixtures are
not mixed down to the molecular

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.000
level. They are mixed down to the
level of clusters of molecules.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:27.570
So, for example,
if I look at something like brine,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.140
brine is salt dissolved in water.
It's visually uniform.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.710
We cannot tell that there's more
than one component.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.280
And, it's this homogeneity
uniformity that makes it a solution,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.850
whereas if you look at something
like milk, milk is a mixture.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.420
It's an aggregate. Milk actually
consists of two phases: there's a

00:04:50.420 --> 00:05:09.373
fatty phase which is insoluble,
and the aqueous phase.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:59.130
And, what's happened is we've got a
fine dispersion of the second phase

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.260
in the first phase.
And that fine dispersion floats.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.390
The fat is clear and colorless, and
the aqueous phase is clear and

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.530
colorless. But that dispersion
scatters light.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.660
And that's where we get the white
in milk. And,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.790
I don't like the notion that whether
it's milky or clear and colorless,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.930
in other words, coarsely mixed or
finely mixed; we simply

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.450
lump them under.
So, I'm going to be talking today

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.360
about solutions and making sure that
we understand the underlying

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.270
chemistry. So,
you might say, well,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.180
we signed up for solid-state
chemistry. Why is he talking about

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.090
solutions? Well,
I'm going to give you three reasons.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:06:07.846
First of all, we have many systems
that we're looking at are solutions.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:56.860
It's very rare to use pure
substances in engineering

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.730
applications. So,
we need to understand solutions from

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.590
that standpoint as we've learned how
to tailor the properties of glasses,

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.460
how to tailor the properties of
semiconductors,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.330
how to tailor the properties of
metal alloys, and so on.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.190
Secondly, many materials are
processed out of solution.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.060
The way we make fine powders is not
to make little molds and cast liquid

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.070
into tiny, tiny little molds.
We make fine powders typically by

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.210
precipitation out of solution.
So, we need to understand the laws

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.350
that govern dissolution,
and exsolution, precipitation.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.490
And thirdly, one of the major units
that we're going to cover before the

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.640
end of the semester involves
biochemistry. And,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.780
the environment for most of
biochemicals is a wet environment.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.920
So, I think it's requisite that we
know something about that

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.810
wet environment.
So, that's sort of the background

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.430
preamble. And so,
what I want to do today is introduce

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.060
some definitions.
So, we'll breeze through some

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.680
material on the handouts,
and ultimately get to the

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.300
miscibility rules.
That's what we really want.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.930
We want to know that miscibility
rules, the rules that govern what to

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.560
substances or three or more
substances are going to mix and form

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.180
solutions. So,
that's what we are heading to:

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:35.760
miscibility rules.
And then, finally,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
we're going to do some quantitative
calculations by the end of the class.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So, let's get on to the handout.
On the one side, we've got the

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
types of solutions.
So I'll just quickly go through and

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
get these definitions under our
belts. A solution consists of at

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:52.140
least two substances.
The majority substance is termed the

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.420
solvent. And then,
the minority substance,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.710
and there can be more than one,
is the solute. So, you can have a

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.990
plurality of solutes,
but you have one solvent.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.280
So I just want to make you
understand that solutions are not

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.570
simply aqueous solutions.
Solutions span all of chemistry.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.850
So, let's go down this chart that's
been organized according

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:22.190
to state of aggregation.
So, first case we've got a solid

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.590
solute and a liquid solvent.
Brine is a good example of that.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.990
You've got solid sodium chloride
dissolving in liquid water.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.390
Here's liquid-liquid. This is wine,
which can be broken down as ethyl

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.790
alcohol dissolving in water.
All right, and we can dissolve a

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.190
gas in a liquid.
And, seltzer is an example where we

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.590
have carbon dioxide dissolved in
water. And, I mean,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:09:08.446
it's chemically dissolved in the
water. It's under high pressure.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:57.280
When you release the pressure,
you see the bubbles exsolve. But

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.570
when we say solution,
we are talking about something that

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.850
is mixed at the molecular level.
So, this is solvated carbon dioxide.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.140
So, now, let's use a gas as the
solvent. There's only the one case

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.420
there: gas dissolving in a gas.
So, we could say that air is a

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.710
variety of gases dissolved in
nitrogen as the solvent.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:37.886
Nitrogen is the majority species,
about 80% nitrogen.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:26.230
We have oxygen.
We have argon. We have carbon

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.470
dioxide. If we're living next to an
aluminum smelter,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.710
we probably have some
tetrafluoromethane.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.950
If you've lived next to a power
plant, burning coal,

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.190
you've probably got some sulfur
dioxide, and so on and so forth.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.420
So, this is a multi-component
solution. Now,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.660
let's look at solids.
This is 3.091, so how about some

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.900
solid solutions?
We've seen evidence of those

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.140
already. Solid metal alloy: carbon
dissolved in iron.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.380
The carbon goes in interstitially,
mixing at the molecular level right

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.270
down to the atomic level here.
We've looked at semiconductors,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.810
boron going into silicon. Boron
sits on a silicon site,

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.360
and actually bonds into that
framework. We looked at stabilized

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.900
ceramics where we put calcia into
zirconia at the end of the last

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.450
lecture to make a high mobility
oxide ion conductor that would act

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:35.500
as a sensor for automotive
applications.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:26.570
And then, we looked at putting
modifiers into network formers.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.140
We form a solution. So, these are
solid solutions.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.710
And then lastly,
we can look at putting liquid into

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:40.280
solid, which is the primary example,
is mercury going into silver. It's

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.850
an amalgam. This is now past
history, but certainly in my

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.420
lifetime for a while I was walking
around with a number of these

00:10:49.420 --> 00:11:07.840
amalgams in the shape of
fillings in my mouth.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:58.300
These were very conveniently made
right in the dentist's office.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.610
But, people have come to appreciate
that it would be a good idea not to

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.920
have mercury in your mouth because
over time it does leach out a little

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.230
bit. And we know it's not conducive
to good physical well-being.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.530
So, this is now thanks to advances
in materials science,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.840
been replaced by some advanced fine
ceramics that can function

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.280
in place of this alloy.
And lastly, we can put gas in solid.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.850
This one is topical today. As
people think about a hydrogen

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.420
economy and how we're going to put
hydrogen on automobiles,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.990
one way is to put compressed
hydrogen tanks full of compressed

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.560
hydrogen at about 5 to 10,
00 psi. That's not very appealing.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.140
Another approach is to interpolate
hydrogen into a compound that can

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.710
dissolve large quantities of
hydrogen. And this is

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.420
one such compound.
So, this is a solution of hydrogen

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.280
dissolved in lanthanum nickel five.
So, that's the range of

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.140
possibilities of solutions.
And then, I want to look at a

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.990
little bit more detail here in the
fine structure of mixtures.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.850
And, in the case of mixtures,
we can look at the solution as being

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.710
something that's mixed at the
molecular level where,

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.570
say, the diameter, if you will,
the diameter of the solute is down

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:30.050
less than several nanometers.
So, we are effectively looking at a

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.160
homogeneous solution.
I've mentioned brine.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.270
And, there are simple tests that we
can put to this.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.380
First of all, it's visually uniform.
And, in fact,

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.490
it's transparent to visible light
because of the band gap that it

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.600
presents. But the main thing is
that it's visually uniform.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.720
It's impossible to filter. If we
wanted to separate sodium chloride,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.830
if we wanted to desalinate, we
couldn't do so by filtering because

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.940
the filter would have to be at the
subatomic level in order to trap

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.900
something at the atomic level.
Well, that's absurd.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.720
So, you can't separate solution by
filtration. And lastly,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.540
it will not settle out. If you make
a solution of sodium chloride and

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.360
water and let it sit in a gravity
field, it's not going to stratify

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.180
because it's mixed at the atomic
level. But, these two here,

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:42.226
the colloid and the suspension,
are the heterogeneous type.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
They are aggregates because they are
mixed at the cluster level.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And, depending on what the particle
size is, we end up with two

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
conditions, and I want you to be
aware of these because there is some

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
interesting physics involved.
And, what we're talking about here

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
is dispersions.
It's a dispersion because we don't

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:51.750
have homogeneity.
Dispersion is fine particles.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:59.250
And I'm using the term particle to
mean this cluster,

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:06.750
fine particles distributed
throughout some matrix.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:14.250
And, what's the principle behind
this? Why doesn't everything just

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:21.750
settle out? Well,
here's what's going on.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:29.250
When we look at a foreign particle,
this is this cluster that's on the

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:34.880
order of 2 to beyond even 1,000 nm.
And, why is this suspended in

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.660
solution in the first place?
Because we know we've got two

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.440
forces acting on it.
First of all, we've got a gravity

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.220
force, which is acting to cause this
to settle. So,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:15:05.906
this is a settling force thanks to
the gravity field.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:55.810
And, working in the other direction,
this interface between the insoluble

00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:01.630
and the solvent,
along that interface we have binding

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:07.450
forces as well.
And these binding forces I'll

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:13.270
simply call interfacial forces.
And, these interfacial forces want

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:19.090
to bind the particle to the solvent
at the resistance to

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:37.280
the gravity field.
So, now, why does particle size come

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.500
in to play? You know the gravity
force is proportional to mass.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.500
And, the mass of the particle is
proportional to the volume of the

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.500
particle. And volume scales with
the cube of the radius,

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.500
whereas this interfacial force,
as the term implies, interface, the

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.500
interfacial force is proportional to
the area of contact between the

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:55.160
particle and the solvent.
And, area scales as the square of

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:01.490
the radius. And you know from your
math that R cubed dominates R

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:07.830
squared when R is large.
That comes as no surprise.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:14.160
But, at very, very small values of
R, R squared dominates R cubed.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.490
And, depending on what the relative
forces are is going to govern what

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:26.830
the relative particle size has to be
before we get particles that will be

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:45.993
suspended in the second phase.
And so, we have here the example of

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
the colloids. One example of the
colloid is milk,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
which I described to you already.
And even though we have two phases,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
both transparent to visible light,
that interface scatters the light.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
These particles are large enough
that they can be separated

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:52.280
by filtration.
But it's unlikely that they'll

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.850
separate in a gravity field owing to
this. They don't settle.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.420
They don't settle. Actually,
what has happened over the past two

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.990
generations is a shift in the
particle size of the fatty phase of

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.560
milk. When you go to the store
today, you buy this red cap milk

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.140
called homogenized milk.
Well, go back two generations ago.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.710
There was no homogenized milk.
Milk was simply pasteurized

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.110
and sent out.
And the particle size was so great

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:28.330
in the fat globules that after
several hours the fat would coalesce

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.550
and rise to the surface.
So, you'd have a creamy phase on

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.770
top. And people would take that out
and use it in their coffee.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.990
And then you'd have what's
effectively skim milk on the bottom.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:45.220
So, somebody came up with the idea,
obviously somebody who had studied

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.440
the rudiments of physical chemistry,
and reasoned that if the fatty phase

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.660
could be broken down to a finer
particle size,

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.880
then the buoyancy forces would
dominate the gravity forces and it

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.250
wouldn't separate.
So, homogenized milk is simply milk

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.750
in which the fatty phase has been
reduced in cluster size to value so

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.250
small that by the time the gravity
field is able to dominate the

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.750
buoyancy field,
the product is spoiled anyway.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.250
So, for the practical shelf life of
the product, you don't have to deal

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.750
with starting by taking the milk out
of the fridge and shaking it in

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.080
order to get good mixing.
That's a good example.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.240
In the case of something like blood,
the cluster size is far too large

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.410
for that to happen,
and so it's not homogeneous under

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.580
illumination. It's easy to filter,
and it will separate in a gravity

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.740
field. So, what we're seeing here
is a demonstration of the

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.910
competition between the
gravitational forces and

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.160
the interfacial forces.
And, the interfacial forces are a

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.490
function of the kinds of bonds that
form. So, it's all there.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.830
It's all there. And, lastly,
this colloid, I want you to be aware

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:07.160
of the definitions here.
I'm not going to quiz you on this.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.490
I simply want you to have it so
that at some point you might want to

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.830
go back and refer to it.
I'm not going to test your memory.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:20.160
But this breaks down the entire
taxonomy of colloids where we see

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.490
that there's a difference between
what happens in the liquid

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.830
dispersive medium,
a gas dispersive medium,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.750
and a solid dispersive medium.
And, you can see many of the common

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:39.250
products that we know are in fact
these dual phase mixtures that

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:44.750
involve very, very fine particles on
the order of some hundreds of

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:50.250
nanometers that we use in common
products. So, so much

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:55.450
for the taxonomy.
But now I want to turn to the

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:00.360
question of miscibility.
And, in order to do that,

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.270
I want you to consider this example,
which I've actually taken from your

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:10.170
reading. I want to look at
dissolution of substances in a

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:15.080
liquid bilayer.
So, we're going to put two vessels

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:34.093
side-by-side, and each will contain
the same liquid bilayer.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.500
And, the liquid bilayer is going to
consist of the bottom layer in both

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.000
vessels is carbon tetrachloride.
And the upper layer is water. And,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.500
first of all, let's ask why these
don't mix. They're both liquid at

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.000
room temperature.
Why don't they mix?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.500
Well, let's take a look at the
electronic structure and bonding.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.000
Whenever I ask why, you know,
you've got a test coming up a week

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.500
from now. When I ask why,
try to work something into the

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.000
answer that speaks to electronic
structure because that's the clue.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:21:00.140
So, what do we know about carbon
tetrachloride?

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.280
It's nonpolar,
so why does one carbon tetrachloride

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.420
bond to another carbon tetrachloride?
And, please don't tell me something

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.560
to do with the electronegativity
difference between carbon and

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.710
chlorine. Let's forget about that.
It's nonpolar, so all we've got is

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.850
weak van der Waals forces.
So, we have a van der Waals liquid

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:39.366
on the bottom whose density
is about 1.4.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:29.540
So, it's going to lie under water.
And water, on the other hand, in

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:34.080
contrast to being nonpolar,
it's polar. And it has hydrogen

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.630
bonding capability.
So, these are very different

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:43.180
substances. And they don't have the
capacity to link to one another.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.720
And so, they don't. They choose
forces of cohesion over

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.820
forces of adhesion.
And so, we have two separate layers.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.460
So now, we're going to ask, what
happens if we introduce a candidate

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.110
solute? So, we really have a
bilayer of solvents.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.760
And now, we're going to introduce a
solute. In the one case,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.400
we're going to put in solid
crystalline iodine.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.050
In the other case, we'll put in
solid crystalline potassium

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.700
permanganate. And why do we choose
these? Well, first of all,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.350
they're both solids, solid going
into liquid. And,

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:36.700
secondly, they're both purple,
very important.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:26.280
They're both purple.
What happens is if we drop iodine

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.560
into this bilayer,
stir vigorously, mix everything up,

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.850
and then wait. The two liquids will
phase separate in a gravity field,

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:42.140
and then we'll find at the end of
the experiment that we have a

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:47.420
solution here of iodine carbon
tetrachloride solution mixed at the

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:52.710
molecular level.
On the other side,

00:22:52.710 --> 00:23:12.153
shake vigorously, wait for system to
equilibrate, layers phase separate.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:23:01.690
And now, here we have a solution of
potassium permanganate in water.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.380
We can see with the naked eye, the
upper layer is purple.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.070
The lower layer is clear and
colorless. In this case,

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.760
the upper layer is clear and
colorless. The lower layer is

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.460
purple. So, it's clear that iodine
has strong affinity for carbon

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.150
tetrachloride.
Potassium permanganate has a strong

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.570
affinity for water.
So, what's going on?

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:29.710
Well, let's look at the structure
of the candidate solute.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:34.850
What's iodine? Iodine is a
diatomic molecule.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:39.990
And it's nonpolar symmetric.
So, it's a van der Waals solid.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:45.130
And, the van der Waals solid
dissolves in a van der Waals liquid

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:50.280
because together they've got
fluctuating dipole interactions that

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.420
can allow them to bond to one
another and form a solution,

00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:00.770
whereas with water it's less favored.
In this case, potassium permanganate

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:06.330
is an ionic compound that forms
potassium cations,

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:11.880
and permanganate anions.
And so, we have an ionic solid

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:17.440
dissolving in a polar liquid.
So, the polar liquid is able to

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:35.680
attract the positive end of the
dipole attracts the anion.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:27.660
And the negative end of the dipole
attracts the cation.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.330
If you read the typical chemistry
textbooks, they don't go into such

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.990
an elaborate discussion.
They like to simplify it to a

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:41.660
slogan, a tagline.
So, you will see this.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:46.330
Well, I hope you don't see that.
I hope you see it's spelled

00:24:46.330 --> 00:25:04.526
correctly. You will see
like dissolves like.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:56.270
I look at that and I said it's too
simplistic. And I'm going to give

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:01.540
you some examples of where that
doesn't happen.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:06.810
Besides, I mean,
I look at that and I wonder if I'm

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:12.080
reading something from California.
The like dissolves a like.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.360
[LAUGHTER] Tenure means never having
to say you're sorry, so just

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.380
enjoy it. Enjoy it.
So now, what I want you to do is to

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.150
look at this table.
This table is going to show that

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.920
this is not such a smart tag like to
work with. Again,

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.690
I will not expect you to commit this
table to memory.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:41.460
I would never ask you to tell me
what the solubility of something is

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:46.230
by heart. I would,
instead, turn around and say,

00:25:46.230 --> 00:26:05.393
for example, calcium copper bromide
forms aqueous solutions.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:56.230
And then, let's take it from there.
I tell you what the fact is. But

00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:01.460
what I want you to notice first of
all is that the table is broken into

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:06.690
two regimes, soluble ionic compounds
and insoluble ionic compounds.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:11.920
So it's not so simple. There's
something else going on here.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.150
And, let's take a look. There's
one they say, for example,

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:22.380
the chlorides are generally soluble.
And the oxides are generally not

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:28.330
soluble.
So, what do we have to think about?

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:34.990
Well, it's a competition, really.
It's a competition.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:41.660
When we look at sodium chloride,
it exists as a solid crystal. And

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:48.330
now, we have to compare whether it
wants to go into aqueous solution.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:54.990
And, what we see is that the answer
here is, yes, whereas the answer for

00:26:54.990 --> 00:27:01.660
magnesium oxide,
which is also an ionic crystal,

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:07.420
it does not form aqueous solutions.
So, what's going on here?

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.280
Well, what's the major difference
here? Sodium chloride exists as

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:17.140
sodium cations and chloride anions,
whereas magnesium is divalent. So,

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:35.080
we have magnesium cations
and oxide anions.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:26.140
And in the crystal lattice,
we have a much, much higher crystal

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.280
lattice energy for magnesium oxide.
If you just go through the Madelung

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.420
derivation, you will have double,
double. So, it's, in essence four

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.560
times. And sure enough,
the melting point of sodium chloride

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.710
is about 800í melting point,
whereas the melting point of

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.850
magnesium oxide is about 2,
00í. And, what happens when we try

00:27:46.850 --> 00:28:07.166
to make this dissolve in solution is
something that looks like this.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:54.880
Here's a cartoon showing water
dissolving sodium chloride.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.770
So, sodium chloride, just to get
oriented, the green spheres

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.660
represent the chloride ions,
and the blue spheres represent

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.550
sodium ions. And,
just to keep things current,

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.440
you can see up here one, two,
three, four, five, the face of an

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.320
FCC Bravais lattice,
but we've got two atoms per lattice

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.210
point as our basis,
etc., etc. And, here's the water

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:22.100
molecule, which looks sort of like
Mickey Mouse here with the red

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:41.800
showing the oxygen,
and the white showing the hydrogen.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:30.800
So, the oxygen end is the negative
end of the dipole.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.600
And, what the cartoon showing is
that the negative end of the dipole

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:40.400
is presenting itself to the cation.
And, if the attractive force

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:59.666
between the solute and the solvent
exceeds the binding energy,

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.000
the crystal binding energy, we will
have dissolution.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:54.820
And that's borne out here where you
see that we have a difference in

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.640
Coulombic force of attraction that
makes it accessible for sodium

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.460
chloride for water to dissolve it,
but inaccessible for magnesium oxide

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.290
because the forces are too strong.
And then, you see the complement

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:14.110
here, that the positive end of the
dipole is presenting itself to the

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:18.940
chloride anion.
I'm always amused when people draw

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.760
ions colored because I know they're
trying to color code them,

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.580
but think about it. If you could
isolate a chloride ion,

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.810
what color do you think it would be?
There's an answer to that question.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.450
What's its electronic structure?
See, it always goes back to

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.090
electronic structure.
What's its electronic structure?

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.720
It's isoelectronic with argon. And
what you think the color of argon is?

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.360
What do you think the color of any
noble gas is? So,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:30:07.453
actually, these things should all be
clear and colorless.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:56.590
I just wanted to point that out.
I know they're color-coded for your

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:02.190
amusement, but I was staring at this
green ion, and asking myself,

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:07.790
should ions be green? No, no,
they shouldn't. OK, so now let's

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:13.390
talk about measures of solubility.
I'm going to put some numbers on

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:31.646
this. So, we can express solubility
in the following units.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:25.280
There are a variety of units,
but the only one that we really need

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:31.560
to worry about is the molar quantity,
which represents moles of solute

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:37.850
divided by liters of solution.
And, remember, the solution is the

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:44.140
sum of all solutes plus the solvent.
All solutes plus the solvent

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:50.420
constitute the solution.
And so, moles per liter,

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:56.710
when we say sodium chloride
dissolves at so many moles per liter,

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:14.286
we can abbreviate that by uppercase
M, which we term molar.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:31:08.660
So if I have a one molar solution of
sodium chloride and water,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:14.330
one molar is equivalent to,
say, one mole of NaCl, in one liter

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:31.260
of solution. I was about
to write water.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:25.290
It's not. It's 1 L of solution
total. And, here,

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:30.580
I think, you can see that it's not
an all or nothing situation.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.880
In other words, certain substances
are insoluble for reasons we've seen.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:41.170
But, other substances are soluble
up to a point.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:46.470
You know from experience you can
add sugar to water,

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:51.760
and a dissolves very readily up to a
certain value,

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:57.050
beyond which you can add the sugar,
stir it, shake it, do whatever you

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:02.350
want, but the sugar will not
dissolve beyond a certain limit

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:08.420
which we call the solubility limit.
Or, in aqueous systems,

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:15.280
they simply call it the solubility
and, at this limit,

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:22.140
we've reached a condition termed
saturation. We say the solution is

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:39.146
saturated with respect to the solute,
and can take no more.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:34.190
And, there are two measures for
saturation solubility.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:39.390
One is just denoted C star,
or some people use C sub S, which

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:44.590
means the concentration of solute at
saturation. And that's a simple way

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:49.790
of getting it.
And, it works when all we are

00:32:49.790 --> 00:33:07.313
dealing with is one solute
in one solvent.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:33:00.590
But, to make matters richer,
so that we can treat conditions

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:06.190
where we have more than one solute,
the other approach is to use a term

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:11.790
known as solubility product.
And, the solubility product is best

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:17.390
shown by example.
Let's look at a salt that dissolves

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:34.713
in water but very sparingly:
silver chloride.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:28.050
Silver chloride has a lattice energy
that's low enough that we can get

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:33.110
some to dissolve in water but only
sparingly so. And so,

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:38.170
I'm going to put an equal sign if we
move from left to right.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:43.230
We're dissolving, so let's call
that reaction dissolution.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:48.290
And, when we move from right to
left, that's called precipitation.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:53.340
And so, silver chloride dissociates.
It dissociates to form silver

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.400
cations. And,
to show that they are dissolved in

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.460
water, I'm going to write aq,
meaning it's in aqueous solution,

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:08.280
and the chloride anions, again, aq.
And, this notion that when an ionic

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.850
solid dissolves in water,
it dissolves not as a molecule of

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:17.420
silver chloride,
but rather as cation and anion was

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:35.640
in fact what won Arrhenius
his Nobel prize.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:26.700
He got his Nobel prize not for,
I think, his really good work on

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:31.410
activation energies and so on that
paved the way for our understanding

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:36.110
of catalysis, and so on.
He got his Nobel Prize for this,

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:40.820
which was called the theory of
electrolytic dissociation,

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.520
meaning that when an ionic solid
dissolves, it forms an electrolyte,

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.230
that is to say, an ionic conductor.
So, that was his Nobel prize.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:54.940
And, what we do is we can express
the solubility of silver chloride by

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.640
the solubility product denoted Ksp
as the product of the instant

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.810
concentration of each of the ions.
And, I know at first blush you are

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:07.450
going to say, well,
that's just the same as talking

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:11.090
about the concentration of the salt
dissolved. And,

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:14.720
that is the case in this trivial
example. We'll move on to something

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.360
a little more sophisticated in a
moment. So, I'm going to take the

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:38.653
concentration using square brackets
to denote concentration.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
So, it's the product of the
concentration of the silver cation,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
and the concentration of the
chloride anion.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
And, concentrations here are in
units of moles per liter.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
So, I'll plug in the value of the
silver ion concentration and the

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
chloride ion concentration.
And that gives me the solubility

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
product. And then,
this goes up to some master value.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
And, that's the saturation. So now,
I want to show you that we have some

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:53.940
evidence for this.
So, here's some evidence.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.820
What I'm showing you is a plot of
conductivity, the conductivity of

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.700
the solution as a function of the
number of moles of silver chloride

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.580
that has been added.
And, what you see? First of all,

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.460
here we have the conductivity of
pure water. Pure water is a very,

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.350
very poor conductor. We should
really properly call it an insulator.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:17.230
And, in units of,
this is reciprocal ohm,

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:21.110
which is the Siemen. In units of
Siemens per centimeter,

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:41.620
the conductivity of pure water is
less than ten to the minus seven.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:29.140
It's some number times ten to the
minus eight Siemens per centimeter.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:33.280
So, what's happening? When we
dissolve silver chloride,

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.420
we are adding, this is the same as
doping. We are adding charge

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.560
carriers, only instead of adding
holes to the valence band,

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:45.710
or electrons to the conduction band,
that's not going to help us because

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:49.850
water isn't a metal.
Water is capable of dissolving ions.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:37:10.166
So, we're going to make it an ionic
conductor by injecting carriers.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
The more silver chloride we dissolve,
the greater the number of carriers.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
The greater the number of carriers,
the greater the conductivity. So,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
by measuring conductivity as a
function of concentration,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
we can determine if we are
dissolving the silver chloride,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
as opposed to we keep adding it and
it just sinks to the bottom.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
So, let's look here. What we find
is as we add silver chloride,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
the conductivity of the solution
rises up to a maximum value at

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
around ten to the minus five moles
of silver chloride per

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:29.830
liter of solution.
So, that would be a concentration of

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:33.490
10 to the minus five molar.
And then, what happens? We keep

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:37.160
adding silver chloride,
but the conductivity doesn't change.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.830
So, what do you think is happening
if you could stare at the beaker?

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.490
You could see the silver chloride
just falling to the bottom.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:48.160
So, the knee in the curve indicates
that we've reached saturation

00:37:48.160 --> 00:38:07.753
solubility. So that's good.
So, we have evidence to support.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:37.500
Now, we can then compare the
solubility with the solubility

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.500
product in the following manner.
We can say that the relationship

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.500
between the saturation solubility is
really equal to the concentration of

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:52.500
silver chloride dissolved,
which Arrhenius has told us is

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.500
really the concentration of silver
ion, which is equal to the

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:22.380
concentration of chloride ion.
All of these are the same.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:27.160
And so, with a little bit of
algebra, we can show them that the

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.940
relationship between this and Ksp is
- since the concentration of silver

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:36.720
equals the concentration of chloride,
then we can take Ksp to the one half

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.490
will then equal the C star,
the saturation solubility. And,

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:46.270
for silver chloride, it turns out
that the product,

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:51.050
the solubility product,
is 1.8 times ten to the minus ten,

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:55.830
which then means that the saturation
solubility for silver chloride is

00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:00.610
the square root of that,
which is about 1.3 times ten to the

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.840
minus five.
And, sure enough,

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.530
that's what you see on this plot.
You see that somewhere just a

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.230
little bit higher than ten to the
minus five molar,

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.920
the plot has flattened out.
But now, let's look at the more

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.610
interesting case and put the
solubility product to work and ask

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.300
ourselves, what happens if we add
silver chloride not to pure water,

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:43.933
but to a solution that contains
already some other dissolved salt.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:32.110
Is that going to have an impact on
the amount of silver chloride we can

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:37.220
dissolve? So,
let's give a specific example,

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:42.330
and a specific example is add silver
chloride to a solution already

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:47.440
containing sodium chloride.
I'm going to add silver chloride to

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.590
a solution of 0.1 molar NaCl.
So, I already have chloride ion

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.790
present. See,
this is interesting.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.990
If I said that, instead of adding
silver chloride to pure water,

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.190
I'm going to add silver chloride to
water that already contains some

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.390
silver chloride,
you say, well, that's obvious.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:07.590
If it contains some silver chloride,
I can't put as much in as I

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:10.790
otherwise could.
But now I'm going to say,

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.990
it's not silver chloride. It's
sodium chloride.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:17.190
Does the presence of sodium
chloride have any impact on the

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:20.390
dissolution of silver chloride?
So, again, we'll look Arrhenius'

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:24.900
theory of electrolytic dissociation.
So, silver chloride will dissociate

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:30.720
and go into solution as silver
cation and chloride anion.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:36.540
And, sodium chloride is present as
sodium ion and chloride ion.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:42.360
So, we've got now, note here
multiple sources of chloride ion.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:48.180
We're getting some chloride ion
from silver chloride,

00:40:48.180 --> 00:41:05.626
and we get some chloride ion from
sodium chloride.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
So, the consequence of that is that
I know I can no longer assume that

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
the concentration of silver ion
equals the concentration of chloride

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
ion. That's no longer the case
because I've got some chloride ion

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
that came from sodium chloride.
So, that's a problem. That's a

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
problem. So, what do I do?
I'm going to try to find the

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
saturation solubility of silver
chloride under these

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:22.400
new circumstances.
So, I'm going to go back to my

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.200
solubility product,
Ksp. And, Ksp is going to equal the

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.990
product of the silver ion
concentration times the

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:36.790
concentration of the chloride ion.
And, I can take a stab at what this

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:41.590
is. I told that this is on the
order of 0.1 molar.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:46.390
And, we saw that in the case of
pure silver chloride,

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:51.190
it's ten to the minus five molar.
It's about four orders of magnitude

00:41:51.190 --> 00:42:09.446
lower even when we have
full dissociation here.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.500
So, I'm going to assume that ten to
the minus one molar is so much

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:47.000
greater than ten to the minus five
molar, which is what we got in pure

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.500
silver chloride that I'm going to
neglect the contribution of chloride

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:58.000
ion from silver chloride,
and say that the concentration of

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.500
chloride ion is simply equal to 0.
because 0.1 is so much greater than

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:09.000
what is left over from the
previous calculation.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:34.390
And now, I can still make the
connection between the dissolution

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:39.790
of silver chloride salt,
and the concentration of silver ion.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:45.190
That still exists as one to one.
So, this will then represent C of

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:50.590
silver chloride times 0.
. And, that's equal to this 1.

00:42:50.590 --> 00:43:08.913
times ten to the minus, what is it,
ten to the minus ten.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
So, I can solve for the
concentration of silver chloride,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
and that gives me 1.8 times ten to
the minus nine molar.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
So, the presence of the chloride
from sodium has had a tremendous

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
repressive effect on the dissolution
of silver chloride.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:25.060
This is called the common ion effect
because I have a common ion from

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:30.130
both solutes, and one influences the
solubility of the other: common ion

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:35.190
effect. And, we can use the common
ion effect to our advantage.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:40.260
If I want to process something in
order to cause precipitation of very,

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.330
very fine particles,
I can load a solution with one

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:50.390
solute, introduce a second solute,
and trigger the precipitation, and

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:55.460
in doing so, control particle size,
and the shape, and thereby prepare a

00:43:55.460 --> 00:44:00.180
material for subsequent processing.
In fact, you can use this.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:04.540
If you want to determine if you've
got water that's been chlorinated,

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.900
simple thing you can do: if you go
back to that table 8.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.270
, you'll know that silver nitrate
has a very, very high solubility in

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:17.630
water. So, I introduce silver
nitrate into water,

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:36.593
and the question is,
is there any chlorine present?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And, if there's any chlorine present,
we know that the saturation

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
solubility of silver chloride is ten
to the minus five molar.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
What will happen is if you've got
chlorinated water,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
and you add silver nitrate,
you will see a shower of very,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
very fine, white powder, which is
the silver chloride.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
So, this is a very good test for
residual chlorination.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:57.230
So, now how can we use some of this?
Let's take a look. I've got two

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:02.460
things I want to show you.
First of all, one thing going back

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:07.690
to the last lecture dealing with
diffusion, and I want to show how

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:12.920
diffusion is important in forming
bonds if we want to make coatings.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:18.150
So, here's a carefully drawn
cartoon by your professor to pose

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:23.380
the question, suppose we want to put
a coating of A on a substrate,

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:28.690
C, and they don't stick.
They don't stick very well.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:34.090
So, one strategy to enable the
binding of coating A on substrate C

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:39.490
is to find a substance,
B, such that A will bind to B,

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:44.890
and B will bind to C. This is
called an interlayer.

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:50.290
And, it's used commonly in the
industry when the coating won't

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:55.410
stick to the native substrate.
So we use an interlayer.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:46:00.240
So, here's a product where this is
used on a regular basis.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.080
I don't own stock in Gillette.
I just happen to know that there's

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.910
a ton of materials science that went
into the design of a product as

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:14.740
mundane as a safety razor.
So, I want to look at the blade.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:19.580
It turns out, they wanted to cut
the blade with a substance called

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:24.180
diamond like carbon.
Diamond like carbon is a mix of sp3

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:28.560
hybridized carbon and sp2 hybridized
carbon. It's not a diamond film.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.930
I want you saying that Professor
Sadoway said that the Mach 3 razor

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:37.300
has a diamond film on it.
It doesn't. If it did, it would

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:41.680
cost more than it does now.
And it's exorbitantly expensive as

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:46.050
it is. So, it's sp3 and sp2.
It's a mix. And, this material is

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:50.430
very, very hard.
It's very hard. You want something

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:54.810
that's hard to give you the
resistance to keep

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.920
that cutting edge.
But you don't want to meet the whole

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.760
blade out of something like that.
Otherwise, it will be brittle, and

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.610
it will shatter.
So, you want the composite material.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.460
So, it turns out that diamond like
carbon, if you put it on steel,

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.300
since the blade is made of steel,
there is very poor adhesion. And,

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.150
Gillette was determined to get
diamond like carbon on the blade.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:37.166
So, they asked, what could be an
interlayer?

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:26.760
And they tried many different
substances, and finally settled upon

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.530
niobium. They went to a fairly
exotic part of the periodic table.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:36.300
They used niobium. It turns out
that niobium, niobium as you know is

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:41.070
a body centered cubic metal.
And so, it can interdiffuse with

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:45.840
steel and form a bond here.
And, the other thing is that

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:50.610
niobium is an element that has a
very high propensity

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:55.380
to form carbides.
So, niobium forms an interdiffusion

00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:00.150
bond with the steel,
and on the free surface has a

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:04.920
carbide which then is capable of
bonding to the diamond like carbon,

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:09.690
and thereby giving us the bond that
we need. And the last thing I want

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:14.450
to show you is something that I just
saw this morning.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:19.220
I was getting ready to go.
Tom, could we shift to the document

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:39.040
camera? I want to show you how we
can take diffusion to make products.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.500
Perfect, OK, this is a ceramic knife.
It's made of zirconia.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:17.000
It's made of zirconia. Now,
how do you suppose they make this

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.500
knife? How is this knife
manufactured? You start with

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:30.000
zirconia. This stuff melts at 2,
00 degrees centigrade.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:53.750
Can you imagine?
It's an ionic compound.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:49:13.933
So, it has no ductility.
And please don't tell me because of

00:48:37.500 --> 00:49:01.250
dislocations; it has no ductility
because the bonds are so strong.

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:21.233
The only way you could perform
zirconia would be to push,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:49:08.750
push, push, and then it breaks.
So, you can't make a billet of

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:28.466
zirconia the way they do how they
make a steel knife.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:49:16.250
They make a billet of steel,
and then they, by mechanical working,

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:36.700
they reduce the thickness,
and then eventually sharpen the edge.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:24.920
You can't do this with this material.
So, what do they do?

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.840
They use solid-state diffusion
starting with particles of zirconia,

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:34.760
fine particles which are compressed,
raised to elevated temperature on

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.690
the order of about 1,
00 degrees Celsius, and held there

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:44.610
for several days.
And, during that time,

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:49.530
diffusion takes place to reduce the
void space, bringing this

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:54.310
to near 100% density.
So, the vast majority of fine

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:58.930
ceramics that you see in the
marketplace, I'm talking true

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:03.560
ceramics now, not the glassy stuff.
Pyrex, yes, Pyrex is castable. But

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:08.180
not this. This is all processed by
solid-state diffusion,

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:12.800
a process of agglomeration known as
sintering. Sintering is

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.430
consolidation by solid-state
diffusion. And then,

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:22.060
in the end, with the diamond wheel,
the edge is cut. And, this stuff

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:26.680
has a mho hardness of 8.
, making it second only to diamond,

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.250
which has a hardness of ten.
High corrosion resistance,

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:35.750
no metallic flavor, very sharp,
and it holds its edge, made by solid

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.683
state diffusion. OK, we'll
see you on Friday.
