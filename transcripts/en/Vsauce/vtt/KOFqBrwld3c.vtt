00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.440
Shooting a watermelon off your brother's
head and an inverted sandwich.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.040
I'm a little sick today,
but the best medicine is episode 37

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.040
of IMG!

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.540
Why is this cat so sad? Does he not
know that unicorn bicycles exist?

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.279
The only thing more spectacular
might be this 'Jaws'

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.570
themed swimsuit with The Little Mermaid
as the victim.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.439
Or maybe the answer is this bubble.
What do you think, shocked barn?

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.460
Huh, always surprised. 
Well, this toilet thought it was funny

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.910
and, as usual, chocolate chip cookie's just
grumpy. But it could be because someone

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.510
just threw

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960
acid on his wife's face.
It's not funny, bag.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.340
MoIllusions.com featured a tree's
shadow that produces a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.270
face. Of course, some shadows prefer
beer pong. I mean, like, they really

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.550
love it.
Reflections can be just as naughty.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.960
This word became "nude."
But whatever,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.530
the final boss of the Internet prefers
dogs making awkward smiles.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.370
Enjoy.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.729
On DeviantArt Katie created out of this world lips,

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.009
a sunset face and eyes based on the Lion King

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.470
and Alice in Wonderland.
But now, what the H is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.810
this?
Oh. A mirror

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.640
lake.
This graffiti uses its surface creatively

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.869
and here's a real-life angry bird attack.
This tree looks like it has teeth, a tongue and

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.460
vomit.
And this shirt makes your arm a horse neck.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.830
Researchers in China are trying to reintroduce
captive bred

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.399
pandas into the wild without wild
pandas knowing the difference.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.780
Their solution? Dress up like pandas,
which leads to awesome pictures

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.729
like these. Heart hair. On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.720
Avery did some important math.
And Raman added this illusion,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.229
where your brain can't help but see the
two groups shake around,

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.890
even though they're not moving.
Like us on Facebook to see more

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.090
or to submit your own.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.290
And as always,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.810
thanks for watching.
