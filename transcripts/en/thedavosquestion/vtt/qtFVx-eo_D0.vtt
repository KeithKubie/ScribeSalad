00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:08.330
The Davos question, what would make a difference
in the world?

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.769
My answer would be very simple.
Read more books. They're good for you.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.310
They take you places you have never been.
Places you could never imagine.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.599
They're fun.
They teach you how to read other books and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.019
help you communicate with other people.
Thanks.
