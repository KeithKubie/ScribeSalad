00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
From the star of Rocky, Rambo, and The Italian Stallion

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.930
Comes the only 80's action movie to come out
in 2010:

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.400
The Expendables.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.759
Before the release of the watered-down PG-13
sequel

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.130
revisit the R-rated movie that has all the
explosions, guns, and testosterone you crave

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.170
And all the plotty overcomplicated backstory
you don't.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.170
"Remember that time we was up in Bosnia? We
took down them Serb bad boys while our guys

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.600
were getting chopped up all around us --"

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.059
No one cares! Just shoot a bunch of people
already!

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.800
Ahh, that's better.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.820
Meet The Expendables, a mercenary gang of
aging movie stars brought together for one

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.500
last paycheck.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.830
Thrill as the heroes of your youth team up,
without nearly enough screen-time to go around,

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.530
Featuring hours worth of Statham and Stallone

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.690
But only 2 minutes of Willis and Schwarzenegger.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.330
He... won't be back.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.260
Instead of the all-star brawl you were promised
on the poster,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.790
Get ready for showdowns that no one ever asked
for, like

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.710
Jet Li versus Dolf Lundgren,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.510
Steve Austin versus Randy Couture,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
And Jason Statham versus a pickup basketball
team.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.290
"Next time I'll deflate all your balls."

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.830
Suit up with the leader of The Expendables:
Barney Ross, a man with a mysterious past,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.090
and a mysterious color-changing goatee.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.830
Watch this killer with a conscience struggle
through tough choices to do the right thing.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.900
"This is my choice. There's no guilt.
No guilt."

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.450
And struggle through Botox to make his face
smile.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.450
Ahh, almost there! Almost got it!

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.320
Aw.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.460
Ride along on his mission to take down this
generically evil CIA agent

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.780
And this generically evil general

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.479
To save this generically Latin island nation

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.120
going through some kind of coup or revolution
or something.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.600
"They wanted me out. Why? Because I saw the
big picture!"

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.180
Once again: no one cares!

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.060
But it's not just boys playing with their
toys.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.140
Get to know the movie's rich female characters
like

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.120
This helpless hostage,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.470
This cheating girlfriend,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.600
This random biker skank.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.100
"Anything for you, baby."

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.700
And.. uhh.. that's all, I guess.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.710
Not a lot of women in this movie.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.560
Gear up for a film that seamlessly blends
the worst action movie cliches of the last

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.680
forty years,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.270
Featuring:

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.270
Heroes who somehow dodge every bullet from
the 80's,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.350
Corny one liners from the 90's,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.160
Lame CGI blood effects from the 2000's,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.160
And lame CGI everything else from today.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.390
So get ready to say "Huh?" in a movie
full of Asian, Latin, and European actors

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.390
who speak English as a second language.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.640
And also Sylvester Stallone.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.010
Is that English?

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.220
Starring...

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.780
Sylvester Staroids

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.920
Cranky

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.750
Ivan Drunko

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.280
The Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Black Guy

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.790
Lucky To Be Here

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.690
Bruce Will-isn't In The Movie

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.760
Plane Li

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.020
Greasy Gandalf

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.700
and Old Man The Barbarian

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.569
The Expendables

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.930
Man all I really wanted to see is these guys
trade one liners.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.230
"I'll be back!"

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.200
"You've been back enough! I'LL be back."

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.600
"Yippee ki yay."

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.100
Nevermind.
