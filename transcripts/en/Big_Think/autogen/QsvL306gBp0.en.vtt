advantage of it if I'm writing a summary

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529
advantage of it if I'm writing a summary
 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.650
advantage of it if I'm writing a summary
of what I just created is anybody using

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660
of what I just created is anybody using
 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.420
of what I just created is anybody using
that summary because maybe at one time

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430
that summary because maybe at one time
 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.890
that summary because maybe at one time
somebody used the summary but no one's

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900
somebody used the summary but no one's
 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.990

using it now or maybe I just started
 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.910
using it now or maybe I just started
doing this and assume that it was useful

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920
doing this and assume that it was useful
 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.319
doing this and assume that it was useful
to other people but they aren't actually

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329
to other people but they aren't actually
 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.540
to other people but they aren't actually
using it maybe I've created work that

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550
using it maybe I've created work that
 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.310
using it maybe I've created work that
doesn't actually need to be done now

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320
doesn't actually need to be done now
 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.959

is more pleasurable to work with files

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570
is more pleasurable to work with files
 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.569
is more pleasurable to work with files
when the files are neat and organized or

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579
when the files are neat and organized or

but there is a point where that can
 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.529
but there is a point where that can
swallow us up we can spend too much time

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539
swallow us up we can spend too much time
 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.650

trying to achieve and you want to think
 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.859
trying to achieve and you want to think
about what if people are just gonna be

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869
about what if people are just gonna be

making them look right sometimes the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600
making them look right sometimes the
 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.480
making them look right sometimes the
answer might be it's totally worth it

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490
answer might be it's totally worth it
 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.390
answer might be it's totally worth it
but sometimes maybe we could use some

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400
but sometimes maybe we could use some
 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.670
but sometimes maybe we could use some
kind of more makeshift solution it might

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680
kind of more makeshift solution it might
 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.170
kind of more makeshift solution it might
get us where we need to go and save us a

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180
get us where we need to go and save us a
 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.730
get us where we need to go and save us a
lot of time and energy because what we

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740
lot of time and energy because what we
 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.730
lot of time and energy because what we
want to do as we're creating outer order

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740
want to do as we're creating outer order
