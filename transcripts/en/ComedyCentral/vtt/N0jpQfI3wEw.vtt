00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.443
  (applause)

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.447
- Welcome back.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.481
So tonight we're
gonna talk about

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:17.383
the economics of being a woman.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.152
By now, everyone
knows that women

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.820
only make 79 cents to the dollar

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.322
and that's actually why
I shop at Forever 21

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.125
  so that I can be reminded
  that I am forever 21 cents

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:28.061
  less valuable than a man.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.462
 (audience groaning)

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:32.131
 Obviously we need to
 narrow the wage gap

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.333
 and the thigh gap and
 also the baby gap.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.736
 Nothing there fits me.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.071
 I feel fat.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.440
 Equal pay for equal
 work is a no brainer.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.075
 So let's talk about
 all the bullshit

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.410
 women have to go through
 just to make less than men.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:45.578
 Let's start at the beginning.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:46.846
Getting ready for work.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.815
It takes the average
woman three times longer

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.516
  to get ready than
  the average man.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.485
And even longer if you're ugly.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:55.988
  (audience laughs)

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.157
  That's extra time
  a man can spend

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.093
 reading, exercising,
 or masturbating.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.727
 Whereas I have to multitask.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.962
 And let me tell you,

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:04.263
 it's hard to get
 through Angela's Ashes

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.399
  while you're jackalackin'
  on an elliptical.

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:09.068
  (audience laughs)

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:11.637
  I know some of you guys
  are probably just saying,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940
 "Well, why don't you just stop
 putting shit on your face.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.041
 "We like you better
 without makeup."

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:19.212
And to that, I'll say a
resounding, "Fuck you."

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.047
 'Cause every time
 I don't wear makeup

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.816
I get asked if I'm sick.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.651
  They're like, "Did someone
  in your family die?"

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:28.254
 I'm like, "No, I just woke up
 feeling pretty and confident.

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:30.690
 "Sorry, won't happen again."

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:34.160
 Here's the sick thing.

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:35.661
 Studies show that
 women who wear makeup

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:37.330
  actually earn more money,

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.965
  which those women
  are going to need

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:42.401
  because makeup is
  expensive as fuck.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:45.972
  Kurt, do you have any
  idea how much this costs?

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.673
  - Well, what, you
  mean the nose job?

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:50.009
  (laughing)

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.013
- I haven't yet.

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.915
 It took over an hour
 to do this tonight.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:57.850
 And yes, I do feel
 better about myself

00:01:57.883 --> 00:01:59.118
with my mask on.

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.052
 But it's only
 because without it,

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:01.354
 I don't deserve love.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.257
  Look, it feels
  like it sometimes.

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.360
  I know damn well
  that being a woman

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.795
 is both awesome and a complete
 pain in the ass at time.

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:11.464
 But I wanted to hear it
 from someone who understands

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:13.032
  both sides of the
  gender equation.

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:14.233
 So I sat down with a friend,

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:16.035
  comedian Riley Silverman,

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:18.237
 who came out as a
 woman six years ago.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.306
 Riley, I haven't
 seen you for a while.

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:21.641
- It's been a long time.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:22.742
- You really do have an
interesting perspective

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:23.976
  because you lived as a man

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.244
  and now you're
  living as a woman.

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:28.114
Do you enjoy the extra
effort of being a woman?

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.882
 - I think at first it
 was really enjoyable

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:31.217
 because it was part
 of this ritual.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.718
And you're like, "Oh
my God, I'm doing this.

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:33.886
 "This is my everyday life."

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.488
Then after a month, you're like,

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.123
 "This is my everyday life."

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:39.825
 - Has there been a spike in
 costs since transitioning.

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.060
 - Everything is a
 little bit more money.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:42.094
 Like everything costs more.

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:43.663
Like haircuts cost more,

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.098
clothing is always more
money for lower quality.

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.833
 And then just even
 having to buy makeup.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:48.768
- Yeah.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.069
 - This adds up really fast.

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:51.437
  - You're a pretty
  big fashionista.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.173
 That's gotta be a huge
 difference in your wardrobe.

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:55.308
- Yeah.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.943
 - Talk to me about the
 change in cost there.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:57.910
 - Everyday, so I had to
 have like a different skirt.

00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:59.312
 And that's like in my morning,

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.380
 there's a lot of days where
 I'm that exact stereotypical,

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:02.682
"I don't have anything to wear."

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:03.883
 And I have a closet
 full of clothes.

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.284
 - Yes.

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:06.552
  - Not only would it be
  when I was living as a man

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:07.787
would I just wear a
pair of jeans every day.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.222
 It would be the same jeans.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.057
Like you'd wear the same
jeans for like a month.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.125
 - Like how women wear bras.

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:14.193
- Yeah, exactly.

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:15.294
- Do you sleep in a bra?

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:16.562
 - [Riley] No.
 - [Nikki] Most women don't.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.431
 But I like, I need it.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:21.100
 It's like comforting because
 my mom never hugged me.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.736
(laughs)

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.605
 It really is expensive
 being a woman.

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:26.806
  Products directed at women

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.608
 like lotions,
 razors, and shampoo,

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.710
 consistently cost more
 than similar products

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:31.944
directed at men.

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:33.079
 Because I guess it's pricey

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.481
giving all our
deodorants tiny waists.

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:37.049
 If it isn't shaped like a lady

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:40.253
  then how will I
  know it's for me?

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:41.787
  That literally is what it.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.457
They call this price
discrepancy the pink tax

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.158
  because, I guess,
  vaginas are pink.

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:47.593
  I don't know, mine
  isn't, whatever.

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.329
  But that's something that
  I don't think a lot of men

00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:52.298
 ever think about which
 brings me to periods.

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.666
  And sorry, I know,
  I'm gonna talk

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.001
 about periods for a second.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:58.437
But I'm on mine, so I'll
fucking do what I want.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.574
  (audience laughs)

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:03.243
  I'm not, I'm late.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.413
  (audience laughs)

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.016
No, a little while back

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.417
we did a segment
called Pay Your Tab Cab

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.185
 where I picked up
 guys from a strip club

00:04:13.218 --> 00:04:14.287
 and then gave them a
 chance to win money

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.188
 by answering
 questions about women.

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:17.523
 At one point in their ride,

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:20.092
I asked these men to demonstrate
their knowledge of periods.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.127
 Here's what happened?

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.230
 (funky music)

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.133
Alright it is time for
the red zone challenge.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.100
 Are you ready?

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:29.135
  - Excited

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.236
 - What do we gotta do?

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:31.404
  - I am like on my
  period right now.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.205
  Here's 50 dollars.

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:34.874
  I just need you
  to go inside there

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.943
  and just get me anything
  that you think will help.

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:38.744
- Okay.

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:39.912
 - Go, go, go.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:44.750
 - [Man In Hoodie] Hey.

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:46.585
  - What'd you get?

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:48.220
 - I got all the good stuff.

00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:48.988
- Yeah.

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:49.889
  - Stuffed turtle.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.657
  - Okay, why this?

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.626
  - 'Cause when you're
  cramping you need cuddles.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:54.760
 You know, you're sad.

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:56.062
 - And pink because?

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.063
 - 'Cause girl.

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.597
(laughs)

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.199
 - Okay, well, we
 got you right here.

00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:01.000
 We got you covered.

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:03.169
 I got you the pads.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:03.936
  - What are those?

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:04.937
Those look like diapers.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.205
  - They only had a 34 pack

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:07.907
  and I don't know
  how many you use.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.342
  - You got me pads?

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.609
Do you think I'm Mormon?

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:12.178
 What the hell is this?

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.245
 - I don't know how they work.

00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:14.914
  - I'll just like,
  I'll roll these up

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:17.883
 and stick 'em up
 like they're tampons.

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:19.051
- Good.

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:20.219
 - [Nikki] Cool.
 - [Blonde Man] That's good.

00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:21.187
- These are the
nessentials, you ready?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.088
- Okay.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.022
  - Chocolate with almonds.

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:24.890
 - Okay, okay, we're talking.

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:26.025
  - I even got three
  chocolate bars.

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:27.259
 Two for you and one for me.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:28.861
 - Oh my God, that's
 so sweet of you.

00:05:28.894 --> 00:05:30.296
  - That way I don't got
  to ask for none of yours.

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:32.131
 And you don't got to
 ask for none of mine.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:34.934
 - It's nice that you think
 about yourself in these times.

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.202
 Anything else?

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.037
 - I got you a Lean Cuisine.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.272
  - I'm on my period
  not suicide watch.

00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:41.207
  - Condolence card.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.908
 - Our thoughts are with you.

00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:44.110
  This is a condolence card

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:46.212
 because you're going
 through your period.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.013
 - Yes.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.648
I thought you'd need it.

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:51.050
 - You're not wrong.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:52.485
  - For somebody who ain't
  never had a period before

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.786
 I think I did okay.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.154
  - You really did,
  you really did.

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:55.955
- Yeah.

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.323
 - I hope you get one.

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:59.058
 - I hope I don't because it's
 a lot of shit for a period.

00:05:59.091 --> 00:05:59.992
 - Isn't it?

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:05.431
  (audience cheers)

00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:07.166
 The struggle is real.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.434
The minutes and dollars it takes

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:11.003
  to look normal as
  a woman add up.

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:12.371
So the next time I hear an actor

00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:13.906
  from some movie
  complaining about,

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.508
  "Oh, I had to sit
  in a makeup chair

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.443
 "for three hours to
 look like a monster."

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:19.378
 Try and remember that
 we do that every day

00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:22.114
 so people don't think
 we look like monsters.

00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:23.616
 We'll be right back.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:24.915
  (audience cheers)
