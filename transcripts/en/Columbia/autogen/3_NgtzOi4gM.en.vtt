now is that the military regimes have
 

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.690
now is that the military regimes have
discarded their rulers but the officers

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:43.700
discarded their rulers but the officers
 

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:44.650
discarded their rulers but the officers
are still there

01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:44.660
are still there
 

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:49.420

not to look at but it's interesting to

01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:01.460
not to look at but it's interesting to
 

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:05.740
not to look at but it's interesting to
think of because the the alternative was

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:05.750

you had a Shiite regime that claimed to
 

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:19.600
you had a Shiite regime that claimed to
be ruling on behalf of the Messiah who

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:19.610
be ruling on behalf of the Messiah who
 

01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:23.370

01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:37.740
along from the 1500s down to down to the
20th century became less and less

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:37.750
20th century became less and less

credible as as the forerunners of this
 

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:50.170
credible as as the forerunners of this
messianic individual so they lost their

01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:50.180
messianic individual so they lost their
 

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:52.450
messianic individual so they lost their
religious credibility and they really

01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:52.460
religious credibility and they really
 

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.290
religious credibility and they really
and the revolution that came about

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:55.300
and the revolution that came about
 

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.000
and the revolution that came about
shifted the religious credibility onto a

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:58.010
shifted the religious credibility onto a
 

01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:01.390
shifted the religious credibility onto a
new revolutionary government but the

01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:01.400
new revolutionary government but the
 

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.710
new revolutionary government but the
interesting thing is that in Iran when

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:05.720
interesting thing is that in Iran when
 

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.960
interesting thing is that in Iran when
the regime fell every military officer

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:10.970
the regime fell every military officer

onto retirement this despite the fact
 

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:23.170
onto retirement this despite the fact
that a war was beginning with Iraq that

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:23.180
that a war was beginning with Iraq that
 

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.210
that a war was beginning with Iraq that

high command of the Iranian military
 

01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:30.580
high command of the Iranian military
disappears because every colonel in

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:30.590
disappears because every colonel in
 

01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:32.380
disappears because every colonel in

by the Shah of Iran so what you had in

01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880
by the Shah of Iran so what you had in
 

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.510
by the Shah of Iran so what you had in
Iran was a revolution in which the

01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520
Iran was a revolution in which the
 

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.570
Iran was a revolution in which the
entire regime Falls what you've had in

the Arab Spring is a perturbation in a

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:44.540
the Arab Spring is a perturbation in a
 

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.370
the Arab Spring is a perturbation in a
long history of military officer rule in

01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:48.380
long history of military officer rule in
 

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:53.230
long history of military officer rule in
which the the top person is discarded

which the the top person is discarded
 

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.090
which the the top person is discarded
but the structure that put him on top

01:15:57.090 --> 01:15:57.100
but the structure that put him on top
 

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.730
but the structure that put him on top
remains and my guess is that when we

01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:00.740
remains and my guess is that when we
 

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.470
remains and my guess is that when we
have new constitutions and electoral

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480
have new constitutions and electoral
 

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.630
have new constitutions and electoral
laws we'll find that there are

01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640
laws we'll find that there are
 

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.690
laws we'll find that there are
provisions for the military to retain a

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:07.700
provisions for the military to retain a
 

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:11.740
provisions for the military to retain a
lot of privileges for example check out

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:11.750
lot of privileges for example check out
 

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:13.600
lot of privileges for example check out
and see whether Parliament is allowed to

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:13.610
and see whether Parliament is allowed to
 

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:17.170
and see whether Parliament is allowed to
review the military budget whether

01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:17.180
review the military budget whether
 

01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:20.650

audit projects designed to build villas
and provide privileges for military

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:27.020
and provide privileges for military
 

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:31.860
and provide privileges for military
officers my guess is that you will have

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:31.870
officers my guess is that you will have
 

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:34.780
officers my guess is that you will have
loyal Democrats who cut deals with the

around 30 years from now whereas in Iran
all the generals are gone but that we

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:41.390
all the generals are gone but that we
 

01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:42.760
all the generals are gone but that we
have a new set of generals who are

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:42.770
have a new set of generals who are
 

01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:44.710
have a new set of generals who are
