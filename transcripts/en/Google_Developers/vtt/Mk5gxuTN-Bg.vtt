00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.150
STEFAN HAUK: We use the Google
platform because it allows us

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.050
to focus on the things we want
to do, which is delight our

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.430
fans with good games.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.360
I'm Stefan Hauk.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.360
I'm Lead Server Developer
at Rovio Entertainment.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.830
We make the "Angry Birds"
and "Bad Piggies" games.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.030
We really appreciate the instant
scalability, because

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.730
when we release a new game, it
usually becomes immediately

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.850
very popular.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.840
We have 263 million monthly
players, at the end of last

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.450
year, who are already
playing our games.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.840
And when we tell them that
there's a new game, they all

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.950
come to it and try to play it.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.310
So we need a lot of computer
power from the start.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.770
OLIVER MICHON: So we are making
some more games, but

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.830
our latest one is called "Song
Pop." It's a music game on

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.300
Android, iOS, on the web.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.290
We're using Google Cloud because
it helps us go fast

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.525
from a quick prototype in a few
months to scaling to tens

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:54.860
of millions of users.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.530
We can go effortlessly from 10
users to 80 million users.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.880
I think Google Cloud platform
help us reach our 80 million

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.500
users with a very small team.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.960
And it's not something we could
have done anywhere else.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.420
ALAGAPPAN ALS: I'm Alagappan.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.400
I'm a backend engineer
at Pocket Gems.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.810
We're building a mobile
entertainment company, and our

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.570
focus is to build innovative
products that push the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.270
envelope in this industry.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.710
Google App Engine is definitely
a critical part of

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.760
our technical stack.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.840
And we use the data that we
collect from App Engine to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.810
develop interesting, exciting
features and make our games

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.880
more interesting.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.040
We chose Google App Engine
because we wanted to focus on

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.510
developing features that are
facing millions of users,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.210
rather than having to
focus on hardware.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.320
STEFAN HAUK: My advice would be
that you should try to keep

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.850
your team small, focus on what
you can do best, and leave the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.040
operational aspects
to the people who

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.370
know how to do that--

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.320
in that case, the Google
Cloud Platform team.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.250
The most important thing that
we want to achieve is to

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.470
delight our fans with great
games and good products.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.450
And the Google Cloud platform
allows us to focus just on

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.120
that and leave the other
parts aside.
