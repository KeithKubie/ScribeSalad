00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.621
- [Voiceover] Consider
the formula P is equal to

00:00:02.621 --> 00:00:06.547
W divided by T where P represents power,

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:11.412
W represents work and has units of Joules

00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:13.741
and Joules can be expressed as kilograms

00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:17.583
times meters squared
per seconds squared and

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:20.731
T represents time and
has units of seconds.

00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:22.814
And when you get to physics
class you'll get very familiar

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:25.390
with things like Joules
which can be represented

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.148
as kilograms times meters squared

00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:29.561
per seconds squared and things like power.

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:31.892
But here we're going
to learn to manipulate

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:34.101
these units so that they make sense.

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:38.192
So it says select an appropriate
measurement unit for power.

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:40.603
And what we've seen multiple times in our

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:44.316
mathematical careers is that
on a certain level you can

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:46.853
manipulate units in a lot of the same ways

00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:49.274
that you would manipulate
variables or numbers.

00:00:49.274 --> 00:00:53.402
So if power is equal
to work divided by time

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:56.226
we could also say that the units for power

00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:59.334
are going to be the units for work

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.909
divided by the units for time.

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.224
So the units for work...the units

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:09.680
for work right over here is Joules.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.602
And so we could write it's going to be

00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:16.510
Joules per and then the
unit for time is seconds.

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:21.491
So you might want to say
it's Joules per second.

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:25.206
But we don't see Joules per
second as a choice here,

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:27.054
so we probably want to expand out Joules

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:28.854
as being kilogram meters squared

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.183
per seconds squared so lets do that.

00:01:31.183 --> 00:01:33.065
So this is going to be equal to Joules

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:37.112
we can re-write as kilogram

00:01:39.848 --> 00:01:43.648
times meters squared over

00:01:43.648 --> 00:01:45.740
seconds squared and we are going

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.251
to divide all of that by seconds.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:53.749
And so what's that going to be?

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.475
Well we could re-write this,
this is going to be kilograms

00:01:57.475 --> 00:02:01.483
(and I'm intentionally trying
not to skip any steps),

00:02:01.483 --> 00:02:06.483
kilograms times meters
squared per seconds squared

00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:09.012
and dividing by seconds
is the same thing as

00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:10.976
multiplying by 1 over seconds.

00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:15.430
So times 1 over seconds and
so if we treat these units

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.515
the way that we might
treat things like variables

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:20.176
this would be equal to, in the numerator,

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:25.176
we would have kilogram
times meters squared

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.331
or kilogram times square meters

00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:29.531
over the denominator
you have seconds squared

00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:33.130
times seconds, you have
seconds to the third power.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.658
So a unit for power, one way
to express the units for power,

00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:39.925
could be kilogram meters
squared per second cubed.

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.705
And we see that this is this first choice

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:46.561
kilograms meters squared
per seconds cubed.
