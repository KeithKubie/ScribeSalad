00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To examine motionlessness, let's do an experiment in space.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Since we know that the laws of physics on earth are the same as those in the heavens,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
any experiment we can contrive that occurs in space

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
should teach us about something that could also occur on the earth.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, for this thought experiment, I want you to imagine drifting out alone in the cold depths of space.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Actually, for this experiment, I want us to be so deep in space that we can't even see the stars

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or the sun or the earth.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We are truly floating in the middle of nowhere.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
As far as we can tell, we are completely motionless.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now, let's say you turn on your flashlight,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because every good scientist floating in the depths of space remembers to bring their flashlight.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You turn on your flashlight, and off in the distance you see another astronaut floating

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
floating in the depths of space.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You're not alone. In fact, this other astronaut is slowing drifting towards you.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, I wonder what this astronaut was thinking before you turned the light on.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I wonder if she thought she was motionless or if she thought she was moving.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's clear that relative to each other you're moving towards each other.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But it's not clear to me who's moving. Maybe you know.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, I'm going to think about this question.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Which of these two astronauts is moving?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Is astronaut 1 the one whose truly moving?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Is astronaut 2 the one who's actually moving?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Maybe they're both moving

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Maybe neither of them is moving. Maybe they're both motionless.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Or, is it impossible to say?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I want you to really think about this question,

00:01:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and don't worry if you get it wrong because this is not a completely intuitive concept.
