00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay--I'd like to teach you about a new concept.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
These are called "HTML Attributes".

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
They look something like this.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We still have our opening TAG name

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and our closing , as before--with the slash.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But we have a new thing, called an "Attribute".

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Attributes have a name.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In this case, I just called it: ATTR equals--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and then you've got quotes, and a value is inside the quotes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And attributes, these days, always equal a value.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It didn't used to be the case, to be honest, but everything we're going to do

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
equals a value.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And tags can actually have multiple attributes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
An example of a tag that uses an attribute

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is the Anchor tag--which is the tag.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And a full example looks something like this:

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You've got the opening "

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
you've got an attribute called "href",

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
you've got its value--which, in this case, is a URL;

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you've got the contents,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and then you've got the closing anchor tag.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So if we were to render this in HTML, we would just

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
see the word, "derp"--but it would be a link to "reddit.com".

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Anchors are for making links.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Let's play around with this in our browser a little bit

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and see it in action.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Okay. So we've got our HTML from before.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm going to clean out some of these tags here

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so we have a little bit more room to work.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's make the words "HTML", here, a link.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So we're going to make an opening tag,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
an "href" to "www.w3c.org/html",

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and a closing tag.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
When we render this,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we see that HTML has turned into a link

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and if I were to click this

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
it would open this page--"w3c.org"--

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and a new window--pretty neat, huh?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Okay. So quick quiz:

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Take the phrase below--

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
we'll take the words, "my favorite" from the phrase below--

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and make those words a link to "udacity.com".
