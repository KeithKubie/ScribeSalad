00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:19.040
[ Silence ]

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.920
I'm Ted Widmer, the Director
of the John W. Kluge center,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.420
and I'm about to ask you to
turn off your cell phones,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.660
but I just remembered
I need to do it myself.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.410
So I'm going to take care of that.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.450
And then, I want to say
what a huge pleasure it is

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.390
to introduce Wayne
Wiegand, our speaker today.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.040
I'm relatively new to the
Library, as all of you know,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.760
and it's been such a pleasure
to begin to learn the history

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.130
of the Library of Congress
and to think about libraries

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.210
in this country and in our world.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.700
I had been in the Library about
one hour on my orientation day

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.940
when John Cole, who's with
us today, gave his history

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.920
for all the incoming employees.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.440 position:56%
And I listened rapt with fascination
and I'd been trying to read

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.410
about the library -- our library
-- in my not very ample free time.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.640
But I feel lucky a second time
because Wayne Wiegand has been here

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.420
for a lot of my time here and the
work he's doing in relationship

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.720
to the history of libraries

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.580
in this country could not be
more topical or more timely.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.450
I won't preempt his talk to
you today, but I just want

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.120
to say he's really taking a
historical topic and bringing it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.390
in a very relevant way to
ongoing social concerns.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.240
And if he won't tell you in his
talk today, I want to mention

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.500
that he's giving a talk on April
25th in Richmond, Virginia,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.340 position:56%
the James Branch Cabell Library,
entitled "Open These Hallowed Doors:

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.790
The Desegregation of Public
Libraries in the American South."

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.420
And I believe that's his next book
project; is that right, Wayne?

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.900
But he's here today to talk
to you about the history

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.190
of school librarianship
in our country.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.760 position:56%
His talk is entitled, "How Long, Oh
Lord, Do We Roam in the Wilderness?:

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.120
A History of School Librarianship."

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.320
He is the F. William Summers
Emeritus Professor of Library

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.050
and Information Studies and
Professor of American Studies

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.380
with a Ph.D. from Southern
Illinois University in 1974

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.510
with numerous scholarly
publications in both history

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.700
of libraries and American studies.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.400
His books include books "Books on
Trial: Red Scare in the Heartland,"

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.250
which came out in 2007 with
University of Oklahoma Press,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.940
coauthored with Shirley A. Wiegand,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.250
and named Book-of-the Month
Club for November, 2007.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.340
And addition to "Books on
Trial," he has authored

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.490 position:56%
over 70 scholarly articles and many
publications relevant to the history

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.950
of text technologies,
including "History of a Hoax:

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.800
Edmund Lester Pearson,
John Cotton Dana

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.490 position:56%
and 'The Old Librarian's Almanac,'"
"Politics of an Emerging Profession:

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.480
The American Library Association,
1876-1917," "An Active Instrument

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.430
for Propaganda: American Public
Libraries During World War I,"

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.730
again, very timely, and
"Irrepressible Reformer:

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.790
A Biography of Melvil K. Dewey."

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.550
I added the K because
I remember that initial

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.080
because I once saw it spelled out
and it was, I believe, Kossuth.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.230
He was named after the Hungarian
freedom fighter, Lajos Kossuth.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.320 position:56%
I forgot to mention, he's the
University of Florida in Tallahassee

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.560
and he also has served on the
faculty at the School of Library

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.520
and Information Studies at
University of Wisconsin-Madison

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.170
where he cofounded and served
as Co-Director of the Center

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.050
for the History of Print
Culture in Modern America.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.250
I could read many more
of his accomplishments,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.180
but I think I would
cut into his time

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.030
and you all came here
to hear to him.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.510
So without further ado,
please welcome Wayne Wiegand.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.510
[ Applause ]

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:28.120
[ Whispering ]

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.880
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Should
I predecease her,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.650
I've left my wife specific
instructions

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.400
about what to do with my remains.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.480
I told her, cremate me, take
my ashes, hide it in a book,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.420
and donate it to the Library
of Congress so I can spend it

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.960
with my friends in perpetuity.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.430
I've decided to modify
those instructions.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.320 position:56%
I'm going to ask her to divide my
ashes in two, half going into a book

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.030
into the Library of Congress.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.420
The other half going
into a book to be donated

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.860
to the John W. Kluge
Center because I've had

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.900
so much fun here the
past several months.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.200
Thank you, Ted.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.500
Thank you, Dan.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.800
Thank you, Travis.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.100
Thank you, Callie.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.400
Who am I missing?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.960
Mary Lou. Thank you all.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.330
Do look for the book after
you read my obituary, okay.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.790
People love school libraries
for a whole bunch of reasons.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.210
Some are obvious.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.190
In her autobiography,
"Speaking Truth to Power,"

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.100
Anita Hill remembers a seating
system her grade school teachers

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.430
crafted to reward achievement.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.770
Gradually moving high-achieving
students

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.210
who finish their assignments
early from seats located

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.060 position:56%
on an inner-schoolroom wall to seats
located on an outer wall where,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.220
under the windows, teachers had
placed the schoolroom library.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.660
After finishing her assignment
ahead of her 4th grade classmates,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.910
Hill recalled, she loved the
freedom to simply reach out

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.510
and pull whatever I wanted from
the shelf without leaving my seat

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.670 position:56%
or drawing attention to my idleness.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.470
She specifically mentions
Encyclopedias, geography,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.430
and history books, and
Nancy Drew Mysteries she

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.130
and her friends frequently shared.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.180 position:56%
Her recollection reflects a thirst
for information, a love of libraries

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.480
and the voluntary reading
they enabled.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.670
Some reasons people love
school libraries are not

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.240
so obvious, however.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.200
In response to an exam
question about library as place

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.870
for a course I taught
at the University

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.090 position:56%
of Wisconsin-Madison years ago, one
student wrote that in the mid-1980s,

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.770
his high school librarian was
being pressured to remove titles

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.350
about homosexuality
from the shelves.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.730
At the time, he was a
sophomore struggling

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.620
with his own sexual identity and
he wanted and needed those books.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.190
Then, something unusual
happened, title by title,

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.150
the librarian reported the books
lost, thus satisfying parents

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.300
and school superiors protesting
their presence in the collection.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.120
But, my student reported, somehow,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.800
he and his gay friends soon
discovered these lost books had

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.620
actually been misshelved
behind others

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.550
in a remote part of the library.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.030
There, they could access the
books freely and all understood

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.110
that any book taken
from the collection,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.690
which need not be checked out
since they were officially lost,

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.420
had to be returned
to the same place.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.920
The collection as still
there, intact,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.610
and including a few newer donated
titles, the day he graduated.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.890
Now, school library history is
full of anecdotes like this.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:54.820
And I could recount a number
of them over the course

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.360
of my remarks this afternoon.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.880
But what I really want to
do is to get at the essence

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.310
of school librarianship so
you understand the world

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.690
of control under which it operates.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.670
Let me explain my title.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.080
"How Long, Oh Lord, Do We
Roam In the Wilderness?"

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.080
It's a biblical passage and
it was the title of an article

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.620
by Marilyn Miller who
taught me when I was

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.770 position:56%
in library school back in the 1970s.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.160
She was a fairly well-known
figure in American librarianship,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.330
particularly school librarianship.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.740
And she was one of those
referred to as the "grand dams"

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.780
or the "grand dames," a group of
women who took hold of the world

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.250
of school librarianship
early in the 20th Century

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:48.130
and literally crafted the contours
of school library practice.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.980
Her title comes from
her frustration.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.300 position:56%
She had just gone through the great
society programs when the Elementary

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.450
and Secondary Education Act had
provided millions of dollars

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.280
to school libraries that
literally doubled their number

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.330
across the country and
quadrupled their collections.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:16.000 position:56%
That's one of the measures libraries
use to indicate impact and growth.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.590
But as the Nixon administration
withdrew funds from the Elementary

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.530
and Secondary Act titles,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.410
she noticed that there
wasn't a replacement

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.130
of that money with local funds.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.700
She was also frustrated
with the fact

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.580
that the American Library
Association,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.070
the major professional
association that governs --

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.650
functions as the Nation's
national library voice --

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.610
was not very friendly
to one of its divisions

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.220
in which she was operating,

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.460
the American Association
of School Librarians.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:10:00.210
And at the time, they were actually
contemplating leaving the American

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.490
Library Association, perhaps
joining with some division

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.310
in the National Education
Association.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.690
So she was frustrated.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.540
And that's why I take it
as my title because I want

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:16.950
to address the issue of, where
does school librarianship fit?

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.890
Now, when it comes to theories,
I happen to be promiscuous.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.210
I will consort with any theorist
I think will give me a framework

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.220
that helps me explain what
I'm finding historically.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.430
As a youth, I went through my
providential period, and then,

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.500
of course, as an undergraduate
in any University

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.360
of Wisconsin institution in the
1960s, I had my Marxist period.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.060
My wife often refers to
that as my red period.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.730
But what I find most comfortable

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.990
with this particular project
is the concept of discourse.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.390
What do I mean by discourse?

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:01.820 position:56%
Most scholars trace the concept to
French philosopher, Michel Foucault.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.960
And as Wikipedia explains,
humanities

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.950
and social science scholars, in
particular, harness this concept

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.780
to describe, not only a
culture's formal way of thinking

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.070
that can be expressed
through language, but also,

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.060
a social boundary that defines what
can be said about a specific topic.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.380
I took that concept of discourse,
added to it the word "professional"

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.900
in order to define what I perceived
to be a professional discourse

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.890 position:56%
which functions like a big
intellectual sandbox, plenty of room

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.480
to play with ideas, but one
nonetheless that has limits,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.940
a social boundary, if you will, in
which leaders employ a formal way

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.770
of thinking to educate and
enlighten members of a profession

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.710
who implements what they
learn to improve service

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.690
for the public's greater benefit.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.070
For school libraries,
that translates

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:59.880 position:56%
into the services they institute and
maintain, the collection, spaces,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.360
and resources that
they make accessible.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.240
The roots of contemporary school
library discourse trace back

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.020
to Benjamin Franklin whose first
order of books for the new Library

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.820
of Congress -- Library
Company of Philadelphia

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:19.510 position:56%
in 1732 emphasized useful knowledge
-- that's a term that comes directly

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:24.160
out of the enlightenment -- useful
knowledge, but ignored fiction.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.890 position:56%
By the time the American colonies
declared their independence in 1776,

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.320
western nations were rapidly
industrializing under capitalism.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.340
Unlike their rural counterparts,

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.570
industrial workers found their day
divided not by sunrise and sunset

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.910
and their year not by seasons, but
by a clock their employers used

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.070
to determine when work occurred.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:54.250 position:56%
To capitalists, work time was always
more important than non-work time

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.670
which evolved its own set

00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:00.050
of descriptors including
leisure or recreation.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.080
Capitalists consistently privileged
useful knowledge generated

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.340
to improve work above any
information considered leisure.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.050
School libraries serving
the information interests

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:16.610
of formal education naturally
mirrored these priorities.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.040
Western states operating

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.280
within capitalist economies also
privileged work information,

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.900 position:56%
but to that added public information
and stories the state regarding

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.930
so essential to the social order

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.780
that they constituted a canon
relevant literature, fiction

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.640
and non-fiction, to be
communicated to citizens

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.370
and taught in schools and colleges.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.480
School libraries serving
state interests also collected

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.310
and preserved these kinds of
public information and stories,

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.930
but they performed
these tasks within a set

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.960
of discursive formations.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.840
What are these discursive
formations?

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.480
Well, I'm going to show you
the portrait of a person

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.760
who has probably had more influence
on your life than you realize.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:08.320
That's Melvil Dewey, crafter of
the Dewey Decimal Classification.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.480
Ninety-five percent of
the school libraries,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.520
as well as public libraries, use
the Dewey Decimal Classification.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.840
As a matter of fact, in the
late 1890s, he was a competitor

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.940
for the position of
Librarian of Congress

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.730
and I'm thinking the only reason he
didn't accept it if it was offered

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.930
to him was because he had a
private club in Upstate New York

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.690
that he wanted to develop and he
was only going to spend nine months

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.560
of the year working here.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.310
At any rate, you can be sure that
if Melvil Dewey had been Librarian

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.120
of Congress, the collection here
would have been Dewey Decimal

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.130
Classification scheme.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:58.560
Now, Dewey was a student at
Amherst College from 1870 to 1874

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.200
and so he went through the Amherst
curriculum, he went through --

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.230
became acquainted with
Amherst teachers.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.330
In 1873, he took a part-time job
to help out with his finances

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.470
in the college library
and loved what he saw.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.990
But he thought this library
was not well-organized.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.090
So how to best organize it.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.240
He shopped around for other
classification systems

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.610
and fell upon a system
that was developed

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.840
at the St. Louis Public School
Library by William Torrey Harris,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:37.970
who later became Commissioner of
Education for the United States.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.650
Harris had built his
scheme on two sources.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:46.530
One, ideas of Sir Francis Bacon who
had argued that the three faculties

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:51.210
of the human mind, memory,
imagination, and reason,

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.950
produce three categories of
learning, history, poetry,

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.440
and philosophy, each of which
could be further subdivided.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:05.540
And two, the ideas of GFW Hegel
who inverted Bacon's order

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.350
to give a more prominent role to
philosophy and from which the rest

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.350
of the structure follows.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.720
From the philosophy, the
science containing all sciences,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.650
Harris saw a natural structure of
knowledge progressing to theology,

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.400
the science of the absolute,
government, philology, nature,

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.670
including mathematics, physics,
chemistry, and the natural science,

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.760
the useful and the
fine arts, and finally,

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.670
geography, biography, and history.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:38.140
That Dewey largely tapped Harris's
structure as the broad blueprint

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.800
for his own decimal scheme,
in order, they are philosophy,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.780
theology, sociology, philology,
natural science, useful arts,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.260
fine arts, literature, and
history, is hardly debatable.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.240
But in defining and identifying
the hierarchy of divisions

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.580
and sections he created beyond that
structure, Dewey looked elsewhere

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.550
for guidance, and particularly
to the Amherst college faculty,

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.380
the courses he took, and
the textbooks he had.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:12.420
So, I passed out a copy of the
Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.750
in its broad way, and I'm
going to show you how he picked

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.360
up things from his textbook.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.510
If you look at 1 --

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:23.340
[ Silence ]

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:30.280 position:56%
137, which is -- excuse me, 130,
which is labeled on the 23rd Edition

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:36.450 position:56%
of the Dewey Decimal Classification,
parapsychology and occultism,

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:42.090
for him, this was known
as temperaments.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.580
Okay. Temperaments.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:50.470
And he subdivided the temperaments
based on a theory he got

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.080
out of his textbook that somehow,

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.270
human emotions were
determined by body fluids.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.630
And so what particular
body fluids were flowing

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.330
around in your body determined
what kind of temperament you had

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:09.550
and that was cemented
into the 137 section

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.720
of the Dewey Decimal Classification
Scheme when he came to the Library

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.380
of Congress, which was in the
Senate building at the time,

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:23.390
in 1876 to copyright his scheme.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:30.430
Now, that scheme very well reflects
the white Anglo Saxon Protestant

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.000
patriarchal culture
in which he existed.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.330
And why do we have 23 editions

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.820
of the Dewey Decimal
Classification Scheme?

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:44.140
Because it's been a constant
effort to address the biases

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.990
and prejudices built
into that scheme.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:52.970
For decades now, I have been
trying to encourage scholars

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:58.360
to do a social history of the Dewey
Decimal Classification Scheme.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.470
All one has to do is
look at, for example,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:06.970
how W. E. B. Du Bois's book, "Souls
of Black Folk," has been treated

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.920
over the course of those 23
editions to see some element.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.450
I also have a paragraph
here on Native Americans.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.240 position:56%
Vestiges of systemic racism continue

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.700
to plague most western
cultural institutions.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.190
Libraries are simply
institutions that tell a story,

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.940
said Winnebago Tribal member
in Huntington Park, California,

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.760
public librarian, Michael
McLaughlin,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.520
in a 2005 "Native American
Times" article.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.690
It is the community
that decides what

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.850
that story is and how it is told.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.630
To McLaughlin, it was clear,

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.650
librarianship's practices
placed Native Americans

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.800
at a distinct advantage
in the story.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.130
Libraries told about them.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.150
For example, neither the Library

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.440
of Congress nor the Dewey Decimal
Classification adequately addresses

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.040
the histories and contemporary
realities of American

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.230
Indians. Neither had a
category for tribal sovereignty

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.780
that enjoyed equal status with
other systems of government.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:12.710
Similarly, while Picasso and
Monet were classified as art,

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.570
Indian sand paintings, pottery,
and basketry were classified

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.870
as crafts and primitive art.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.760 position:56%
And while Protestantism and
Catholicism found comfortable niches

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.840
in religion, Indian spiritualism
was found in mythology,

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.830
folklore, and other religion.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:34.920
In short, McLaughlin concluded,
every American Indian perspective,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.650
accomplishment, or
cultural belief practice

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.810
or material product according
to these classification systems,

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:46.090
is of a subordinate
or inferior nature.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:51.770 position:56%
So the Dewey Decimal Classification,
one footing in this set

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.740
of discursive formations
I'm describing,

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.970
has built into it a momentum --

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.930
excuse me, an inertia
which resists change.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.210
And I would ask each
of you, first of all,

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:09.330
how many of you have had public
school library experiences

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.990
as a child, young adult?

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.700
Okay. A number of you.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.500
And my guess is, the what you --

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.560
how you receive my remarks will
be conditioned by the experiences

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.550
that you had in those
school libraries.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:27.350
Ask yourself, if you were
first exposed in school

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.270
to the Dewey Decimal
Classification System,

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.520
is that how you perceive
the organization

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.750
of knowledge at this point?

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:40.630
How much influence has that
had on your subsequent life?

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.010
Now, let me move to this one.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.810
And this photo is going
to stay up for a while.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.930
What you see here is Dewey in
the middle of his first class

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:56.640
of library school students
at Columbia College in 1887.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.630
There's a story here.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.980 position:56%
Dewey became librarian at Columbia
College in 1883 and he always wanted

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.560
to start a library school.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.780
So he began organizing it,
began soliciting subscriptions,

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:16.550
began encouraging people to
apply in the fall of 1886.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.030 position:56%
What he didn't tell his superiors
was that he was going to admit women

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.100
to this school on the
all-male campus.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:29.160
Once the Board of Overseers found
out, they refused to allow him

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.460
to use school facilities.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.640
So what he did, instead, was went
across the street from campus

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.890
and opened up his school in
a storeroom above the chapel.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.940
This is a picture of
the individuals there.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.690
Now, notice the gender composition.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.480
Dewey's a male, a couple
of males on the left side.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.640
But the rest happen to be females.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:57.220
And they all knew they were
there under unique circumstances.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.870
It really wasn't a certified
school within the Columbia system.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.010
I call it a bootleg school.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.310
But here is where I think most

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:11.790
of the professional
discursive formations that we

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.830
in librarianship operate
under today took root.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.750
And let me explain how that works.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.710
First of all, because Dewey
could not determine --

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:32.800
he could not allow his students
to take course elsewhere,

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.130
he tapped into a set of
Saturday morning public lectures

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:42.020
that Columbia faculty
were expected to deliver.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:48.890
In the fall of 1886, he asked
those lecturers to deliver lectures

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:55.300 position:56%
on the best books and scholarship
that was emerging from their fields.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:00.750
You may recall between
1870 and 1900 was when most

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.600
of the professional
associations to which many

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.220
of you now belong emerged --
American Historical Association,

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.330
American Political
Science Association,

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.210
American Sociological Association,
American Economics Association --

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.680
each of which established a journal

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.910
in which reviews were a
major part of that activity.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.670
So what Dewey asked
his students to do,

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.480
females could attend Saturday
morning public lectures,

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.120
was go to specific lectures and
take notes so they would find

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.890
out what was the best literature
in each of these individual fields.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.100
Where's the locus of authority?

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:48.170 position:56%
It's not the library student nor the
librarian determining what is the

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:54.000
best book or article in the
literature, it is the professional

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.290
in that particular
discipline doing so.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:03.820
So those library school students
learned very early that's how you

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.010
determine what is the
best literature.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:10.730
You look to the professional
experts outside librarianship.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.010
That was one component
of their curriculum.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:19.520
Another component, Dewey brought
in a number of library luminaries

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.720
to inculcate what has become known

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:26.020
as the library faith,
or the library spirit.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.350
That word pops up a lot in
library literature and still pops

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:36.430
up on occasion as those of you
read it regularly can attest.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.140
It's built on a Jeffersonian
concept.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.010
In order for democracy
to function properly,

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:49.430
it needs an informed
citizenry, Thomas Jefferson said.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.450
And librarians simply extended it.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.460
In order to be in informed
citizenry,

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.020
libraries are essential
to democracy.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.060
Makes a great deal of sense.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.960
Added to that, particularly
at this time,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.110
comes Andrew Carnegie donating
his millions of dollars

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:11.690
for nearly 1700 public library
buildings across the country

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.740
and that whole Jeffersonian
principal public library library

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.290
faith got juiced with a whole
lot of growth all at once,

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.660
late 19th early 20th Century.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:26.820
About the same time, John Dewey
is positing his progressive theory

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.810
of education which is looking not
at kids as adults to be waited for,

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:38.470
but as children who
have central concern.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:47.400
Okay. So you have first, the
Dewey Decimal Classification

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.050
as one element in this
discursive formation.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:55.150
You've got the curriculum
where the indirect authority

00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:00.190
of librarianship is
practiced by external experts.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:03.110
Then, you've got the library
faith, and to that, then,

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:06.150
Dewey actually added a core.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.660
First, teach cataloging
and classification,

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.250
including subject headings.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.010
Subject headings do carry the same
kinds of biases and prejudices

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:20.340
and privileges that the decimal
classification scheme does.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.470
To that, add management.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:27.400
How do you manage a public -- a
school -- a library at this point?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.090
There wasn't a whole lot
of literature on that,

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:35.720
so a lot of internship kind
of activities took place.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.450
But always, the angle was, how to?,

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.040
because you already the
justification for why coming

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.720
out of the library faith.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:51.440
Now, I want to also note here in
the management of the library,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.280
Dewey happened to have started an
organization called the Library

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.810
Bureau in 1881.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.210
And the Library Bureau,
I'm willing to guess,

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.680
there is probably Library Bureau
furniture scattered hither and yon

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.670
about the Library of
Congress, if I'm not mistaken.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:11.300
It's that beautiful quarter-sawn
oak that is so sturdy,

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:18.460
under which generations of wads of
gum have been stuck for decades.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.830
At any rate, if you think
about a library room,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.890
there's a central command post.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.300 position:56%
It's built into the circulation desk

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.700
and you have a person
staffing that desk.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.400
Well, having told you about
this particular picture

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.820
and the gender composition of
that picture, you can well imagine

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.950
that the likelihood of the person
occupying that desk is going

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:52.370 position:56%
to be female and because she must
staff that desk and there are users,

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:57.580 position:56%
clients, all around her, should some
upheaval occur in a remote corner

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.980
of the library, she cannot leave
her command post which was built

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.340
into the architecture
of the library.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.760
So what does she do?

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.050
Sssh [Hush Noise].

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.190
You see the beginning
of the stereotype

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:16.060
of Marian the librarian emerging
from the very architecture

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.430
and the furnishings of the library.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.000
Another one besides
management is reference.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.570
That's kind of gone out of hand.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.870
We're not calling it
reference so much anymore.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:35.460
The direct line from reference
in the late 19th Century to 2017,

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.310 position:56%
we now call it information literacy.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.840
And finally, bibliography.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.300
It was very important for
library school students,

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.180
these people you see here,
to learn bibliography.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:55.950
And if you look at the emergence of
the printed works of the late 19th,

00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:00.040
early 20th Century, you see

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.710
these discursive formations
in evidence everywhere.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.750
Let's just go back to reference.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.960
You remember, "Reader's Guide
to Periodical Literature,"

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.810
those of you over the age of 25?

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:17.930
Now, the same kind of biases,
prejudices that manifest themselves

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.170
in the classification schemes
also manifest themselves

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.580
in "Reader's Guide to
Periodical Literature"

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:28.840
which never indexed a periodical
like the "Chicago Defender"

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.090
that went to a quarter
million African Americans.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:35.280
Nor did it ever index
"Colored American" which went

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.750
to about equally as many.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:43.930 position:56%
So for an individual who wanted to
look up a topic on African Americans

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:47.580
in the 1930s, go to a
school library and get their

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:52.180
"Abridged Reader's Guide,"
two of the major organs

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.470
of communication aren't
being indexed there.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.190
If it's not indexed, librarians
are not inclined to purchase them

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:03.660
because there's no
bibliographic access to them.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.180
Or, a series of bibliographies.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.130
When the Chicago World's
Fair started in 1893,

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.330
ALA had a huge booth and they
had a new publication called the

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.130
"Catalog of ALA Library."

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.090
It identified 5,000
books recommended

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.770
for any beginning library and
that was important because that's

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.380
when Carnegie was starting
to give out his money

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.950 position:56%
and they needed instant collections.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:32.330
What Dewey had his students
do was comb the reviews

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:36.270
of the American Historical Review,
the American Economics Review,

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.290
etcetera, all those
periodicals being put

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:45.110
out by the professional disciplines
for the best works, mark them,

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.970
and include them in
"Catalog of ALA Library."

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:53.340
This became a tradition and out of
it came in the early 20th Century

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.710
"Children's Catalog"

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.420
which recommended the
best books for children.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:02.780
Or course, didn't include any
Horatio Alger or subsequently,

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:07.520
Nancy Drew, or subsequently,
Goosebumps.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.450
In essence, catalogs like

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:15.770
"Children's Catalog" cemented a
particular set of literary canons

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:20.250
into existence and quinquennially,
these books would pop

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.710
up at school libraries, school
librarians would then take them

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.180
to their card catalog,
and the materials in the

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.660
"Children's Catalog" they
did not have were marked

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.060
for potential acquisitions.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:38.150
The materials in the "Children's
Catalog" that were not in the

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:42.240
"Children's Catalog" were
marked for what we call

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.780
"weeding" in the librarianship.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:48.260
So over the years, these
bibliographies became very powerful

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.270
and they include bibliographies
like the

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.830 position:56%
"Elementary School Library Catalog,"

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.570
the "Junior High School
Library Catalog,"

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:59.610
the "Senior High School Library
Catalog," which had a tendency,

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:04.030
in part, to homogenize
collections nationwide.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.940
So another discursive formation.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.570
What makes school librarianship
unique, however,

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:18.930
is that the women you see here
seized upon a vacuum of authority

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.150
for children's literature.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:26.090
In the late 19th Century, as
John Dewey's progressive theory

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:31.250
of education took root, the world
of children's publishing began

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.570
to emerge and grow significantly.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:39.550
No one was ready to take that
on in terms of evaluation

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:44.720
and so public school and
school librarians seized it

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.990
as their locus of authority.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:51.660
Now, all of the --
I have to say all --

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.530
well, I'll say, nearly all of
the individuals who were part

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.930
of that group looked like
these people here, white,

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:08.030
middle class females who were
educated in particular ways

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.510
to like particular
kinds of literature.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:16.940
They evolved a set of canons that
those bibliographies reinforced

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:22.710
that looked askance at what the
popular literature of the day was.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.870
And all of those books tended

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:30.920
to celebrate the white Anglo Saxon
Protestant Patriarchal culture.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:37.150
Come the 1950s, 1960s, and I'm
just going to stick with this world

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.810 position:56%
of children's literature, right now.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:43.390
Come the 1950s, 1960s,
and the feminist movement

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:50.240
and the civil rights movement, a
woman named Nancy Larrick began

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.400
to look at these literatures
and say, hey, wait a minute.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.020
I don't see any black faces
in children's literatures.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:01.620
They're not getting an
analysis of how black kids live

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:05.480
and black kids aren't getting an
analysis of how black kids live.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.240
She went back to the school library
and said, hey, wait a minute.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.090
The females who are depicted in
this literature are generally

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.490
in subordinate positions to males.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:20.380
The active ones are males,
the passive ones are females.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:26.660
So having come to know that,
the school library people began

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:31.450
to recognize that they had
cemented into existence

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:35.120
in their literature
collections the very biases

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.360
that they wanted to fight against.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.600
I don't think they ever said,
you know, we've made a mistake.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:48.560 position:56%
And, come the 1980s, post-Stonewall,
there began to be a recognition

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.160
of differences in sexuality.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:59.580
So those are the three footings
of the discursive formations

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.210
of school librarianship discord.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.190
But I'm going to add a fourth one.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:10.000
And that is, the commitment to
intellectual freedom and opposition

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.300
to censorship that
finds its rhetoric

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.240
in what's called the
Library Bill of Rights.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.120
The Library Bill of
Rights was passed

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.810
by the American Library
Association in 1939.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:24.190
The word "race" is included in it.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:28.330
And it came as a result
of observations

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:33.490
of the Nazi party burning
Jewish books in Nazi Germany.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:39.940
"Grapes of Wrath" being banned
in schools and libraries

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.340
across the country, 1939, 1940.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.220
And Chinese librarians
saying, please help us

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.680
after the Japanese had
conquered China in the 1930s

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.800
and began burning their libraries.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.230
So Library Bill of Rights.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.880
To it, the school librarians

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.890
in the early 1950s added the
School Library Bill of Rights

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:02.920
which modifies it for
particular school librarianship.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.620
But the Library Bill of
Rights, even though it sounds

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.770
like it's got the force
of law, has no teeth.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:13.010
If anyone in this room
chooses to challenge a book

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:19.290 position:56%
in the local school library and is
a powerful figure in local politics,

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.430
the librarian has two choices,

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:24.220
potentially lose her
job or fight you.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.300
If the librarian chooses to fight
you, no one will come to her aid

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.500
to pay for the legal
expenses required to do so.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.680
So the Library Bill of Rights,
though it sounds good and is part

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.490
of the library rhetoric,
doesn't have teeth to it.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.050
Publicity helps, of
course, but once again,

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.160 position:56%
the locus of authority is elsewhere.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:51.060
Just like, what are best
books is allocated to others,

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.860
the locus of authority in
the school library resides

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.220
with the school system.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.550
It could be the principal,
could be the superintendent,

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.970
could be very vocal
members of the public

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:04.220 position:56%
who bring their issues to attention.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.130
So these are the constraints

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:10.390
under which school
librarians have operated

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:13.980
since the late 19th Century.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:20.060
School librarianship itself is
largely a 20th Century phenomenon.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:28.700 position:56%
It wasn't until compulsory education
made more and more people come

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:32.710
to school, until high
schools became commonplace

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.540 position:56%
that school librarianship took root.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:40.770
And for every generation of school
librarianship, it has been females

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.280
who have been the leaders.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.350
They were the ones who established

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.400
within the American
Library Association early

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.840
in the 20th Century that
later became a division

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.980 position:56%
of the American Library
Association in post-World War II era

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.290
that then threatened to leave
the American Library Association

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:02.480
because the leaders didn't think
that they were operating properly.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.580
So how long do we roam
in the wilderness?

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.720 position:56%
I would argue, that's your home,
the wilderness because you're caught

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.520
between the world of librarianship
with its discursive formations

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.970
and the world of education
where the real power is.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:29.400
In order for school librarians to
be participants in the practice

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.370
of education, they're
the ones who have to go

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:37.010
to the education community and
tell them, hey it's working

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:41.060
out just fine, we can contribute
to the educational process.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.120
That's one of the things I
found out while I was here.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:51.870
But let me just finish with,
that's not all there needs to be.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:57.830
There is no holy book in which
God says what a library should be.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:00.040
A library is what

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.630
people make of it.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:06.460
Now, two years ago, I published
this book, " Part of Our Lives:

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.100
A People's History of the
American Public Library"

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.850
for which I thank the National
Endowment for the Humanities

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.360
for the fellowship that
allowed me to do it.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.320
In that book, I discovered
by listening to the voices

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.030
of the people who used public
libraries that they use it

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.290
for three main reasons,
A) information access.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.970
And in librarianship, we're
all about information access.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:31.900
I'm not disparaging that all.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.080
B) The library as a place.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:40.500
More than a third place, as Ray
Oldenburg would describe it.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.480
It's a place where community
gets constructed in a whole bunch

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.650
of different ways through a
whole bunch of different forums

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:50.500
through the space it provides.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.550
And C) through the
social nature of reading.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:59.990
We often think of reading as
a solitary act, and it's not.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.240
It combines us with other people.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.510
And I think -- let me
just give you some --

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:12.520
[ Rustling of Papers ]

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:17.110
Recent research in
neuroscientific --

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:22.020
recent neuroscientific research
has demonstrated how narrative

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:27.100
in fiction activates
particular parts of the brain,

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.120
including the sensory
and motor cortexes.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.260
In her summary of this research,
Annie Murphy Paul notes, the brain,

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.780
it seems, does not make much of
a distinction between reading

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:41.180
about an experience and
encountering it in real life.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:46.120 position:56%
In each case, the same
neurological regions are stimulated.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.680
One researcher, she reports,

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.330
found that fiction offered readers
the opportunity to enter fully

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:53.750
into other people's
thoughts and feelings.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.430
Another saw substantial overlap
in the brain networks used

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:59.680
to understand stories
and the networks used

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.710
to navigate interactions
with other individuals.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.980
In particular, interactions in
which we're trying to figure

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.970
out the thoughts and
feelings of others.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:12.390
Other researchers suggest
reading fiction is an exercise

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:14.740
that hones our real
life social skills

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.850
and that regular fiction
readers seem to be better able

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.680
to understand other
people, empathize with them,

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.350
see the world from
their perspective.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:28.110
Fiction, notes Keith Oatley, is
a particularly useful simulation

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:31.970 position:56%
because negotiating the social world
effectively is extremely tricking

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:35.320
requiring us to weigh up
myriad interacting instances

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.210
of cause and effect.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.600
Just as computer simulations
can help us get to grips

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.120
with complex scientific
problems, so novels, stories,

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.790
and dramas can help us understand
the complexities of social life.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:54.460
Do y'all remember what the Dewey
Decimal Classification System does

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.250
with fiction?

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.270
It ignores it.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.330
Fiction has been the
bastard stepchild

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:05.530
of library collections
for 150 years.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:10.440
But let me give you two
experiences of reading fiction,

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.520
particularly popular fiction.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.190
After her father died in 1963,

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:21.560
9-year old Sonia Sotomayor
buried herself in reading

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.430
at her Broncs library in
the apartment she shared

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.060
with her mother and her brother.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.770
Nancy Drew had a powerful hold on
my imagination, she remembered.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.400 position:56%
Every night, when I finished reading
and got into bed and closed my eyes,

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:39.060
I'd continue the story with me in
Nancy's shoes until I fell asleep.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.910
Her mind, she noted, worked in
ways very similar to Nancy's.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.970
I was a keen observer and listener.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.270
I picked up on clues.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:49.570
I figured things out logically
and I enjoyed puzzles.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:53.110
I loved the clear, focused feeling
that came when I concentrated

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:58.010
on solving a problem and
everything else faded out.

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:03.270
Every single female Supreme Court
member read Nancy Drew as a kid.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:06.280
Nancy Drew never shows
up in the bibliographies

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.410
of school library collections.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:09.710
Last example.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:15.440
In 1984, President Ronald
Reagan wrote the daughter-in-law

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.200
of Harold Bell Wright whose
best-selling 1920s religious novel,

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.720
"That Printer of Udell's,"
Reagan read

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.800 position:56%
as an adolescent in Dixon, Illinois.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.640
Shortly after reading the book,

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.770
he declared himself
saved and was baptized.

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:35.550 position:56%
The novel's protagonist Reagan wrote
Wright's daughter-in-law 60 years

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.960
later, served as a role
model that shaped his life.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.150 position:56%
It's likely that copy of "That
Printer of Udell's" Reagan read came

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.250
from the Dixon Public Library
which he visited twice weekly

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:51.260
in the early 1920s often reading
on the Library's front steps.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.270
So, you've got the discourse
of school librarianship.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:45:00.670
It's an intellectual sandbox in
which you can play with a whole lot

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.870
of stuff, but it's got boundaries.

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:07.500 position:56%
And I would argue, if you look
toward the social nature of reading,

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:12.910
if you look towards the library
as place and don't be bound

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:15.440
by the discourse of
school librarianship,

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.930
history would suggest there
are some opportunities

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:19.760
out there to be seized.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.560
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.800
I'll be happy to take questions.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.100
Whoops. Excuse me.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:40.440
Oh, I -- one thing -- I
almost knocked your --

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.750
while here, I have been checking
the obituaries of the Grande Dames

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:50.050
and every generation
of female leaders

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.470
of the school library profession.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:58.300
And I am absolutely struck with
how many of them are lesbian.

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:03.320
I think women who shared
this evangelical belief

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:11.080 position:56%
in what libraries could do, who were
same sex, found a comfortable place

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:16.240
to practice librarianship
-- to practice a profession.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.960
Now, I need more information.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.420
I need to interview
individuals who are my age

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.490
because Marilyn Miller was
one of those individuals --

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.690 position:56%
the one who wrote, "How Long, Oh
Lord, Do we Roam in the Wilderness?"

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:33.630
And I need to interview more to
see if indeed that the number

of what were called "Boston
marriages" at the time,

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.140
the number of Boston
marriages exceeds the norm

Hi. Thank you.

You had said that a
researcher had said

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:01.160
that the brain does
not make a distinction

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.410
between a fictional
narrative and real life.

I took this from a "New York
Times" Sunday morning paper article

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:25.130
and this Annie Paul Murphy cited
several scholars who were working

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:28.060
on social neuroscience reading.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.390
And that's what I'd
have to give you.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:31.690
I can't remember.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.440
Keith Oatley is the name
that comes particularly

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.800
to mind, but there were others.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.840
There are a number of these
research experiments going

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.210
on around the country.

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:46.150
We live in an age where the
education profession is being

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.900
pressed towards testing
and measurement.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.190
In that kind of an environment,

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.570
school libraries don't
prosper very well.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:48:03.500
So the discoveries by social
neuroscientific scientists may not

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:08.630
directly apply to the current
situation unless we come

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:12.650 position:56%
up with enough funding to restore --

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.530
I live now in the State
of California

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:18.870
where the State has made a
decision that schools don't have

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.170
to employ school librarians.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:24.230
So if school librarian --
school libraries exist,

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:29.340
they're usually held open
by volunteer parents.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.540
Dan?

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.850
&gt;&gt; You made a number of comments

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:42.540
about how the classification system
tends to solidify a particular sort

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:47.760
of intellectual bias and
that may change over time.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.530
But I don't think you've
addressed the question of,

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:52.780
is that a good or bad thing?

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.250
And if it's a bad thing,
are there --

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:58.760
is there some way of dealing with
that and eliminating the bias?

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.620
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: It's
an inevitable thing.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.660
No. There is -- all you can
do is keep paying attention.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:11.870
At least, that's what
history tells me.

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:15.340
23 editions of the Dewey
Decimal Classification Scheme.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:21.820
I think the Library of Congress
subject headings identified

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:27.090 position:56%
homosexuality as a sexual perversion
up until the middle of the 1970s,

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:30.820
you know, and so pressure's
brought to bear and changes occur.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:35.870
This summer, thanks to the National
Endowment for the Humanities

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.430
which gave me a summer
stipend, thank you very much.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:41.710
I will be going to the
University of Illinois where one

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:46.000
of Dewey's best students went.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.490
Huge library system that
still uses the Dewey Decimal

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:52.030
Classification Scheme.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.600
It's too expensive to change.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.260
They can't possibly do it.

00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:00.170
So that's built into
the inertia to change.

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:04.930
&gt;&gt; I Had a question about --

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.570
you suggested several times
about the marginalization

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:10.290
of fiction in school libraries.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:13.520
But I was a school librarian
here in D.C. for seven years

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.090
and I would suggest
it's not the library

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:19.480
that is marginalizing fiction.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.020
It is the educational curriculum.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.320
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Sure.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:28.120
&gt;&gt; And their desire always to have
children only reading non-fiction.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.160
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: I'm not
going to debate with you.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:35.750
My youngest son and his
wife are well-healed.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:42.050
They own a $4 million home on top
of a hill in suburban San Francisco

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:47.530
and across the street is the public
school to which my grandson goes.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:52.810
Shortly before -- last
time I was visiting home,

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:57.190
they held a fundraiser for the
library which was a Jay Gatsby kind

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.290
of thing, pictures of my
son in a Jay Gatsby uniform,

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.000
pictures of my daughter-in-law

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.890
in whatever she wore
-- Jay Gatsby's Zelda.

00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:09.470
Yeah. Okay.

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.400
All right.

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.370 position:56%
So anyhow, they raised $100,000
that evening for the school library.

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:21.880 position:56%
That library's going to have that
fiction because it's well-supported.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.180
So you're right.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.530
Where education, and that's
the locus of authority

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:31.300
for the school library, it's
what the curriculum dictates.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:38.200 position:56%
Most states have bibliographies that
they send out to school libraries

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.780
from which school librarians
select materials.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.150
I don't know if your state did.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:45.450
California does.

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:46.750
They still do it.

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:51.810
So that already restricts
the universe of possibilities

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:54.900
in some respects unless
you can get extra money

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.990
to buy the materials you want.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:04.300
Now, my son's -- my grandson's
school is radically different

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:07.960
from the school located
in downtown Oakland

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.060
to which poor kids [inaudible].

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:14.180
The school library in one
is significantly different

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.000
than the school library
in the other.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.390
So it's tied to funding, too.

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.190
Yes?

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:25.040
[ Whispering and Commotion ]

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.340
Oh, sorry.

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.640
Brenda, just a second.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.940
&gt;&gt; Sorry. Sorry.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.240
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: I think you
need to get the microphone first.

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.460
&gt;&gt; Sorry. Thank you very much
for this fascinating lecture.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.740
I have three short
intertwined questions.

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:41.110
The first follows on the
question of fiction and its place

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:42.410
in the Dewey Decimal System.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.020
You mentioned that it has
been ignored over the course

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.270
of 23 editions and I was curious
what the relationship of fiction

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:49.590
to literature may have been

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:52.990
because there's an 800
class titled literature,

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:57.230
and I've always been interested
in the tacit separation of fiction

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.100
and literature in some
bookstore layouts for instance.

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.020
I would be interested in
knowing how this plays

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.380
out in library classification.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.030
Related question has to do with --

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:07.330
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Can
I answer one at a time?

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:08.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:09.930
Sure.

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:11.920
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: I'm old now and
I may forget the first one you ask.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.220
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.520
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: When you open the

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.500
"New York Times" book
review this Sunday morning,

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.440
I'm willing to bet a month's Social
Security check that you're going

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.470
to see the words, serious
reading four of five times.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:26.770
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.440
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: You
know where that started?

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:34.300
In the early 19th Century when
the publishing industry began

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:40.240
to recognize that women were
becoming increasingly literate

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.090
and that they wanted a
particular kind of fiction,

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:46.870
the publishing industry
began to supply it.

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:49.680
And largely, they were romances.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.600
Well, in the male-dominated
reviewing media,

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.700
they would review these materials

00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:01.450
and they'd call it
"mere" reading, m-e-r-e.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:06.330
Whereas, opposed to the other kind
of reading was, "serious" reading.

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.590
Now, that phrase has come
down to us to the present day

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:12.650
and it has baggage, obviously.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:14.580
So what you see addressed

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:21.220 position:56%
in the 800s is what cultural
leaders regard as "serious" reading.

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.820
&gt;&gt; That's very helpful.

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:29.270
It's amazing how that term,
"mere reading" [inaudible] women.

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:33.530
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: The journey
towards today includes mind candy,

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:37.090
trash, and it all fits
into that, you know,

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:41.360
recreational reading just isn't
as important as useful knowledge

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.470
or information that
computers can manipulate.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.050
I'm not disparaging that, mind you.

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:53.860
It's just -- and Sonia Sotomayor,
she found Nancy Drew compelling.

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:56.710
&gt;&gt; Right. Which justifies
the importance of fiction.

00:54:56.710 --> 00:55:02.080
Yeah. So the related question
had to do with the classification

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:06.020
of languages and literatures that
are essentially outside the pale

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.890
of the west, broadly
speaking, as other --

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:11.710 position:56%
other languages, other
literatures, and what you had to say

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:16.070
about how classification
centralizes certain forms --

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:19.240
or centers certain forms of
knowledge and marginalizes

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.260
and implicitly subordinates others.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:25.430
So I was curious about that as
well because the architecture

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:28.300
of libraries sometimes
mimics this kind

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.040
of architecture of classification.

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.420
Even here at the Library
of Congress,

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:35.460
you have the main reading
room where a certain vision

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.500
of the West is centered and then,
the other rooms are satellites

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.030
and often the architecture of
those rooms reflects, you know,

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:43.430
a kind of pantheon also
of Western thinkers.

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:46.450
So you go into the African
Middle-Eastern studies,

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.320
African Middle-Eastern reading
room and you look up and you see,

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.240
you know, Darwin and, you know,
Mozart and Bacon and so forth.

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.540
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: If
I may interrupt.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.830
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: And if you
look at the school library walls

00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:02.790
of the 1930s in Birmingham,
Alabama, you've got Robert E. Lee.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:06.160
If you look at the school library
walls in Madison, Wisconsin,

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.950
at the same time, you've
got Abraham Lincoln.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:11.250
&gt;&gt; That's fascinating.

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:15.400
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: The walls
demonstrate the cultural priorities

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.950
of the locality.

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.590
So I'm sorry to interrupt you.

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:20.040
That was a teachable moment.

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.890
I thought I'd seize it.

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:26.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Great. We have time for one more.

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:29.530
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Brenda's
got to get a question here.

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:32.350
She came all the way from
Alexandria, Virginia.

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:40.260
&gt;&gt; Wayne, in the course of your
research, what did you discover

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:45.890
about the ways in which
and the degree

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:50.920
to which municipal
funding played a part

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.190
in the operation of
school libraries.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:54.490
&gt;&gt; Wayne Wiegand: Yeah.

00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:59.780
School libraries depend almost
entirely on local funding.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.440
It's like 95 percent.

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:08.180
The only time that there was a
significant change was in those war

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:11.960
and poverty programs coming out
of the Johnson era and that's

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.190
when they just literally
doubled in number

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:15.870
and quadrupled in collections.

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:17.970
And there was a whole
bunch of money available

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:21.180
for other media kinds of things.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.740
But it's directly tied
to local funding.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.820
You live in a poor district,
you're generally going

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.810
to have poor school libraries.

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:29.720
You live in a wealthy
district, you're generally going

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.730
to have good school libraries
staffed by professionals

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:39.620
who ask questions and
participate in the instruction.

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:42.230
Am I done, now?

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:43.530
Okay.

00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:45.380
&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: I want to just
invite you all to a talk next week

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:47.520
at the same time, Timothy Breen

who is another senior chair
here at the Kluge Center.

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:53.100
We'll be talking on
new interpretations

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.850
of the American Revolution.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:58.510
