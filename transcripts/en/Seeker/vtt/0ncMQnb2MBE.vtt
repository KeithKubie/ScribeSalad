00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.590
You can tell a lot about a person just from
their hair.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.839
Like I can look at you and know if you’re
bald just like that.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.370
Hi everyone, Julian for DNews.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.360
A person’s hair reveals a lot of secrets
about them, and you can uncover them.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.830
Not by interpreting clumps of human hair with
pilimancy or some other form of heresy, but

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.830
with science.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.912
I’m going to wager you’ve seen the detective
shows where they find a single hair at the

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:30.250
crime scene, extract the DNA from it, find
the murderer, and then David Caruso puts on

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.840
his sunglasses and says something like, “He
almost got away with it but he was just a…

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.840
hair short.”

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.460
It’s true that hair can be used to pull
a DNA sample, but it’s a lot harder than

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.820
those shows make it seem.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.780
See, most of your hair is dead cells.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.800
When they die they are pressed together to
form a protein called keratin and new cells

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.960
are generated underneath them by the root.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.260
In the process though, the nucleus inside
the cell gets destroyed and the DNA goes with

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.039
it, so usually to get a hair sample with any
useful DNA, it has to have the root attached.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.400
Rarely some DNA will survive cornification,
but finding hair at a crime scene is not the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.690
smoking gun it’s always made out to be.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.860
Incomplete hair may help determine maternal
lineage though.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.940
Because mitochondrial DNA is passed from mother
to offspring and is thousands of times more

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.710
abundant than nuclear DNA, it’s easier to
get a sample to analyze.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.560
But even without the root, hair can be full
of secrets.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.260
Keratin has sulfur atoms that bond to trace
elements, which explains why Trace is so hairy.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.080
Anyway these elements can give away what you’ve
been putting in your body.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.840
I know a lot of you immediately thought about
drugs.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.700
And it’s true, drug tests can find out if
someone’s been using marijuana or opiates

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.840
or amphetamines or PCP.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.229
And since those elements bind to your hair
when the hair is forming, the longer your

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.960
hair, the farther back the test goes.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.090
So if you’re a hippy with dreads finally
applying for that big government job, that’s

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.140
another reason to get a haircut.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.920
Don’t think shaving your head bald will
help either, because your hair is everywhere,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.460
screaming infidelities.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.570
Like your body hair.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.040
Drug tests can use that too, and since body
hair doesn’t grow like the hair on your

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.220
head, it could actually represent a longer
timeframe, possibly up to a year, though there

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.909
are no conclusive studies on that.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.099
Either way though, it hurts your chances of
passing a drug test if you’re a hairy pothead.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.489
Interestingly it takes about 5 to 7 days for
forming hair to start protruding past the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.560
scalp, so you could do a bunch of drugs and
pass a hair drug test that same day.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.620
But, y’know, don’t do a bunch of drugs.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.620
Please.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.889
Keratin’s tendency to grab trace elements
can be used to divine more mundane things

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:26.889
too.

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.140
It can tell us what someone’s diet is.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.329
This fact makes it useful for studying animals
like bears.

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.529
Researchers have actually developed a new
technique that runs a laser down the length

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.019
of a single bear hair and vaporizes it.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.349
The gas is then analyzed by a mass spectrometer.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.019
The old method involved analyzing bunches
of hair which gave them a general idea of

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.310
what they had been eating.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.599
Doing it this way lets them easily tell exactly
when their diets change and monitor how much

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.579
mercury they’re getting from fish.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.620
Plus I imagine it’s safer running up and
plucking one hair off a grizzly than grabbing

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.620
entire handfuls.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.569
So, the eternal question still stands: does
she or doesn’t she dye her hair?

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.480
Only her hairdresser knows for sure.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.099
Unless it’s blue, then we can all tell,
because blue almost never happens in nature.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:33.869
Trace explains why here.
