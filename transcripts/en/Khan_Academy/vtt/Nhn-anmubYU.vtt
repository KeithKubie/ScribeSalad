00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:02.770
Good morning.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.660
Actually I don't know
what time it is for you,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.680
it's morning for me.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.490
Welcome to the presentation
on slope and y-intercept.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.740
This presentation isn't going
to teach you how to solve for

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.760
slope and y-intercept, but
hopefully it will give you

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.660
a good intuition of what
slope and y-intercept is.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.380
And we're going to do something
a little bit different

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.800
this time as opposed to
what we normally do.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.880
We're not going to use the
chalkboard, we're actually

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.490
going to go on to the Khan
academy website and use the

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.210
graph of a line exercise to get
a little bit of an intuition

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.810
for what slope and
y-intercept is.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.420
So when the application starts
off, it starts with the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.360
equation y equals 1x plus 1.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.820
So that's the same thing
as y equals x plus 1.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.790
But we see that the
slope here is 1.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.580
If you looked at the
introduction to graphing that

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.430
I talked about, the slope is
the same thing is the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.310
coefficient on the x term.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.910
And if you see here,
whenever we move over

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.600
by 1, we move up by 1.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.710
And I'm going to do another
module on that slope is

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.070
actually rise over run.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.510
So it's for every amount
you rise, how much do you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.990
have to run to get that?

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.940
And rise just means how much
do you change in y, run means

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.310
how much do you change in x.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.070
So here rise over run is just
1, and y-intercept is where

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.550
you intercept the y-axis.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.160
Now, as I change the slope and
the y-intercept for this graph,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.770
I think it's going to make a
little bit more sense to you.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.440
Watch what happens when the
slope goes from 1 to 3/2.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.970
So 3/2 is the same
thing is 1 and 1/2.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.830
So notice it got steeper.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.460
And if I increase the slope
more it gets steeper even

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.530
more, and y equals 2x.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.960
If I increase any more
5/2 is 2 and 1/2.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.200
So the more I increase
the slope, I think you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.940
see what's happening.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.380
This thing jumps around.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.030
I should fix that.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.100
Let me move it back.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.400
And actually, the goal is to
make the line go through

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.490
those two blue points.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.900
That's the goal of I guess
you'd call it the game.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.070
I don't like how this thing
jumps around though.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.835
That was interesting,
let me go back there.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.460
y equals 0x plus 1.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.800
We could have rewritten this as
just y equals 1, because 0x

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.700
is the same things as 0.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.730
And notice it's a
completely flat line.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.190
No matter what x is y is 1.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.580
And that makes sense because
this equation would

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.750
just be y equals 1.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.190
Now I've been showing you
what happens to the slope.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.395
Now notice we have
a negative slope.

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:24.560
The slope is now
downwards sloping.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.610
It's downward sloping
at a slope of 1/2.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.020
Because let's say the rise in
this situation is negative

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.810
1, and the run is 2.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.500
So that's why we get
negative 1 over 2.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.880
And we had just been doing
slope so far and I think you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.170
get the idea that as we
decrease slope, it's going to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.640
push the line further and
further-- it's going to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.720
slope downward even more.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.490
I hate to use a word in its own
definition, but I think you

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.030
see that now in the picture.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.520
Now let's put up the
y-intercept a little bit.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.460
And this is even
more interesting.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.980
So y-intercept-- oh boy, how
did that happen, that was

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.760
strange --y-intercept--

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.820
Notice, negative 1x plus 2, so
the slope is negative 1 but it

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.420
intersects the y-axis at 2.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.615
Now if we increase y-intercept
by 1 more it's just going

00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:15.570
to push this line up 1.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.670
Let's do that.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.940
See.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.110
Oh, this is actually increasing
it by increments of 1/2.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.690
Let's do another one, I just
want to see what happens

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.530
on another graph.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.670
It actually depends on
the actual problem.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.350
OK, this is interesting.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.140
OK, this is the same thing.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.600
We start at the same point.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.030
Let's actually try to figure
out the equation of a line that

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.120
goes through these two points.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.150
Well, let's see.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.890
It looks like the y-intercept
if is going to have to

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.970
be a little bit lower.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.980
I do not get why
it would do that.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.240
It just brings the line down
as we lower the y-intercept.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.520
And let's see I think the slope
needs to be higher, because

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.100
those two points, the line that
goes through them is

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.270
definitely steeper.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.980
I apologize for this
thing acting up like.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.530
That looks like about
the right slope.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.320
The slope is like that, and
these two points are connected.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.240
Yeah, I think that looks like
the right slope, but the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.470
y-intercept has to be lower.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.875
Almost there, I think.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.690
There you go!

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.970
So the equation of
this line is 7/4x.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.410
So 7/4, that's the same
thing as like 1.75.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.360
So the slope of this line
slopes faster than 1/1 and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.540
you can kind of see that.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.300
I'll show you how to figure out
all this, I just want to give

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.980
you an intuitive sense of what
sloping and y-intercept is.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.520
And it intersects the
y-axis at negative 13/4.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.210
That's a little more than 3,
which you can-- negative

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.860
3 --which you can
see right there.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.890
Let's see if we can
do another one.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.120
And if you want, we can assign
this module to you and you can

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.380
play with it just like
I'm doing right here.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.290
So let's see, the line that
we want to get will go

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.320
something like that.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.540
Looks like the current line's
slope is a little too high.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.130
Let me lower the
slope a little bit.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.420
That looks about right.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.140
7/8, so that means for every
8 you move to the right

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.580
you're going to move 7 up.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.790
And I'm going to draw that
better in another module.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.470
This module I'm kind of doing
on the fly, so I apologize.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.920
I do every model on the
fly so I guess I really

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.390
should apologize.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.350
But you're not paying for this,
so I shouldn't apologize.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.240
Oh, I distracted very easily.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.180
Let's see, let's
move this line up.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.660
And you do that just
by the y-intercept.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.860
You can see shifting the
y-intercept up just shifts

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.890
the line straight up.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.200
It doesn't change the
inclination of the line.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.100
The slope changes the
inclination of the line.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.190
There we go.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.390
The equation of this
line is 7/8x plus 13/4.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.060
Let's see if what I said about
slope is right if we move.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.640
If we run 8, we should rise 7.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.040
So let's see.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.080
Run 8.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:02.090
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.790
So that gets us right there.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.670
And then we should rise 7.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:14.930
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.740
Well that actually gets
us those exact points.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.250
And we're back on
the line again.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.170
I'm going to draw another thing
like that for you so if you get

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.240
confused don't lose heart.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.370
Let's do one more.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.800
OK.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.090
Where's the other dot?

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.560
I don't know.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.610
Let me see.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.870
The other dot doesn't exist.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.170
I gotta fix all these
bugs in this thing.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.540
Oh there.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.830
Good.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.440
It showed up.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.020
It showed up.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.850
Excellent.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.090
OK, so look.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.530
We have to make the line go
through these two points.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.910
It looks like the slope
is negative, definitely.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.120
Not that negative, it's like
a fractional negative slope.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.720
And it'll intercept the y-axis
somewhere around here.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.400
The y-intercept is going to
be like 7 and something.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.360
7 and change.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.910
So first of all let's
get this slope down.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.110
Oh boy.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.410
This thing is going to
jump around again.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.410
Notice y equals 0, x plus 1.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.020
If we increase the slope.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.300
This thing is doing all sorts--
I haven't seen this application

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.130
in a while, so I must've
written it when I had inferior

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.180
programming skills, let me keep
--OK, that slope

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.160
might be right.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.960
Let's bring the line up higher.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.200
No, it still seems like my
slope-- see the y-intercept,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.215
I'm raising the line.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.830
Oh good, I got it
exactly right.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:32.620
And I was right.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.310
The slope is negative, because
you can see it slopes downward.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.710
But it's not sloping
downward that fast.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.130
And that make sense, that
the slope is negative 1/3.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:49.850
And that makes sense because if
we run 3, 1, 2, 3, we rise

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.060
negative 1, we rise negative 1.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.540
Right there.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.940
So that's why the slope
is negative 1/3.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.530
And then the
y-intercept is 22/3.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.170
Well that's 7 and 1/3.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.650
And right there, we intercept
the y-axis 1/3 of the

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.850
way between 7 and 8.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.020
Well I think that should at
least give you a little bit of

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.600
an intuition on what slope and
y-intercept are and you can

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.840
have this module assigned for
you, so you could play

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.540
with it yourself.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.940
And I'm going to do some more
models where you actually

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.650
calculate slope and y-intercept
and hopefully give you even

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.820
though further intuition
on what they are.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.850
So I hope you have fun playing
around with this stuff.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.000
I remember I was very excited
when I first learned

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.890
this stuff, because
it's very visual.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.870
So, have fun.
