00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.390
Here's the completed app for
looking at activities.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.810
I've started to show all the possible
activities it detects and

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.450
you can see that it has a percentage for
each one.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.283
For example, when I was testing this
earlier, it determined there was a 45%

00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:18.780
chance I was on foot, 45% chance
walking, 25% in a vehicle, etc.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.966
Now it can't be 100% sure for
some activities, so

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.442
it's up to you as a developer
to figure out what works best.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:29.273
When you start a car for example,
you're driving really slowly.

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:32.475
And it might think you're biking or
running for example.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.205
This app will just show you how to get
the data, its up to you to figure out

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:39.115
how to use it in the best
possible way for your app.

00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:40.445
You're going to build this from scratch.
