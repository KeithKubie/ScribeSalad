00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.950
&gt;&gt; Janice Hyde: Good afternoon.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.250
Welcome to the John With.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.440
Kluge Center at the
Library of Congress.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.840
My name is Janice Hyde, and
I am privileged to serve

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.250
as the interim director
of the Kluge Center.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.710
Before we begin today's
program, please take a moment

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.690
to silence your cell phones
and other electronic devices.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.990
Thank you.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.970
I'll also make you aware that this
afternoon's program is being filmed

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.640
for placement on the Kluge
Center website as well

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.480
as on its YouTube and
iTunes channels.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.400
The John W. Kluge Center is pleased
to host this afternoon's program,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.920
which will showcase the work
of one of its resident fellows.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.860 position:56%
The Kluge Center is a vibrant center
for scholarship on Capitol Hill

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.390
that brings together
intellectuals and researchers

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.040
from around the world to exchange
ideas and learn from one another,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.910 position:56%
to distill wisdom from the Library's
rich collections, and to interact

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.200
with policy makers in the public.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.500
The Center offers opportunities
for senior scholars

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.990
and post-doctoral fellows to do
research using the vast collections

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.000
of the Library of Congress.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.320
It also offers free public
lectures, conferences, symposia,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.150
and other programs, and it
administers the Kluge prize,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.720
which recognizes outstanding
lifetime achievement

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.290
in the humanities and
social sciences.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220
To view past programs or to learn
more about the Kluge Center,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.780
please visit our website
at LOC.gov/Kluge.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.300
Today's program is
entitled Popular Politics

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.230
and Public Opinion in
Late Medieval Paris.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.970
It features scholar and current
Kluge fellow, Michael Sizer.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.800
Dr. Sizer is a historian with
interests in political culture

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.290
and philosophy, cultural
history, interdisciplinary studies

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.750
of literature and ideas, urban
history, the history of revolt

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.980
and revolution, particularly
appropriate today.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.280
He received his PhD in medieval
French history from the University

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.170
of Minnesota in 2008, and during
his graduate studies he was also a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.610
fellow of the [foreign language]
at the Sorbonne in Paris.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.620
Dr. Sizer's research at the
Library of Congress has focused

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.270
on late middle ages in France,
one of the most tumultuous periods

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.210
in European political history.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.660
It was a time marked by revolts,
riots, popular preachers,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.020 position:56%
processions, and other engagements
of the people in the political realm

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.190
that was unheard of in
previous times according

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.450
to one chronicler of the period.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.010
In celebration of Bastille
Day today,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.980
Dr. Sizer will discuss the popular
politics of late medieval Paris,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.760
1380 to 1422, and what
bearing it may have

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.780
on the way we understand
popular political culture today.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Michael Sizer.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.520
[ Applause ]

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.910
&gt;&gt; Michael Sizer: Hello everyone.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.460
So thanks for being here and
thanks to the Kluge Center

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.360
for having hosted me
these past several months.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.390
It's been a great experience.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.420
I'd like to thank in
particular Travis Hensley,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.370
Mary Lou Riecher [phonetic].

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.440
Also, Erica Spencer at
the European Reading Room

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.690
and also the Rare Books
Reading Room.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.950
Staff and also the other fellows

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.370
who it's been really
fun to interact act.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.300
It's really exciting to be able
to research in this setting

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.750
and give this talk here
with the Supreme Court

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.720
and the Capitol Building
out the windows.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.520
You know, I think it has definitely
affected and inspired my thinking

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.150
on the very deep and long
history of the relationship

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.280
of governments to their people.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.340
And everyone knows that the Library
is the best place in the world

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.080
to do research on the history of
the Americas or the United States,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.300
but it's also the best place in
the U.S. to do European history,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.540
and I feel very lucky to
have been able to do that.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.540 position:56%
I'm also very thrilled to be talking
on Bastille Day because I'm going

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.660
to be talking about other earlier
rebellious Frenchmen and Parisians,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.600
and I promise you a
riot at a Bastille.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.350
The Bastille survives this riot,
but it won't survive, obviously,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.850
the one that we commemorate
today in 1789.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.070
All right, to start with, let
me give you just one example

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.920
of a chronicler's description
of Parisian popular opinion

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.720
in the period under study.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.710
In February 1383, at the
time of fiscal insecurity

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.130
and popular discontent
over taxation,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.110
the Duke of Anjou [phonetic],
serving as regent of France,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.720
unwisely decreed that a
new tax should be levied.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.330
As part of the process of making
such a decree official required

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.540
that it be proclaimed publically,
royal officials searched

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.040
around for a town crier
to proclaim the tax

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.000
in the market places of Paris.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.240
Fearing physical harm,
no one volunteered

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.800
until finally one man
agreed to do it in return

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.760
for a significant payment.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.060
The chronicle of the monk

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.150
of Saint-Denis relates
what happened next.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.520
Taking all precautions for himself,
the crier assembled the people,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.330
first entertaining them with slick
words and then loudly proclaiming

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.160
that someone had stolen golden
plates from the king's palace

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.210
and that the king would
give praise and reward

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.260
to those who returned them.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260
And as he had excited
the crowd to laugh

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.740 position:56%
at this almost unbelievable item and
seeing that the crowd was distracted

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.210
and engaged in many
uproarious conversations,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.930
he quickly spurred his horse
and proclaimed that a tax was

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.780
to be raised the next day.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.510
This unexpected news disturbed the
minds of those in the audience,

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.010
who filled the city
with vague rumors,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.320
most saying it was a false
tale and other astonished,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.440
waiting to see the outcome.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.700
Thus, the spirit of rebellion grew,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.280 position:56%
and they bonded together using
terrible words, conspiring the death

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.270
of those who decreed the tax.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.230 position:56%
The conventional scholarly consensus
following Jurgen Habermas is

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.330
that one cannot truly
speak of a medieval public

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.590
and that a proper public
only developed

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.900
under the historically specific
conditions of the enlightenment

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.860
and that the political sphere was a
restricted one dominated by status

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.850
and spectacle prior
to the modern age.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.840
The episode described here
however depicts a Parisian crowd

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.370
that was far from passive in
the face of official authority

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.180
in the public space and furthermore
that employed its own modes

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.730
of spreading information,
formulating opinions,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.540
mobilizing and taking action.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.330
The crowd here is also politically
sophisticated, able to understand,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.380
sort, and evaluate
information easily

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.160
and is not fooled by
the crier's rouse.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.810
Perhaps most interesting is that
the forces of authority know

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.960
that the crowd is this way and
that they are operating in a tense

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.510
and tenuous context, an unstable
situation out of their control.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.120
This passage is by no means
unique, references to an active

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.520
and engaged Parisian populous
occur frequently in all sources.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.950
Still, this is a rather typical
example of public opinion

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.180
in that we have, in that it
only provides just a hint

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.220
of a bigger picture and raises as
many questions as it does answers.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.750
Many of our examples of a sort of
medieval popular political action

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.810
and public opinion
come in tantalizing

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.530
but incomplete chunks like this.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.790
But at the same time, we
cannot ignore these hints

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.460
as they suggest a quite
different way

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.250
of how medieval politics
operated from the elite-centered,

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.800
top-down model that still
dominates the scholarship.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.210
When hints such as these are
put together and aggregated,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.140
we can get a clearer picture of
late medieval political culture

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.340
in which the popular class
has played a significant

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.690
and even decisive role.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.520
This process of collecting and
making sense of little chunks

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.450
of evidence like this in order

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.040
to make a comprehensive
composite picture

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.740
of how these phenomena operated
has been what I've been engaged

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.820
at the Kluge Center for
the past several months,

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.310
and in my previous time
here, several years ago

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.430
and doing my dissertation
research and also

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.860
at the National Archives in Paris.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.140 position:56%
I have also been trying to situate
this evidence within a wider context

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.040
of late medieval political
action, one that incorporates

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.730
and explains popular involvement
in politics in a way that puts it

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.150
at the center of that
[inaudible] political culture.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.560
This talk will present
some of the results,

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.990
which are still preliminary,
still being sorted

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.080
and figured out of this research.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.450
So why late medieval Paris.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:55.550
Let's have a nice picture of people
unloading boats on the Sienne.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.420
Late medieval, by this I mean
14th and 15th Century Paris,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.680
is a great place to look
if we want to answer

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.110
for some of these questions.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.020
There are several reasons for this.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.500 position:56%
The city, likely the largest in
western Europe, was inhabited by men

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.780
and women throughout
the social spectrum

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.020
and thus offers an opportunity
to see how both elites

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.340
and non-elites participated
in politics.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.800 position:56%
As a center of learning with the
University of Paris, and as the site

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.470
of the royal government with
its army of scribes as well

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.880
as a commercial hub with
a thriving merchant class,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.180
the city was unusually literate,
perhaps up to 20 percent or higher.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.530
The time period was tumultuous,
featuring frequent revolts.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.690
Major popular uprising
occurred in 1356 through eight,

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:44.070
1380 through 1383, 1413 and 1419.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:50.240 position:56%
Civil war from 1407 through 1435 and
occupation by the English from 1420

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.070
to 1435 in the context
of the hundred years war.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.280
This [inaudible] was both cause
and result of an unusual degree

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.540
of engagement in political
life by the popular classes,

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.880
and the question of their
involvement was hotly debated.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.260
From a broader perspective, this
period is crucial, in the formation

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.690
of the French nation state as the
power of impersonal institutions

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.220
of authority were advanced
alongside the king's direct rule

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.790
and the integration
of the popular classes

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.040
when political society
was both a source of power

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.510
and disruption for
the expanding state.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.490
Paris, as capitol of one of
the largest of these new forms

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.010
of centralized state, was
a vital stage for the play

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.990
of these new forms
of political power.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.100
Furthermore, this period's
history of popular opinion

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.790
and politics is a particular
interest

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.800 position:56%
as it predated the invention of the
printing press and yet displays some

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.990 position:56%
of the features of political culture
associated with post-print era.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.840
Political pamphleteering,
popular participation, propaganda,

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.000
lots of P's, and ideological
debate in all 14th

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.900
and 15th Century Paris is
an excellent laboratory

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.030
for observing premodern,
preprint popular politics.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.860
So I struggled to think of various
ways, points of entry to explain

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.950
in this short lecture
the rather complicated

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.630
and broader political culture

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.280
that contextualizes all the
examples I want to show you

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.430
and that also could allow
me to bring to the fore some

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.200
of the bigger historical
and theoretical issues

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.440
that are related to this inquiry.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.750
I think the best way to
do that is to go over some

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.700
of the late medieval meanings
and associations connected

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.030
to the key words in this
discussion, the people, populous

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.500
or [foreign language] and public.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.460
Let's start with people.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.800
The word populous has a long
history, stretching back to Rome

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.510
where it generally referred to
the populous Romani [phonetic],

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.970
the mass of male citizens where
authority was thought ultimately

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.440
to rest, but which by the
imperial period was seen

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.810 position:56%
as a largely abstract entity with no
active force in political affairs.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:01.180
The [foreign language] of Justinian
[phonetic] from the sixth century,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.680 position:56%
which would become quite influential

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.960
on late medieval law defines the
people as indicating the entirety

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.280
of citizens including patricians
and senators, while other terms

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.580
such as vulgus [phonetic]

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.080
or plebeians denoted
solely the lesser multitude.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.830
This meaning continued into
the medieval period although

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.460
to this sense was added the
sense of a mass of believers,

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.370
the populous could be
the Christian flock.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.080
In both cases, they are passive.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.540
They're presence as a crowd
validates the authority

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.040
of the powerful one who was before
them, whether prince or priest,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.070
who was acting upon them and
who was thus distinct from them.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.000
It's main meaning was
to denote a mass

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.600
of undifferentiated
citizen subordinates.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.160
The sense of the term essentially
persisted throughout the middle

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.790
ages, but in the late
medieval period,

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.640
a new set of associations
was added to it.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.560
In some ways this borrowed from
the ancient Roman republican idea

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.560
that the people were the
ultimate source of sovereignty.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.610 position:56%
Late medieval jurists and
political thinkers such as Marsilius

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.840 position:56%
of Padua [phonetic] and the
influential Bartolus of Saxoferrato,

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.950
who derived their arguments from
Roman law placed sovereignty

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.590
in the populous although the
implications of this were variable.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:18.140
In general, though condemnation
of tyranny were well articulated

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.490
and abundant in medieval
political theory,

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.860
most medieval jurists
stopped short of saying

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.720
that the people could overthrow
an unjust prince, arguing instead

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.610
that resistance must be
undertaken in the words of Aquinas,

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.610
who is representative of
the commonly shared view

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.880
of medieval intellectuals, "not
through the private presumption

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.100
of a few, but rather
by public authority,"

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.280
meaning barons, lords, etc.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.860
I don't want to get too far

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.300
into medieval resistance
theory here except to say

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.630
that unlike what is
sometimes assumed,

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.460
the middle ages produced abundant
and very varied versions of it

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.120
and that several were based on
the premise that ultimately care

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.220 position:56%
and concern for the people was an
important if not fundamental factor.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.370
This was accompanied in the late
middle ages by an ethic of sympathy

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.190
for the suffering of the poor
found in all sorts of sources.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.450
The common saying [inaudible], the
voice of the people is the voice

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:19.430
of God, first attested by
Charlemagne's court advisor,

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.730
Alcowen [phonetic],

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.890
who was denouncing what he
said was a commonly held idea,

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.510
reflected a sort of sacred
power of the people's judgement.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.930
Supplicants in pardon letters

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.160
from late medieval France
characterized themselves

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.460
as "poor laboring men."

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.320
In order to elicit sympathy,
royal decrees often declared

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.670
that the king is issuing
a law due to having heard

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.090
"the cries of the people."

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.650
Chroniclers often deplore
the suffering of the poor

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.020
and [foreign language], the lesser
people, to indicate the plight

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.010
of the realm and as an
implicit critique of leadership.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.890
The Bourgeois of Paris, the name
given to an anonymous chronicler

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.840
of 15th century Paris, who was more
likely a cleric than a Bourgeois,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.600
invokes the pathos of the suffering
poor frequently in his account.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.400
Here is one example.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.560
Alas. The great pity of going
through the city of Paris

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.370 position:56%
because truly one could see more
men asking for alms than anyone else

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:22.570
who cursed their lives 100,000
times per day, in crying often

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.850
and assuredly in a raised voice,
alas, alas, true and gentle God,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.230
when will you stop for
us this heavy sadness

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.000
and this melancholy life
and this damned war.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.430
Note how the alas of the Bourgeois
is immediately echoed by the cries

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.310
of the impoverished Parisians.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.900 position:56%
The chronicler and the [foreign
language] speak with the same voice.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.860
When he wants to condemn the
duke of Berry [phonetic],

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.390
who had joined the [foreign
language] party hostile

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.830
to the more popular, especially in
Paris, Burgundian [phonetic] party

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.920
in 1412 during the civil war, the
Bourgeois says, "He was more cruel

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.450
to the little people than any
serasan [phonetic] tyrant."

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.790
Political theorists
writing advice for princes,

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.170 position:56%
called mirror of princes literature,
also argued that the protection

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.130
of the poor was crucial
to valid and proper rule

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.450
and even stressed the
common humanity under god

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.250 position:56%
that both kings and peasants shared.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.440
The most poignant example I found
of this, though there are several,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.610
comes from a text I read
in February in the Library

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.990
of Congress' Rare Books Room,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:25.120 position:56%
and it's from the [foreign language]
information for kings and princes,

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.600
which is a late 14th
century French translation

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.080
of an earlier Latin text written
by an anonymous Dominican.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.860
In a section on royal clemency and
dealing with recalcitrant serfs,

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:41.240
it says, and this is somewhat hasty
and rough translation, "To serfs,

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.640
one must not place punishment
with too much rigor but gently.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.080
Because even though they are
serfs, they are God's creatures,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.530
and in this we must consider
them as men and as friends

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.900
because we are all formed
from the same elements

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.550
and have the same birth.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.940
We are called to the same heaven,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.780
and we are from the
same blood, redeemed.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.050
We all have a faith and a mind,
and we all go to the same purpose.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:11.110
There is not serf or freeman
in God, and we are all of God.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.440
Though I find this to be
an exceptionally eloquent

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.670
and poignant expression of
this idea of a common humanity,

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.830
the sentiment was not unique

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.330 position:56%
and became an increasingly important
idea in the late middle ages,

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.430
helping validate the inclusion
of the people in political life.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.780
This phenomenon should be seen
alongside an increased evaluation

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.700
of vernacular written culture,
which signaled the moving away

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.480
from the more exclusive clerical
culture of the earlier period.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.320
Okay. So what is the
medieval idea of the public.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.150
The most important thing
to remember is that while

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.320
in modern speech the
opposite of public is private.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.940
In medieval parliaments, the
opposite of public, publica,

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:54.440
publicus, public [phonetic]
was singular or particular.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.690
This reflects a different
nuance of the word's meaning.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.100
In the middle ages public meant
pertaining to all or common

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.350 position:56%
with its opposite particular meaning
pertaining to one individual.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.460
A prostitute was a public woman
because she made herself available

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.860
to all, this is the real
meaning of a common woman,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.870 position:56%
rather than to a particular husband.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:20.040
Chronicler [inaudible]
articulates this difference clearly

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.370
in his condemnation of the
behavior of rival court factions.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.790
"Rivals in the civil war
induced him, the king,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.740
to do their singular
will and pleasure

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.380
without having regard
together through deliberation

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.930
for the public good of the realm."

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.590
This last quote includes the most
common usage of the word public

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:43.360
in the later medieval period, that
of the public good or common good.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.070
This concept came from Aristotle,
whose works were translated

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.140
into Latin in the 13th Century
in French and the 14th Century,

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.420
and the influence of
Aristotle can't be understated

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.250
in the late Middle Ages.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:00.450
By the late Middle Ages the term
or common good was ubiquitous.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.990
Late 14th Century poet Ustach
Deshawn [phonetic] provides

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.490
as good definition as
any in one of his poems.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.030
What is the common good?

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.340
That which can relate to the
profit of all, young and old,

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.430
to keep the law his
country and his own.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.870
Nichola Arem [phonetic], who
translated Aristotle's politics

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:23.310
into French in the 1370's and who
also glossed the text explained

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.390
"The common good is also like
a collective holy thing."

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.220
On the one hand, the
concept of the public

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.430
or common good justified
the increase of royal power

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.390
over a much greater
slice of political life

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.320
than had been possible before.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.180 position:56%
Indeed by the late Middle Ages the
French royal government had attained

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.500
both the ideological and
logistical authority and power

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.400
to make it the unquestioned center
of the realm's political universe.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.250
In the late Middle Ages into the
growing influence of Roman law,

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.590
royalist medieval jurists

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.490
and thinkers were successfully
advocating for a conception

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.730
of royal sovereignty that was
stronger and more centralized

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.990
than previous, adapting the
Roman law formula to argue

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:08.290
that [inaudible], the king,
his emperor, and his realm,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.590
enabling the application

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:15.180
of wide-ranging Roman imperial
powers encoded in law to the king.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.100
This was accompanied by the growth
of impersonal, bureaucratic,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.710
financial and legal
institutions of royal government,

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.380
which enabled extensive war
powers, coaptation of local courts,

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.330
the extension of a concept of
treason, and the implantation

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.740
of permanent royal taxation
in the mid-14th Century.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.940
The idea of the public good was
mobilized for this purpose as well,

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.200
justifying the king's
abrogation of local rights

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.110 position:56%
and prerogative in favor of his own.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.140
Every encroachment,
taxation, expanded war powers,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.870
overturning unfavorable
judgments in local courts,

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:51.140
ignoring municipal liberties
could be and was justified

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.440
by invoking the public good.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.910
The kind and his royalists
theorists did not have a monopoly

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.320
over this concept however for
the public good could be invoked

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.440
against the king to
criticize his actions

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.790
and to invalidate his decisions.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.200
The chronical of Jean Jouvenal
des Ursins gives but one example,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.560
when Parisians reject
a tax levy in 1405.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.520
In this time, one spoke loudly of
the queen and my lord of Orleans,

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.670
saying that it was by them that
lump-sum taxes (tailles) were made,

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.430
and sales taxes (aides)
raced about and were raised

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.100
without anything being done and
none of it used for the public good

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.420 position:56%
and quite loudly in the streets once
cursed them and said many words.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.520
As this example shows, the king and
his court could be held accountable

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.900
for their failures to uphold the
public interest while claiming

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.880 position:56%
extensive powers allowed for the
royal government to assume a greater

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.360 position:56%
and greater share of political life,
it also meant that they were subject

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.960
to public scrutiny to a
greater degree than before.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.570
The king's morality,
disposition, and comportment

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.640
because his office was
central to the maintenance

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.850
of the public good became
objects of scrutiny and censure.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.120
The thriving mirror of prince's
literature commented extensively

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.650
on the importance of the king
maintaining his moral character

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.860
as this was linked to the
performance of his public office.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.090
Cruelty, gluttony, and other sinful
behaviors were not just a question

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.980
of personal salvation anymore
but were of public importance.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.440
The court in particular was
a flashpoint for criticism.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.510
Though the king's person
was sacrosanct

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.800
and he was rarely the
object of direct criticism,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.100
his officials were not,
and they were often blamed

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.570
for the king's conduct

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.330
or for perceived failings
in royal governance.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.990
Courtiers were frequently the
target of popular uprisings.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.360
The most blatant example
of this in Paris is

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.000
when the revolutionary
provost of merchants,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.220
the head of the Parisian
municipality elected

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.500
by the town's bourgeois, Etienne
Marcel gathered a crowd of men

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.680 position:56%
who burst into the Palace [phonetic]
Royal, and this is early 1358,

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.030
and while the regent Charles
cowered in the corner in horror,

00:22:55.030 --> 00:23:00.080 position:56%
slaughtered his two leading marshals
before his eyes, one on his bed,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.850
the victims' were decapitated,
then dragged out of the palace,

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.090
leaving blood all over the royal
chambers and stairs and display

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.530
in the courtyard visible
from the regent's window.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.180 position:56%
Marcel, whom one chronicler says
claimed-- oh here's a picture of it,

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.910
this is a modern representation
of the killing of the,

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.250
you can see the [inaudible]
how he's like sat,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:23.910
and that's Marcel pointing.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:29.330
Marcel, whom one chronicler says
claimed to have acted "concerned

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:33.060
for the public good" explained
to the cowering [inaudible]

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.370
that the killings of these
"false, wicked" traders was done

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.530
"by the will of the people."

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.600
These actions were a display of
the power of the commons intended

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.680
to intimidate as when
Marcel warns the [inaudible]

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.510
that the marshals were killed
to avoid greater perils.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:55.020
Here's a picture of
Etienne Marcel's revolt,

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.860
and he's having the
Parisians clear the Louvre

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.660
of weapons during his uprising.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.600
So potent was this dynamic
that it became the engine

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.200
for late medieval political
intrigue, those courtiers

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.450 position:56%
who are marginalized in the constant
scramble for courtly prestige

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.680
and access to the king
and the decision making

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.840
and revenue controlling areas

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.150
of government could go outside the
court and appeal to the public.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.030
They usually did so on the grounds
of immorality and the misuse

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.470
of public funds by court insiders,

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.010
which the populous was
only too happy to support.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:31.020
The result was a recurring
cycle of scandal and purge

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.520
in late medieval France, a source
of considerable instability

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.900
in the government and discord
in the realm as a whole

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.240
and generally the defining
feature of most revolts.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.960
In this way, the popular element
and it's sense of guardianship

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.030
over the public good was a central
feature of the politics of the day

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.580
in a way that is underappreciated
in most scholarship,

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.080 position:56%
which focuses on the rivalry and
decision making of powerful figures.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.380
All right.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:00.740
So that's kind of the context
that I feel is important,

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.760 position:56%
and I tried to make that as short as
possible because now it's more fun,

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.100
we're going to talk about
some of the examples.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.700
What forms of popular political
expression are revealed

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.500
in the sources?

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.750
There are many different
types, and I will not be able

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.250
to discuss them all today.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:20.580
For the sake of easy comprehension,
I divide them in what I'm trying

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.380
to write, into two categories, the
formal, the listed, the official,

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.830
and the informal, listed,
and unofficial.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.640
Forman or official modes

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.530
of expression were
those generally overseen

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:35.680
or favored by forces of authority.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.900
Informal or unofficial ones were
generally outside of their control,

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.220
and sometimes operated
against their wishes.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.680
In the formal category, we
have, among other things,

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.890
representative bodies, such as the
estates general, the municipality,

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.980
petition, processions
and ceremonies,

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.530
moral and political
literature, and sermons.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:58.690
In the latter category, the
informal, we have rumors, speech,

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.560
news, songs and festivals
plotting and revolt.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.960
It should be noted that these
categories are not hard and fast.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.490
Many of these elements listed
here, festivals for example,

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.530
could fall into both categories
depending on the situation,

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.440
and many of them overlap.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.650
Municipal institutions could
often express the interest

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.520
of their community through
petition for example.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.220
I just grouped them there for
the purposes of discussion.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.200
In the interest of time, I
don't want to cover the formal,

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.540
official modes of communication
today.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.180
The only thing I want to say about
them, and it is an important thing

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.990
to keep in mind, is that
although these modes

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.260
of interaction were
generally overseen by royal

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.590
or aristocratic officials
and those allied with them,

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.240
it does not mean they were fully
predictable or controllable.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.100
We see that petitions from various
interest groups had a real effect

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.120
on royal legislation, which often
reproduced verbatim the petitioners

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.680
words and royal decrees.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.550
Processions and ceremonies were
often carefully orchestrated

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.140
and extravagant spectacles,
but they relied

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.610
on the audience's participation
and bestowal of good graces,

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.620
which in some cases
was not forthcoming.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.020
Crowds could confront the
king with petitions, heckle,

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.980
and simply not participate
in the expected numbers

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.740
or with palpably luke-warm
enthusiasm,

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.120
which was recorded by chroniclers.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.840
As much of these events represented
opportunities for the powerful

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.420
to display and enact their power,
they were seen by the people

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.690
as a rare chance to have an
exchange with their sovereign.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.440
So let's talk about some examples.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.220
Let's talk about speech.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:31.100
As stated before, though late
medieval Paris was unusually

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.630
literate, the predominant mode
of communication was oral.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.490
Parisian's were famous
for their speaking.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.800
The Duke of Berry [inaudible]
grumbles in 1413

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.050
that they are a "people
full of rumor."

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.470
And famed 15th Century poet,
Francois Villon declared

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:50.270
"there is no tongue
like the Paris tongue."

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.930
The oral public's fear has
several differences compared

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.390
with that dominated by writing.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.530
Speech acts are bound by space and
time, which reduces their effect

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.650
and makes them subject to
immediate place of power.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.710
The oral sphere is more determined
by the social differences

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.800
and personal charisma
of those occupying it.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.500
But it's ephemerality
also raises possibilities

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.710
as it is more elusive and fluid.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.450
From the modern perspective, we
tend to see written communication

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:21.860 position:56%
as democratic and connected to the
greater possibilities of expression.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.750
In the late middle ages, however,
writing was not democratic

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.610
and often served to calcify

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:31.010
and domesticate the thriving
oral-based exchange mechanisms.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.870
Let's look at some examples.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.070
Keep in mind it is rare
to have the contents

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.480
of speech acts although I have
a few of those rare examples,

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.390
but other examples allow us to
see hints of their form as well

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.760
as their ubiquity and importance.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.550
So I want to go back to
the monk of Saint-Denis

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.300
for my first example here.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.170
I really like this one
because of its sonic imagery

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.210
and the way it describes
and mobilizing crowd.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.690
This is kind of similar
actually to the one,

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.350
and it's from the same revolt,

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:04.760
the mallet wielder's [phonetic]
revolt in March 1382 as before.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.960
So the riot that he's
about to describe began

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.190
with the rough treatment of
a woman selling water crest

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:15.890
in the la saille [phonetic],
the city's marketplace,

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:18.130
by a royal tax collector.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:24.730
Seeing this, the Paris crowd
beat the tax collector to death.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.030
From this small incident,

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.340
the uprising grew rapidly
throughout the city,

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.720
represented in [inaudible]
chronicle, the monk's chronicle

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.210
by the cries of the people.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.800
This crime having been perpetrated,

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.730
the tumult now could not
sustain itself in the marketplace

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.920
but soon pervaded all the city.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.890
From all places one ran to the
marketplace with immoderate haste,

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.480
converging from all
directions into a crowd.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.990 position:56%
A loud clamor with a raised up from
everywhere and resounded in all ears

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.450
so that the dire venom of sedition
could be spoken everywhere,

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.880
next some men with
confused minds and deserving

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.910
of divine punishment went through
the neighborhoods and crossroads

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.430
of the city shouting out horrible
words equipped with the weapons

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:08.590
and swords that the popular furor
could supply, calling "To arms

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.690
for the liberation
of the fatherland."

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.010
This is the Maillotins Revolt.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:20.010 position:56%
It's called that because the rioters
went and got a bunch of hammers

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:25.610
that were stored in the city's
arsenal, and so they used hammers,

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:29.280
which were decidedly
nonaristocratic weapon.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.900
Knights used swords.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.090
And so they used hammers
in their revolt,

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:38.120
and here's them hammering
people and things.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.450
The people expressed the
power of their numbers

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.230
and their uniformed
will to the loudness

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.540
of their collective shouting
because this power went as far

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:49.220
as shouting distance
combining with cry, the cry,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.080
with movement to their city
spaces expanded their reach

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.330
of the people in rebellion.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.030
So that's an example of
the power of the sort

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.210
of oral community has
expressed in this chronicle.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.340
It's a rather extreme example.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.150
What were the regular channels
by which information circulated?

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:09.450 position:56%
Marketplaces such as the
aforementioned [inaudible], taverns,

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.780
prominent city squares,
bridges, cemeteries,

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.590
and churches were common
meeting places

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.780
where ideas were frequently
exchanged.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.270
Instructions for town criers,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.310
who were to disseminate orally the
king's decrees indicated the places

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:24.160
in Paris where the greatest
number of people congregated

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.190
and thus the announcements
would have the greatest effects.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.510
These were before Saint
Genieve's church--

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.180
Before the palace, before
the chateleigh [phonetic]

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.510
in LaSailles [phonetic] at Port--

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:46.340
[ Foreign Language ]

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.830
And so on, a letter of
remission describes how

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.750
in July 1413 during the
[inaudible] uprising

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.980
in Maillot [phonetic] near Paris
a chamberlain and a companion

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.840
"went together to the gate of
the market to hear the news."

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.020
Orem's [phonetic] translation of
Aristotle's politics mentions how

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.820
"all manner of people converse
in the market and in the city,

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.980
and because of this congregations
and assemblies are easily made."

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.740
Hers a marketplace picture.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.660
Here's men discussing the
purchase of an Oxford.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:26.090
Maybe they're also discussing
politics at the same time.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:29.650
To this quote of Aristotle's
that Orem translates,

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:34.210
he also adds a grumbling gloss,
warning of "the mob or a multitude

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.310 position:56%
of merchants found in marketplaces."

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:41.690
Taverns were particularly rife
with gossip, rumor, and discussion.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.510
Here's a tavern.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.000
Guilbert de Metz' [phonetic]
15th Century description

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.210
of Paris said there were
4000 taverns in the city.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.280
There probably weren't that many.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.690
And here are few sample tavern
names, just because they're fun.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.800
The deer's horn, the Griffin,
the helm, the armed man,

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.020
the striped assistant, the
two axes, the three axes,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.080
the bear on the line
and the wolf's tail.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.930
So these people would congregate
in these taverns with their names

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.740
and their beautiful signs

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.550
that depicted these
things I just described.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.980
The point is that these were all
important places where people

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.540
of all social strata mixed and
normal cultural codes of honor

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.110
and respect for hierarchy
were loosened.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:29.020
Not surprisingly, some of the most
shocking and subversive snatches

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.200
of everyday people's
speech that comes down to us

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.860
in the sources were spoken
in taverns and then recorded

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:38.520
when their unfortunate speakers
went on trial for their words.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.920
Here are some examples.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.220
These are my favorites.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.140
In 1379, Jean Loast [phonetic]
declared that he wished

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.010
"that the king was dead and
that his soul in paradise

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.380
and happy peace could be throughout
the realm, and it was a sin

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.260
that he continued to live."

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:58.450
In 1398, a certain Jean de
Begne [phonetic] was accused,

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:02.120
as it turns out falsely, of
having complained of over taxation

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.300
and called the king insane, and
he said that the king's brother,

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:10.120
"played dice and loved
whores," which was true.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.420
My favorite example comes not
from Paris but from Orleans,

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.090
but I included it anyway
because it's too good.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.980
In 1384 in the aftermath
of failed revolts

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.610
that shook the entire realm
including Paris and Orleans,

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:25.610
Guillium Lejup Onye
[phonetic], the roadmaker, said,

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.110
"Shit on this king
and shit on that king.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.880
We have no king but God.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.480
Do you think they acquired
what they have justly?

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.000
They burden me again and
again, and it weighs on them

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.140
that they can't have
all of our things.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:38.770
What affair is it of theirs to take

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:41.230
that which I have gained
with my sewing needle.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.460
I would rather have the
king and all kings die

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.140
than to have my son hurt
even his pinkie finger.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:52.150
Do you think it was a good
idea for Guillium to say that?

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.610
No. He was pardoned actually,

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.300 position:56%
but he got a fleur de li
[phonetic] engraved in his forehead.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.160
The royal symbol, the fleur de li.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.960
The authorities knew of subversive
speech prevalent in taverns.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.670
The Duke of Burgundy, Philip the
Bold tried to use the network

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.500
of Paris taverns to his advantage
around 1400, "to put the hearts

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.110
of the people against
the queen and the Duke

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.500
of Orleans, the king's brother.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.390
He had false lies spread
by scults [phonetic]

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.950
and in taverns about them."

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.370
A systematic regime of
espionage in the taverns of Paris

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.740
to prevent the youth from
plotting or being idyll,

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:30.010 position:56%
for this led to revolt, was
advocated by a political philosopher

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:34.530
and some called the proto-feminist,
Christine de Pizon [phonetic].

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.220
She was maybe a proto-feminist
depending on your view,

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:42.430
but she was not politically
progressive in other ways.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.940 position:56%
And this plan was once again advised

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.640
by the Arman Yacklad [phonetic]
government in October 1413

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.710
after the [foreign language]
uprising had been quelled.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:56.370
They say that "the provost of
Paris should send 30 or 40 good

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.780
and sure sergeants to walk often
around the city and in taverns

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.670 position:56%
and other places to listen, inquire,
search and hear if they find

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:07.130
or know anybody murmuring, plotting
betrayal, saying or doing anything

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:10.240
that could be the cause
of disruption of peace."

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.420
The 1383 Parisians planned
for resistance as well

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.930
as an abortive 1417
plot to open Paris

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.410
to the Burgundians were hatched
in taverns, is tangible evidence

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.890
that the authorities
were right to be wary.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:26.800
In addition to these informal modes
of spreading news and information,

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.840
more formal modes of
speech also existed

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.950
in these faces in the street.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.830
Popular preachers commonly
circulated through Paris competing

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.460
with street performers,
peddlers, and the cries of sellers

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.050 position:56%
of all sorts of wares for attention.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:42.260 position:56%
Most street preachers were connected
to an official organization,

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.380
and the right to preach
was officially guarded only

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.890
for those sanctioned by the church.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.870
The university had a powerful
weapon to move public opinion

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.890
with its phalanx of preachers
from the student body and faculty.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.800
This university preacher brigade
was a powerful and important tool

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.850
of the secular authority
such that the threat

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.850
of a preacher strike
was a major weapon

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.530
of intimidation by
university officials.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.170 position:56%
Also, the king found himself
frustrated in keeping the university

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:10.950 position:56%
in line ideologically and was forced

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.950
to issue what were most
likely ineffectual warnings

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.140
against the university's preaching
when he found himself at odds

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.250
with their political views, most
notably in the twist and turns

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:24.460
of the policy of the subtraction of
obedience towards the [inaudible],

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.680
papal schism, it's a real
mess, but when the king

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.060 position:56%
and the university disagreed with
one another, university would preach

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.090
against the king's policies.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.550
One prominent popular
Parisian preacher, theologian,

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:41.160
Pierre-aux-Boeufs,
here's a preaching scene.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.910
This is actually January
Husband, it's bohemia rather

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:46.850
than Paris, but I like the picture.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.940
One prominent Parisian preacher,

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.650
theologian Pierre-aux-Boeufs
complains of the way that he has

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.420
to compete for attention
in the city's streets.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.790
"There are many who never tire of
listening for the length of a day

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:04.390
to the jokes and japes of a
performer and his game of pantomime

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:06.200
or to hear a prolix
[phonetic] romance.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.500
" Because of this, preachers
had to adapt accordingly

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.750
and filled their sermons
with fiery images,

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.440
sometimes condemning
the rich and powerful.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.740
In one of his sermons,

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.440
Pierre-aux-Boeufs deplores the
laziness and decadent clothing

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.080
of the rich and equated
poverty with holiness.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.720
He further says, due
to their rapacity,

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.430
they (the rich) show
themselves hard, rigorous

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.650
and cruel towards the poor.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.540
The hard and evil words of the
poor hear sometimes at the doors

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:36.170
of the greedy rich stripped of
all mercy, these harsh refusals

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:44.170
that they there can be called
rightly hard stones hurled at God.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.700
The sources refer to the
presence of many preachers

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.300
who captivated the city for
months with their public sermons

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.490
on morality held in the streets

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:56.390
or Saint Innocence
Cemetery before great crowds

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:59.560
such as the Franciscan
brother, Richard, in 1429,

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.770
who was said by the bourgeois of
Paris to have drawn five to 6000

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.200
for his moralizing sermons.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.800
When Brother Richard was
giving these sermons,

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.580
no doubt he had the famous
painting of the dance of death

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.990
for which Saint Innocence Cemetery
was well known for centuries

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:16.120
as his backdrop, reinforcing
the theme of the equality

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.440
of all human beings
before God and judgment.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.000
Nonprofessional preachers
can get and audience.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.020
[Foreign language] mentions, "A
crazy man captivated audience

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.320
in the Palace [inaudible]" in 1410,

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.560
claiming he could heal
the king's insanity.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.090
The king was insane
from 1393 to 1422,

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.130 position:56%
a long time, probably schizophrenic.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:41.110
And that caused a lot
of problems too.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.410
Aside from Brother Richard,

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.560
the bourgeois mentions the
well-attended preaching sessions

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.220
of a recluse named Jean La
Vouyeur [phonetic] in 1442,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.520
and the Chatleigh [phonetic]
registers state

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.290
that [foreign language] would be
hanged as a thief in June 1390,

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.710
pickpocketed a woman
distracted "by a sermon"

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.310
at Saint Innocence Cemetery.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.870
Political leaders would
sometimes give large speeches

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.100
to assembled crowds as well.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.570
Recognizing their power, both sides

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.460
in the civil war employed
their own preachers.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.750
Prior to this, there was the
remarkable speech war in 1357

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:15.500
and 1358 between Charles the
Bad of Navarre and his rival,

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.710
the [inaudible] regent Charles,
the same one who was cowering

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:22.240
in the corner earlier, later,
King Charles the fifth at the time

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.350
of the Etienne Marcel
uprising in Paris.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.260
Charles the Bad had
scaffolding erected.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.520
This is a picture of
this, supposedly.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.280
It's kind of a strange picture,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.180
but Charles the Bad had scaffolding
erected in the [foreign language],

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.970
an open field where normally
jousts and other events were held,

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.130
and had his men spread
word of the coming speech

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:44.320 position:56%
in the days leading up to the event.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.740 position:56%
Around 10,000 are said to have shown
up at eight or nine in the morning

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.540
of November 30 to see the demagogic
Charles the Bad give a speech

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.250
railing against royal officers
and other injustices perpetrated

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.460
by the royal government for
Castro-esque four to five hours.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.240 position:56%
Not wishing to be outflanked, the
young dofan [phonetic] gave a speech

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.650
at the Palace de Grave [phonetic]
on 11 January to "a great crowd

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.980
of people" in which he declared
that he was "ready to live

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.360
and die" with the Parisians.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.660
The speech worked.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.270
"The words of the [inaudible]
were so agreeable to the people

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:22.420
that he had the greater part
of them in favor of him.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.970
Another example of spreading
information and commentary

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:31.850
about contemporary
politics was through song.

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:35.370
Music was a major part of medieval
cultural life, and people played

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:37.040
and sang as a group activity

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.900
or enjoyed watching
street performances.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.540
Because music and songs were part
of the people's participation

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.400
in political ceremonies, it
is not surprising to find

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.700
that music could be injected

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.220
with a different political
context out of satire.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:54.580
A ruling from 1395 prohibits Paris
minstrels from singing "neither

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.940
in the squares nor elsewhere"
any [inaudible], rhymes or songs

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.540
that make mention of the pope,
king, or lords of France.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.060
The monk of Saint-Denis
describes how some Parisians sang

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:08.900 position:56%
"injurious songs" outside the window
of the Countess of Henolt [phonetic]

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.010
as she dined after arriving
to the city as an ambassador

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:15.220
for John the Fearless in 1414.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.530
One chronicler in 1347 comments
that a song called "I Failed Her

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:24.440
to Whom I Was Given in Love"
was sung "everywhere in France"

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.280
about the young count of Flanders,
Louis, who abandoned his fiance,

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.600
the daughter of the King
of England at the altar,

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.920
thus touching off a
political scandal and war.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.860
In 1413 in the context of the
vicious civil war in France,

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.850
a judicial record tells
that [foreign language],

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:44.050
who snuck into the town of
[inaudible] near Paris was arrested

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:47.190
for playing subversive songs
on his harp in a tavern

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.250
and for having a written
version of "A Ballad

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:53.710
Against Those in Paris"
in his pocket.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.630
The printing press is given a lot
of credit for the role it played

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.540
in spreading ideas during the
reformation, and so it should,

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.600
but it is also important
to realize the elements

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.600
of pamphlet culture existed in
Paris before Gutenberg's invention.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.160
The widespread use of paper, a
cheaper alternative to parchment,

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.630
began in the 14th century,

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.640
making writing more
disposable and accessible.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.280
Orality retained its importance
in aspects of law and government

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.840
but increasingly writing
had become necessary,

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.360
rather than an ornamental
accompaniment to these procedures,

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.970
and have permeated
civic life as well.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:27.190
It must be remembered that
in this period orality

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.510
and literacy were not mutually
exclusive worlds or processes.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.980
Written texts were often
read aloud to audiences,

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.770
and thus a large amount
of people could share

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:38.560
in a textual experience
even if they could not read.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.370
Political broadsides have been
discussed as a feature of English,

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.670
political and urban life as a
major vehicle for the spread

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:48.190
of the Lollard heresy
in the same period.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:52.500 position:56%
But it is almost certain that they
existed in France and Paris as well.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.890
A few of them have come down to us
as they were designed as ephemeral,

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:59.970
but sources give several
indirect references to them.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.220
The political debate
over the papal schism,

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.740
which fed into the
political disputes

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.330
of the civil war had occasion
efforts the control opinion in 1397

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:12.080
as this ordinance states quote that
"no person regardless of status

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:17.300
or condition be not so daring or
bold in secret or openly, directly

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.230
or indirectly in deed or
in speech to preach, orate,

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:23.860
make or write letters or any
other sort of writing or anything

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:28.040
that can bring or create any harm
or obstacle to the above said vote

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.970
of succession neither in the
manner or means to proceed

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:34.080
with it or in its practice.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.470
Also, in 1406, anyone found
with a copy of a University

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.530
of Tulet letter arguing that the
king could be deposed as a heretic

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.930
if [inaudible] pope
was to be executed.

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.370
There was considerable
concern over seditious letters

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.070
in the civil war period,
and efforts were made

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:52.140
to intercept them before they
could reach their audience.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.220
Such letters were probably intended
to be read in taverns and churches

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.550
by sympathizers, but copies
of them would also be hanged

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.400
up on church doors and other places

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.370
as Nichola de Bay's [phonetic]
description of a provost

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:09.090
of Paris decreed banning the
practice in July 1404 indicates.

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.530
The royal condemnation of the
Cabotian [phonetic] rebels

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:15.590
after the revolt was crushed
in September 1413 lists as one

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:19.840
of their major crimes that "many
defaming letters were made and sent

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.310 position:56%
to many persons affixed to church
doors and published in many places."

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:27.400
Though he was considerably
well connected,

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.400
and that's not exactly a member of
the common people, it is noteworthy

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.050
that the Duke of Burgundy,
John the Fearless,

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:37.160
engaged in a large scale publicity
campaign directed by University

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.170
of Paris theologian John Petit
[phonetic] for his justification

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:43.650
of tyrannocide, a treatise
defending his recent assassination

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.340
of the king's brother,
that's the guy

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.690
who likes dice and
plays with whores.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:52.040 position:56%
Luxury copies donned in leather were
sent to prominent lords as gifts

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.570
from John the Fearless, but
cheaper copies were also produced

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:55.940
for distribution.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.250
Petit and his secretary,

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:00.570
John Johannes [phonetic] used the
treasury office of the College

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:02.300
of Roueaux [phonetic]
of the university

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.110
for the copying campaign in 1408.

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:08.920
Twelve students at a time would
take dictation from Johannes

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.050
to produce numerous
additions, which were then sent

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:15.980
out throughout Paris and the realm.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:19.450 position:56%
I promised riots of the Bastille,
and I will deliver, but before that,

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:21.820
I think it is important to
remember that if we're talking

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.860
about popular resistance to a royal
authority, and not all, in fact,

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.020
not most of popular political
engagement was adversarial

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:33.350 position:56%
to the crown must be said, even in
these tumultuous medieval centuries,

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:36.180
it is just as important however
to talk about more humble,

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.400
everyday forms of resistance
than big revolts.

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.170
Rather than take the
risk of open revolt,

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:44.890
townspeople from the Parisian
[foreign language] were most likely

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:48.620
to engage in the sort of everyday
resistance activities famously

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:52.290
analyzed by James Scott in the
study of modern Malaysian peasants,

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.500
foot dragging, dissimilation,
desertion, false compliance,

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.940
pilfering, feigned ignorance,
slander, arson, and sabotage.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.060 position:56%
By their nature, such acts are
likely to escape mention in sources,

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.210
but there are some references.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.670
I think a most instructive
reference to kind of every day sort

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:12.580
of resistance that we encounter
comes from a July 1388 ordonnances.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:17.220
Every day there is committed and
perpetrated many crimes, excesses,

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.230
evils, and ill deeds, and that many
times and often it has occurred

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:23.930
and occurs that some of
our Officers and Deputies

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:26.380
when the case requires it to
make rulings, enforcement,

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.310
or other matters of justice, have
rebellions, defiance, obstacles,

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:31.450
and disobediences given to them.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:34.050
And what is worse, many of
our officers, procurers,

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:37.380
and sergeants in exercising
their said offices and duties

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.100 position:56%
and otherwise, in hatred or contempt
of them, have been greatly injured

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.310
and cursed or very badly
beaten, mutilated, and wounded

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:46.670
and some dead and killed.

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.670
This comes in the context
of the crown attempting

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:52.520
to label royal officers in a legal
extension of the royal person.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.930
Thus they personified the
king and therefore any act

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:59.430
on them was an act of treason.

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.230
We can see here once again that
the people obviously drew a clear

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:05.350
distinction in their minds
between king and officers,

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:09.540
a distinction that the crown tried
to erase but to little effect.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.840
All right.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.070
Riot at Bastille time.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:15.370
Obviously the most sensational

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:18.630
and therefore most documented
expressions of popular politics

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.300
in this period were
instances of revolt.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.300
As I mentioned earlier, these were
frequent in the late middle ages,

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.460
once generation in Paris.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.490
Scholars [inaudible] in how and
what they mean and how we were

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:31.930
to compare them to modern-day
revolutions, and those are big

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.980
in great questions, but it
would take a whole other lecture

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.250
to begin to address them.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.840
What I hope to do here is to
describe one riot that was part

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.130
of the 1413 Caboshian [phonetic]
revolt so you can get a picture

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:46.040
of what these events looked like
and some of the dynamics that were

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.440
in play that echo what I
have already talked about.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.570
Briefly, the Caboshian revolt was
an uprising in which aristocrats,

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:54.270
university men, trade
gills, and rank

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:57.260
and file Parisians all participated
in a loose alliance based

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.530
on a common ideology of antagonism
towards the growth of taxation,

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:04.470
the state bureaucracy, and
the increased centralization

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:06.820
of government power in the court.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.110
It took place in Paris in 1413.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:12.570
It is named for Simon Cabosh,
the slaughterhouse worker,

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:17.660 position:56%
who was one of the movements leaders
as it was the Paris butcher's guild

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.350
that was at the forefront
of the movement.

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:23.120
Following a contentious estate's
general meeting in January

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.590
and February in which the estates
rejected calls for taxation

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:29.970
and instead demanded reforms
and purges of wicked courtiers,

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.630
a commission was established
to draft a set of decrees

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.620
that would reform the
royal government.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:39.320
This would be issued in May and is
now called the [foreign language].

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.670
In late April following the
riot I'm about to describe,

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.970
the Caboshian seized
power through the organs

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:48.430
of the Paris municipal government
and militia and by physical control

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:51.490
of the king, again, the
tragic Charles the sixth

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.600
who was incapacitated by
schizophrenia and the dofan,

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.530
the 13-year-old Louis
of Guien [phonetic].

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:01.140 position:56%
Once in power, they purged the
government of disagreeable courtiers

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.410
and tried to win other cities
in the realm to their cause.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.780
Alarmed by their excesses,
the University of Paris,

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.600
the Duke of Burgundy and other
initial sympathizers abandoned the

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:15.070
movement in July, and the
movement collapsed in August 1413.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.170 position:56%
So this is an incredibly complicated
history, but let's just focus

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:21.310
for now on the night of April 28.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.770
On this night, the butchers,
as heads of the city militia,

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:27.760
rallied 3000 armed Parisians in
the Palace de Grev [phonetic],

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.720
entering the hotel
de Ville [phonetic]

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.500
and seizing the town standard
to leave them as they marched.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.340
Over the course of the next several
hours, 20,000 more joined them.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.170
These numbers are provided
by chroniclers,

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:42.290 position:56%
and they are probably exaggerations.

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:46.700
A crowd of 23,000 would
represent at least 10 percent

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.620
of the Parisian population in this
time and would have been the size

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.350
of London's population by itself.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:58.040
So these numbers, we have to
doubt, but in any case we can guess

00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.690
that the participation
of everyday rank

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:02.650
and file Parisians was significant.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:06.210
The monk of Saint-Denis Sandonen
[phonetic] describes the riot

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:11.670
as "the popular commotion
instigated by most sordid men

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:15.320
and later the participants as
plebeians and the popular classes."

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:19.000
Once assembled, the crowd
marched to the Bastille.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.580
They did so because they knew
that Pierre de Czar [phonetic]

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.760
from a prominent Paris bourgeois
family and former provost

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:31.170
of Paris once popular but now
hated had taken refuge there.

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:33.620
The Bastille also had both tactical

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:38.210
and symbolic importance
to the city of Paris.

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.980
It had been constructed
here, we see it,

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:46.120
in the 1370's by Charles the fifth
and his authoritarian provost

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.260
of Paris, Ug O Brio [phonetic],

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.340
as part of that king's aggressive
building program intended

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.820
to assert symbolic royal
power and ownership

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:58.930
over the city's physical space
following the Etienne Marcel revolt

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:01.200
of 1356 to eight.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.370
He was scarred for his
whole life by that incident

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:07.220
that I described earlier when the
marshals were executed in front

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:12.630
of him and he wanted to have
an extensive building program

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.410 position:56%
that would kind of assert his power.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:16.750
As an extension of the
Saint Antoine gate,

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:19.680
it was a key strategic
defensive threshold

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.910
between the city's interior
and exterior, which contributed

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:25.060
to the Parisians' concern
that it was being used

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.360
for a planned assault on the city.

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.100
So in 1789, the Bastille was
in the middle of the city.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:34.810
In 1413, it was right
on the edge of the city.

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:37.840
For these reasons, the Bastille
was seen as an intrusion

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:40.380
on the Paris community
sense of peace.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.940
When they arrived, the Parisians
camped out in front the fortress

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.070
and "swore an oath not to leave

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:47.880
until they had taken
the fortress by force."

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.430
Another chronicle says
that they threatened

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:52.470
to demason the fortress,
which I love.

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:53.820
I love that.

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:58.130
The angry crowd was
temporarily mollified, however,

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:02.650 position:56%
and the Bastille given a 376 year
reprieve, when the Duke of Burgundy,

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:06.260
beloved by the masses arrived
and arrested Pierre de Czar.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.240
The Parisians were
not done, however.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.380
Still amassed and a large
crowd, the Parisians marched

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:15.160 position:56%
to the dofan's residence at San Paol
[phonetic] and demanded an audience.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.690
The dofan's counselors
advised him to charge

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:21.520
out his gates wearing
a Fleur de li flag,

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.880
but the teenage Louis could
not muster the courage to do

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.810
so against the armed and
angry throng outside.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:28.110
He was 13.

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:29.650
It would have been hard.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:33.370
The Parisians draped the city stand
over the fleur de li on the gate

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:35.280
of the dofan's residence.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.410
The dofan Louis addressed
the crowd to his credit,

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:41.150
saying that they should
return to their jobs.

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:42.450
From the Roux St. Antoine,

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:44.120
Jean de Troyes [phonetic]
representing the Parisians

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.620
who cheered him on,
he was a surgeon,

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:50.890
and surgeons in those days
weren't the reputable doctors

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:55.610
that they became-- anyway, Jean de
Troyes announced that they had come

00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:57.800
for the benefit of
the realm and demanded

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.180
that the dofan's wicked counselors
be delivered to them immediately,

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.430
producing a scroll of
50 named "traitors"

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:08.400
that they insisted the
dofan's chancellor read aloud.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.560
They also attacked the
dofan's moral character saying

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.630
that he spent too much time in
"indecent nocturnal parties"

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.850
and that they feared that his
lack of guidance and discipline

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:19.780
in his youth would lead him to
the same sickness of his father.

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:24.510
They said that if the demands were
not met they would "rip everything

00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:27.750
to pieces" and the dofan's hotel.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:31.340
When the dofan's chancellor Jean de
Ville read the scroll of traitors,

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.050
the first name on it was his own.

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.490
At this, the dofan
withdrew into his residence

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.740
and refused any more discussion.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.570
The Parisians immediately stormed
the dofan's hall by smashing

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:46.380
down the door and then "raced
through its halls in all directions

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.390
and rifled through all his records
and sized everyone they found,

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:53.390
sending many noblemen in
the dofan's court to prison.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.340
The violence then spread throughout
the city as Parisians rounded

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.500
up other suspected
traitors and arrested them

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.210
and ransacked their homes.

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:04.060
Though the night of April 28
with an intense and extreme

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.070
in its confrontation
with royal authority,

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:08.730
in essence it's continued the
themes I have already tried

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:12.590
to explore today, and the animated
late medieval Parisian popular

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:15.090
opinion in my quiet times as well.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.340
We see the Parisians
able to mobilize quickly,

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.620
probably through word of
mouth facilitated here

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.880
by the militia deputies
who could neighborhood

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.750
by neighborhood to spread the word.

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.710
But they also produced a scroll of
traitors showing their familiarity

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:31.560
with writing and the inner court
workings no doubt disgruntled

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.100
courtiers assisted them in
the drawing up the scroll.

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:38.450
We see the implicit claim to
represent the public good by arming

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:41.570
for the city's defense,
justified by their use

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:42.900
of the militia organization

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.140
and their marching behind the city
standard and also their desire

00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:48.860
to remove threats to the city
by pulling suspected traitor,

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:52.400
Pierre de Czar from the Bastille.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.390
We see them using claims of
the dofan's immorality as a way

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:59.340
to justify arrest of his courtiers
and curbs on his autonomy.

00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:02.430
Through their physical
penetration of the dofan's hall,

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:05.340
we see them claiming the space
as subject to public scrutiny,

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:10.080
a public space rather than a
personal one of the dofan's.

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.820
We see from a broader lens this
crucial dynamic referred to earlier

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.400
that court intrigue could
be animated by alliances

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.470
with the popular classes.

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:20.820
In all, we see the most
spectacular manifestation

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:24.780
of what was a fundamental aspect of
late medieval culture, the central

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:29.980
and tumultuous role of the people
engaged in political action.

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.510
So, I'll stop there.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:43.160
[ Applause ]

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:47.100
So, are there any questions,
anybody have any comments?

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.900
Yeah, sure, Tom?

00:56:48.900 --> 00:57:35.160
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.460
Well thanks for that question.

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:41.210
I actually had a huge chunk on
Habermas that I removed just

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:43.970
because it wasn't working
for this lecture.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:47.740
I wanted to talk about the sources.

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:52.900
And it's hard to answer
in a short thing.

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.310
But yes it's a big part of what
I'm going to try to talk about.

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:58.650
Habermas was very explicit
in that he said

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:02.940 position:56%
that what he was describing was part

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:07.290
of a very contingent political
history, structural features

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:11.810
of the 17th century and
the 18th century in Europe,

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:21.140
and this was essentially that the
people, bourgeoisie especially,

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:25.560
could enter the public sphere,
they were private individuals

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.720 position:56%
who could enter a public sphere as
a public people and voice their sort

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:35.290
of universal opinion using reason
in order to advance their opinions

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:38.000
in kind of a neutral
plane with everyone else.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:44.500
The means for this was
in cafes and salons

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:47.220 position:56%
and newspapers and things like that.

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:51.680
So the structural elements that
Habermas talks about were not

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:56.420
in evidence in the 15th
century, 14th century in Paris.

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.080
Although some of them were.

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:01.660
I mean, some sort of insipient
versions of that were.

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:04.210
And Habermas doesn't say
much about the Middle Ages.

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:05.510
He sort of hints at it.

00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:08.100
Other people kind of coming after
him had filled that picture in,

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:11.570
but what Habermas does say is that,
oh gosh, there's so much to say.

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:14.280
I'm going to try to keep
this as short as I can.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.990
He says that what's crucial
is that there is a line

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:18.990
between the government
and the people.

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:20.940
There's the government
and the civic society.

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:23.180
And what traditionally
people like Habermas

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.070
and other's says is the Middle
Ages didn't have that line.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:29.660
The Middle Ages had all these
intermediate entities, lords,

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.900
other jurisdictions, and all of
these people so that the public,

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:37.020
what would be the public's sphere,
was filled by all these kind

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:42.150
of intermediate things,
and the medieval sort

00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:46.590
of political story was thus not
one with a line between government

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:50.530
and people but actually a
whole bunch of nodes of power.

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.830
I think Habermas talked
about status, sort of walking

00:59:53.830 --> 01:00:01.710 position:56%
around with the nobility rather
than-- so that's Habermas' argument.

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:06.280
And he said what I'm
describing is not an ideal type

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.580
but a specific event.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:12.280
A lot of people have
criticized Habermas.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.070
I think that the best criticism of
Habermas is the feminist criticism

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.720
for example that points
out that what he describes

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.880
as a universal public sphere was
in fact very heavily gendered.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:30.030
There were all sorts of rules of
playing in the public sphere that,

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:32.220
you know, they talk about
it being governed by reason

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:36.110
but in fact there are all sorts of
kind of social identity, related,

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:39.110
gendered things that
were restraining it.

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:42.890
And Nancy Frasier,
her argument's great.

01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:46.870
And other people have
also come in, not just me

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:49.390
but other people have talked about
how there are many different kinds

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:53.100 position:56%
of public sphere, you know, the very
thing that Habermas didn't want.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:58.120 position:56%
I have sort of articulated arguments
why there are actually many of them

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:05.610
and that Habermas is a little
too sort of Euro-centric and kind

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.770
of modern-centric in his thing.

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:14.350
What I would say against the still
strong and still potent argument is

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:19.260
that in the Middle Ages we see,
and I think the court is the key,

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:23.490
we see antagonists, people
defining themselves as subjects

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:27.870
and as marginalized from kind
of royal government as subjects,

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:34.200
and then the court is this object
of frustration, animosity, hatred,

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.170
and so in some ways you see
what Habermas was talking about,

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:40.480
which was a line between the
government and the people.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:45.310 position:56%
But this co-exists with all of these
other sort of political affiliations

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:48.520
that Habermas was talking
about, that people have talked

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.370
about since de Tokeville
[phonetic] and Marx, you know.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:57.250
So, but I think that because
you do have those kind of,

01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:02.450
that kind of dynamic between Court
and people, you are seeing sort

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:07.460
of this kind of early version
of people considering themselves

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:12.090
as a kind of a public
against the government.

01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:14.180
Now is it governed by reason?

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.610
I think I've already answered
this question for a long time,

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:21.230
so I'm sort of reluctant
to be there.

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:24.410
No, I mean there was a sort
of, there was a culture

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:28.450
of reasonableness that people try
to advocate, but it wasn't as sort

01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:31.490
of blown up, and it's
kind of celebrated

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:33.730
as it was in the enlightenment.

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:38.180 position:56%
And I guess I would go back to Nancy
Frasier's argument and the argument

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.210
of others that this kind
of ethic reason was itself,

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:46.450
a kind of cultural construct that
couched and hid all of these kind

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:52.100
of sort of gendered and other ways

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.000
that there was excluded
and included people.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.120
That was a long answer.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.140
I'm sorry everyone, but
it's a really good question,

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:03.980
and it's really complicated stuff.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.690
Did I kill every-- yeah?

01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:08.960
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] politics,
so but I notice

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:14.500
that [inaudible] royal taxation
would be a political issues

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.090
[inaudible] and so forth,

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:19.400
and I [inaudible] ever a
perceived public interest or, yeah,

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.880 position:56%
public interest on the spending side

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:27.700
such that you would
find a tax ear marked

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:34.180
for a particular activity
[inaudible] or more acceptable

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.880 position:56%
or less than the object [inaudible],
so on the spending side,

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.180
what was understood

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:45.720
to be [inaudible] a worthy activity
[inaudible] the subjects would kind

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:54.060
of go along, and the other
thing that I was kind of curious

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.360
about one might [inaudible]
conflicts is

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.100
to have a good [inaudible]
a good outside [inaudible]

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:05.950
and the English were sort
of [inaudible] and I kind

01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:12.700
of wondered what role they played
either rhetorically or in actuality

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.300
as [inaudible] these
things, you know,

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.020 position:56%
the French would put all [inaudible]
come together [inaudible].

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.080
&gt;&gt; Okay. Two good questions.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:26.730
So the story of taxation is quite
complicated, but the original,

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.070
sort of medieval structure
of taxation as sort

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:31.610
of exactly what you're talking
about, that taxation had to be

01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:39.090 position:56%
for a specific purpose, and so
originally leaders would raise a tax

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:44.320
for building a wall, for
paying for my son's wedding,

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.020
for very specific purposes.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.800
And for a war most often.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:54.040
Okay. And so this was the
tradition, and leaders always had

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.690
to articulate what that purpose
was, municipal leaders had

01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:00.560
to articulate what that purpose
was, and there was an expectation

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.060
of a kind of cause and effect.

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:11.040
In the 14th Century the
war became the hundred,

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.500 position:56%
well the term the hundred years war
was a later term applied to the war,

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.900
but there was basically a kind
of endless war with the English,

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.640
and in the context
of the endless war

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.820
with the English there was
also an endless need for funds.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.170
And so the French government,

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:31.490 position:56%
the royal government kept collecting
money for war against the English

01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:35.510 position:56%
such that they just finally said
guys, let's just do this every year.

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:36.810
We always need money.

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:38.110
We're running out of money.

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:40.570
And when they tried to do that,
that's when the most serious,

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.810 position:56%
I mean I would call it a revolution,
the Etienne Marcel uprising,

01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:50.860
when the crown tried to
impose permanent taxation,

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.840
and it was in the king got captured
at the battle of [inaudible]

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.830
by the English, and
to pay his ransom

01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:01.470
because the English extracted
a huge ransom for him.

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:05.060
The crown said we just
need huge amounts of money.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.630
And in the face of that, Etienne
Marcel, the provost of Paris,

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:13.320
I mean the provost of merchants
in Paris, and the estates general,

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:18.700 position:56%
you know, created a very significant
resistance reform movement,

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.110
and they tried to have the
estates government essentially,

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.010
state's general essentially
govern the country.

01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:25.430
So the resistance to this kind

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:32.840
of permanent taxation was pretty
serious, and it was, they never,

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.220
they never stopped being serious.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.830
I mean this taxation
problem continued.

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:39.460
What stopped it is kind of the
answer to your second question,

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:43.560
or what changed the game, which
is, after all of these revolts

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.840
that I'm talking about and
the civil war especially

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.850
between these two parties,
the Burgundians

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:51.790
and the Armonex [phonetic], so
kind of a complicated story,

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:55.880
but basically the Duke of Burgundy
assassinated the king's brother

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.370
in 1407, and these two
factions sort of fought,

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:03.560
and they fought for years.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.890
When that happened, and with
all these revolts happening,

01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:09.240
France was severely weakened,
and the English invaded

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:13.780
under Henry the fifth [inaudible]
1415, they occupied France

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:20.190
and northern France in 1420 an
in the treaty of Troyes in 1420,

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:23.090
Henry the fifth's son, Henry
the sixth, Henry the fifth

01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:25.610
of England's son, was
to take over the crown

01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:27.550
of France, so this was disaster.

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:30.150
And in this, and this
is happening, you know,

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:32.950
ten years after the
events I'm describing,

01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:36.910
in this context you have the dofan,
who has got his little enclave,

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:38.760 position:56%
and that's when Joan of Arc appears.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:45.020
Okay. And I think you can say
that that changes the equation

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:50.650
for many Frenchmen and
that is the external enemy

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.100
around which they are
able to mobilize.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.080
That being said, I always insist
that you must understand that even

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:01.840
with Joan of Arc, even with the
English occupying most of France,

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.750
that there were a lot of people in
France who we would call Frenchmen,

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:08.120
including the Parisians
most notably,

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.930
who didn't like Joan of Arc.

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:12.800
Joan of Arc was an Armonac, she
was kind of on the other side.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.120
Joan of Arc was burned
by the Burgundians,

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.990
the English captured her but
handed her over to the Burgundians

01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:20.900
to burn her, and so
this idea of Frenchness

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:25.050
that was being mobilized
successfully by the dofan

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:30.410
and by his party was eventually
able to kind of overcome some

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:34.450
of this kind of fractiousness,
but that even in Joan

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:38.090
of Arc's time it was
not a sort of done deal.

01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:40.280
So, that was long answer too.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.390 position:56%
I'm trying to not have long answers.

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:44.190
Yes sir?

01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:58.140
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:01.510
Well there's tons of popular
mobilizations in Europe.

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:04.830
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:09.090
No, it's not unique, but
the university of Paris

01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:12.910 position:56%
in this period mostly because of the
papal, politics of the papal schism

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:16.390
in which there was a pope in Rome
and a pope in Avienne [phonetic],

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:18.230
became really, really
politically active and kind

01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:22.140
of exercised its muscle more
than I think most university,

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:26.030
most universities and
other places did.

01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:28.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.730
Well, I mean, so the University
of Tullos [phonetic] and the south

01:09:30.730 --> 01:09:34.400
of France was kind of a very
different political context,

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.380
but the University of Tullos
issued what I described here,

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.750
this letter in 1406 saying
that the king was a heretic

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:44.210
for supporting the Aviennial pope.

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:45.750
So, yeah, they would get involved.

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:51.310 position:56%
The University of Orleans would also
get involved in the uprisings there

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:55.890 position:56%
in the 1380s and the Italian
universities, some of these jurists,

01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:58.710
and I don't think they
weren't sort of directly

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:01.660
in the street the way the
University of Paris people were,

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.550
but a lot of their
jurists are articulating,

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:10.710
as I sort of alluded to,
justifications of government as,

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:15.680 position:56%
you know, being based in the popular
sovereignty, and Marsilius of Padua,

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.790
you know, is the most sort
of strident version of that.

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:24.350
He basically kind of almost
a republican in this period.

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:26.520
But no, I don't think
overall it's nothing compared

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.820
to University of Paris.
