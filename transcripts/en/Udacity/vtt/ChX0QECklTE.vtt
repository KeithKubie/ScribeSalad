00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So congratulations, you just finished unit 1.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You just finished unit 1 of this class,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
where I told you about key applications

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of artificial intelligence,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I told you about the definition of an intelligent agent,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I gave you 4 key attributes of intelligent agents

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(partial observability, stochasticity, continuous spaces, and adversarial natures),

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I discussed sources and management of uncertainty,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and I briefly mentioned the mathematical concept of rationality.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Obviously, I only touched any of these issues superficially,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but as this class goes on you're going to dive into any of those

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and learn much more about

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
what it takes to make a truly intelligent AI system.

00:00:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Thank you.
