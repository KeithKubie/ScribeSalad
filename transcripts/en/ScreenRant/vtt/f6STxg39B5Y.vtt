00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.200
Movie fans these days know to keep an eye
out for more than just the plot, as writers

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.929
and directors have made a habit of planting
easter eggs, inside jokes, and references

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.730
to classic movies at every turn.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.250
But who says the fun has to stop when the
movie ends?

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.310
Some of the funniest jokes and hidden treasures
can be found once the credits start to roll.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.530
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Details
Hidden in Movie Credits.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.730
Back to the Future
By now, most people know that Marty McFly's

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.040
disastrous trip to Old Man Peabody's farm
was the first time he changed the future,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.700
turning "Twin Pines Mall" into "Lone Pine
Mall".

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.850
But did you catch the other time travel joke?

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.700
The farmer's son only appears for a second,
but is listed in the credits as "Sherman Peabody"

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.350
- a reference to Mr Peabody and Sherman, the
stars of the famous time travel cartoon.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.410
Harry Potter &amp; The Prisoner of Azkaban
The Marauder's Map came in handy to help Harry

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.420
and his friends track students and teachers
in real time, but the magical map was also

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.200
home to the most well-hidden gag in the series.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.310
The movie's credits follow dozens of footprints
throughout the school, including two pairs

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.259
that seem to be getting romantic.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.990
Some people claimed it was too adult for a
kids movie, but the animator claims he really

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.060
only meant it as a childhood kiss, explaining
the movement.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.270
We'll let you decide.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.749
Robocop
The dark future of Robocop got even darker

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:35.070
when a good cop was slaughtered and rebuilt
as more machine than man, but the homicidal

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.389
robots he had to fight were even scarier.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.909
That's what the filmmakers were counting on,
too.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.490
When the final copyright notices scrolled
by in the credits, they packed an added promise:

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.259
that ignoring the notices "may result in civil
liability and criminal prosecution by enforcement

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.369
droids."

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.419
No evidence that they ever made good on the
threat, though.

00:01:55.419 --> 00:02:01.380
Frozen
No matter how crazy, unbelievable, or impossible

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.479
a movie may be, studios usually cover by warning
audiences that nobody was hurt during filming,

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.130
or that incredible stunts were carried out
by professionals.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.220
For Disney's Frozen, the studio decided to
distance itself from a controversial claim

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.319
instead, confirming that the outrageous claim
made by Kristoff doesn't represent the opinions

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.409
of the studio.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:32.959
Mission: Impossible 3
Before J.J. Abrams was rebooting Star Trek,

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.540
Star Wars, and bringing a new spin to the
Mission: Impossible series, he helped create

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.490
the TV sensation LOST.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.280
Knowing how much fans of the TV show loved
a good conspiracy, he made sure to thank The

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.620
Hanso Foundation - the company behind the
mysterious DHARMA Project - in the end credits.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.030
Finding Nemo
Fans of Pixar's movies know that the animators

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.870
love to plant easter eggs and well-hidden
cameos from other characters - but they're

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.769
not always so secretive.

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.130
Most young audiences probably left the theater
when the credits on Finding Nemo started rolling,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.129
but if they had stayed put, they would have
caught an unexplained appearance from a swimming

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:15.310
Mike Wazowski, the star of the studio's previous
movie Monsters, Inc.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.860
Pulp Fiction
Quentin Tarantino has shown how strange his

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.810
sense of humor can be, so when the victim
of an armed robbery has his line cut short

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.409
in the movie's closing act, he didn't miss
a beat.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.489
The actor was supposed to say "I'm just a
coffee shop manager," but was cut off.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.560
The director decided to go with the line he
really did say, crediting the actor as "Coffee

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.180
Shop" in the final credits.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.049
Guardians of the Galaxy
Long before CG effects spread across Hollywood,

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.129
movies had to rely on actual animals - which
led to a guarantee in the credits that "no

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.359
animals were harmed" while making the movie.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.920
Even though they were more fantasy than fact,
the makers of Guardians of the Galaxy still

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.450
decided they should let fans know: "no raccoons
or tree creatures were harmed," either.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.310
Fight Club
If you know director David Fincher, then you

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.799
know Andrew Kevin Walker, the screenwriter
of both Seven and 8MM.

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.970
But Fincher's trusted writer was also brought
in to work on the script for Fight Club.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.471
Even though he didn't do enough work to earn
an official credit for the movie, the director

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.250
found a way to include him.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.970
The three police detectives who assault the
movie's narrator are never named, but are

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.130
credited as Detective Andrew, Detective Kevin
and Detective Walker, giving the writer a

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.280
full, if unusual appearance in the credits.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.820
Brave
The medieval magic of this Pixar story begins

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.889
when a young girl can't help but chase after
a will o' the wisp - a magical creature of

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.350
blue light.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.530
Their real nature is revealed when the monstrous
bear, Mor-du, is killed, and his true spirit

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.980
is released, becoming one of the wisps.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.310
Knowing that, it's hard not to shed a tear
when the final credits dedicate the movie

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.020
to the late Steve Jobs, the studio's biggest
supporter, creating a new wisp in his place.&nbsp;

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.500
