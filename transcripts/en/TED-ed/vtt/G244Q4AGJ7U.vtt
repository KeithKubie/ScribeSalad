00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:10.611
Take a look at the water in this glass.

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:14.355
Refreshing, hydrating, and invaluable
to your survival.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:15.929
Before you take a sip, though,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.926
how do you know that the water inside
is free from disease-causing organisms

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:22.589
and pollutants?

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.591
One out of ten people in the world
can't actually be sure

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.431
that their water is clean 
and safe to drink.

00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:31.386
Why is that?

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:32.806
Inadequate sanitation,

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:34.916
poor protection of drinking water sources,

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.655
and improper hygiene

00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:40.377
often lead to sewage 
and feces-contaminated water.

00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:43.198
That's the ideal breeding ground
for dangerous bacteria,

00:00:43.198 --> 00:00:44.258
viruses,

00:00:44.258 --> 00:00:45.989
and parasites.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.078
And the effects of these pathogens
are staggering.

00:00:49.078 --> 00:00:52.904
Diarrheal disease from unsafe water is one
of the leading causes of death

00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:56.187
around the world for children under five.

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:58.588
And according to a U.N. report from 2010,

00:00:58.588 --> 00:01:05.739
microbial water-borne illnesses killed
more people per year than war.

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:09.808
Proper treatment processes, though,
can address these threats.

00:01:09.808 --> 00:01:11.538
They usually have three parts:

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.607
sedimentation,

00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:13.739
filtration,

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.329
and disinfection.

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.857
Once water has been collected
in a treatment facility,

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:19.598
it's ready for cleaning.

00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:23.139
The first step, sedimentation,
just takes time.

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:28.339
The water sits undisturbed, allowing
heavier particles to sink to the bottom.

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:31.040
Often, though, particles 
are just too small

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.244
to be removed by sedimentation alone

00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:35.189
and need to be filtered.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.379
Gravity pulls the water downward through
layers of sand

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:41.250
that catch leftover particles 
in their pores,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.750
prepping the water 
for its final treatment,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.811
a dose of disinfectant.

00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:49.087
Chemicals, primarily forms 
of chlorine and ozone,

00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:51.750
are mixed in to kill off any pathogens

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.279
and to disinfect pipes 
and storage systems.

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:59.112
Chlorine is highly effective in destroying
water's living organisms,

00:01:59.112 --> 00:02:01.482
but its use remains government-regulated

00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:04.801
because it has potentially harmful
chemical byproducts.

00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:09.040
And if an imbalance of chlorine occurs
during the disinfection process,

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.091
it can trigger other chemical reactions.

00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.603
For example, 
levels of chlorine byproducts,

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:18.881
like trihalomethanes, could skyrocket,
leading to pipe corrosion

00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:25.492
and the release of iron, copper,
and lead into drinking water.

00:02:25.492 --> 00:02:27.892
Water contamination from these
and other sources

00:02:27.892 --> 00:02:29.042
including leaching,

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:30.392
chemical spills,

00:02:30.392 --> 00:02:31.592
and runoffs,

00:02:31.592 --> 00:02:33.814
has been linked 
to long-term health effects,

00:02:33.814 --> 00:02:34.620
like cancer,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.343
cardiovascular and neurological diseases,

00:02:37.343 --> 00:02:39.493
and miscarriage.

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.704
Unfortunately, analyzing the exact risks

00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:45.091
of chemically contaminated 
water is difficult.

00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:47.651
So while it's clear that disinfectants
make us safer

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:49.954
by removing disease-causing pathogens,

00:02:49.954 --> 00:02:52.234
experts have yet 
to determine the full scope

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:55.035
of how the chemical cocktail 
in our drinking water

00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:58.013
really impacts human health.

00:02:58.013 --> 00:03:01.566
So how can you tell whether the water
you have access to,

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:03.585
whether from a tap or otherwise,

00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:05.365
is drinkable?

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:07.185
Firstly, too much turbidity,

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:08.935
trace organic compounds,

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:13.776
or high-density heavy metals like arsenic,
chromium, or lead,

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:17.215
mean that the water 
is unsuitable for consumption.

00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:19.805
A lot of contaminants, 
like lead or arsenic,

00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:21.867
won't be obvious without tests,

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:23.805
but some clues, like cloudiness,

00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:25.816
brown or yellow coloration,

00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:27.073
a foul odor,

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.687
or an excessive chlorine smell

00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:32.518
can indicate the need 
to investigate further.

00:03:32.518 --> 00:03:34.666
Water testing kits can go a step further

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:39.887
and confirm the presence of many different
contaminants and chemicals.

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:41.520
With many types of contamination,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.941
there are ways of treating water where 
it's used instead of close to its source.

00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:50.127
Point-of-use treatment has actually
been around for thousands of years.

00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:55.598
Ancient Egyptians boiled away many
organic contaminants with the sun's heat.

00:03:55.598 --> 00:03:58.522
And in Ancient Greece, Hippocrates
designed a bag

00:03:58.522 --> 00:04:02.287
that trapped bad tasting 
sediments from water.

00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:05.857
Today, point-of-use processes usually
involve ionization

00:04:05.857 --> 00:04:07.579
to lower mineral content.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.389
They also use adsorption filtration,

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.347
where a porous material
called activated carbon

00:04:13.347 --> 00:04:17.870
strains the water to remove contaminants
and chemical byproducts.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.819
While it's not always an effective
long-term solution,

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.499
point-of-use treatment is portable,
easy to install, and adaptable.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.698
And in regions where large-scale
systems are unavailable,

00:04:28.698 --> 00:04:32.131
or where water has been contaminated
further along its journey,

00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:36.569
these systems can mean the difference
between life and death.

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.099
Clean water remains a precious
and often scarce commodity.

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.982
There are nearly 800 million of us who
still don't have regular access to it.

00:04:44.982 --> 00:04:48.061
The good news is that continued
developments in water treatment,

00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:50.301
both on a large and small scale,

00:04:50.301 --> 00:04:52.811
can alleviate a lot of unsafe conditions.

00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:55.111
Implementing proper systems where
they're needed

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:58.489
and paying careful attention
to the ones already in place

00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:01.870
will fulfill one of the most basic
of our human needs.
