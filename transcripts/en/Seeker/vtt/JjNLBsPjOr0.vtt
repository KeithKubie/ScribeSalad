00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.080
Hey hummingbirds!

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.999
You think you’re so perfect, fluttering
around, lookin’ all pretty?

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:07.310
Well we finally found a way to make you look
clumsy and dumb!

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.790
Just like us!

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.790
Hey bird lovers!

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.150
I’m Chastity, filling in for DNews.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.170
Hummingbirds are incredible creatures, aren’t
they?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.350
Just watching them in flight, darting from
flower to flower, is awe-inspiring.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.770
To drink nectar from flowers, hummingbirds
rely on their ability to hover.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.770
But how do they do it?

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.420
Engineers from Vanderbilt University teamed
up with a biologist from University of North

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.510
Carolina at Chapel Hill to create a detailed,
aerodynamic simulation of hummingbird flight.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.830
The simulation demonstrates that the way a
hummingbird flies is much more closely related

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.690
to insects than it is to other birds.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.550
Unlike other birds, Hummingbirds can generate
lift not just on the downstroke, but on the

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.850
upstroke as well.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.480
This happens by inverting their wings.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.490
Larger birds get practically all of their
lift on the downstroke.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.400
Insects, however, can also hover, fly back
and forth, and side to side.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.140
Their wing construction may be different,
but like the hummingbird, insects also produce

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.420
lift from both the upstroke and downstroke.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.900
Hovering, in itself, is an amazing feat that
requires intense visual processing.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.470
But two researchers from the University of
British Columbia claim to have found a glitch

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.940
in the hummingbird hover system.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.670
The researchers found that altering a hummingbird’s
visual stimuli while it attempts to feed causes

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.250
the bird to falter in flight.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.720
The hummingbirds were put into a laboratory
flight arena.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.590
They hovered around a plastic feeder in front
of a surface that projected images.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.280
When still images were projected, the birds
had no visible response.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.350
Moving images, however, seemed to trip their
game up.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.370
A rotating spiral, for example, caused the
hummingbirds to drift backward repeatedly

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.280
as they tried to make contact with the feeder.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.750
Kind of like me trying jog and drink water
at the same time.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.160
The poor hummingbirds still could not get
used to the moving images when the researchers

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.770
repeated the experiment.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.200
When the bird’s beak broke contact with
the feeder, a re-boot was triggered - the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.909
bird would come back to its original hover
position, only to get tripped up again by

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.270
the same images.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.960
The researchers explain that this experiment
suggests quote - “the hummingbirds' visual

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.710
motion detection network can over-ride even
a critical behavior like feeding."

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.810
These findings could open a door to more research
on other interesting ways that flying birds

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.230
use visual information.
