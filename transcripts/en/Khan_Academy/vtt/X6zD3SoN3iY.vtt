00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:01.975
Simplify 25 a to the third

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.933
and a to the third is being raised to the third power, times b squared

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:09.723
and all of that over 5 a squared, b times b squared

00:00:09.723 --> 00:00:12.698
So we can do this in multiple ways, simplify different parts.

00:00:12.698 --> 00:00:16.262
What I want to do is simplify this part right over here.

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:18.990
a to the third power, and we're raising that to the third power.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.871
So this is going to be from the power property of exponents, or the power rule

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:27.489
this is going to be the same thing as a to the 3 times 3 power

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.082
So this over here (let me scroll up a little bit)

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.456
is going to be equal to a the 3 times 3 power, or a to the ninth power.

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:41.329
We could also simplify this b times b squared over here.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.415
This b times b squared, that is the same thing as b to the first power

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:49.271
remember, b is just b to the first power. So it's b to the first power times

00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:53.606
b to the second power. So b to the first times b to the second power

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:59.375
is just equal to b to the one plus two power, which is equal to b to the third power

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:04.102
and then last thing we could simplify, just right off the bat just looking at this:

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:08.195
we have a 25 divided by 5. Well that's just going to give us 5.

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:10.790
or we could say it's going to give us 5 over 1

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.918
if you view it as dividing the numerator and the denominator both by 5.

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:17.082
So what does our expression simiply to?

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:25.667
We have 5a to the ninth, and then we still have this b squared here, b squared.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:35.200
All of that over a squared times b to the third power... times b to the third power.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.887
Now, we can use the quotient property of exponents.

00:01:36.887 --> 00:01:38.395
You have an a to the ninth

00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:43.621
Let me use a slightly different color. We have an a to the ninth.

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:47.733
over a squared. What's that going to simplify to?

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.302
Well, that's going to simplify to be the same thing,

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:49.818
let me write this

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:56.677
a to the ninth over a squared, the same thing as a to the nine minus two, which is equal to

00:01:56.677 --> 00:01:59.031
a to the seventh power.

00:01:59.031 --> 00:01:59.975
Now we also have

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:02.036
and this will get a little bit interesting here

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:05.025
We have a b squared over b to the third power

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:07.867
So that simplifies too.

00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:10.118
So b squared over b to the third is equal to

00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:12.975
b to the two minus three power, which is equal to

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:13.513
b to the negative one power.

00:02:13.944 --> 00:02:16.631
And we'll leave it alone like that right now.

00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:18.790
So this whole expression simplifies to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.810
It simplifies to: 5 times a to the seventh power (because this simplifies to a to the seventh)

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:33.092
a to the seventh, times (the bs right here simplify too)

00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:36.600
b to the negative one.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.979
We could leave it like that, you know, that's pretty simple

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.215
but we may not want a negative exponent there

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:45.421
we just have to remeber that b to the negative one power is the same thing as

00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:48.779
one over b. Now if we remember that, then we can rewrite this

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:52.036
entire expression as, the numerator will have a five

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:54.913
and will have a to the seventh

00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:58.692
5 a to the seventh. And then the denominator will have the b.

00:02:58.723 --> 00:03:02.179
So we're multiplying this times one over b.

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.523
That's the same thing as b to the negative one.

00:03:04.523 --> 99:59:59.999
And we are done!
