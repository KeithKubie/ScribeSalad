ALICIA GOODE: I first started
experimenting with taxidermy

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.000
when I was a little kid.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.660
I remember making shoe box
dioramas for my friends.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.830
Some of my friends parents
weren't too thrilled

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.401
about that, but I
thought it was great.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.250
My name's Alicia Goode, and
I'm an exhibits preparator

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.220
at the Oakland
Museum of California.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.580
One of the things that I
really love about taxidermy

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.730
as a profession is that
it's a great melding

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.900
of a lot of the areas
that I'm passionate about.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.900
So I've always been
artistically inclined

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.500
and I've always loved nature.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.050
I started out pursuing
a degree in zoology,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.310
but then I decided to
switch to fine art.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.470
And I actually didn't
end up finishing school

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.230
because I got a job
at a big museum.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.520
And so I quit school to
avoid going into debt

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.890
and just turned full-time
and never looked back.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.410
I think the work that
we did at the Oakland

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.470
Museum of California was
one of the biggest projects

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.750
that I've been involved with.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.070
And there was a grizzly
bear in particular that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.710
was just in horrible shape.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.340
We also got a herd of Tule Elk.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.940
They were also pretty damaged
or even older than the bear was.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.360
They were collected in 1910.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.510
And I think that to
pull off a nice mount

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.090
and to have it be believable
is to amass as much reference

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.710
you can and get to
know the species.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.680
See them up close in life
and learn their attitudes

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.740
and posturing.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.200
People sometimes
think it's creepy.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.260
I don't think it's
creepy at all.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.610
There's no fascination with
death or morbid aesthetic

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.840
that I'm really going after.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.390
The most rewarding
part of my job

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.820
is knowing that I'm
creating something

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.450
that might inspire people
to care about nature

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.820
and want to conserve it.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.530
Hopefully through going
to natural history museums

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.626
and seeing taxidermy
and dioramas,

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.500
they'll learn about all
these different kinds

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.169
of animals and environments.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.900
And hopefully through
knowing about them

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.650
and caring about them
and being interested

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.858
and then, they'll want to
protect them in the future.

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.130
SUBJECT 1: Are you pursuing
a unique career path?

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.980
Let us know in the
comments below.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.430
And to find out how a former
corporate lawyer gave up

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.760
his career to be a
full-time LEGO artist,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.270
check out this video right here.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.040
SUBJECT 2: I left
the law firm behind

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.910
to play with bricks full-time.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.480
The bricks I use in my art
are the very same bricks

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.230
that people could
purchase at a toy store.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.120
I don't paint them.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.160
I don't have access to special
colors or special shapes

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.860
and sizes.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.910
And we're in my art
studio today where I have

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.919
over five million LEGO bricks.

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.210
