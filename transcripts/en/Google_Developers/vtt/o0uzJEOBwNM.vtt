FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Hello.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.950
I'm Florina Muntenescu
for the Developer Show.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.190
This is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.560
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.480
And P Beta 3 is now available.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.120
It's our next milestone in
this year's Android P Developer

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.620
Preview.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.600
And it takes us
very close to what

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.270
you'll see in the final
version of Android P, due

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.830
later this summer.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.110
Included are the
Beta 3 system images

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.690
for Pixel devices and
the Android Emulator,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.510
as well as an update to the
Android Studio Build Tools

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.400
to include D8 as an
independent tool.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.260
Head on over to the post to get
started in a few simple steps.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.350
And to learn what's new
for text in Android P,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.910
check out this post.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.160
TextView is one of the
most critical components

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.810
of the Android View system.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.550
So this is why we
continue to invest

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.460
in both developer- and
user-facing features

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.210
and improvements, including
precomputed text, magnifier,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.940
Smart Linkify, and more.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.650
Now that the core
has been stabilized

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.860
with the recent Kubernetes
1.11 release, we'd

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.440
like to share a deeper
look at the Kubernetes work

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.650
that Google is driving, as
well as some of the innovation

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.540
we've built on
Kubernetes foundations

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.040
in the last three months.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.640
Check out the post for details
on priority and preemption,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.870
changes to CRDs, Cloud
Provider plugins, and more.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.870
And if you missed any of the
Google Cloud Platform updates

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.540
from June, check out this post.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.390
Highlights include Node.js
on Google App Engine's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.760
standard environment,
QUIC, a transfer protocol

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.580
optimized for HTTPS, and Cloud
Firestore as a GCP storage

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.890
option.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.900

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.820
Thanks for watching.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.060
And we'll see you next week.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.160
SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.710
That's [? coming. ?]
