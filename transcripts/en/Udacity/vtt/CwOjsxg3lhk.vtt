00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is "yes."

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this part of the state space, we are obviously entering values that are too small,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but the heuristic is admissible if h(x) is lower than the cost-to-goal.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It would have been inadmissible if the values over here were much larger

00:00:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
than the values we want them to be.
