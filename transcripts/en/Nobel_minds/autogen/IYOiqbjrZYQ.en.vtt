00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.030

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.390
 tell us that when we wake up, everything will be fine 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.700
 but it was not a bad dream 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.300
 it was the reality cd you 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.690
 our new reality the republic 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.750
 democratic of the congo 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.459
 as for our baby arrived I 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.560
 realized that these problems could not 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.930
 not find a solution to the block 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.510
 operative but that it was necessary to fight 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.670
 against the root causes of these 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.890
 atrocities 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.549
 I have not been to the village of the cases you 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.739
 to talk with men why 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.170
 you do not protect your babies your 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.860
 girls and your women 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.170
 where are the authorities in these villages 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.599
 to my surprise villager 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.150
 knew the suspect 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.700
 everyone was afraid of him because he 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.430
 was a member of the provincial parliament and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.010
 enjoyed absolute power over the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.750
 population 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.660
 for several months his militia 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.780
 terrorized the entire village he had a 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.870
 style and fear kills a defender of 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.989
 human rights who had the courage 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.660
 to denounce the facts the deputies 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.109
 is drawn without consequence immunity 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.530
 parliamentary allowed him to abuse 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.810
 with impunity 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.690
 these two babies were followed by 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.289
 dozens more children raped 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:28.419
 when the 48th victim arrived 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.680
 were despairing with others 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.700
 human rights defenders 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.620
 we seized a military court 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.970
 finally these rapes were continued 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.240
 and judged as a crime against humanity 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.610
 rape of bba vaults ceased 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.719
 calls to panzi on May 6 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.360
 the psychological and sexual future 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:58.139
 reproductive genetics of his babies is 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.479
 mortgaged what happened to kavumu 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.030
 and which continues today in 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.719
 many other villages in Congo such 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:10.259
 that rapes and massacres to be blessed and 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:12.800
 Kasai was made possible by 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.919
 the absence of a state of law 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.669
 the foundation of traditional values 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:22.279
 it reigns impunity in particular 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:27.409
 for the people in power 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:30.599
 the rapes the massacre the torture 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:34.439
 insecurity spreads the lack 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:37.099
 of education create a spiral of 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:40.560
 unprecedented violence 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:44.370
 the bus lines of this perverse chaos and 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.539
 organized was hundreds of 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.419
 thousands of women raped over 4 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:56.039
 millions of displaced people to 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:59.539
 the interior of the country and the loss of 6 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.539
 millions of lives 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:06.409

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:12.539
 poverty the whole population of denmark 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:14.639
 decimated the peacekeepers the 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.520
 United nations experts have not been 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:21.569

 until these days so the situation 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:35.089
 does not degenerate further

 troubling and that is the abundance of our

 smartphone these objects contain some 

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:57.470
 minerals that are found here often 

00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:02.090
 extracted in inhuman conditions 

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:03.870

 think for a moment about the human cost 

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.640
 of making these objects as 

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.000
 that consumer the least that one 

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.000
 can do 

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.510
 as a consumer the least that 

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.230
 we can do 

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:51.650
 and insist that these products be 

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:53.350
 made with respect for dignity 

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.840

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.170
 the perpetrators of the violence that are 

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.650
 responsible for their crimes 

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:08.830
 but also it is that they choose to 

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:12.320
 look away 

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:14.990

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:18.920

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:25.910

 profits of the nominees ray ended up on 

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:43.490
 the opaque accounts of an oligarchy 

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:47.390

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:14.720
 shame on our common humanity 

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:19.730
 the inhabitants of my country have 

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:22.760
 desperate for peace but 

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:24.380
 how to build peace on two 

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.870
 mass graves 

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:30.080
 how to build peace without truth 

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:34.100
 nor reconciliation 

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:37.430
 how to build peace without justice 

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:42.330
 neither repair 

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:45.800
 at the moment I'm talking to you about intake 

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:48.350
 self-help mold in the drawers 

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:51.830
 from about to new york 

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:56.280
 it was written after an investigation 

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:58.650
 professional and rigorous on 

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:02.340
 war crimes and violations of 

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:06.620
 human rights perpetrated in the congo this 

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:11.340
 investigation explicitly names victims 

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:15.990
 places but dates and fight 

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:18.420
 the authors it is report of the project 

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:21.350
 mapping established by the high commission 

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:25.680
 united nations human rights 

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:27.740

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:32.960
 war and crimes against humanity 

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:35.940
 and maybe even crimes of genocide 

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.030
 what is the world waiting for them to be 

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:43.200
 taken into account 

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:47.610
 there is no lasting peace without justice 

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:50.180
 but justice does not negotiate have the 

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.830
 courage to take a critical look 

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.740
 impartial on the events that 

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:57.350
 have been raging for too long in the 

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:01.170
 Great Lakes Region 

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:04.100
 let's have the courage to reveal the names of 

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:07.140
 perpetrators of crimes against humanity 

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.450
 to simply avoid them 

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:13.290
 continue to mourn this region 

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:15.050
 martyrdom let us have the courage to recognize 

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:18.660
 our mistakes of the past 

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:22.890
 let's have the courage to tell the truth and 

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:24.810
 perform the work of the memoirs 

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.779
 dear fellow Congolese 

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:34.310

 together let's build a better future 

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:02.310
 for africa 

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:06.840
 nobody will do it for us 

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:10.020
 ladies and gentlemen of peace 

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:13.930
 the paintings that I brushed you 

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:15.790
 offered a sinister reality but 

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:19.590
 let me tell you 

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:22.540
 the story of sarah sarah has been to us 

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:25.690
 transferred to the panzi hospital in a 

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:28.840
 critical state his village had been 

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:31.810
 attacked by an armed group that had 

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:36.370
 massacred all his family leaving her 

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:43.000
 only taken hostage she was brought 

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:45.790
 in forest attached to a tree or all 

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.460
 sarah days were raped 

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:50.400
 collective until she loses 

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.830
 knowledge 

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:56.710
 the rape bidc used as a weapon of 

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:59.800
 war and destroy of course sarah 

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:02.320
 but also his family his community 

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:06.449
 in short simply destroy the tissues 

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:09.930
 on arrival at the hospital 

00:17:06.449 --> 00:17:13.740
 sarah could not walk us 

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:18.610
 hold up and could not hold back 

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:20.010
 nor her nice urine and that because of 

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:23.410
 the severity of his injuries 

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:26.260
 urinary genitals and digestive coupled with 

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:28.810
 an infection on added nobody 

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:32.640
 could imagine she would be a day 

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:36.850
 as he gets back on his feet 

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.430
 yet every day that passes and the 

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.440
 desires to continue to live shine in 

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.930
 their eyes 

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:46.560
 every day that passes and it was she 

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:49.600
 who encouraged the caregivers 

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:52.480
 year not lose hope 

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:55.299
 every day that passes and sarah it's 

00:17:52.480 --> 00:18:00.520
 was beating for his survival 

00:17:55.299 --> 00:18:06.590
 today it's a beautiful woman 

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:09.049
 smiling strong charming sarah stood 

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:11.919
 committed to helping people and a lived 

00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:16.250
 a story similar to his 

00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:18.740
 it received 50 US dollars a 

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:21.950
 allowance that our house transits 

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:24.590
 and dorcas grants women wishing 

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.809
 to build their lives on the socio 

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.730
 economic 

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:29.470
 today sarah runs her little 

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.570
 business 

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.580
 she bought a small lot the 

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:37.220
 mozilla foundation help with tons 

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.470
 to make a roof she could get 

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:42.370
 to build a home 

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:46.429
 she is autonomous and very proud 

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:49.520
 to be autonomous his story shows that 

00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:52.340
 even if a situation is difficult and 

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.110
 seemed desperate the determination 

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.659
 with determination 

00:18:54.110 --> 00:19:00.850
 there is always hope at the end of 

00:18:56.659 --> 00:19:04.520
 tunnel if a woman like sarah 

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:08.539
 do not give up that they are us for 

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:12.740
 do them this and of course the story 

00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:15.890
 said that it's nothing Congolese but there are 

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:21.020
 sahara in Central African Republic in 

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:24.080
 colombia in bosnia oniam a and iraq and 

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:29.120
 in many other countries in conflict in 

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:31.309
 the panzi world our program of his 

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:35.630
 holistic that includes support 

00:19:31.309 --> 00:19:38.390
 medical psychological social economic 

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:40.610
 and legal watch worried even though the 

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.179
 road to healing is long and 

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.149
 difficult 

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:47.140
 the victims have the potential to 

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:50.270
 transform their suffering into power 

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:53.529
 they can become actresses of 

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:56.929
 positive change in society 

00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:59.990
 this is the case already the city of joy 

00:19:56.929 --> 00:20:02.870
 our rehabilitation center at 

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:06.640
 bukavu where women are helped for 

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:09.980
 spread their destiny to hand however 

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:13.520
 they can not do it alone and 

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:17.780
 our role is to listen to them as 

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:22.240
 today we are listening to madam nadia 

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:23.809
 death at an Indian your courage 

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:28.670
 your daring 

00:20:23.809 --> 00:20:30.980
 your ability to restore hope 

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:36.320
 a source of inspiration for the world 

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:38.090
 whole but for me especially the 

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.270
 Nobel Peace Prize which is ours 

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:43.809
 awarded today will have no value 

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:46.580
 actual crate it can change 

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:47.420
 concretely the lives of the victims of 

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.900
 sexual violence 

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:54.610
 departure the world and helped bring back 

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.610
 peace in our countries 

00:20:55.270 --> 00:21:01.710
 so what can we do 

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:07.260
 or 

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:10.740
 what can you do first this is 

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:15.270
 our responsibility to all to act in 

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:19.470
 that sense and act it's a choice it's a 

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:22.399
 choice to stop or not violence 

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:26.399
 Regarding key women whether or not there 

00:21:22.399 --> 00:21:29.549
 a positive masculinity that promotes 

00:21:26.399 --> 00:21:33.200
 gender equality in times of peace 

00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:33.200
 as in wartime 

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:59.010
 to act is a choice to support or not 

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:01.799
 a woman to protect her or not from 

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:05.159
 defend his rights to fight or not 

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:05.840
 at his side in the country ravaged by 

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:09.059
 Conflicts 

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:13.039
 finally it's a choice to build 

00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:16.529
 or not peace in the countries in conflict 

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:19.740
 to act is simply refused 

00:22:16.529 --> 00:22:21.990
 indifference if it is necessary to make war 

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:26.450
 it's the war against indifference 

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:29.909
 that is eating away at our societies today 

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:33.000
 secondly we are all would be 

00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:36.360
 vab lé vis-à-vis these women and 

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.149
 their loved ones and we all have to 

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:42.149
 appropriate these fights including the 

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:46.610
 states that have to stop hosting 

00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:49.230
 the leaders who tolerated or worse 

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:51.710
 use sexual violence to 

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:55.279
 access to power 

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.279
 states must 

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:12.370
 states must stop them 

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:14.290
 welcome with the red carpets is 

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:17.770
 rather the states must trace a 

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:20.850
 red line against the use of rape 

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.850
 as a weapon of war 

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:30.010
 a red line that would be synonymous with 

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:33.390
 political economic sanctions and 

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.390
 prosecution 

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.740
 to do an act is just not 

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:43.690
 difficult 

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:47.910
 to do a right act is not difficult 

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:51.040
 it's a question of political will 

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:55.690
 thirdly we must recognize 

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:57.180
 the sufferings of the survivors of 

00:23:55.690 --> 00:24:00.520
 all violence against women 

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:03.730
 in armed conflicts and support them 

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.800
 holistically in their process 

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:08.640
 of healing 

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:11.520
 here I insisted on repairs 

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.980
 it's these measures that gives them 

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:18.030
 compensation and satisfaction l air 

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:22.090
 allow to start a new life 

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:24.580
 it's a human right 

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:28.270
 I call the states to support 

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:30.670
 the initiative to create a fund 

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:33.370
 global reparations for 

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:36.510
 victims of sexual violence in the 

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.510
 armed conflicts 

00:24:50.909 --> 00:25:00.070
 fourthly on behalf of all 

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:03.070
 widows of all the heads of the orphans 

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:06.039
 massacres committed in the republic 

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:09.190
 democracy of the Congo and all 

00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:12.690
 Congolese peace loving I call the 

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:15.720
 international community finally has 

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:20.140
 considered the project mapping reports 

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:26.950
 and his recommendations that the law be 

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:30.159
 said this is where it would allow the 

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:33.549
 Congolese people in crying his 

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:36.760
 dead mourn his forgive his 

00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:40.740
 executioners exceed his suffering and 

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:44.679
 plan serenely in the future 

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.980
 finally after 20 years of bestowal 

00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:49.659
 blood 

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:52.409
 rape and massive displacement of
