00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.830
Let's look at the answer
to our locality quiz.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.270
We were asked, which of these
are not good examples of locality?

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.330
The statement that it
rained three times today so

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.605
it will likely rain today again
is a decent example of locality.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:15.205
Usually if it rains often,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:18.965
it's probably going to just
continue raining often for a while.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.625
We ate dinner at 6 every day last week,
so

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:26.837
probably we will eat dinner
around 6 this week too.

00:00:26.837 --> 00:00:28.667
This also tends to be true.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.947
People tend to eat meals around
the same time for a while.

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:36.317
And finally,
it was New Year's Eye yesterday,

00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:39.837
so it will be probably be
New Year's Eve today too.

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:43.497
This one is not a good
example of locality.

00:00:45.037 --> 00:00:45.762
Why?
Well,

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:47.977
because some things
do not have locality.

00:00:47.977 --> 00:00:51.680
For example,
it being New Year's Eve one day

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.560
usually means that the next day
it won't be New Year's Eve,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.870
because New Year's Eve is one of those
things that do not have much locality.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.721
If it was yesterday,
then we know it's not going to be today,

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:09.815
which is kind of opposite of what
the locality principle is about.

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:14.522
As we can see, some things do
have the locality property and

00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:16.135
some things do not.
