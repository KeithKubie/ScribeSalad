00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:01.890
- [Instructor] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.230
is review a little bit
of what we've learned

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.580
about monopolies and, in the process,

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.840
get a better understanding for

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.510
some of the graphical representations,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.970
which we have talked about in the past,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.370
but I wanna put it all
together in this video here.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.530
So let's say that the
industry that we are in,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.760
the demand curve looks
something like that.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.520
That is demand and I'm going to assume

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.880
that it is a linear demand curve.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.070
This axis right here is dollars per unit.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.750
In the context of demand, that's price,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.890
and this is quantity over here.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.110
This little graph here,
we still have quantity

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.380
in the horizontal axis,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.770
but the vertical axis isn't
just dollars per unit,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.340
it's absolute level of dollars.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.910
Over here we can actually plot

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.753
total revenue as a function
of quantity, total revenue.

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:54.530
Remember, we're assuming
we're the only producer here.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.290
We have a monopoly,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.990
we have a monopoly in this market.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.377
So if we pick a quantity,

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:02.580
if we don't produce anything,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.320
we're not going to generate any revenue,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.120
so our total revenue will be zero.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.300
If we produce a bunch, but we
don't charge anything for it,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.050
and that's this point right over here,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.930
our total revenue will also be zero.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.260
We've done this in other videos,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.480
but then as we increase
quantity from this point,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.810
our total revenue will keep
going up and up and up.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.170
There'll be some maximum point

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.020
and then it'll start going down again,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.840
so our total revenue would
look something like this.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.610
Total revenue would look something
like that, total revenue.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.220
And from the total
revenue, we can think about

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.700
what the marginal revenue would look like.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.030
Remember, the marginal revenue just says

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.670
if I increase my quantity by a little bit,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.500
how much am I increasing my total revenue?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.330
So that's essentially the slope,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.590
the slope of the total revenue
curve at any given point,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.450
or you can think of it as the
slope of the tangent line.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.050
We've seen before, when you start here,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.000
you have a very high, positive slope

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.270
and we've seen in other videos

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.950
it actually ends up being
the exact same value

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.090
as where the demand curve
intersects the vertical axis

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.000
right over there,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.200
but then it keeps going lower,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.320
the slope becomes a little less
deep, less deep, less deep.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.710
It's still positive, less deep, less deep,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.560
and then it becomes zero right over there

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.490
and then it starts going negative.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.113
It becomes zero right at that quantity.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.730
The slope of this keeps
going down and down and down,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.190
it's positive, then it becomes zero,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.770
and then it actually becomes
negative and you see that here.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.130
Now it starts downward
sloping even more steep,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.983
even more steep, and even more steep.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.830
That's the revenue side of things.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.000
Let me label this, this is
our marginal revenue curve,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.250
slope of the total revenue.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.460
If we're gonna maximize profit,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.570
we need to think about
what our costs look like,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.360
so let me draw our total cost curve.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.180
And I will do it in magenta.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.380
Let's say our total costs
look something like this.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.890
Total cost looks something like that.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.610
Out here, where we have very few units,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.590
where we have zero units, all
of our costs are fixed costs.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.430
And then as we produce
more and more units,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.410
the variable costs start
piling on over there.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.360
Even from this diagram, you can actually

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.830
start to visually see economic profit.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.710
Economic profit, and when
we're talking costs and profit

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.120
in an economics class, like
this is kind of one, I guess,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.630
remember, you should view it
in terms of economic profit

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.290
and when we're talking about total cost,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.180
we're talking about opportunity cost.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.260
So this is total opportunity cost,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.523
both the implicit,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.255
both the explicit,

00:03:37.255 --> 00:03:39.160
the ones that you're actually
paying money for explicitly

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.920
and the implicit opportunity costs.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.810
Total opportunity costs,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.340
that's total opportunity cost

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.310
and the difference between
your total revenue,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.990
so for a given quantity,
the difference between

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.751
your total revenue and your
total opportunity cost,

00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:56.060
that gives you your economic profit.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.500
For this quantity right over here,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500
your economic profit would be represented

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.500
by the height of this little
bar between these two curves.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.560
But what we see what's going on is,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.040
as we increase the quantity over here,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.370
these curves are getting
further and further apart.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.945
That's because the green
curve, the total revenue,

00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:17.230
it's slope is larger
than this purple curve,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.820
which is total opportunity cost,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.560
or you could say it total cost.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.550
So we could go even further along,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.120
just the distance between the two curves

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.940
gets bigger, bigger,
looks like it maxes out

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.830
right around here someplace

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.550
and then the two things start getting

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.840
closer and closer together.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.080
This purple curve's slope is now larger

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.490
than the orange curve's slope,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.380
so then they start getting
closer and closer together.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.170
If you were to just look at this graph,

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.620
whatever the maximum distance

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.810
between these two things are,

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.810
it looks like it's about
there, right over here,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.450
that would be your
maximum economic profit.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.210
But we know we can also visualize it

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.610
on this curve over here.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.650
And we can do that by
plotting our marginal cost.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.410
And remember, marginal costs,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.090
this is marginal revenue,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.030
is the slope of your total revenue curve.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.380
Marginal cost is the slope,

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.280
the instantaneous slope at any point

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.360
of your total cost curve.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.820
So I will do that,
let's do that in yellow.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.180
Right over here, you have a zero slope,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.320
or pretty close to zero,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.870
at least the way I drew it over there.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.140
So your marginal cost is going to be

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.160
pretty close to zero right over there.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.597
And then we see this slope
keeps increasing and increasing

00:05:27.597 --> 00:05:30.290
and increasing and so our
marginal cost will keep

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.210
increasing, increasing, and increasing,

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.590
so it will look something like that.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.682
That is our marginal cost curve.

00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:40.820
If we pick a quantity and if we find

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.240
that the marginal cost over here,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.940
I don't know, let's say that
it's five dollars per unit,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.893
that literally means that the slope,

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:51.150
that that same quantity, the
slope of our total cost curve,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.910
that the slope over there
would have to be five.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.440
That's what that is telling us.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.850
This is plotting the slope of
this curve right over here.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.800
And if we want to maximize profit,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.120
we already talked about how
you would do it visually

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.650
on this curve, we can do it over here.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.250
Well, right over here, as we produce,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.340
if we start from producing
nothing to producing something,

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.714
for each incremental unit,

00:06:11.714 --> 00:06:14.350
the incremental revenue we get on that

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.300
is much higher than the incremental cost.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.520
So, hey, we should produce it

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.030
because we're gonna get profit there.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.010
We could keep producing
because we're gonna get profit

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.870
on each of these incremental units,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.760
so we'll keep doing it,
we'll keep doing it,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.520
we'll keep doing it,
until the marginal revenue

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.260
is equal to the marginal cost.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.930
At that point, it doesn't make sense

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.100
for us to produce anymore.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.770
If we produce an extra
unit past that point,

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.670
on that unit our cost will
be higher than our revenue,

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.360
so what will eat into our economic profit.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.370
So this right over here is
where we max the quantity,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.803
which we maximize profit.

00:06:44.803 --> 00:06:47.640
When we see it, we see
it right over there.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.750
The way I drew it, luckily, it looks like

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.950
that is the maximum point
between those two curves as well,

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.350
and it makes sense.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.590
Before this point, when marginal revenue

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.680
is higher than marginal cost,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.950
that means that the slope
of the total revenue curve

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.140
is larger than the slope
of the total cost curve,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.550
so they're getting
further and further apart.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.360
After this point, and right at that point

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.510
their slopes are the same,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.160
so the slopes are going to
be the same right over there,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.940
and then after that point,

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.917
the slope of the marginal cost curve,

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:20.080
sorry, the marginal cost is high,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.110
which tells us the slope of
the total cost curve is higher,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.120
than the slope of the total revenue curve.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.990
And so they're gonna get
closer and closer together

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.047
and this distance gets squinched apart.

00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:33.800
That is where you maximize profit.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.850
And if you wanted to
visualize the actual profit,

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.020
on this graph over here,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.740
we cannot obviously visualize it here

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.000
as the distance between these two curves.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.920
If you want to visualize it over here,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.270
we would have to plot our
average total cost curve.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.440
And essentially, what you're doing is

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.080
you're just taking this total cost curve

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.860
and you're not just taking
the slope at any point,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.370
that's the marginal cost,

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.320
instead you're just dividing
it by the quantities.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.880
So if you take this total cost curve,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.100
you take this value and you divide it by

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.050
very, very, very low quantity,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.470
you're going to get a very,
very, very, very large number.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.490
You can imagine, as you're
spreading your fixed costs

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.870
amongst a very small quantity,

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.420
so you're gonna get a very large number.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.220
Then, as you produce
more and more and more,

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.550
your average total costs go down,

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.130
but then your variable
costs start picking up

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.210
and your average total costs
might look something like that.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.630
Average total costs.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.863
And so, if you wanna know your profit

00:08:25.863 --> 00:08:28.520
that you have maximized from
this graph right over here,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.410
you say this is the quantity
that maximizes my profit,

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.800
marginal revenue is
equal to marginal costs,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.258
the price that I can get in
the market for that quantity,

00:08:36.258 --> 00:08:39.720
you go up to your demand
curve and it gives you,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.710
this is the price that you
will get for that quantity

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.850
and so that is, on a per unit basis,

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.060
that is the revenue that you will get.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.640
You can view price is equal to,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.390
price is the same thing as revenue,

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.383
revenue per unit.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.030
So on a per unit basis, this
is the revenue you're getting,

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.640
and on a per unit basis,
this is your average cost,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.880
this is average total costs.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.100
This is taking all your costs
and dividing it by units.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.230
On an average, per unit basis,

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.450
this is going to be your economic profit.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.710
On a per unit basis, and
if you wanted to find your

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.280
actual economic profit,

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.560
you would have to multiply it
by the total number of units.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.290
So you would, essentially, have the area

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.140
of this rectangle right over here.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.000
This is your per unit
average economic profit

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.810
and so your total economic profit

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.900
is going to be quantity
times profit per unit

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.697
and so this right over
here is economic profit,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.990
or maybe I should call it
the total economic profit.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.823
Let me write it out,

00:09:41.823 --> 00:09:42.656
total

00:09:43.722 --> 00:09:46.010
economic

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:46.950
profit.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.080
And the area of that rectangle

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.420
should be the same thing as the height

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.970
of this right over here.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.480
The only reason, and we can maintain

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.840
this is a sustainable scenario

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.220
because we have a monopoly.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.320
No one else can enter.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.570
If this was not a monopoly,

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.730
if there were no barriers to entry,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.240
then other people say hey,
there's economic profit there,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.865
that means that there's an incentive

00:10:07.865 --> 00:10:10.570
for me to put those
same resources together

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.476
and try to compete
because I'm going to get

00:10:12.476 --> 00:10:16.170
better returns than my opportunity costs

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.623
than my alternatives is a
good way to think about it.
