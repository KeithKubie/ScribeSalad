00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.169
Opposers, it's summer
blockbuster season.

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.704
That doesn't just mean
I'm heading

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.839
to my former employer
to demand my job back.

00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:08.741
No, it also means

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:12.078
there are lots of big, expensive
movies hitting the theaters.

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:15.348
So, here to take down liberal
Hollywood one last time,

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.817
citizen journalists
Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp!

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.119
-(cheers and applause)
-No. No!

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:21.888
(bleep) that, Jordan!

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.223
Yeah. We're not going to waste
our last four minutes

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:26.893
on television talking
about (bleep)<i> Jurassic World!</i>

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:30.396
I'm not about to watch hours of
a predatory dinosaur onscreen.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.331
Bill O'Reilly's been canceled!

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:33.933
-(laughing): I love that.
-Yeah.

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.335
Okay, so, tonight, we're not
just going at the movies.

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:38.738
We're widening our scopes
for our new segment:

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.307
BOTH:
"Going<i> at</i> the Everything!"

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.444
-(fanfare, squeal, thumping)
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.879
The gloves are off,
and our hands are filthy,

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:48.881
so we're ready
to take down everything.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.550
-Are you scared, Jordan?
-No.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.585
I mean, just what do you mean
"at the everything"?

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:53.953
-Chuck, stay with us.
-(Klepper mutters) Okay, okay.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.489
-Come on, Chuck! Come on!
-Stay with us!

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:59.692
-Okay, let's start
with The Carters. -Mm-hmm.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:02.328
We're ready to rip this album
apart from Bey to Z.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.197
Now, for those of you
keeping score,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.066
this is the third hit record
about Jay-Z's infidelity.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:11.003
They are America's favorite
cheating couple, and, honestly,

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:12.872
they should just
keep on milking it.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.740
BeyoncÃ©, if you (bleep) Drake,

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:16.776
you'd probably get your own
cinematic universe.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:20.012
Yeah. And I know you can
stream it everywhere now,

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:22.181
but the fact
that this was a TIDAL exclusive

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:25.251
for even an afternoon
is (bleep) stupid.

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:30.189
Music is a fundamental right,
not like health care.

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:32.959
Libs, if you want free Medicare,

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.261
-come up with a Napster
for hospitals. -Yes!

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.130
Not that we know
what Napster is.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.865
-We're very young.
-Extremely young.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.868
Moving on.
Gay Pride is this month!

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.603
Wow. So, enjoy your celebration

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.139
of love and self-acceptance
and harmony.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.307
-I'm talking to you,
corporations! -Yeah.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.276
(laughter)

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:53.646
You leftists think Pride is
a big liberal wankfest,

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.881
but it's not.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.949
It's just a capitalist bukkake!

00:01:56.982 --> 00:02:00.753
Yeah, as if Colgate gives a shit
about you.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:04.056
-No, they want your cash,
you childless queens! -Yes.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:06.192
(laughter)

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:10.429
Brands have always been there,
and they always will be there.

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:13.900
-Equifax threw the first brick
at Stonewall! -Yeah.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:17.069
Conservative companies
should join in on the fun.

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:18.938
-Yeah.
-You don't have to like gays.

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.840
You just have to love money.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:23.209
Yeah, Chick-fil-A,
get in on this!

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.545
We even made you a new logo!

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.647
(laughter)

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.682
(applause and cheering)

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.818
It's very good.

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:36.856
Yes. In June,
all corporations are gay...

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.125
-for pay.
-Yes.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.127
Next up-- fad diets.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.662
Gluten-free, Whole30.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.730
Jesus, what's harder--
only eating veggies,

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.799
or constantly (bleep)
telling me about it?

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.501
Just eat bread and die!

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:49.969
(laughter)

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:53.005
Jared and Ivanka, you off-brand
Barbie and Ken dolls,

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:55.775
you've been coyly evil
for too long.

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:58.611
It's time be<i> evil</i> evil!

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.846
Set a nursing home on fire!

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.882
Sell an orphan on eBay!

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:07.053
Drench this country in blood,
you (bleep) vampires! Commit!

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.021
-(applause and cheering)
-Yes. More hot takes!

00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:10.389
-More. We need more.
-More hot takes.

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:12.391
-Time for a speed round!
-Speed round. Okay.

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:14.860
Antarctica,
stop melting, you stupid bitch!

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:18.998
Yeah. Horses, you're not cars,
and you never will be!

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.367
Stay still and look pretty!

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.070
-Oil, be more!
-Mm.

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.905
Ooh, gender-reveal parties.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:28.007
Ugh. I don't want
to bite into a cupcake

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.109
to find out
if your baby has a dick!

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:31.877
-Yes.
-Straight people are perverts!

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.446
Yes. Yes.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.681
Facebook, you're evil.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:38.884
You feed people fake news,
enable sham elections

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:40.953
and make everyone
more lonely and sad.

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:43.089
-Keep up the good work!
-Mm-hmm.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.391
Next up, we got...

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:46.959
Chuck? Chuck, what's happening?

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:48.794
Wait. We need more things
to go at, Chuck!

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:50.029
Yeah, yeah, we're not done!

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:51.697
CHUCK: That's it, guys.
That's all you gave me.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.032
-What? No, no, no, no.
-(Sharp muttering)

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:54.200
-There has to be something else.
-Yes.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.401
-We can't...
-Something else to go out.

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:56.602
Something in...
something in this room.

00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:58.471
-Okay, okay, wait, wait.
-Scanning. Scanning.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:03:59.872
-(muttering)
-Scanning.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.807
-JACKSON: Scanning.
-(laughter)

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.777
Jordan-- he's got big, stupid
hair, but everybody knows that.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.812
Oh, that cameraman.
And he's probably has a family.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.914
No, that's too easy.
What else? What else? What else?

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:10.683
(Jackson gasps loudly
and sharply)

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:13.085
BOTH:
You.

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:15.721
You're an attention-seeking
media whore!

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.623
You don't believe anything
you say.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.625
You only say it so that people
will listen to you,

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:21.894
thus feeding into
the modern media culture

00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:24.263
that assigns no value
to anything thoughtful

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:26.565
or substantive or truthful,

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:29.969
and instead rewards ignorant
blowhards for their shock value

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:32.872
because entertainment is all
that matters anymore.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:36.575
You're a piggy,
a greedy, selfish (bleep) pig

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:38.978
who will fatten yourself
on the death of discourse

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:43.650
until you explode, a steaming
pile of putrid hateful slime!

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:47.687
(cheers and applause)

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.689
KLEPPER:
Uh...

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:52.291
are you guys...
are you o... are you okay?

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:54.894
-Stay on...
-Chuck! Stay on us, Chuck!

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:58.597
-Stay on us... forever. Yeah.
-Stay on us forever, Chuck!

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.801
-Well, y'all, it's been cute.
-Yeah.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.803
But that's all the time we have.

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:07.073
So, until some other
Viacom property scoops us up,

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:08.407
remember this:

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.943
money is God; content is king,

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:13.012
and if you think
the world is on fire,

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:14.480
grab a can of gasoline,

00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:16.215
and we'll see you
in the comments section.

00:05:16.248 --> 00:05:17.817
Good-bye forever, you sluts!

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.852
The fight continues...!
