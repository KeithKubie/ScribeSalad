00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.469
Well, there’s a couple reasons why college
has gotten so expensive.

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:14.590
First of all is: states are cutting higher
education funding.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.029
Second thing is: supply and demand.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.920
What we have is a crisis where to get onto
the job ladder, the few decent jobs left—that

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.350
have healthcare, that have security, that
have a pension—they all require a college

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.350
degree.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.429
So you have to go to college, basically.

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.260
And yet the actual number of spaces in colleges
hasn’t really increased.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.010
Harvard admits something like ten percent
more now than they did in the ‘70s, so there

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.010
are more people competing for fewer spots.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.050
And that means that the colleges can just
raise the price, and they’ll find somebody

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.050
to pay it.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.790
No matter how high it gets, somebody is out
there paying it, and so they just raise it

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.370
and raise it and raise it, and we keep paying
it.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.809
Colleges are adding services like rock climbing
gyms, extra administration, they’re doing

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.070
more marketing, they’re doing these really
expensive study abroad programs and, again,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.660
they’re competing over the rich kids, they’re
competing over the ten percent and the one

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.380
percent, people who are not “cost sensitive.”

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.200
Colleges keep throwing services and throwing
bells and whistles at them, and they’re

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.960
just paying it, because the entire economy
is shifting toward marketing itself to the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.910
top ten percent and the top one percent, and
those are the kids that are going to college

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.910
now.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.480
The college premium (how much extra you earn
for going to college) is 70 percent.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.760
You earn almost double if you go to college
on average than if you don’t go to college.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.990
So we’re in this bind where you HAVE to
go to college or else you end up in a really

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.210
bad job for the rest of your life, but them
to go to college you have to go into $80,000,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.270
$100,000, more than that debt.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.840
I interviewed somebody for the article that
is paying off $311,000 in debt.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.050
I interviewed another person who was actually
a bankruptcy lawyer who was paying $2000 a

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.630
month in student loans after he got out of
college.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.350
And so when you look at how many of us have
student loans—and that we’re paying them

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.460
off at the time when we’re early in our
careers, we’re not as established in our

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.729
fields, we can’t afford decent housing,
we aren’t earning very much at that time,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.569
and then we’re also, on top of that, paying
a couple hundred dollars a month extra—that’s

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.630
money we’re not saving, that’s money we’re
not putting to a pension, that’s money we’re

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.750
not putting to a home—and that extends the
period of—what our parents call “adolescence,”

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.950
but really, insecurity—that extends our
period of insecurity into our 30s and our

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.950
40s.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.940
And so if you look at any poll of millennials,
more than half say they have put off marriage,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.810
they have put off children, they have put
off buying a home because of their student

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.010
loans.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.700
And student loans are the only form of debt
that you cannot get rid of in bankruptcy,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.140
so they are literally inescapable.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.569
Even if you die, in some states your partner
might actually have to pay them off for you.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.830
So this is a ball and chain around the ankle
of millions of millennials, and again, it’s

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.500
not a choice that we made, it’s the economy
that we’re in, that to get onto the job

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.239
ladder you need to have an education.

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.270
One of the things that we forget, and especially
our parents forget, is how much cheaper college

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.270
used to be.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.220
When my dad was in college he worked for ten
hours a week in the cafeteria, and that was

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.739
enough for his tuition and a little bit of
his rent.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.450
That doesn’t sound familiar to anybody I
know.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.310
And what has happened since then is: the cost
of education has gone up between 400 and 1200

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.240
percent depending on the kind of school you
go to.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.390
Meanwhile, minimum wages haven’t really
budged, general wages haven’t really budged,

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.430
and the price of everything else has gotten
higher too.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.860
So in the early ‘70s it took around 300
hours of minimum wage work to afford a four-year

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.160
education.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.760
By the 2000s it took 4,400 hours of minimum
wage work to afford a four-year education.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.950
There are a lot of really smart people who
look at a debt of $100,000 when they get out

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.780
and minimum payments of hundreds of dollars
every month and go, “It’s not worth it.”

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.760
And the problem is the economy really isn’t
working for them.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.660
If you look at any measure of poverty, unemployment,
there’s never been a time in America where

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.300
it’s worse to not be a college graduate.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.090
If you want a pension, if you want healthcare,
if you want decent wages, if you want security,

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.210
all of those jobs now require college degrees.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.589
And even if they don’t require college degrees,
there’s now so many people with college

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:27.710
degrees they’re getting those jobs.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.710
Right?

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.990
The hiring manager at a coffee shop looks
at two resumes and one has a college degree

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.850
and one doesn’t, even if the job doesn’t
necessarily require a college degree he’s

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.550
going to hire the college grad because he
thinks they’re smarter, harder working,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.550
or whatever.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.419
And so you’ve got kids that are now systematically
disadvantaged because they didn’t go to

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.939
college, but it’s understandable that they
wouldn’t want to given the cost.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:55.150
And so we need to think about all of the opportunities
that we’re missing by having an entire generation

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.189
of people who look at the cost of college
and decide not to go, and what those people

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.690
could be doing if they went.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.469
I don’t know if other people have noticed
this, but at my high school the rich kids

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.620
went to college and the smart kids went to
college.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.599
And it feels like there’s this huge tranche
of kids that were sort of normal kids—they

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:24.449
weren’t exceptional—and those mediocre
kids, if they were rich they went to college,

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.889
and if they were exceptional and they weren’t
rich they went to college.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.369
But that leaves out this huge structure of
all these millions of people who were just

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:35.810
kind of average but just didn’t go because
they ended up doing something else.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.889
I think we as Americans forget that we’re
the only country where college costs this

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.610
much, and we’re the only developed country
without a functioning safety net.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.580
It’s a lot better in other countries.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.419
I actually went to graduate school TWICE in
Europe, because I couldn’t afford to go

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.419
in America.

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.550
And in lots of European countries it is free.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.310
(Tell everyone you know.)

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.099
And a lot of other countries it’s really
cheap.

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.639
And many of the degrees are in English, and
those countries are run by adults.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.319
They’re great.

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:08.999
Go there.

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:11.430
I also went to community college for two years.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.719
Community college has a bad reputation for
no particular reason.

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.159
Community colleges are great.

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:20.149
So people should consider going to community
college and then transferring to a two-year

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:21.149
university.

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:22.539
There’s nothing wrong with that.

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.240
We’re all doing our best.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.110
Find a cheap way that works for you, and if
you can get a visa to leave America and stay

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.629
left, then do that too.
