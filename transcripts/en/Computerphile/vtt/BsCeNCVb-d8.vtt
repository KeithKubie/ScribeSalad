00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.060
I would say it's easily in a million
lines.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.399
A million lines of code

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.120
Absolutely.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.840
The algorithm is meant to
indicate all of the different methods

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.860
We use who decide which search results we'll
going to show you

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.100
and in what order for which
recommendations we'll going to choose for you

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.910
I think people when they refer to the
algorithm they mean all the code

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.529
that we've written to do those things

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.040
I don't think of it as one thing, I think
of it as lots of little pieces that are

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.570
trying to accomplish the overall goal of
connecting you with what you're looking for

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.600
or what we think you might want
to watch

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
it's not like a piece of code hidden in
a safe or something

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.410
(Laughter)

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.440
there's no piece of code hidden in a
safe

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.160
there's a lot of code and it scattered
all over the place in our code base

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.450
if you look closely at it it will
resemble much more accounting than any

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.930
sort of dark sophisticated thing.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.770
there is whether it's the algorithm or

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.610
whatever is there is a degree of secrecy
is in there for good or bad reasons

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.570
I mean you you can't be completely open
about all of this, can you? or you're not

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.150
open about all of it seems

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.830
is that a fair comment?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.480
I mean I think
we're quite open about what we're trying to achieve

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.540
and I think we're open about
the instances where we know it's not

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.650
working and we think it could be better

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.150
I tend to be a little bit more reticent
to discuss exactly how we're doing it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.360
and there's a few reasons first of all
we don't want people to try to game

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.370
what we're doing and sadly we do see
that on YouTube and so everything do we

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.120
have to think about the opportunities
for gaming it I mean we're using certain

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.660
kinds of information to help people find
the videos they're looking for

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.659
That depends on on that being that
information coming from sincere viewers

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.280
who were actually looking for things

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.310
now if instead it came from a robot

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.610
it wasn't really looking for anything it
was just trying to make sure that a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.510
particular video showed up at the top of
some search results are you know how to

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.380
tremendous number

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.610
views then then we can't use that
anymore and so it's not just that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.220
there's a few more instances of poor
search results or inflated view counts

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.190
but but it's worse than that because
actually that's what that means that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.660
that we can't use the thing that we were
using anymore and so now we have to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.590
you know, we have to take that away as a
possibility for helping associate

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.650
the viewers with the videos they want to
watch and then move on to the next thing

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.069
and then of course that thing may also
be abused and so, you know, we have to

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.129
try to protect these these signals as we
call them so that so that we don't lose them

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.510
and you know that and then we're left
with very little to actually go on

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.530
I don't want to lock us into a
particular way of doing things

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.269
you know say for instance that five
years ago

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.549
ranking the search results by the view
count may have been a great thing to do

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.160
and that was because at that time

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.580
view count was one of the best signals

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.280
that you could find for what are the
quality of the video

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.860
well since then we've found other things
that are even better

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.660
and we don't want people to become upset when
they say hey wait a minute these videos

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.150
are ranked in the order of the view
count

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.100
that's wrong what's not wrong because we
like I said we would have done an

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.920
experiment to find that there was
actually a better way to do it yes we

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.230
take the view count into account but
there's some other thing that we might

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.359
want to do for instance a very good
example is if it were just ranked by

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.700
view count you've never seen any new
videos

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.739
so you type plane crash after a plane
crashes and you'd see the oldest plane

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.370
crash footage we have if we want to have
some video of the new incident

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.880
we can't rank everything by view count
we don't want to commit ourselves

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.720
in a way two people thinking that this is the
way it has to be and that we can't make

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.680
any changes because where we have to we
have to make changes

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.489
you mentioned view

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.849
I mean view account is very transparent
signal because of the design of YouTube

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.329
can you mention some of the other
signals you're using

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.829
sure what one of those that we started using

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.930
a couple of years ago now I guess what
was watch time. So what we noticed was

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.920
that was that when people looked for
videos

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.580
it was often the case that they would
see one that looked like the video they

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.540
wanted to watch but then once they got
on that watch page it wasn't actually

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.370
the video they wanted to watch

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.570
maybe it had a thumbnail that was you
know very misleading or title that was

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.980
particularly misleading

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.540
now fortunately in most of those cases
eventually they got to the one they were

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.200
looking for and often that was because
that would be somewhere on the related

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.070
videos but in looking that situation we
thought when 'Gee that's kind of crummy'

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.760
because why should I have to click two
or three times in order to finally get

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.440
to a video that I was looking for

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.390
we tried to figure out how to fix that
went well people tend to know fairly

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.950
quickly whether or not the video they've
landed on is the one they're looking for

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.460
the best example I remember of this was
we saw one where there were several

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.620
videos that had titles about a
particular boxing match and one of them

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.070
especially had a thumbnail of a guy like
he was just about to be hit and miss you

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.510
know its fist was right up in the other
guy's face and everybody was going to

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.440
click on that one

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.600
what turned out that the video behind
that was a person talking about that

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.680
fight and it had no footage of the fight
and eventually the viewers would finally

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.650
get to the one that had some footage of
the fight when we looked into that

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.150
situation we realize that one way to
detect the difference between these was

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.860
one of these videos wasn't getting watch
very much and the other one was once

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.910
very loan or watch for very long exactly
one of them wasn't getting watch very

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.580
long and the other one was and so
instead of just ranking the videos by

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.260
how often they were clicked in response
to a query we rank them for how much

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.330
they they were watched in response to a
query and so that helped that situation

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.080
quite a bit

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.600
how often are you twiddling the dials
and refining this and tweaking - is

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.290
like a daily thing with little things
that can change or is it like a

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.900
once-a-year big implementation

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.080
we've we've always got at least I don't
know ten different changes that were

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:41.000
working on and they may take somewhere
between a few weeks to several months to

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:50.540
finally launch and there's usually some
some analysis and intuition and then

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.120
there's some implementations some
changes that you're going to make to the

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.980
code and then there's lots of
experimentation and evaluation in order

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.920
to confirm that this change actually
benefits the viewers and so how many

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.050
times do we do in a year maybe 50 times
a year or a hundred times a year

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.440
other things that believes that can be
pulled like okay today we're going to

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.310
put twenty one percent emphasis on watch
time and no no it needs to be nineteen

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.500
percent is it is it like that or not

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:25.490
um it's not really like that because all
of those settings or levers or or all

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.070
the code that we've written to make
those kinds of decisions has been has

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:38.570
been tuned based on evaluation and
analysis of some kinds of experiments or

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:46.220
other ways we have of rating changes and
so it would make sense for us to walk in

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.430
and saying like you know I'm feeling
like we ought to put a higher weight on

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.420
something even if i were to feel that we
ought to put a higher weight and one

00:07:53.420 --> 00:08:00.020
watch time for instance what that would
amount to is some of the engineers doing

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.100
several weeks worth of experiments to
see whether or not putting a higher

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.560
weight on watch time resulted in more
people getting to the videos they

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.560
watched faster

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.460
 

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.620
we can see

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.280
the data that we've got about now the
data that we get back is completely

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.419
random it depends where when the server
crew received that message to put in same

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:25.470
computer's memory

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.949
so this time we're on it is actually
giving us some use for the information

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:33.870
because when we have demonstrated some
evidence you know in the broader subject

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.300
another way that we might find to
recommend things too
