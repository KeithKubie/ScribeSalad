00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.870

Um,

10
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:36.120
I'm excited to be home with my wife and kid.
And speaking of which I last week,

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.770
last Monday.
Can you guys remember back to November 12th?

12
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.480
Remember that Trump was still president?
He's still president anyways.
Uh,

13
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.170
was I gonna say,
um,
I,
I read a question,

14
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.750
best friend's wife from a lady and felt that neo needed to chime in.

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.910
So what did I do?

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.220
I got in touch with my wife's people to try and see if I could poke her on the

17
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:06.120
podcast and she was nice enough to take time out of her busy,

18
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:10.860
beautiful schedule as being the greatest mother ever.
Um,

19
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:12.510
welcome back to the program.

20
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.910
<v 1>Thank you Nia hill.
Thank you so much.
Thank you for having me.</v>

21
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.900
Oh well what was it like to work with Tom Cruise?
Oh my God,

22
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:21.940
he is so amazing.

23
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:26.700
He is just so generous and do his own sponsor,
did his own stuff.

24
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.370
So he really,
the bangs you in that scene,
right?
Oh my God.
It was great.

25
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:34.240
He didn't let us do it.
No,
no.
He'd stand in me commitment.

26
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.410
He stared me in the eyes the entire time.
I was like,
wow.
Really?

27
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.450
It's like we're in a real relationship.
I'm telling you right now,

28
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.140
after you got to be Invisalign to be fixed,
that snaggle tooth,

29
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:47.800
I just felt like it all just went to another level.
His commitment to the craft.

30
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.490
Yeah.
Excuse me ma'am.
We're trying to do a podcast over here.

31
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.230
I got the little one out here too.
When she has her favorites

32
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.820
<v 0>show on the one created by Harlan Williams.</v>

33
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.900
I can't say the name of it or she's going to freak out cause she's kind of

34
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:05.230
looking at like why is there no sound?
Okay.

35
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.400
<v 1>What is,
it's almost the 2020 is not the 1920s there.</v>

36
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.280
Once you have some old lady playing the piano when the corner.
Um,
all right,
Neil.

37
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.570
I know you have a lot of stuff to do.
Yes.

38
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.880
We're going to do a little Bang Bang here.
Going right into it.
All right,
great.

39
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.580
All right.
Best friend's wife from a

40
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.743
<v 0>wait.</v>

41
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.970
<v 1>Best friend's wife.
All right.
Hello Billy Baldwin.</v>

42
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.680
Ah,
Yay.
Like it.
Yeah,
but I went in that I like that.
I win.
Yeah.

43
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:38.040
That's not a bald and I,
when do I?
I don't think so.
All right.

44
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.090
Recently I must say,
hey honey,

45
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:45.450
speaking to the Mikey rather than chime in.
All right.
Yes.
Oh,

46
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.050
you're talking about,
yeah.
That's not going to be me.
All right.
Uh,

47
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.730
recently I've been posting pictures and videos on my Instagram that are not

48
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:56.160
slutty.dot dot.
Not slutty,

49
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.140
but I wouldn't show my parents either.
Ah,
ha.
Period.
Now wait,
now where would,

50
00:03:01.141 --> 00:03:03.580
where would you call if you had to rate that as a movie?
Where is she?

51
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.050
What do you mean?
Like some movie PG,
PG 13 are,

52
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.850
it's not NC 17,

53
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.810
but it's not painful if she's showing nip and booty.

54
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.690
So then you would say PG,
PG 13 now summaries,

55
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.170
right.
[inaudible]
um,

56
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.950
I am 26 years old.
Prime of your life.
Yup.

57
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.590
And I've been feeling very confident about myself.
Wow.

58
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.640
By [inaudible] bay.
Vida.

59
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.940

Lapper do pardon me guys.
Don't dance anymore.

60
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.080
Bring webpack burlesque.
The old stripper song.
Yeah.

61
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.340
Dita von Teese does it not in the club.
What do you mean in the club?

62
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.170
The in Duck Club da na [inaudible] in duck club.

63
00:03:56.171 --> 00:04:00.640
Now that was never our,
are you going down?
Um,

64
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.160
and I've been feeling very confident about myself and my body.

65
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.000
I'm single with no boyfriend or even dating.
[inaudible]

66
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.240
anyways,
my friend,
sorry,

67
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.360
since I was 16 has told me that his wife has been uncomfortable with us talking

68
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:20.350
because she seen my pictures.
So they'd been friends since camp.

69
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.360
So what happens at Camp?
Nia stays at camp.
That's right.
She,
she's told him,

70
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.460
uh,
she feels insecure and sees my pictures even before he does.

71
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.840
Uh,
he is the following here.
Yes.
She's watching you.

72
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.760
Private eyes.
Yeah.
He has expressed that.

73
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.730
He may not be my friend anymore because of this.

74
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.380
And this is not the first time I've been blocked by male friends because their

75
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:48.670
female counterparts,

76
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.880
our social media stalking me and claiming I'm trying to get their men,

77
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:56.590
first of all,
nobody is stocking you.
You're on social media.

78
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.520
If you are hanging these up in your house and you looked and she was staring

79
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:01.500
into your window,
no,

80
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.290
but you can let go and just be like really looking through someone's feed and

81
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:09.210
just be like every time they pose looking and not only looking at the picture of

82
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:12.850
see who's liking the picture and the tie,
like all that kind of stuff.

83
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.940
All of that is all out in the open.
I know,

84
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.600
but like you can pay like up just a little bit more attention to it than a

85
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:21.810
normal just scrolling through.
Oh,
like,
like,
like,

86
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.850
like a little kid playing hide and go seek.
The first time they hide,

87
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:29.590
they lie down on the floor,
face down and recover their eyes.
I'm hiding.

88
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.580
You're not hiding.
You're putting this out for the world to see.
And judge,

89
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.300
I've been told uh,

90
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.870
to maybe tone it to tone down my posts or not,
right.

91
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:45.760
How I feel because the girls take it personally and take it out on my friends.

92
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.961
Uh,

93
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:51.961
and these are these my real friends order their girls have legit reasons to be

94
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:58.010
upset.
Yours truly a huge fan and love to Nia and the baby.
Oh,

95
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.990
<v 3>um,
well first of all I had to say,</v>

96
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:07.460
I don't know why you're surprised at this reaction because you're out there

97
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.900
thirst trapping and these girls don't want their men to get caught in your trap.

98
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.100
So even though you may not be trying to get done for the white audience,

99
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.290
what thirst trapping she's out.

100
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.220
Their thirst trapping means like you post photos that are intentionally like

101
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:24.710
sexy or provocative cause you're trying to get legs.

102
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.440
You're trying to get into this,
that they're not just,

103
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.850
Oh this is just me eating corn flakes with most of my breasts.
No,

104
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:34.160
I don't think that you're necessarily acting like it's not,

105
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:37.850
but you know that there's just like certain photos that are going to get like

106
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:42.750
the IEA reaction as opposed to the like Aye Yai Yai.
It's this,

107
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.620
is there any,
uh,
DT going on here?

108
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.550
<v 4>Teas,
D,
teas,</v>

109
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.690
<v 3>Dixie,
you kids here.
Oh,
cause I imitate a vibrator.</v>

110
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.680
I don't know that it's a Dt,

111
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.700
but it's definitely like showing you what you yeah.

112
00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:05.610
What you could be throwing around the bedroom for sure.
So I don't,

113
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:07.650
I mean it's not surprising that their,

114
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.760
their girlfriends and wives or whatever are going to be like feeling some type

115
00:07:11.761 --> 00:07:15.900
of way if they're liking your pictures.
So,
um,
I don't know.

116
00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:19.380
I don't think that you're doing anything wrong,
but I didn't write this.

117
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.060
I don't think that,
um,
they're necessarily wrong either.

118
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:28.020
But here's the thing,
I feel like the,
we're going back to one of my earlier,

119
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.150
my earliest appearances on the podcast.

120
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.720
Only thing is she's been friends with this kid since she was 16,
so that's,

121
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.411
they're fine.

122
00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:39.411
But I also noticed in her letter that she said that like all of her male friends

123
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.120
are most of her male friends.

124
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.930
So is this another situation where you've got a girl who's got a lot of male

125
00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:50.400
friends,
nothing wrong,
involved male friends,
and it's,

126
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.760
Oh my God,
they're stalking me on Instagram and Oh my God,

127
00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:57.690
there's such haters and like,
are these men really?
My friends,
it's like,
listen,

128
00:07:57.691 --> 00:08:00.840
you just have to understand like you have to kind of be a grownup about this.

129
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.740
Like it's one thing for you,
like I said,
to post thirst trapping pictures.

130
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.520
All your girlfriends are going to be like,
yes.
Oh my God,
you're giving me life.

131
00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:11.910
You're so hot.
Look at you,
Bam.
All that kind of stuff.

132
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.440
That's what your girlfriends and like your gay friends or for trapping me,

133
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.590
I just told you what it was earlier.
I said,
yeah.
I said,

134
00:08:19.591 --> 00:08:23.430
when you're posting a picture that's intentionally provocative or sexy to get

135
00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:27.150
likes,
that's like a thirst trap.
You're not really going to hook up with anybody.

136
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:32.330
No,
you're just,
you're just posting a sexy photo.
But you see for women,
lady,
uh,

137
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.230
guys are showing thirsty for attention that that's what it is.
Sorry,

138
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.670
sorry,
I'm the White Cup on Sanford and son,
um,
set on and rap.

139
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:47.400
So I mean I'm,
I'm,
I'm just not surprised that they're there.
What should she do?

140
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.600
Did she step away from these people?
I mean step away

141
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.070
from the car with your hands?
No.
Do you have

142
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.700
<v 1>to understand that if you start to move into this space where you're posting</v>

143
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:04.230
sexy photos,
your viewership and the way people look at you is going to change.

144
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.050
Huge point.
If you're okay with that,

145
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.830
then keep doing what you're doing.
But if you have a problem with it,

146
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:13.050
then maybe you want to pull back a little bit.
But yes,

147
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:14.910
people are gonna look at you some type of way.

148
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:16.230
Women are going to look at you differently.

149
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.110
Men certainly are going to start to look at you differently.

150
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.410
And certainly what comes with that territory is that women are going to be like,

151
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.860
oh,
I saw you liked her photo when she was like,
you know,
bent over being like,

152
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:33.060
you know,
if I could just meet cute or whatever.
I don't know what,

153
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:36.150
people will insert a point here.
They're both certainly,

154
00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:39.090
you're not going to insert anything.
That's,
that's what I know.

155
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.500
It's a rough one.
Both men and women equally are going to look at it differently.

156
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.060
Right.
Okay,
so let's not,
let's not turn this into yet another,
that's what I said.

157
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.750
You said women are going to look at you differently.
Men are certainly can.

158
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.880
I'll get you differently.
Yeah.
Well,
okay,

159
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.620
so what does that mean?
Just say what you're saying.
Just don't,
don't,
yeah.
Well,

160
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:09.490
okay,
me just,
yeah.
I mean I stand by what I said.
You think that,
well,

161
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.570
why can't you say that so we can discuss it?
I've been doing that.

162
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.450
Yeah.
Well,
okay.
If Lolo wasn't here,

163
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.620
I right now I would transcribe what you just said to me.
What's his,
what?
I can't,

164
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:23.790
there's too many f words in it.

165
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.380
All that was that was like if you put a bunch of f words into a shotgun,

166
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.980
right.
Well,
um,

167
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.790
so women know what other women are doing.

168
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.730
I think you'd have to expect that.
You know,

169
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.920
if these women are already uncomfortable with your presence in their man's life,

170
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.700
if you start,
you know,

171
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.760
posting booty shots and all this other kind of stuff and they see that they're

172
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.450
dudes liking it,
they're going to be like,

173
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.660
she wouldn't say that she was bending over and already have that type of stuff.

174
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:57.470
She just said,
this is some stuff that,
you know,
it's a little more risque,

175
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.620
but I wouldn't show my parents.
Right,
exactly.
Meaning it's,
yeah,
you know,

176
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:06.470
your parents making sure your knees get back and I was like a priest.

177
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.580
I think you should post whatever I can in the Catholic church.

178
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.240
If you're feeling good about yourself and about your body,

179
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.030
you should post all the live long day.

180
00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:19.410
Just know that it's not going to be this perfect scenario where you can just

181
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:23.070
post and no one's going to look at you differently.
I disagree,
fortunately,

182
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.880
unfortunately.
That's just the way that it is.
I disagree with that.
With what?

183
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.450
With that you should go and post all these sexy photos of yourself and put them

184
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:33.300
on social media.
Women cannot not be doing that.
Why?

185
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.040
Why are you telling women what they should be doing with their body?

186
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:41.090
Is there it is.
There it is.
[inaudible] is so bright.
Yeah,

187
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:43.710
and there it is from you to tell it like,

188
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.660
I don't think women should post a like who are you?

189
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:47.810
You don't get to decide what people do with their bodies.

190
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.290
Please not say that expression.

191
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.320
What you don't get to just you guys all sound like children.
Whatever.

192
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:56.650
I want to say it in her lap trying to police my words.

193
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.270
You haven't even heard what my point is.
What's your plan?
Okay,
my,

194
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.370
my point is bad.
I don't want to hear it.
Yeah,

195
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:11.440
you have the way you wish the world was in the way.
It really is.

196
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.760
Okay.
Okay,

197
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:18.090
so to go out there and and and and do all of that stuff and be all provocative

198
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:22.660
and get all these people hot and bothered,
there were so many fricking cycles.

199
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:27.661
That's the same reason why you don't go out there and as a celebrity sit there

200
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.900
and in a tree stump or whatever the hell you call it for,
for a,

201
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.790
for a candidate,

202
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.780
all you're doing is just going out there and getting that lunatic in the white

203
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:41.410
van with the two seats that wants to make a pipe bomb and stick it in your

204
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:44.680
mailbox.
You're doing stuff like that.
You're a good looking person.

205
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.810
People are going to know you're good looking like the literally social media's

206
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.280
been around so long that that people aren't even understanding that there's no

207
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:53.350
perspective on it anymore.
Half of these,

208
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:56.380
so many of these photos that are on Instagram and all that type of stuff,

209
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.920
those were like the kind of photos that were in the beginning of a magazine at a

210
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:04.090
truck stop like 20 years ago and these are just regular women up.
But back then,

211
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.970
you didn't know where these women,
where you couldn't find them on the Internet.

212
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.630
There wasn't cvs taken.
Everybody's uh,
uh,

213
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.570
information and you can go on and find everybody's address out there and you're

214
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:16.510
going to go out there thirst trapping or whatever the hell you're calling it,

215
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.250
showing your goods and you're just,
you're playing a,
uh,

216
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.070
there's not a person in law enforcement that there would not 100% agree with

217
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:24.700
what I'm saying.

218
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.880
This has nothing to do with a guy telling you to do what you should be doing

219
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.900
with your body.

220
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.790
It has to do with somebody looking out for your own personal safety and that

221
00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:35.470
doing that is no different than these f and morons.

222
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:40.470
You see out there riding a bicycle in la on busy streets allegedly in this bike

223
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:44.050
lane that's not even painted and they have their headphones on.
You have,

224
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.520
you have completely no responsibility for your own personal safety.

225
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:50.140
And then when something happens to you,

226
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.370
this is this 100% looked at that you're a victim,
you are a victim,

227
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.190
but there's nothing looking at like some preventative measures.
Like,

228
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.440
why would you go on the Internet and do that?

229
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.600
Just post a picture yourself smiling.

230
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:04.570
You're a good looking person and you'll attract the kind of person you want to

231
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:05.020
meet.

232
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.940
You're going to go out there and show your booty crack and you and you and you,

233
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:11.590
you your,
your ass cleavage there.
I mean,
what are you,
what are you,

234
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.740
what do you like you even said that if you're going to start showing that

235
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.710
everybody was going to look at you differently,
certainly guys,

236
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.380
now all they're going to think is rude.
One of the Faq,
right?

237
00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:22.810
That's all they're thinking.
That's the best you're going to get.

238
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.170
That is the best you're going to get with those photos and the worst you're

239
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.400
going to get is an efin stalker.
Right?
Okay,
so that's what I was saying.

240
00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:32.980
I wasn't trying to get in your world.
I wasn't over here.

241
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.740
Manspreading I'm just saying doing that,

242
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.100
it's literally like becoming a comedian,

243
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:41.950
posting something on the Internet and then you're going to get upset when

244
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:44.950
someone just tears the hell out of it and says you absolutely stink.

245
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.980
And it's just like,
well,
you know,
you're not a victim here.

246
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.960
You're the guy who posted your,

247
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.390
you're the person who decided to get up on stage and people are gonna judge you.

248
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.840
That's all I'm saying.
And I think that women that do that type of stuff,

249
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.300
I don't think because there's so young,

250
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:04.301
I don't think they understand the level of f and lunatic that is out there.

251
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.340
I don't even understand it because women get it way worse.

252
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:09.110
So to go out there and sit there,

253
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:11.660
I mean that's like when you go to the frigging alligator farm and the dangling

254
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.690
those frigging chickens over the thing and all the crops go in the water,

255
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.340
you're out of your mind.

256
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.000
<v 3>Uh,
well I understand your points,</v>

257
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.650
but I still think that people should post what they want to post.

258
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.640
<v 1>It's their last roll.</v>

259
00:15:26.641 --> 00:15:30.390
The dice that you're in the herd of people shown most of their boobs.

260
00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.800
<v 3>I mean,
they're not going to get people.
Yeah,
I do.</v>

261
00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:39.480
Because I don't think that you should be living your life and fear of what could

262
00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.690
happen or what might happen because of that was the case.

263
00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:45.390
I wouldn't leave the house.
I'm not talking about going after a dream.

264
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.920
I'm talking about keeping your ass crack in your pants.
Well,

265
00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:54.210
I respectfully disagree.

266
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.790
<v 1>The thing is the points where we're going to have a problem with so and so gets</v>

267
00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:00.910
to be a certain age.
You don't.
You dare tell her that that's going to be okay.

268
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.860
Listen,
we'll see that about it.
No,
no.
I know it's your daughter now.

269
00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:09.890
It's not okay.
I recognize the hypocrisy in this,
but I would be like,

270
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.440
<v 3>please don't post that type of stuff on there,</v>

271
00:16:13.441 --> 00:16:16.860
but I also know that I,
at a certain point,

272
00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:19.410
I'm not going to be able to control what she does.

273
00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:23.290
She's not going to be sitting here quiet,
already tapped watching cartoons.

274
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.680
What do you mean to have kept up?
What does that mean?

275
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.780
<v 1>You know,
beyond a certain point.
I mean,
what,
what?
What age is that?</v>

276
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:30.920
What are we talking about here?

277
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.250
<v 3>When she's 80 and she's an adults,
I'm not going to go see isn't</v>

278
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.560
<v 1>I think of what you thought.
Your,
your 18 hours,
the logos.
You're not an adult,</v>

279
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:44.180
right?
Oh,
you're not okay with you.
And I get them teenage.
Yeah.

280
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:47.590
You and I get a divorce and I'm,
I'm with an 18 year old.
What?
She's an adult.

281
00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:52.100
You're going to be like,
she's a shy.
Oh my God,
I would kill you.
I kill myself,

282
00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:56.870
but yeah,

Oh God.

283
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.460
Oh,
say that no ball romantic little enough.

284
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:04.430
Sweet nothings.
I don't even know how to be romantic,
do I not?
It'd be romantic.

285
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.780
<v 3>Um,
Oh,
you know what romance is?</v>

286
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:17.140
You're not,
you're like a generous like sweetheart,
but like romantic.
No,

287
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.500
I wouldn't say that your romantic,
but no,
I wouldn't argue with that.

288
00:17:20.501 --> 00:17:23.620
You like romantic things you like,
like music,
like dancing,

289
00:17:23.621 --> 00:17:26.320
like in the middle of the house.
Like you like to do stuff like that.

290
00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:30.850
I want to take you to Frankie valley out here in La.
Marque first.
Uh Huh.

291
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.410

295
00:17:44.591 --> 00:17:48.740
you want to find like a 50 year old white woman to take to stuff like that?
Why?

296
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.240
Why do you got to bring race into it?
Cause I mean deldot see fall valley

297
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.180
<v 3>heavy.
Come on,
let's be,
are you kidding me?
I maybe my mom will go.</v>

298
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.260
Where'd she go?
I take her.
You would take my mom.

299
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.040
I love you mom.
I'll go in a minute.

300
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:11.310
You got some probably have a really nice time at y'all.
Just too good to be true.

301
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:13.980
You don't want to see that too.
And he's in his eighties he's still kills it,

302
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.000
right?
Yeah.
That's the guy from Jersey Boys,
right?

303
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.830
Georgia even though one.
Yeah,

304
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.220
<v 1>go one.
Never laid a hand on you,
man.</v>

305
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:29.171
<v 3>So anyway,</v>

306
00:18:29.171 --> 00:18:33.700
back to the question of a million module where my Nias perspective,

307
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.100
my perspective is not as that you're not doing anything wrong by thirst trapping

308
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:43.820
on Instagram,
but you should know that that's going to come with a,

309
00:18:43.821 --> 00:18:47.680
a change in how you're perceived.
And yes,
they are.
Here's the thing.

310
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.840
If I had a girlfriend who was hot single and she was feeling really good about

311
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:55.390
herself and she was posting,
you know,
sexy photos,

312
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.620
I would be one of the first ones being like,
yes bitch,
get it.
Oh my God.
Amazing.

313
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.450
Yeah,
get it.
Get your life.
Just get everything.

314
00:19:04.451 --> 00:19:09.320
What is that that yes girl show you.
But if Billy you doing,

315
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.670
if I saw the bill was lacking all of her photos,
I might be like,

316
00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:17.130
now wait just a minute.
So that's just the reality of it.

317
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.020
<v 1>All right.
Let's see.
I finally got my abs like I finally,</v>

318
00:19:20.021 --> 00:19:21.550
I didn't have to go on the road for,
you know,

319
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.330
and just ruin everything that I got.
I get my abs back and I start,

320
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.620
I start posting shirtless photos cause I feel good about my body.

321
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.660
<v 3>Be like,
yes,
yes.
Get it,
get it.
Yeah,
I would,</v>

322
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:39.230
but yeah,
and what I have a problem with women but women already like

323
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.880
<v 1>are,
are looking for you and trying to like put it out there.
I've seen it.</v>

324
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.290
I assume we're going to see comments,
ladies.
That's what I see y'all sly remarks.

325
00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:49.750
That's one of the funniest things you've ever said.
Just no,
I'm watching.

326
00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:53.500
I've never had that attention ever.
Uh,
it's been happening.

327
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.540
Perhaps you haven't noticed it,
but it happened.
No,

328
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.850
that doesn't count when you get to where I'm at now.

329
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.760
What do you mean it doesn't count?
It counts when you're nobody.

330
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.270
That means you're good looking up.
All of a sudden you start selling tickets.

331
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.180
<v 3>Hey Baby.
Hey Baby.
Yeah,
man.</v>

332
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.290
I just like,
that doesn't mean anything.
Look how good she's been.

333
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.230
You liked me when I was broke.
I did.

334
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.120
I fell in love with you when you were broke.
It was a great time.
You know.

335
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:22.370
I got you.
I was thirst trapping.

336
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.590
That was going to say something else.
Oh,
navy.

337
00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.213
Um,

338
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.860
<v 1>all right,
well I'll agree to disagree on those photos.
I mean,
I think you know</v>

339
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.110
what people are.
Yeah.
It's just like you were inviting like,

340
00:20:41.111 --> 00:20:43.390
I would love this gotta be something up there.

341
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.350
Somebody in law enforcement and stories and all of that,

342
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:51.010
that the stuff that these people are,
I like,
people are lunatics now.

343
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.600
Like people will already nuts.

344
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:57.601
But this like this computer with all of this stuff that you can look at like you

345
00:20:57.761 --> 00:20:58.750
couldn't do,
you know what I mean?

346
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:03.070
Like down this look back in the day near if you had like a crush it somebody on

347
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:03.431
work.

348
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:08.140
I mean you needed your imagination when you went home to conjure up some sort of

349
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:08.351
fit.

350
00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:13.351
Now you just go to their Instagram page and just sit there like an absolute void

351
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.650
or it's not even considered voyeurism anymore.
Right.
And you just sit there,

352
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:18.484
it's weird.

353
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.430
The whole thing is weird and you go further down and then their pictures on

354
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:24.450
enough and then you need video and then the video I got.

355
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.610
Yeah you just some weird thing the way she like cracks and egg when she's just

356
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:29.210
showing you how to make uh,
uh,

357
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.440
over easy egg or something and you get all of this psycho world and then what

358
00:21:32.441 --> 00:21:32.790
happens?

359
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.520
You get so into that virtual world that if you ever asked her out and she

360
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:41.110
actually approached you,
you then have a performance,
a prob problem because it's,

361
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:44.110
it's too intimate.
Cause he used to this stuff,
this thing,

362
00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:47.990
there is a disease and you know,
I I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

363
00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:50.920
I'm not judging anybody cause I felt the ramifications of it,

364
00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:55.090
you know what I mean?
Trying to lay off the uh,
the,
the,
the,

365
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.130
the bad stuff on there if you know what yeah,
yeah,
I do too.
It's,
yeah,

366
00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:02.380
it's just too easy.
So I'm just saying,
I dunno,

367
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.950
you know,
you don't mean to,
yeah,
I'm liberal and I'm conservative.

368
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:09.370
I'm conservative when it comes to this.
You are conservative when a car is,

369
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:13.630
you know,
last call it a bar.
I get a little liberal and that has what do you,

370
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.150
what is time man?
Like what is 2:00 AM do you realize that it's,

371
00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:23.050
it's 12 noon in Japan right now,
man.
Oh Jesus.

372
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:28.600
Okay.

379
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.740
Yeah.

There's no baby there.
Say Hi baby.</v>

382
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.910

Halo.
Hey.

Football.
You say football.

385
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.840
Can you just kiss the microphone?
Can you say football?
Football.
Football.

386
00:23:27.841 --> 00:23:31.840
I love that.

pop.
Puppy,

No dogs.
That's right.

395
00:24:17.661 --> 00:24:22.460
You're watching inbox.
Where the hell is it?
All right.

396
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:26.840
Here we go.
Four reads everybody.
Hey Nini?
Okay,

397
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.660

All right.
All right.

399
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.350
For any smokers out there trying to quit or if you know someone who is,

400
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:43.800
there's a revolutionary way to quit called zero,
zero,
zero.

401
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.010
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
Zeroes.

402
00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:51.011
Quick Kit is a new quilting solution proven to increase your chances of kicking

403
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:56.180
the habit by up to four times compared to going cold Turkey.

404
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.780
In your own words.
Oh,
sorry.
Capital Letters.

405
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:06.440
Talk about your experience or experience of someone you know who was trying to

406
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:08.120
quit smoking.
Oh Man.

407
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:11.510
I remember there was this guy and he was trying to quit smoking but he couldn't

408
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:15.680
do it cause it was too hard
and then he died.

409
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:17.680
Uh,
no he didn't.

410
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.990
He's still lift and he eventually quit and I think he went cold Turkey.

411
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.300
I don't know why these people want me to tell you that.
Anyways.

412
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:27.850
How many times did you slash day try before you slashed?

413
00:25:27.851 --> 00:25:31.520
They were finally successful.
He tried a lot.
A lot of times.

414
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.590
What method already answered all this.
The zero quit kilt kit not killed.

415
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.230
Um,
it's a three tiered approach that includes prescription medication,
nicotine,

416
00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:45.650
gum and continued support through a mobile app.

417
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.330
Dare I say this is like the blitzkrieg onto n c

418
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.580
Atlanta.
Jesus.
I almost forgot the last way.
How would you do it?
Well,

419
00:25:56.581 --> 00:25:58.750
the English channels there,
there ain't off.

420
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.970
How the hell would you do the rest of it and how are you going to get them on

421
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.710
living?
You don't walk across the water,
Huh?

422
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.920
Bring them hope I didn't get done what he did.
He had a hell of a battle plan.

423
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.690
Your advertisers are gonna Increase.
I think we would've rolled right past it.

424
00:26:15.691 --> 00:26:17.190
He brought it up.
Here's how it works.

425
00:26:17.191 --> 00:26:22.050
Go to quit with zero.com to start your online doctor visit.

426
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.790
After your five minute visit,

427
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:28.590
a physician will then determine if you're eligible to use the quit kit.

428
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.330
If you're eligible,
like they're going to say no,
the doctor will prescribe.

429
00:26:33.331 --> 00:26:34.170
We don't want money.

430
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.740
We'll prescribe your medication and the quit kit will be shipped directly to

431
00:26:40.261 --> 00:26:41.610
your door.
Why is that so hard to say?

432
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.450
Quick Kit zero zero zero whoa.

433
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:50.830
Costs less than what the average smoker spends on cigarettes and add less than

434
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.960
other quitting options.
Yeah.
How come?
How expensive our cigarettes now per pack.

435
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.033
Nia.

436
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:57.953
<v 8>Oh,</v>

437
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.080

Smoke it in the board room</v>

438
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.420
lies,
uh,

439
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.790
Quit was zero.com/bar and for a limited time,

440

Need to talk about how every man looks better in,

444
00:27:33.231 --> 00:27:36.200
feels more confident when he puts on his suit.
Could you do that for me?

445
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.910
Every man looks better and it feels more confident when they put on a suit.

446
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.340
What does it do to you when you see me in a suit?

447
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.920
When you see Mike pasty body March,
uh,

448
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:54.170
no.
You look great in a suit.
You know,
I liked the whole habit dash.
Yeah,

449
00:27:54.171 --> 00:27:56.740
I liked that whole look.
I like,
does it increase bottom?

450
00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:01.640
I like a three piece suit.
I like a nice tie.
Good shoes,
nice socks,

451
00:28:01.641 --> 00:28:04.010
good trousers.
Does that,
uh,

452
00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.170
is that increased my chances later on of getting some sort of physical contact

453
00:28:09.171 --> 00:28:13.160
with you?
Consensual?
Of course.
Yes.
Consensual.
I know it's in the old days,

454
00:28:13.161 --> 00:28:16.390
I could just tie you down with my neck ties.
That would have been fine,

455
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:21.130
but that was considered working it out amongst yourselves.
Oh my God.

456
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.680
They're like in Japan or something where,
all right.
Um,
yeah,

457
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.090
definitely like it when you wear a suit,
visit a stylist.

458
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.880
What if I wore one in the bedroom tonight?
Just showed up.
That's weird though,

459
00:28:31.881 --> 00:28:36.250
because that's not,
I would like that if I just showed up in a suit.
Yeah.

460
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.680
Really?
Yeah.
And you were like the businessman.
Oh boy.

461
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.950
And then they gave you the business.
Okay.
This bit,

462
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.930
this man giving me the business.
All right.

463
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.120
Looks like somebody's gonna be doing some business with Indochino.
Alright.
Uh,

464
00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:57.740
visit a stylist at our showroom and have them take your measurements personally

465
00:28:57.741 --> 00:28:59.990

relaxed while your suit gets professionally tailored and mailed to you in a

470
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.030
couple of weeks.
Really folded up like a frigging pocket square.

471
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:24.620
Just watch as the compliments rolled in.
Oh my God.
Look at your package.

472
00:29:24.621 --> 00:29:29.270

People arrested for Ammo from all races,

480
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:02.950
trample each other and in a department store,

481

It's like they should do be doing it.

483
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:11.680
You know when the Serengeti,

484
00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:15.190

485
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.340
you've taken a drink next to an alligator and there's a line on the other side

486
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:19.174
of you.

487
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.120

488
00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:25.420
know every wall,
like somebody screws it up.

I.
Hey Billy Birkenstocks.
Uh,</v>

590
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.820
I'm 26,
um,

591
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.460
and still in love with my high school sweetheart.

592
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:46.080
We've been on and off again for 10 years and I've gone through a lot to say the

593
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:47.520
least.
Jesus Christ.
Yes.

594
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:52.980
I just got back from a two week vacation with her where everything was perfect

595
00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:54.660
and we had the time of our lives.

596
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.940
This is the woman I want to start a family with.

597
00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.690
And it became more and more apparent on this trip.
Congratulations.

598
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:05.340
What could go wrong?
Um,
here's the thing.

599
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.220
I slept with her sister on a drunk and blacked out night three years ago while

600
00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:16.220
me and her,
we're not together and we're on bad terms.

601
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.310
Oh boy.
Who bully.

602
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:24.680
My heart was broken and I had a lot of resentment.
I was 23 drunk week.

603
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:27.080
Shut the fuck up dude.
You had a dick.

604
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:32.290
You fucking jerked off to where while you were dating her other sits that get

605
00:38:32.481 --> 00:38:36.040
the fuck outta here.
Don't fucking come at me.
Got a dick too.

606
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.990
<v 0>All right.
Don't fuck.
And our youngest sister came on to me.
Oh my God,</v>

607
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:45.310
you victim.
Things were different then and I was a mess.
Listen,

608
00:38:45.311 --> 00:38:47.850
I'm not saying you weren't fucking heartbroken.
You,
uh,
you,

609
00:38:47.851 --> 00:38:51.220
you are fucking psych the next day.
There you go.
You know what?

610
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.440
You just got to check off a whole family.

611
00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.520
Well,
you got to love to do is bang them mother.
Um,

612
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.960
that's gotta be called something like the Grand Slam.
You know,

613
00:39:04.961 --> 00:39:08.260
like when tiger woods won four in a row and they was saying he won the grand

614
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:12.880
that you won,
you won all four majors would be if you bang the mother,

615
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.780
it all the daughters,
that would be the Grand Slam.
Uh,

616
00:39:16.781 --> 00:39:19.840
the amount of guys left or right now,
why the women have pissed?
Uh,

617
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.640
well a year or so later,

618
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:26.140
me and my high school sweetie started talking again and started to become close

619
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.640
leading up to where it is now.

620
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.670
I had an unbelievable guilt for what I did with their sister.

621
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.490
The closer me and this girl got years later,

622
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.330
it is the only thing that I haven't been honest with her about and I had to tell

623
00:39:37.331 --> 00:39:40.060
her,
you fucking idiot.
No you didn't.
You should have talked to your sister.

624
00:39:40.061 --> 00:39:41.890
And just,
there's been like,
look,
what are we going to do here?

625
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:43.743
<v 8>You know,</v>

626
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.670
<v 0>he's,
is it,
how does it make things better that you told her</v>

627
00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:55.230
that's such as [inaudible] and then like for the rest of their fucking lives,

628
00:39:55.231 --> 00:39:59.100
that's going to be a problem between the two of them.
Ah,
Jesus,

629
00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:04.260
you shouldn't have said Shit and just waited until 20 years later when the

630
00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:07.650
sister,
you know,
who never got married,
gets fucking hammered.
And the guy,
yeah,

631
00:40:07.651 --> 00:40:11.340
well I fuck jasmine 25 years ago.
And at that point,
you know,

632
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.680
what are you going to do?
He'd be like,
yeah,
it was,
dude,

633
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:17.420
it was in the fucking two thousands.
What do you want from me?
Um,

634
00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.040
anyways,
egos a well,
a year or so later,
I mean,

635
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.440
in the high school,
Sweetie started talking again,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

636
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:25.550
I had an unbelievable guilt.

637
00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:28.900
<v 8>MMM.</v>

638
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.490
<v 0>So I had to test.
So the last night of our vacation,
oh my God,</v>

639
00:40:33.491 --> 00:40:36.040
we were laying in bed and I told her everything.

640
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:37.850
<v 8>Okay.</v>

641
00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:39.290
<v 0>I took a slap.</v>

642
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:44.360
She was crying for hours and it was as ugly as you can imagine.
Well,

643
00:40:44.361 --> 00:40:48.800
you know what,
Dude,
I commend you.
You got it off you fucking chest.
He goes,

644
00:40:48.801 --> 00:40:52.910
I feel terrible.
And I'm torn on if it was the right decision to tell her,

645
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.580
my friends are giving me mixed answers.

646
00:40:55.581 --> 00:40:59.960
And I would like an outside perspective from someone who I respect greatly.

647
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:05.660
Uh,
Jesus cry.
I appreciate the respect me.
Um,
I don't know.

648
00:41:05.661 --> 00:41:08.130
Do you know if it was really bugging you and you felt like you had to tell a

649
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.260
good good.
You told her,

650
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:10.973
<v 8>you know,</v>

651
00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.970
<v 0>now you don't have to worry about that fucking thing coming out of nowhere.</v>

652
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.050
He goes,
it is still fresh and everything is confusing on what is next.

653
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.590
We love each other very much,
but obviously I fucked up big time.

654
00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.310
Do you think this relationship stands a chance?
I really hope it does,

655
00:41:25.311 --> 00:41:26.540
but I'm worried I ruined it.

656
00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.830
She seems to be getting through it better than I thought after her first

657
00:41:30.831 --> 00:41:34.020
reaction,
she told me she loves me,

658
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.690
<v 8>but I really hurt her and she needs some space because when,
um,</v>

659
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.780
she needs some space.
I hope you don't have a brother

660
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:48.620
<v 0>because when I'm with her,
okay,
she told me she loves me,</v>

661
00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:51.500
but I really hurt her and she needs some space because when I'm with her,

662
00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:52.580
she can't be mad at me.

663
00:41:52.581 --> 00:41:55.520
I'm not a scumbag and this is completely out of character for me to do.

664
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.160
I just made a terrible mistake.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.

665
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:02.600
I will say the fact that you actually feel this level of guilt,
um,

666
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.440
uh,
you're a better man than me cause I wouldn't have said Shit.

667
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.820
I just would've just been like,
well,

668
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:11.060
I hope this doesn't fucking come out someday.
Well,

669
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:13.580
we're having pumpkin pie over thanksgiving.
Uh,

670
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.280
and I bet there's a lot of people out there that live with that secret.

671
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:20.990
My thing is not only the cowardly self preservation that I would try to have,

672
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.610
I would also,
I'm also thinking like

673
00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.360
this is,
I would have handled that situation.

674
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:35.390
I either wouldn't have said shit or I would just break up with her and just walk

675
00:42:35.521 --> 00:42:39.970
away from it because I,

676
00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.110
I wouldn't say a by the way,

677
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:45.800
I banged your sister and then for the rest of their life they have to fucking

678
00:42:45.801 --> 00:42:47.780
deal with that.
Um,

679
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.500
<v 11>yeah.</v>

680
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.060
<v 0>When I'm the piece of shit that did it.</v>

681
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:56.090
But I have to commend you that you actually felt that level of guilt and said

682
00:42:56.131 --> 00:42:57.690
something,
uh,
because I,
I don't know.

683
00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.980
So it sounds to me that you're going to get past it.

684
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.260
So the good thing

685
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.760
is that now you don't have to worry about that fucking grand piano fog crashing

686
00:43:10.951 --> 00:43:14.490
down on your fucking life someday.
So that's the upside.

687
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:18.490
<v 8>MMM.</v>

688
00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:23.490
<v 0>Maybe there's an upside that you told her where she'll have faith in you that</v>

689
00:43:25.151 --> 00:43:30.070
like,
wow,
this guy actually feels guilt about stuff like that so I can trust him.

690
00:43:30.071 --> 00:43:34.300
We were broken up while it happened.
Um,
you know,

691
00:43:34.301 --> 00:43:37.150
let me see if I can get Nia in here for this one.
Hang on a second.

692
00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.980
All right.
The magic of the pause button again.
The lovely Nia is here.

693
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.410
<v 3>Hi.
Hey,

All right.</v>

694
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:49.740
<v 0>Ex-Girlfriend's sister.
Oh,
Jeesh yeah.
All right.
Really quickly,
this guy.</v>

695
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.210
All right,
I'll give you the abridged version.

696
00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:53.490
I've been on and off again for 10 years.

697
00:43:53.491 --> 00:43:56.370
Just got back from a two week vacation with her.
Everything was perfect.

698
00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:00.840
We had the time of our lives.
This is the woman I want to start a family with.
A,

699
00:44:00.841 --> 00:44:01.590
here's the thing.

700
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.500
I slept with this sister and a drunk and blacked out at night three years ago

701
00:44:04.501 --> 00:44:07.050
while we met.
Uh,
while we,

702
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.830
me and her were not together and we're on bad terms.
My heart was broken.

703
00:44:10.831 --> 00:44:11.700
I had a lot of resentment.

704
00:44:11.701 --> 00:44:15.210
I was 23 drunk week and her youngest sister came on to me.

705
00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.340
<v 3>Oh No.
I'll tell you.
That's a rough one.
It's a real rough.</v>

706
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:23.170
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

707
00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:26.750
<v 3>You like,
oh,
you make some self the victim.
Yeah.
She came on to me.
Okay.</v>

708
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.640
I said earlier,
I said,
dude,
I have a dick too.
Don't fucking lie to me.
Exactly.

709
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:35.040
I stop it.
I said,
you rubbed one out to her before you fucking,
yes.

710
00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.040
The seeds have been planted for a while that you've been wanting to fuck the

711
00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:40.770
sister.
Don't try to act like,
oh,
I was so heartbroken.

712
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.020
You and the sister are both dirty.

713
00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.760
<v 0>Okay,
so here's the deal.
He goes,</v>

714
00:44:45.761 --> 00:44:48.790
he felt terrible the last night of the vacation.

715
00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.720
He couldn't deal with the guilt.
So he told her,
oh my God.

716
00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.930
He goes,
I tell Egos.
I took a slap.
She was crying for hours and it was ugly,

717
00:44:58.931 --> 00:45:03.250
as you can imagine.
Yeah,
I'm all right.
She told me she loves me,

718
00:45:03.251 --> 00:45:06.850
but I really hurt her.
And she needs some space because when I'm with with her,

719
00:45:06.851 --> 00:45:08.230
she can't be mad at me.

720
00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.620
I'm not a scumbag and this is completely out of character for me to do.

721
00:45:11.621 --> 00:45:14.770
I just made a terrible mistake.
So he's basically saying,

722
00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.700
do you think the relationship stands a chance?
I really hope it does,

723
00:45:18.701 --> 00:45:19.960
but I'm worried I ruined it.

724
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.470
She seems to be getting through it better than I thought after our first

725
00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:24.310
reaction.
What do you think?

726
00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.820
<v 3>Yeah,
no,
it's,
it's not gonna happen.
You fucked her to the stair.
It's over.</v>

727
00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:32.500
That's it.
Thanks.
So yeah,
because I mean maybe,

728
00:45:32.501 --> 00:45:36.820
maybe there are some people who are more emotionally evolved than I am,

729
00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.160
but I couldn't get that.
Like that's her sister.

730
00:45:39.161 --> 00:45:42.820
Like her is not going anywhere and like how's it going to be at like

731
00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:46.090
Thanksgiving and Christmas and like all that kind of stuff.

732
00:45:46.091 --> 00:45:49.540
Like you're just going to avoid each other or just kind of like,
it's weird.

733
00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.670
I mean maybe the three of them can have a threesome

734
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.090
sound.
What I was thinking,
you can't,

735
00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:03.020
you can't have a threesome with your sister.
That's disgusting.
That's gross.

736
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:07.640
I would never want to see.
Just
know each other on these bombs.

737
00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:12.140
Yeah.
Talking to each other.
Hey,
I remember we went to the waterpark.

738
00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.360
Oh No,
stop.

739
00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:20.590
Three of them sit down and both this guy and the sister or so repentant and so

740
00:46:21.771 --> 00:46:25.640
whatever.
But like you,
you'd never be able to trust them.

741
00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:29.480
You'd never be like,
Oh yeah,
can you guys run out and like,
you know,

742
00:46:29.481 --> 00:46:32.460
get some extra sugar and more groceries.
Try not to

743
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:38.670
[inaudible].
Exactly.
So,
and that's the thing.

744
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.650
She might be okay with him now,

745
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.830
but in the end she's going to choose her sister like that no matter how her

746
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:48.270
sister betrayed her.
That's the sister.
So you are disposable.

747
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.090
You're just like the dude that's her family.

748
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:56.150
So if you think that you really have to like hands on to her and the sister and

749
00:46:56.151 --> 00:47:00.330
the sister will probably get past it,
but like a long,

750
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:03.210
long ways from now.
And it'll probably always still be there.

751
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.770
But because their family family betrays each other all the time,
you know,

752
00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:13.020
here's the thing.
I think what she did was worse than what he did.
The sister.

753
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.930
Oh definitely.
If we're going to like put them on.

754
00:47:15.931 --> 00:47:20.100
Who was the worst person that situation?
The sister 100

755
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.750
<v 0>here's what I learned.
You never do that if you're with a woman.
Okay,</v>

756
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:30.130
okay.
You guys break up and blah blah blah.
If her sister comes on to you like

757
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:34.750
<v 3>you are effectively ending that relationship forever.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

758
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.950
And what do you think he told her?
Her and the relations.

759
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.010
You think he should have told her?

760
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.030
The thing about it is,

761
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.980
is that he told her because he felt guilty.

762
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.160
So it was to unburden his own conscious because it wasn't real because there's

763
00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:56.770
nothing in telling her that would make her feel better and oh my God,

764
00:47:56.771 --> 00:47:59.620
thank you so much for being honest with me.
That's the sister.

765
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:04.240
So I don't know.
I don't really know how to answer.

766
00:48:04.241 --> 00:48:08.440
Nothing compatible that he had such guilt that he had to tell her.
Not really,

767
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:12.280
because people are burdened with shield all the time and they like,
oh,

768
00:48:12.281 --> 00:48:16.120
I just had to get it off my chest.
And it's like,
great,
congratulations.

769
00:48:16.121 --> 00:48:18.070
It's off your chest now.
I feel shitty.

770
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:22.830
So was that really for me or was that for you?
Nia.

771
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:28.030
Renee hill coming here and bringing the love.
Yeah,
I,

772
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.090
I don't,
I don't,
I'm not with that whole like,

773
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:35.890
well at least he was honest with you.
It's like for what?
For me?
No,

774
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:40.540
that was all for him to I burn.
Ever looked at it that way.
Wow.
Yeah.

775
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:44.530
Not that I don't think apologies are worthwhile or I don't,
I,

776
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.470
it's not like I don't think that you should apologize for something you did

777
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:50.090
wrong,
but I just feel like you really need to question.

778
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.220
That's what you were saying.
Yeah.

779
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:56.080
You really need to question your motivations for confessing something of this

780
00:48:56.081 --> 00:48:59.800
level.
You know what I mean?
It's like what are you really trying to do?

781
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:03.630
A lot of times people are just trying to unburden themselves.
Well,

782
00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.301
that's what I was saying,

783
00:49:04.301 --> 00:49:07.780
that the best thing now is he got it out there so he doesn't have to worry about

784
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:11.290
that grand piano coming crashing down into his life someday.
I'm the same way.

785
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.150
They haven't like fucking Thanksgiving dinner.

786
00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:18.400
What I want to know is what is going on between the girl and the sister.

787
00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.560
Cause obviously that's no sister.
That's no real.
I don't know.

788
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.180
That's what I'm more,
something else.

789
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:30.181
Why that's fucked up is because now you know that the parents know.

790
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:35.830
You know,
you think she would have told the parents like mom,
what if they know?

791
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.780
Yeah.
And then they got to be like,
oh my God,
we raised a whore.

792
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.350
And I don't think that she's a hoe.
She's at a hotel.

793
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.450
But you guys still make mistakes,
but it's,
that's really,
yeah,
that's issue.
No,
no,

794
00:49:48.451 --> 00:49:53.260
that's,
that's beyond,
that's a power thing.
Yet it is total power.
It is.

795
00:49:53.261 --> 00:49:57.580
I wonder if this was a younger sister and I wonder like who knows?

796
00:49:57.581 --> 00:49:59.590
But that's what I'm more intrigued about now.

797
00:49:59.591 --> 00:50:04.510
It's like what's going to happen with the sisters?
You know,
that's like,

798
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.120
that's some deep shit right there.
So I don't know.

799
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.710
That's like a power thing on her thing saying like,
you know,

800
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.660
it was much as you're into her,
you still can't fucking resist me.
What is it?

801
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.810
Yeah,
maybe so because who does that?
Who goes after you?

802
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:22.450
Let us to the female mind.
I can't let you in on that.

803
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:27.280
That's not a female thing.
That's like a dirty ass Ho bitch.
Nasty.

804
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:28.040
I

805
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.120
<v 0>don't know what that's like.
I would never go after,
uh,</v>

806
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:36.200
relatives like significant other.
So where do you draw the line?

807
00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.080
What do you mean coworker?
So you're not

808
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:44.510
just so that people know because you really have strong opinions on this.

809
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:47.980
So I want to know.
So family obviously.
Yeah.

810
00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:50.043
Yeah,

811
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:55.290
my family clearly in a relationship with somebody else and you know,

812
00:50:57.261 --> 00:50:59.060
got all that together.
I want to know,

813
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:04.070
I want to know where you draw the light coworker.
You've,
okay.

814
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:08.000
You guys occasionally have lunch together with the sisters,
coworker.
Yeah.

815
00:51:08.001 --> 00:51:11.360
And this is something the guy's got like he does like the Paisley tie with the

816
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:13.100
suspenders.
You know that there were cameras,
this,

817
00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:16.230
that you guys always go nuts about that no belt.

818
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.440
Yeah.
Well if you have suspenders,
you don't need a belt.
So,
but anyway,
um,

819
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.400
what if he has both suspenders and a belt and then you think like,

820
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.800
I don't know what it is that you're trying to do.

821
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:32.450
Well maybe how would you have both when that,
when that like get that thing,

822
00:51:32.451 --> 00:51:34.310
that female thing where like you'd feel safe.

823
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:38.060
Like this guy's really going to have like he's going to have an alarm system and

824
00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:42.770
a gun ear and a sword and where to condoms.
Yeah.
No,

825
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.210
I don't know about that.
Yeah.
No,
I mean if they're not involved,

826
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:51.740
if they're not like in a real relationship.
Neighbors.
Yeah,
the neighbor.

827
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:55.880
Would you bang a neighbor when I bang like my sister's neighbor?
No,

828
00:51:55.881 --> 00:51:59.120
not use sisters now,
but we're taking family out of it.
I'm saying where,

829
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:04.160
where is the line where it's just like,
well,
whatever bitch,
you know,

830
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:08.030
is it that you guys say you put the hand up,
whatever,
bitch,

831
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:11.390
what are you talking about?
I'm saying,
cause you saying like that's family.

832
00:52:11.391 --> 00:52:14.940
You can't fucking do that.
I'm just trying to find a comedic angle here.
No,

833
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:19.490
I see what you mean.
I mean neighbor two streets over.

834
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.390
Your neighbor knew them,
invited you over and you went over there.

835
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:28.070
<v 3>You know what?
I have a real life example of guy.
Guy was an architect.
Okay.</v>

836
00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:32.990
All right,
I got it.
I have a real life example of this.

837
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:37.040
During,
during my prom I went my senior prom.

838
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:41.900
I love somebody else.
Yup.
Wait a minute.
I want somebody who was just a friend.

839
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:46.590
Okay.
But my friend has biz Markie.

840
00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.030
He was just a Fred.
Um,

841
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:54.490
but my friend went to the prom with this guy that she had just met and they were

842
00:52:55.251 --> 00:52:58.460
set up by another friend.
He went to a different school.

843
00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.290
So they didn't really like know each other,

844
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.960
but that was the day of justification.
They just,

845
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:07.670
they were set up by friends.
So I'm totally innocent.

846
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:12.671
So really we really connected during prom and like,

847
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:17.150
as you know,
that was not what happened.
As you know,

848
00:53:17.151 --> 00:53:18.800
my prom did not end that great.

849
00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:22.160
My parents like came and like took me from this house that I was in because I

850
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:24.920
was dumb enough weight to tell them the truth.

851
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:28.530
I called my parents because I was supposed to spend the night at a girlfriend's

852
00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:32.670
house,
but instead we're going to be hanging out at this boy's house.

853
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:35.880
His older sister was there.
There was a whole bunch of us were hanging out.

854
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.150
I was having such a great time that I call my parents and I said,
hey,

855
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:41.400
just so you know,
I'm staying here.

856
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.560
My mom completely flipped out and she and my step father came and like extracted

857
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:50.730
me from the home.
So that's how my prom ended.
Exactly.
So it didn't end on any,

858
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:54.450
it was a very traumatic,
but right.
Parents ultimately they did the right thing.

859
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.310
Um,
but anyway,

860
00:53:56.311 --> 00:54:01.140
he and me and this guy ended up connecting and we ended up like dating

861
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:05.940
afterwards,
so you know,
um,
oh that's different.
I thought you were saying like,

862
00:54:05.941 --> 00:54:07.530
you know,
like I,

863
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:11.550
we went in the bathroom to the front part of the Limo and put the window up in.

864
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:16.380
No,
no,
no,
no.
But it wasn't her boyfriend.
They had just met.

865
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.800
I think she definitely felt some type of way about it,
you know,

866
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:23.370
only because he chose you over her.
Exactly.

867
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:26.370
You guys didn't have any sorta like friendship,
friendship?
No.

868
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:30.800
She and I were really good friends.
Yeah.
That,
yeah.
No,
no,

869
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:31.643
that's not good.

870
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:37.090
<v 0>Oh,
that's a rough one.
But it wasn't
[inaudible] let him rough one.</v>

871
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.590
<v 3>And we dated for a while.
We dated up in Seoul,
you know,</v>

872
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:43.410
like I went to college basically,
and that was,
that was the end of that.

873
00:54:43.411 --> 00:54:47.100
So it wasn't like this long,
the term,
you know,
Torrid affair.

874
00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.800
It wasn't like he was my first love or anything.

875
00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:54.810
He was just really cute and a football player and like Bob Marley,
you know?
Hey,

876
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:56.183
what can I say?

877
00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.310
<v 0>Sorta,
Sorta,
sorta details here.
All right,
well that's the podcast for this week.</v>

878
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.150
Um,
and he came hard this week.
Came hard.

879
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.890
You really fucking just put that guy you just said,
you know what,
then that's it.

880
00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:11.880
It's a fucking rapping.
You know what?
I think you're right.
I think you're right.

881
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:15.630
I can say that.
Yeah.
As I said to him,
like,
thank you.
Yes.
Yeah.

882
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:27.740
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

883
00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.540
<v 3>Hey,
what's going on?
It's Belper</v>

884
00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.680
<v 10>and it is the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,</v>

885
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:37.790
November 15th,
2010 and a,

886
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:41.190
I'm doing this one really,
really,
really fucking late.
Uh,

887
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:46.190
I had to fly back from Columbus this weekend,
Columbus,
Ohio.
And uh,

888
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:49.820
before I start the podcast,
I want to thank everyone who came out to my shows.

889
00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:54.590
I had six phenomenal shows out there.
Every damn one of them sold out.

890
00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:00.090
People smiling and waving.
I was shaking hands and kissing babies after shows.

891
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:04.530
Everything was great.
So I want to thank everyone who came out.
Uh,

892
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:09.750
seriously,
man,
that was amazing.
The uh,
Sun,
even the Sunday shows sold out.
So,

893
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:15.130
uh,
yeah,
definitely.
Um,
definitely going to be back,
you know,

894
00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.180
cause that's how I do it.

895
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:19.840
Do you show up to my shows then I come back to your town.

896
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:24.400
You know the fuck you think I'm doing this shit for free.
Paypal.

897
00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:29.380
Oh,
Lee,
the podcast is free.
Um,

898
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:34.180
but even that is anything free.
There's a price to pay for everything.

899
00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:39.060
My girl is fucking pissed at me right now because my apartment was so goddamn

900
00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:43.380
quiet until I came home and she was praying to God that I had already done the

901
00:56:43.381 --> 00:56:47.610
podcast and she was asking me,
did you have,
did you already do it?
Did you do it?

902
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:51.780
And I said,
no,
I have to do the podcast.
And she was just like,
gosh,

903
00:56:51.781 --> 00:56:53.820
it's just so nice and quiet.

904
00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:59.900
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a more subdued podcasts this week.

905
00:57:00.051 --> 00:57:03.230
I'm just fucking with you.
I live to irritate people.
All right,

906
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.820
so I'm going to be doing it.
All right.
What the fuck am I talking about?

907
00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:10.760
I just got off the plane.
All right.
Back from Columbus.

908
00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:14.330
What the fuck do I want to talk about?
I don't fucking know.

909
00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.390
I'm starting to take pictures of people sleeping in airports.

910
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:22.300
Just some of the fucking faces,
you know?
Yeah.

911
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.990
Especially on the planes when people don't bring those neck braces.
Yeah.

912
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:30.430
You know those people like they're fucking sue happy people during the day and

913
00:57:30.431 --> 00:57:33.370
at night they fly in planes and they have those little neck braces.
When,

914
00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:37.780
when people don't have those,
just watching people's heads,
Bob and all around,

915
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.760
you know that's a good time to be obese cause he got like that built in neck

916
00:57:42.761 --> 00:57:43.594
brace,

917
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:50.270
big neck brace of fat.
You know,
you want a pillow.

918
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.820
All you do is just lean your head 45 degrees to the right or the left.

919
00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:58.180
You're all good.
I bet they never have any neck pain,
you know?

920
00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:01.840
But what do they do every fucking week on the biggest loser sitting there,

921
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:05.590
bitch moaning and complaining.
Oh it's so fucking hard.
Really?

922
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:12.020
You have a body temperature pillow on all four sides of your neck.

923
00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:16.140
I know it's round.
Okay.
But my world,

924
00:58:16.141 --> 00:58:21.070
you still have sites.
So there you go.
Fatties fat people.
I know.

925
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:26.070
And I know I tease you a lot because you know what?
I'm sick of you.
Um,

926
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.861
citizens that you know,

927
00:58:26.861 --> 00:58:30.880
there's enough fucking groups out there that I got to watch what I say that I

928
00:58:30.881 --> 00:58:35.290
got to tippy toe around.
Okay?
I'm not tick,
I'm not fucking adding another one.

929
00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:39.790
All right.
I've added up to here with the fucking tippy toe in.
Okay.

930
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.700
Goddamned bastards.
Lay off the fudge.
Um,

931
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.870
I first realized though,
it's out of control.

932
00:58:49.871 --> 00:58:53.980
When I went to fall asleep on the plane and I felt like I was laying on a cloud

933
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:59.090
and I realized it was part of my neck.
Jesus,

934
00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:04.060
how fucking cranky am I when I get off of Goddamn plane?
Um,

935
00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:08.630
anyways,
I was a good boy out in Columbus as far as [inaudible] goes.

936
00:59:08.631 --> 00:59:13.330
I did not booze as far as eating goes.
I did all right.
You know,

937
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:13.910
you know,

938
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:17.000
it's so fucking funny is when you go to the Goddamn Midwest and you try to ask

939
00:59:17.001 --> 00:59:21.700
people,
where can I get something healthy to eat like that?

940
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:25.400
Like there's no such thing as healthy food in the Midwest.

941
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.520
They don't even fucking understand it.
You know,

942
00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:33.650
all they know how to do is to have some big block headed fucking blonde haired

943
00:59:33.651 --> 00:59:38.150
kid come out of their goddamn wife's fucking Twat.

944
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:40.520
Right.
They don't even raise them.

945
00:59:40.521 --> 00:59:44.420
They just send them out in a fucking cornfields and just,
just have the kid,

946
00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:47.900
the kid grazes until these fucking 16.
All right.

947
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:50.900
Then they signed him up for pop Warner fucking football.

948
00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:56.320
They can't even find a helmet to fit his big fucking big 10 goddamn butcher

949
00:59:56.601 --> 01:00:01.520
block of a fucking head.
Right.
And then what happens?

950
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:04.190
Some piece of shit can't beat him.
So what do they do?

951
01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:06.890
They fucking crack one of the crack back block,

952
01:00:06.891 --> 01:00:11.510
whatever the fuck they take his fucking knees out.
Alright,

953
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:16.760
his dreams over.
He's not going to block for Jim Plunkett.

954
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.770
It's fucking over.
So then what?

955
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.030
He gets a job at a fucking hotel desk in there.
I come walking in,

956
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:28.190
you know the fucking Pussy,
California boy now going,
oh,

957
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.710
excuse me,
is there a place to get something healthy?

958
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.900
And these fucking people there,
their eyes cross.

959
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.370
I see this all I say so you know,
I'm really craving a steak desert.

960
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:40.640
Is there a place to get a steak?
And I don't mean like an Applebees steak,

961
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:44.420
you know what I mean?
I'm talking cloth Napkins.
I'm talking,
you know,

962
01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:49.421
somebody related to a Rockefeller sitting at the bar sipping on some goddamn old

963
01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:53.990
booze talking to a broad 70 years younger than him.
That's,

964
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:57.260
that's the kind of fucking place I want to go to.
All right.

965
01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:02.620
That's what I want to go to.
And you know what,
this fucking Goddamn idiots said.

966
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:06.890
He sends me to some fucking barbecue shack.
I'm walking towards it like,
you know,

967
01:01:06.891 --> 01:01:07.521
I don't have a car.

968
01:01:07.521 --> 01:01:12.380
So I'm walking around the hotel and as I'm walking towards the complex,

969
01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:16.400
he told me to go to one of the first red flags I saw was a neon sign.

970
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:17.541
All right.

971
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:21.440
We got any steak eaters out there who listened to this fucking podcast?
Yeah,

972
01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:25.460
Dee Dee like a quality steak.
Do you like going to a quality place?

973
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.410
Exactly.
Now have you ever seen a fucking neon sign?

974
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.300
Neon signage?

975
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.790
There's Peter Luger's have neon signage.
I don't think so.
Huh?

976
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.320
Smith and Willinsky now it's always supposed to look stuffy.

977
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:47.480
It's supposed to look like this politicians in there doing fucking dirty

978
01:01:47.481 --> 01:01:50.600
backdoor deals for fucking defense contracts.

979
01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:52.940
That's what it's supposed to look like.
All right.

980
01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:59.960
Fucking guys in suits.
That's what it's supposed to look like.

981
01:01:59.961 --> 01:02:01.850
And I come walking into this and uh,
and you know,

982
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:04.850
I don't have enough time before the show,
so I just say fuck it.

983
01:02:04.851 --> 01:02:05.900
And I go over there,
right.

984
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:08.660
And I walked into this barbecue joint and if you guys have listened to this

985
01:02:08.661 --> 01:02:12.710
podcast before,
you realize I fucking hate barbecue.
I don't like it.

986
01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:17.600
It doesn't taste good.
I think the sauce is just their way of,
of,

987
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:22.530
of covering up the fact that you're eating a very poor cut of meat,

988
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:24.023
you know,

989
01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:28.650
eating the fucking Cartlidge out of a Goddamn oxen or whatever the hell they do.

990
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:33.750
The pig ears sandwich is it really did you get all the cartilage in there?

991
01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:37.860
You fucking moron.
No wonder you got to slather it with all that smoked Hickory,

992
01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.640
whatever,
the fireworks,
it actually isn't.
Then when you cook it with whatever,

993
01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.670
with all the barbecue sauce.
So I go in there and you know,

994
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:48.240
and I'm fucking grumbling like the Goddamn fucking old man I am.

995
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.250
So I open up the menu and I just,
you know,
something just pops out at me.

996
01:02:53.251 --> 01:02:56.460
It's just pulled pork.
They got some uh,

997
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.720
some Broccoli and some beans and I say,
fuck it.
You know,

998
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.670
he's cute girl comes over,
right?

999
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.730
Like the round his tits I've seen in a long time.

1000
01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:09.760
It was fucking that perfectly fucking round and they weren't fake.

1001
01:03:09.761 --> 01:03:12.420
And I was just kept looking at him going,
how are they so fucking around?

1002
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:13.590
And I was like,
you know what?

1003
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.160
She probably has on one of those fucking Hocus pocus bras.
That's what it is.

1004
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.580
She's probably got an eight cup,
possibly a B Cup.

1005
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.260
And I don't know what the fuck they're doing.
They're padded.
But you know,

1006
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.360
still it was fun to look at.
She,

1007
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:33.000
she had one of those bras that I think Doug Henning made and um,

1008
01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:37.410
masters of illusion,
Doug Henning,
um,
he's a magician.

1009
01:03:37.411 --> 01:03:40.230
Everybody with a big space in between his teeth.

1010
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.220
Like that fucking guy used to play for the giants who's now on television,

1011
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.790
who had a failed Sitcom and I can never remember his fucking name.

1012
01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.560
Yeah,
you ever had something like that?
You just can't remember the fucking name.

1013
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:57.360
And the same facial hair is Rosie Greer.
What the fuck is his name?

1014
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.120
One of the great defense events of all time broke the sack record.

1015
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:06.570
Remember that when fucking Brett Farve curled up into the fetal position,

1016
01:04:06.571 --> 01:04:11.040
because they were friends,
the fuck is his name.
He plays for the goddamn giants.

1017
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:17.820
Ah,
Shit.
The fuck I keep thinking Richard Seymour.

1018
01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.590
I know that's the guy that patriots shouldn't have traded the fuck is his name

1019
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.950
begins with an s.
There's an s in there somewhere.

1020
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.700
That guy could fucking,

1021
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:33.630
he could spit a walnut at you between his two front teeth.

1022
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:37.350
That even opened in his goddamn mouth.
Um,
anyway,

1023
01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:40.650
so I go in there and I fucking order that shit and I'm just looking at this girl

1024
01:04:40.651 --> 01:04:42.150
with their round tits,
right?

1025
01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.780
And she brings his stuff over and they got this little,
you know,

1026
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.410
they got the Kansas City,
which is a sweet,
that's a sweet,
sweet or one.

1027
01:04:49.411 --> 01:04:52.980
And then you got Carolina's more vinegar base and then we got,

1028
01:04:52.981 --> 01:04:57.030
we got the fucking Mexican one that's going to make your eyes water and you nose

1029
01:04:57.031 --> 01:05:01.360
run.
And then they had one other one,
the pussy one.
Right?
So I go with the kids,

1030
01:05:01.361 --> 01:05:02.700
a city one,
and I gotta tell you,

1031
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:06.600
it was one of the best fucking meals I've had in a long time.
It was apps.

1032
01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:10.770
The pork was absolutely delicious.
I loved it.

1033
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:14.520
The beans were phenomenal.
The Broccoli,
of course,

1034
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:16.920
had been steaming since they opened a,

1035
01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:22.240
because nobody in the Midwest eats vegetables.
They're horrible people,
man.

1036
01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:25.180
They all got big heads and block Colin's,
you know,

1037
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:28.330
that's why they play that smash mouth football.

1038
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.420
They're not going to use a spread off fence.
They're all fucking clogged up.

1039
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:39.370
Ah,
just fucking around people.
I'm just fucking around.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

1040
01:05:39.371 --> 01:05:43.450
I'm going on adrenaline here.
All right.
I'm going on adrenaline.
That's all I got.

1041
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.340
That's all I got this week.
So I actually,
I,
I,

1042
01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:48.750
that's the one time when I didn't eat well and uh,

1043
01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:52.240
we're going to talk about food this week.
I went to fucking Pinette,
Panorama,

1044
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:55.840
Panorama,
fucking Panera bread,
whatever the fuck you call it.

1045
01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:00.340
Went in there and I got a breakfast sandwich.
Um,
hi.

1046
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:04.060
Sarah can help you down here,
sir.
Yes.
Thank you sir.
Come down to this registered,

1047
01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:06.970
sir.
Thank you,
sir.
Hi Sir.
Can I help you sir?

1048
01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:12.090
One of those places where it's like,
did somebody drug you?
You know,

1049
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:16.600
did Alec Baldwin of Panera bread come in and scream fuck you at you.

1050
01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:20.850
You know the whole Glen Gary,
Glen Ross,
and now you're out here with,
with,

1051
01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:25.480
you know,
just trying to be all fucking happy
stepping.
You're not dad happy.

1052
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.560
So anyway,
sir,
can I help you?
Sarah,
Sarah can help you down here.

1053
01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:32.410
You don't have the next person down here,
sir.
Can you down come down here sir.

1054
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.920
So I go down.
There I go.
Let me get a,
let me get a breakfast sandwich.
Okay.

1055
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:39.100
We have our choice between egg and cheese,
egg,
cheese and sausage.
Your egg,

1056
01:06:39.101 --> 01:06:41.770
cheese and bacon.
I go,
let me get the egg and cheese.
What kind of bread?

1057
01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:45.820
Kind of bread you got?
What'd you get the hickory smoke.
We got the salmon flat.

1058
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:48.880
Fuck it.
Just give me a week.
Okay,
sir.
There's no reason to curse,
right?

1059
01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:51.130
So I get the wheat and uh,

1060
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:56.020
they just microwave this shit.
I don't know.
It was one of the most,
uh,

1061
01:06:56.021 --> 01:06:59.410
it was almost like a joke sandwich,
like a prop sandwich,

1062
01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:03.850
like the kind of thing that would be sitting on a plate in the background and

1063
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:08.610
that old show.
Uh,
what was it?
Peewee's playhouse.
Peewees funhouse

1064
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:11.170
peewees uh,

1065
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.610
let's give some kids some acid and invite a pedophile over whatever the fuck his

1066
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:19.600
show was called.
I don't know.
See adrenaline one doesn't always work.
That was a,

1067
01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:24.190
that was a shit sandwich and the story was even shittier.
But anyways,

1068
01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:28.810
this is the fucking podcast for this week.
I need help from you guys.
All right.

1069
01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:34.000
Uh,
I went out and I bought some Ram for my computer.

1070
01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:37.930
My whole do it yourself kick.
All right.
I know.

1071
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:42.310
I could've gone down to the apple store and had one of those fucking nerds,

1072
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:47.740
that Goddamn body odor walking around with the nerve.
They have,
you know,

1073
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.580
genius written on their shirt,
right?

1074
01:07:51.581 --> 01:07:55.030
With their buddy Holly glasses and that type of shit.
And I'm like,

1075
01:07:55.031 --> 01:07:58.300
how fucking hard can it be to put ram in a computer?

1076
01:07:58.301 --> 01:08:00.930
That sounds pretty intimidating,
doesn't it?
Well,
you know what,

1077
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:03.790
I went on Youtube and evidently it's pretty fucking easy.

1078
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:07.690
Take a goddamn nickel out of your pocket,
right?

1079
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.400
You unscrew the fucking battery for some reason you,
you a,

1080
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:16.430
you turn right to loosen it.
You know,
lefty Loosey tighty you after and go right,

1081
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:20.090
pop out the fucking battery and there's like two screws.

1082
01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.410
You remove a band and then there's two switches and the things pop out like

1083
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:27.020
toast.
You take out the old one,
you put in the higher one,

1084
01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.590
he slammed that fucker back in.
You used to the reverse process and you're done.

1085
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.000
But this is the problem.
You need special screwdrivers.

1086
01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.840
All right?
You need precision screwdrivers.

1087
01:08:38.841 --> 01:08:41.900
And I went down to fucking home depot and they don't have any small enough.

1088
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:45.230
So now that I have is insulted.
All the tech nerds out there,

1089
01:08:45.231 --> 01:08:48.560
where the fuck can I get these screwdrivers?
I have a Mac.
Oh,

1090
01:08:48.561 --> 01:08:51.260
s x or that 10 I have no idea.

1091
01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:56.560
Version 10.5 0.8 I need some precision screwdrivers to unscrew fucking three

1092
01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:01.790
four bolts.
You know,
I feel like I'm going to,

1093
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.850
I'm going to put a fucking Hammy and my laptop.
It's a joke.

1094
01:09:04.851 --> 01:09:05.960
You guys should go on Youtube.

1095
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.200
Go on Youtube and check or go on the M podcast cause we'll have this v.com m

1096
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.400
podcast.com we'll have that video up there.
Just look up youtube videos,

1097
01:09:16.401 --> 01:09:18.500
how to add ram to your Mac.

1098
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.490
And this guy will show you how to do the whole fucking thing.
It's a joke.

1099
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.110
All right.
This is my new kick.
I'm sick of these fucking guys with their Dickies.

1100
01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:28.550
Come walking into my apartment,

1101
01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:31.370
charging me all this God damn money and not one of them.

1102
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:35.450
Seems like there are any smarter than I am.

1103
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:39.830
So basically they just have information,
information.

1104
01:09:39.831 --> 01:09:42.950
Who are the new number two?
Who is number one?

1105
01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:48.170
You are number six.
I am not.
I am a free man.

1106
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:54.080
I'm sorry.
Iron maiden flashback.
Um,
yeah,

1107
01:09:54.081 --> 01:09:57.260
I'm sick of these guys coming in here charging me all his fucking money.

1108
01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.450
I want to learn how to do shit myself.

1109
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:02.450
I'm still trying to get the balls up to replace the trim on my doors.

1110
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:05.870
I've gotten to the point where I've watched enough youtube videos where I

1111
01:10:05.871 --> 01:10:09.110
definitely know how to get the shit off.

1112
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.910
Like most weekend warriors.
Oh,

1113
01:10:13.911 --> 01:10:17.180
I can start the fucking job but bring it on home,

1114
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:21.380
you know it's going to be hilarious and or great for my act is when I actually

1115
01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:25.280
tried to do this shit and fail and then I have to call another guy over to

1116
01:10:25.281 --> 01:10:28.220
finish it because I wasn't man enough to figure it out myself.

1117
01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:32.930
And it'll be emasculating.
But you know what?
I'll learn.
I'll stay.

1118
01:10:32.931 --> 01:10:36.500
I don't give a fuck.
I don't have any God damn pride at this point.
I'll,
I'll,

1119
01:10:36.501 --> 01:10:39.800
I'll stand right there and figure out,
look over his shoulder.

1120
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.600
I'll be that annoying guy.
Huh?

1121
01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:47.030
Are you blue collar guys out there who fix shit?
I did that for a minute.

1122
01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.440
I used to finish basements.

1123
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:54.430
You know in the fucking worst job you could ever do is you'd go into somebody's

1124
01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:56.030
fucking house,

1125
01:10:57.650 --> 01:11:02.300
you'd go into finish their basement in the fucking cunt would be sitting down

1126
01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:06.290
there in the basement watching you do the entire project.

1127
01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.750
So anytime you made a bad cut,
anytime you know all,

1128
01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.040
you know all the bullshit that's behind the walls,

1129
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.230
there's a lot of knee and elbow work and they sitting there freaking out.

1130
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.540
What does that,
is that,
is that going to be a pro?

1131
01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:23.470
Like when you go to put the fucking installation and you know
what?

1132
01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.890
I can't remember the fucking measurements.
I was,
I was a grunt.

1133
01:11:25.891 --> 01:11:28.320
I just handed the dude this shit and I remember that like the,

1134
01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:32.970
the fucking installation would go like 80% up the wall and then you just reach

1135
01:11:32.971 --> 01:11:36.180
over and break off some more insulation and stuff it in there and the fucking

1136
01:11:36.181 --> 01:11:38.160
Goddamn broads would get so pissed.

1137
01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:42.840
Well what about that little space in between?
It's not gonna matter.

1138
01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:48.180
Why are you here?
Do you think we're going to steal your fucking laundry?

1139
01:11:48.181 --> 01:11:52.830
Get outta here.
The fuck out of here.
That was a bit late then.

1140
01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:55.580
You know what's funny is you just sit there and,
and the,

1141
01:11:55.581 --> 01:12:00.581
the fucking shit that would go on between me and the other person I was

1142
01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.390
finishing the basement with,
you know,

1143
01:12:03.391 --> 01:12:06.840
when we realized the person wasn't leaving do they do,
would just be like,
yeah,

1144
01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.240
hand me the nail gun and you know you do that shit where,

1145
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:13.260
where like the Douche is behind you,
right?

1146
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:18.060
It's basically he's talking to me,
I can see his face and over his shoulder.

1147
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:21.840
I see the person who owns the fucking house and he turned him,
he'd be like,

1148
01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.640
hey me that nail gun.
And you know,

1149
01:12:23.641 --> 01:12:27.150
his eyes would be wide and his eyebrows would be down,
you know,
that look like,

1150
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:31.200
ah fuck.
Ah,
Shit.
Um,

1151
01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:34.430
so anyways,
that's probably what's going to end up happening to me.

1152
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.550
So this is the Monday morning podcast.

1153
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:41.370
They subdued version of the Monday morning podcasts for November 15th.

1154
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:46.080
And guess what?
Guess what everybody does?
I stutter through this fucking thing.

1155
01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.570
It is November 15th and old.

1156
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:52.050
Billy boy here has got 30 days and no Busan,

1157
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:57.090
no boots,
not a drop of fucking booze.

1158
01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.350
How do you like that for fucking willpower?
It's not that impressive as well.

1159
01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:05.910
Fucking means a lot to me.
I was actually on the plane reading,
rolling stone.

1160
01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:10.380
M and M is on the cover and he was talking about two and a half years of being

1161
01:13:10.381 --> 01:13:11.340
sober.
And I was thinking,

1162
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:16.200
that's pretty fucking amazing considering the most I've been able to go 75 days.

1163
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.580
You know,
I,
granted,

1164
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:23.130
I don't feel like I have an addictive personality.

1165
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:26.070
I just don't want to have a huge fat head.

1166
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:32.550
Although I could use the side of my neck for a pillow when I get on the Goddamn

1167
01:13:32.551 --> 01:13:36.510
plane.
Um,
so anyways,

1168
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.300
this is the podcast for this week.
Last week,

1169
01:13:39.301 --> 01:13:44.301
I actually began a new segment here on the podcast a inadvertently.

1170
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:47.041
Um,
when I,

1171
01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:51.630
when I brought up that movie over the edge and when those kids right in the

1172
01:13:51.631 --> 01:13:55.530
school and they locked the police and the parents and the teachers because they

1173
01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.990
were having that meeting in the cafeteria,

1174
01:13:57.991 --> 01:14:02.550
they lock them in the fucking cafeteria and then they start vandalizing the

1175
01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:07.551
school and the cop runs up and he's tugging on the fucking chain link fence or

1176
01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:12.090
whatever the fuck they put up and he can't get out.
And this chick,
big chick,

1177
01:14:12.091 --> 01:14:15.400
like six foot two comes running by with this giant globe.

1178
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:20.500
She runs by the camera and then comes running back,
looks at the cop and goes,

1179
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:24.580
ate it.
You stink.
And pig.
What are the,

1180
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:29.200
what are the most fucking horrific lines I've ever seen in a fucking movie?

1181
01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:32.650
And that ended up inadvertently creating a new segment,

1182
01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.760
best lines in awful movies.
And uh,

1183
01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:41.710
I got one for Ya.
Uh,
it is called shark attack.

1184
01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.620
I can't tell you what the line is.
You have to watch somebody sent this in.

1185
01:14:44.621 --> 01:14:48.070
I should say it's a shark attack.

1186
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:52.210
Three just,
just search.
We're going to have all of these,

1187
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:57.130
all of the ship shit.
Sorry up on.
I'm actually apologizing cause I didn't curse.

1188
01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:01.240
Sorry.
I said ship instead of shit.
Um,

1189
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:04.840
we're gonna have all these videos up on the [inaudible] podcast.com.
All right.

1190
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:07.360
But for some reason,
if you want to look it up yourself,

1191
01:15:07.361 --> 01:15:11.830
if you're a control freak,
I understand that.
Go ahead.
Make your life harder.

1192
01:15:11.831 --> 01:15:12.664
I don't give a fuck.

1193
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:18.090
Go on Youtube and look up shark attack three famous line and I challenge you to

1194
01:15:19.601 --> 01:15:22.840
be silenced after you fucking hear what this guy says.

1195
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:27.460
I think I just said what it just,
it's the most,

1196
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:31.810
one of the most fucked up lines I've ever heard in a movie.

1197
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:35.710
And you know that that's the challenge.

1198
01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:39.850
Give me a line worse than this fucking line in shark attack.
Three famous line.

1199
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:45.160
And also I was kind of surfing,
I started surfing bad movies cause I,

1200
01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:50.161
I got into that part on Youtube and a a definitely must rent a definite rental

1201
01:15:51.641 --> 01:15:53.980
for me.
I'm taking a month off here,

1202
01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:59.800
coming up around Christmas is a silent night,
deadly night,

1203
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:04.300
part five.
I have to watch that fucking movie.
Um,

1204
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:05.920
there's another great one.

1205
01:16:05.921 --> 01:16:09.040
Just just go on Youtube and fucking just look at the movie.

1206
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:13.960
Just look at the trailer for that fucking movie.
You know,

1207
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:16.480
somebody asked me the other days like,
you know,
as an actor,

1208
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:20.740
when you're in a bad movie,
do you think you realize it?
You know,

1209
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:25.510
and I think on a movie like that,
you'd do.
But the scary thing is,

1210
01:16:25.511 --> 01:16:30.460
is I think on anything else you don't because you're so at the fucking mercy of

1211
01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:33.970
the music,
of the edits and all that type of shit.
You just pray to God.

1212
01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:34.893
You got somebody good.

1213
01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:37.990
That's what I learned in date night when I delivered eight fucking lines.

1214
01:16:37.991 --> 01:16:41.080
Listen to me talking like I'm in an inside the actor's fucking studio.

1215
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.380
I had eight lines more than a goddamn extra.

1216
01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:48.700
And here I am talking like I'm a fucking professional.
Why do I have the hiccups?

1217
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.170
Um,
so anyways,
there you go.
People,

1218
01:16:53.171 --> 01:16:57.040
there's 21 minutes where I didn't talk about sports.
All right,

1219
01:16:57.041 --> 01:17:01.180
so be prepared to roll your fucking eyes.
All right,

1220
01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:05.800
let's talk NFL football real quick here.
I went one in three this week,

1221
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.930
betting against the spread.

1222
01:17:07.931 --> 01:17:11.660
I got my fucking ass handed a fucking ass handed to me.

1223
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.240
I knew the second year,
you know,
gamblers out there,

1224
01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:18.170
you know like those certain weeks where you just,
you just can't see a winner.

1225
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:21.380
Some weeks you get excited,
you're like,
oh fuck,
this is easy man.

1226
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:23.980
Like that that they'll definitely cover.
They're definitely covered.

1227
01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.093
Course half of them don't,

1228
01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.680
but I'm not even talking about whether you win or you lose,

1229
01:17:27.681 --> 01:17:31.010
but you have that excitement like,
yeah,
I can fucking see it.
Right.

1230
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:34.640
You know,
you're like Def,
the black dude who's,

1231
01:17:34.641 --> 01:17:36.770
who's constantly shaving his head and Predator.

1232
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:41.690
I see you over there in them trees,
right?
You're looking at it like that.

1233
01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:46.040
This week I was more like Tom Cruise in top gun.
You know,

1234
01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:49.790
when he loses his edge and he's going,
yeah,
Nah,
it's,
it's no good.
It's no good.

1235
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:53.420
You know,
turn the fucking playing around you fucking fag.
What are you doing?

1236
01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.670
All right.
And he says,
that's no good.
It's not good.
I can't,

1237
01:17:55.820 --> 01:18:00.530
I can't see anything that,
that's how I was this week.
I just,
you know,

1238
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.560
I looked at the bills and lines that I just didn't like.

1239
01:18:03.561 --> 01:18:07.460
It hated that fucking game.
You know,

1240
01:18:07.461 --> 01:18:12.380
those two Goddamn Jekyll and Hyde teams,
who the fuck's gonna show up?
You know?

1241
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:14.120
So I stayed away from that one.

1242
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:19.300
I looked at fucking Miami and the Ravens and something was telling me Chad

1243
01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:21.050
Pennington,
Chad Pennington,

1244
01:18:21.051 --> 01:18:24.650
but I was like against Ray Lewis and fucking Ralph Nader,

1245
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:26.540
whatever the fuck the name of this quarterback is.

1246
01:18:26.541 --> 01:18:30.890
If for some reason I can't remember,
Edie Falco,
Edie Falco,

1247
01:18:30.891 --> 01:18:34.400
what the fuck is his name?
Flaco Joe Flacco.

1248
01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:41.030
Um,
so I step my gut told me Miami,
but I didn't have the balls.

1249
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:45.500
I didn't have the balls to pull the trigger.
So I said,
fuck that one.
All right,

1250
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:49.670
so I bet Tampa Bay,
because they've been working for me and they covered.

1251
01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:52.460
And then I just picked two games where I just couldn't,

1252
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:55.640
I couldn't see a fucking winner.
I bet that,
uh,

1253
01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:58.910
the Houston Texans against Jacksonville,

1254
01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:03.710
I was getting a point and a half.
I said,
ah,
God damn.
Jekyll and Hyde,

1255
01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:08.390
Jacksonville,
who's going to show up?
Texans have been consistent.
Fuck it.

1256
01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.120
They beat the colts.
I'm going with the Texas.
All right.

1257
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.860
Lose that God damn fucking bet on that Hail Mary Pass.

1258
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:17.930
All right.
But that happens.

1259
01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:23.120
And then I looked at the Arizona Seattle game and I picked Arizona and I said,

1260
01:19:23.121 --> 01:19:26.690
no,
wait,
Seattle,
Seattle.
I say,
yeah,
Pete,

1261
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.570
Carol's not a fucking NFL coach.
And I picked Arizona as I was saying,
Nah,

1262
01:19:31.571 --> 01:19:35.120
not Seattle.
So I fucking lose that one.
And this was the worst one.

1263
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:41.590
Pittsburgh plays my fucking New England patriots and I was so Goddamn fucking

1264
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:44.060
depressed.
After that Brown's laws,

1265
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:48.950
the Steelers are at home and they're only given fucking four and a half.

1266
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:52.520
They got that great defense.
They got Ben Roethlisberger,

1267
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.360
Joe fucking cool won two super bowls

1268
01:19:58.190 --> 01:20:00.710
that held a lot of water with me.
So I said,
fuck it.

1269
01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:03.950
I'm taking the Goddamn Steelers.
I bet against my own fucking team.

1270
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:10.080
And I lost that one.
I was my Sunday night show,
um,

1271
01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:13.590
at,
at the funny bone and Columbus and I get off stage and I'm going,

1272
01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:18.510
it's gotta be like 17,
three or 17 to nine or something.

1273
01:20:18.511 --> 01:20:21.900
Pittsburgh and I get off stage and it's fucking 10 to nothing patriots.

1274
01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.960
And I was a,
you gotta be shitting me.
Right.

1275
01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:28.830
You know that sinking feeling you like,
you gotta be kidding me.
Really,
really.

1276
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:32.010
I lost faith in my own fucking team.
I'm running to be able to enjoy this.

1277
01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:35.880
Actually,
I still did enjoy it.
It's kind of a win win for me.

1278
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.330
Either the Patriots get their fucking asses kicked,
right?

1279
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.330
But it helps my gambling record or they go out and win.

1280
01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.810
But the thing is is I didn't bet on the patriots,
so I can't brag this week.

1281
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:50.610
I can't even bring up the fact that we fucking on the Pittsburgh Steelers.

1282
01:20:50.611 --> 01:20:54.540
We are seven and two against those motherfuckers.
The last nine games,

1283
01:20:55.050 --> 01:21:00.050
the six time world champion that the fucking Yankees of the NFL,

1284
01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:05.190
the Boston Celtics of the NFL,
the Montreal Canadians,

1285
01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:10.110
the ones with the most fucking titles.
We are seven and two.
And I,

1286
01:21:10.111 --> 01:21:12.990
for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.
I remember a few,

1287
01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:17.280
like a month ago when all the jet fans had their stupid green chest hair

1288
01:21:17.281 --> 01:21:21.240
standing at attention and I was saying that Rothenberger hadn't come back yet.

1289
01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.540
And that's the team that's going to kick the shit out of you or until you beat

1290
01:21:24.541 --> 01:21:27.020
that fucking team that,
that's the team that I believed in.

1291
01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:32.850
What the fuck happened?
I don't know.
So anyways,

1292
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:34.380
and uh,

1293
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:39.380
being in Columbus actually got to watch the browns and the jets game and I,

1294
01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.230
you know what?

1295
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:44.610
I don't fucking what the browns like Cleveland fans,

1296
01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:48.000
I don't know what the fuck you guys did to the sports gods.

1297
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:51.270
That's another one of those fucking towns.

1298
01:21:51.271 --> 01:21:55.410
It's just like they just can't lose a game.
They have to fuck it up.

1299
01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.680
You know?
By the way,

1300
01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:02.520
can I get any credit on this podcast for that stat that I created?

1301
01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:05.400
Remember I told you,
I said Mark,
uh,

1302
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:09.810
fucking Sanchez leads the League in drop inner dropped interceptions.

1303
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:14.310
Any fantasy football nerds want to start keeping track of that.

1304
01:22:14.311 --> 01:22:15.840
I've never seen anything like it.

1305
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:20.730
It's like he's got a little remote control and the football that when defenders

1306
01:22:20.731 --> 01:22:24.840
catch it with both hands,
it's,
I don't know what he does.
Like he's,
he's got like,

1307
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:29.750
he turns it into a knuckle ball,
that fucking piece of shit.
I'm joking.

1308
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.300
He's actually a good quarterback.
That fucking guy,
he threw a pick.

1309
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.900
He throws a pic.
I could have caught the ball.

1310
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:39.990
It hit this dude in both fucking hands,

1311
01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:45.000
but because Sanchez throws it,
the dude just goes wall.
Hey.

1312
01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:48.150
He took it like you would think it was a hot potato.

1313
01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:52.320
Just sort of throw it past himself and then he's like,
Whoa,
well no,
wait,

1314
01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:55.730
I think I want to catch it now.
And at that point the jet Diff,

1315
01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:59.790
a wide receiver wisely slapped it to the fucking ground.

1316
01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:03.870
You know,
I don't know.
In defense of the jets,

1317
01:23:03.871 --> 01:23:07.270
I mean they did miss three field goals,
so they should have won it regulation,

1318
01:23:07.271 --> 01:23:09.970
but Jesus Christ,
they opened the fucking door.

1319
01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:13.150
That's what scares me about the jets is they fucking lose games and they still,

1320
01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:18.340
when they got luck,
be a lady to night.
They got there on their side.

1321
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:20.650
And you know what Chad fans,

1322
01:23:20.651 --> 01:23:24.640
cause I know you have no idea what it's like to win a championship.
All right?

1323
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:27.760
That's what you need.
When you start saying shit like that,

1324
01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:31.090
that's the kind of shit that should get you excited and scares the shit out of

1325
01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:35.260
me because if you motherfuckers are actually going to be a halfway decent team

1326
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:38.260
and the people are going to drop interceptions,

1327
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.360
I mean how do you stop them

1328
01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.190
even when they're trying to lose a fucking game that's still winning games.

1329
01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:52.510
But jet fans,
you got to admit how fucking insane is that running back.

1330
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.730
I told you that guy who's,
I keep forgetting his name,

1331
01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:59.260
the guy with the dodge ram grill on the front of his fucking helmet,

1332
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:05.170
who do fuck was talking about his arms were saying that's why he fumbled the

1333
01:24:05.171 --> 01:24:08.140
ball.
Oh that motherfucker,
they will write and feel gold.

1334
01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:14.230
Just step out of bounds,
protect the fucking ball,
whatever.

1335
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:15.430
Here's my prediction.

1336
01:24:15.431 --> 01:24:19.640
I think Cleveland very quickly is going to get over Lebron leaving and they're

1337
01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:23.830
going to become a football town once again.
And,
uh,

1338
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:28.890
I am all for it because I fucking loved the Cleveland browns in the 80s.

1339
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.100
I loved those teams.
Brian Sipe,
Bernie Kosar.

1340
01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:34.571
Ah,

1341
01:24:34.571 --> 01:24:37.930
that fucking orange Hellman used to play in municipal stadium and it was always

1342
01:24:37.931 --> 01:24:42.820
like fucking minus 60 degrees,
uh,
those games with a shit,

1343
01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.620
those games with a fucking shit,
um,
cardiac kids.
Right.

1344
01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.760
I don't know.
You know what?
I actually get excited when a team that,

1345
01:24:51.761 --> 01:24:55.390
that's been bad for a long time,
but I actually used to have a winning tradition.

1346
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:59.650
Like the browns were the shit in the 50s,
right through the 60s.

1347
01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.520
You know,
that's something I should've looked up.
I should've looked up.
Uh,

1348
01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:09.310
how many NFL titles that they,
uh,
that they want isn't that fucked up that they,

1349
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.130
they don't count those.
You know what I mean?

1350
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:17.910
Like how the Pittsburgh Steelers are a top the league with a measly six

1351
01:25:18.431 --> 01:25:20.110
championships.
It's not a measly,

1352
01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:22.240
because they've won it in the last 40 something years,

1353
01:25:22.241 --> 01:25:26.110
but like six championships is all it takes for you to get to the top of the

1354
01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:30.760
league.
You know,
it's fucking 27 in baseball,

1355
01:25:30.761 --> 01:25:34.240
17 in basketball.
I always forget what the Canadians got.

1356
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:38.470
The Canadians got like fucking,
uh,
they got at least 22,

1357
01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.460
something like that.
Jesus Christ's I'm fucking French.

1358
01:25:42.461 --> 01:25:45.940
Do she's going to correct me on that one.
All in capital letters,

1359
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:52.390
um,
squiggly lines over different vowels.
Yeah,

1360
01:25:52.391 --> 01:25:54.220
I don't why,
why don't they come?
Anybody know why?

1361
01:25:54.221 --> 01:25:56.850
Why don't they count those titles?
You know,
why don't they,

1362
01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.350
they count like a mean,

1363
01:25:59.351 --> 01:26:03.560
would it be nice if eagle fans could actually have like 1960 or the fuck they

1364
01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:08.561
had at least some sort of championship banner hanging on top of a,

1365
01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:13.070
the fucking a Blimpie subway,
sandwich.com stadium,
whatever.

1366
01:26:13.071 --> 01:26:17.540
Wherever the fuck they play.
Why don't they went out?
They count those.

1367
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:20.720
Does anybody know?
Is this even Fuckin remotely interesting?

1368
01:26:20.721 --> 01:26:25.280
Let's get to do the obscure sports stat of the week.
Somebody sent this shit in,

1369
01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:25.761
you know,

1370
01:26:25.761 --> 01:26:30.761
last week I started this topic by saying how the last time sports teams in St

1371
01:26:32.031 --> 01:26:34.410
Louis lost the world series last,

1372
01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:39.710
the Stanley Cup final lost a Superbowl and an NBA title way back when they had

1373
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:45.970
the Saint Louis Hawks before they moved to Atlanta the last four times they've

1374
01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:47.630
lost in the finals.

1375
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:50.600
Last Times they've lost in the finals and all four sports is what I'm trying to

1376
01:26:50.601 --> 01:26:55.250
say.
We're all from teams,
all at the hands of teams from Boston.

1377
01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:01.100
There's your obscure staff from last week and this is the one from this week.

1378
01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:06.220
All right.
This is the most fucked up thing I've seen in awhile.

1379
01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.910
Evidently back in 1973.
All right.

1380
01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:15.800
The glam rock was going on,
right?
Let's give you a little historical perspective.

1381
01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:20.390
I think this is right during Watergate.
When did Nixon get bounced out?

1382
01:27:20.391 --> 01:27:23.510
Like 74
that's right.

1383
01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:27.890
Cause he wanted 72 and then the fallout was in 73 and then he was gone.

1384
01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:30.290
What else happened?

1385
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:34.640
And we got out of Vietnam as a year before we got out of Vietnam.
And,

1386
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.470
uh,
I know chicks are pretty hot back then.
You know,

1387
01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:44.060
that whole Mary Tyler Moore look,
and I was never in the Mary Tyler Moore.

1388
01:27:44.061 --> 01:27:46.160
She looked better on that show with that skinny drunk.

1389
01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:50.870
He used to fall over the Ottoman.
But Dick Van Dyke,

1390
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:55.340
um,
was the other ones,
the ones that did the guest stars and they had,

1391
01:27:55.341 --> 01:27:58.370
they had the fucking mini skirts,
mini skirts,
you know,

1392
01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:02.870
barely hanging over those fucking Harry muffs.
Um,
anyways,

1393
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:05.930
there's your historical perspective,
uh,

1394
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:10.990
to Yankee pitchers in 1973 I never heard of this traded their wives and kids,

1395
01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.170
they just switched off families.
And this is the story.

1396
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:23.210
According to the Daily News,
1973,
um,
Fort Lauderdale,
Florida.

1397
01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:27.590
March,
March,
March 5th,
Yankee Pitcher,

1398
01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:31.190
they go by their last names here because I guess,
you know,

1399
01:28:31.191 --> 01:28:34.400
people knew who the fuck they were.
Kekich K,
e,
k,
I,

1400
01:28:34.401 --> 01:28:39.401
C H and Maryland disclosed today that they had exchanged families several months

1401
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:44.540
ago.
Peterson moving in was Susan Keck.

1402
01:28:44.541 --> 01:28:49.541
Rich enter two daughters and Keck rich moving in with Maryland Peterson and her

1403
01:28:50.271 --> 01:28:51.200
two sons.

1404
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:56.660
The pitchers in separate talks said they decided to reveal the arrangement

1405
01:28:57.230 --> 01:29:00.830
because too many people knew about it.
Evidently everybody in baseball,

1406
01:29:00.831 --> 01:29:05.831
I mean you can't really keep a story like that quiet I guess all around the

1407
01:29:05.911 --> 01:29:08.610
fucking spring training.
Everybody was talking about the shit.

1408
01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:12.030
So they finally just went public with it.
So,
um,

1409
01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:14.520
they thought it was time to clear the air.

1410
01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:18.780
And the 31 year old Peterson confided that they hope that you won't make

1411
01:29:18.781 --> 01:29:23.100
anything sorted out of this according to Kekich.

1412
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:24.840
I'm sure I'm saying that wrong.

1413
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.980
Unless people know the full details that could turn out to be a nasty type
thing.

1414
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:34.280
Don't say this was wipe swapping wife swapping because it wasn't,

1415
01:29:34.590 --> 01:29:39.060
we didn't swap wives.
We swapped lives.
Ah,

1416
01:29:39.061 --> 01:29:43.620
Jesus Christ.
Look at this guy.
Fucking sprinkle in a bunch of sugar over it.
Um,

1417
01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:48.650
I guess technically he is right to how fucked up or their children check it.

1418
01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.070
You know,
your dad just taps out.
Yeah,
I'm Outta here.

1419
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:56.820
I don't want to be with your mom anymore.
And you know,
you know my best buddy,

1420
01:29:56.821 --> 01:30:00.000
he was always over here drinking beers.
Yeah,
he's going to be your dad now.

1421
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:03.060
He's going to be banging your mom when you hear that Moan and just,
no,

1422
01:30:03.061 --> 01:30:06.290
that's not me doing that work or right kids and uh,

1423
01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.730
I'm Outta here and uh,

1424
01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.590
I'm going to go fuck his wife and go raise his children.
Okay.

1425
01:30:14.190 --> 01:30:17.850
How does that sit with you?
Jesus Christ.
You want to talk them?

1426
01:30:17.851 --> 01:30:21.390
If they had daughters you want to talk about the easiest chicks to lose your

1427
01:30:21.391 --> 01:30:23.910
fucking virginity to are there you go right there.

1428
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:28.440
There they are lined them up fellas.
All right.

1429
01:30:28.441 --> 01:30:32.760
New Jersey where the forehead resided for four years requires simply that the

1430
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:36.960
parties proved separation for a year in order to file for divorce.

1431
01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:41.730
It's a no fault rule,
meaning no grounds are required.
You know,

1432
01:30:41.731 --> 01:30:46.731
what's amazing about this fucking story is how like that you could actually keep

1433
01:30:47.671 --> 01:30:50.870
something like this quiet for a,

1434
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:54.360
for a couple of months because if you ever tried to do any bullshit like this,

1435
01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:58.050
uh,
today,
I mean Jesus Christ,

1436
01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:02.790
three different 24 hour sports networks and ESPN alone,
the versus network,

1437
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.250
I mean then you get,
TMZ would jump on that would just TMZ late night talk shows.

1438
01:31:08.251 --> 01:31:12.400
They got like 58 of them now.
Oh my God,

1439
01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.380
we'll be over manager.

1440
01:31:13.381 --> 01:31:17.820
Ralph Houk said it was a situation that he could live with a,

1441
01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:21.780
that it would not rip apart his team and that it still had its best chance of

1442
01:31:21.781 --> 01:31:24.000
winning a pennant since 1964.

1443
01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:28.710
I always liked Ralph Hulk fucking keep it positive and just for the record,

1444
01:31:28.711 --> 01:31:33.711
they went 80 and 80 to two games of under 500 Jesus fucking Christ Jesus Christ.

1445
01:31:36.451 --> 01:31:40.650
How the fuck he is the top,
that obscure stat.
Does anybody notice that?

1446
01:31:40.651 --> 01:31:43.710
I've been stuttering more and more as this fucking podcast goes along.

1447
01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:48.660
The Sun is gradually going down.
I got 36 stutter and fucking minutes in here.

1448
01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.840
Hang on a second.
I gotta turn the light on so I can read here.
Hold on,

1449
01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.310
just stay there.
Don't freak out.

1450
01:31:56.030 --> 01:32:00.070
I'm not leaving you for somebody else's wife and family.
The street.

1451
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:06.790
How the fuck mean talk.
That was like the fallout of the,
the,

1452
01:32:07.710 --> 01:32:09.580
the free love man.

1453
01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.820
Society's rules man.
What does it mean?
You know what's funny is they,
they really,

1454
01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.310
um,
I saw a great documentary on,

1455
01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:23.340
on hippies is literally called hippies and it was awesome because one of the

1456
01:32:23.741 --> 01:32:24.341
former,

1457
01:32:24.341 --> 01:32:29.341
a hippy dudes was really honest where he just said he didn't like what was going

1458
01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:37.600
on and he rebelled against it,
which I totally fucking related to,

1459
01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:42.550
but he talked about living in those communes,
you know,

1460
01:32:42.551 --> 01:32:45.040
where they were going to start their own fucking churches and their own

1461
01:32:45.041 --> 01:32:48.400
education and everything and everybody shared everything.

1462
01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:54.180
And He came to the same conclusion that we all come to is that basically other

1463
01:32:54.671 --> 01:32:56.620
people are fucking irritating

1464
01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:00.700
and you want to get away from him.

1465
01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:04.030
And that's basically what happened at the commune,
at least for this guy.

1466
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:07.300
Like he was hanging out and have a free love.
And all this type of shit.

1467
01:33:07.570 --> 01:33:10.030
And after awhile you're just like,
oh my God,
I gotta,
I gotta get,

1468
01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.570
I gotta get the fuck away from these people,
you know?

1469
01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:17.770
So you really gotta hand it to the native Americans how they were able to live

1470
01:33:17.771 --> 01:33:20.300
like that and somehow,
uh,

1471
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:24.340
you know why that is of course is because they didn't realize they didn't

1472
01:33:24.341 --> 01:33:28.690
understand the concept of having an apartment much less a fucking door.

1473
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:33.040
Um,
all right.
That was pretty ignorant.
That's plow head.
Oh,
by the way,

1474
01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:36.130
I've really pissed off a lot of potheads evidently on my podcast.

1475
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:36.690
They think that I,

1476
01:33:36.690 --> 01:33:41.440
I am against smoking weed and then I'm trashing that whole fucking lifestyle.

1477
01:33:42.490 --> 01:33:46.870
Why don't you guys go take another hit off your fucking blunt and fucking relax.

1478
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:50.290
All right.
Just because I trashed that guy

1479
01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:55.600
who was a pot smoker.
I wasn't saying that weed was a bad thing.

1480
01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:59.830
All right.
At this point,
with those vaporizers that they have,

1481
01:34:00.190 --> 01:34:05.190
it's probably fucking 10 times healthier than sitting around drinking a six

1482
01:34:05.861 --> 01:34:10.840
pack.
I don't have a fucking problem.
I wasn't talking about smoking weed.

1483
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:13.630
I was,
I wasn't,
I was making fun of a loser.

1484
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:18.460
I was telling that woman that she was dating a fucking loser.
All right?
As a man,

1485
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:22.480
your job is to go out and fucking provide,
you know,

1486
01:34:22.630 --> 01:34:27.100
and when somebody breaks into your house not to shit yourself and to grab the

1487
01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:30.490
nearest blunt object and fucking go Braveheart or Ana,

1488
01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.990
that's what you supposed to do.
You know me,
I would shoot myself,

1489
01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:37.330
lock myself in the bathroom and call nine one one of course,

1490
01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:43.390
but I can provide God dammit.
That's what I got to fit fucking pit bull for.

1491
01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:48.970
Um,
speaking of that,
I watched no country for old men again,
man.

1492
01:34:48.970 --> 01:34:51.040
What a fucking awesome movie that is.

1493
01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:54.670
That is just absolutely phenomenal fucking movie.

1494
01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:57.800
It actually made me sad that we were in final descent.

1495
01:34:57.801 --> 01:35:00.900
That's how good that goddamn movie is.
Um,
but anyway,

1496
01:35:00.901 --> 01:35:05.030
so I just know that potheads I'm not making fun.
You know,

1497
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:09.260
if I make fun of some guy who's a booze bag,
booze bag,

1498
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:12.320
fucking losers sitting around drinking beer all day on the couch,

1499
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:16.580
that doesn't mean that I don't think that anybody should drink.

1500
01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.480
All right,
so fucking relax.

1501
01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:26.180
Jesus Christ.
I thought you got mellow when you smoke weed.
Um,

1502
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:30.710
anyways,
let's plow ahead.
Hey products.

1503
01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:34.370
Can you guys basically just admit that you want weed to be free just so you can

1504
01:35:34.371 --> 01:35:37.510
just sit around smoking it and not have to worry about anybody hassle in Ya,

1505
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:41.840
you know,
to use a classic Hippie word,

1506
01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.780
why can't you just admit that and stopped telling me about,

1507
01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:49.610
you know how the fucking declaration of independence was written on hemp and

1508
01:35:49.611 --> 01:35:53.960
all,
all these,
you know,
I mean Jesus Christ,

1509
01:35:53.961 --> 01:35:57.620
you can make a potted plant out of a 40 in empty 40 ounce.

1510
01:35:58.370 --> 01:36:01.220
I'm not going to sit there and act like I don't wish that I want to drink in

1511
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:05.990
public.
Right?
Dude,
my brain shut down seven minutes ago.

1512
01:36:05.991 --> 01:36:08.840
I don't even,
what the fuck I'm talking about?
I need to start reading again.

1513
01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:13.790
Overrated.
Underrated for this week,
everybody.
Um,
all right.

1514
01:36:13.791 --> 01:36:17.360
This guy said underrated banana pancake.

1515
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.460
Damn.
I made a simple pancake with bananas in it and I had some,
uh,

1516
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:27.260
some great real maple syrup from New Zealand and it was fucking amazing.

1517
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:32.300
I couldn't believe how great it tasted.
I never was a pancake guy.

1518
01:36:32.301 --> 01:36:33.350
And when I used to go to,

1519
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:36.980
I was never pancake guy when he used to go to diners back in Jersey.

1520
01:36:36.981 --> 01:36:41.981
It was delicious but overrated to banana pancakes.

1521
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:45.980
All right.
I got greedy.
I thought the first one was so good.

1522
01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:49.160
I went back and made a second one man,
was I wrong?

1523
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:53.630
I ate it and felt like a gluttonous pig.
I should've known,
but I,

1524
01:36:53.631 --> 01:36:56.480
at least for temporarily temporarily forgot.

1525
01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:00.620
Happiness comes in spurts and too much of anything can be bad.

1526
01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.760
I hate to relate life to a couple of pancakes,
but it's true.

1527
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:09.140
I overdid it and ruin the great single pancake experience.

1528
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:13.160
A one and it was great.
I had a second and I felt like shit.
Yeah,
there you go,

1529
01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:15.380
dude.
Dude.
Batter.

1530
01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:20.600
Pancake batter is a edible cement.
That's what it is.
All right.

1531
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:23.840
I told those stories before for all you struggling comedians out there,

1532
01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.180
you don't want to blow a bunch of cash on food,

1533
01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:31.420
go down to Denny's or an Ihub and about nine 30 in the morning,

1534
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:35.690
get the fucking full stack of pancakes and force.

1535
01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:39.920
I didn't even know if they make them anymore with all this talking about

1536
01:37:39.921 --> 01:37:44.780
nutrition,
I don't even think back in the day they give you five and you just,

1537
01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:48.410
I just like man versus food.
I just shoved that.

1538
01:37:48.670 --> 01:37:50.750
She'd be sweating by the time he got to the third one,

1539
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:54.980
all that syrup and all that butter.
And then you'd suck down your water in the,

1540
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:58.050
and I swear to God you weren't hungry again until like 10 o'clock at night.

1541
01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:03.270
So you got to skip at least one fucking meal.
You know,
just a tip.

1542
01:38:03.810 --> 01:38:06.450
Just a tip for you.
Let's wind this podcast down.

1543
01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.470
Let's go short and sweet this week shall we,
uh,
youtube videos for this week.

1544
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:11.910
And I'm going to tell you right now,

1545
01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:15.120
and I think these are arguably the best fucking youtube videos,

1546
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:18.480
the best cluster of youtube videos that,
um,

1547
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.100
that you guys have suggested since I've been doing this topic because you guys

1548
01:38:23.101 --> 01:38:27.240
have,
are now actually going outside the realm of youtube in finding some really

1549
01:38:27.241 --> 01:38:30.750
obscure shit.
So for all of you,

1550
01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:35.790
they're listening at home.
Just go to the MM podcast.com and uh,

1551
01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:39.660
we'll have all of these lined up for you to watch.
All right,
here we go.

1552
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.090
First a youtube video.

1553
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:45.390
And this one right here is an instant fucking classic.

1554
01:38:45.391 --> 01:38:48.180
I absolutely love this guy.
Uh,

1555
01:38:48.181 --> 01:38:53.181
this youtube video is called man is tased mocks cops and still gets away.

1556
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:57.330
I want you guys to watch this because not only is it fucking hilarious,

1557
01:38:57.331 --> 01:39:02.331
but this guy really shows why it's so important to know what your rights are as

1558
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.460
as a citizen.

1559
01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.670
I'm not saying the cops aren't still gonna kick the shit out of you,

1560
01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.320
but just to watch this guy,

1561
01:39:10.321 --> 01:39:14.880
he's actually stumping the cops on a certain level because they can't answer his

1562
01:39:14.881 --> 01:39:19.200
questions.
They got pinned on the ground and they said,
go and sir,

1563
01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.870
you're underneath the rest.
You're,
do you realize you're aren't ya?

1564
01:39:21.871 --> 01:39:25.680
You're aware that you're under arrest.
And he goes,
no.
He goes,
what's the charge?

1565
01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:27.600
What is the charge?
And they just kept going,
sir,

1566
01:39:27.601 --> 01:39:31.050
are you aware that you're under arrest?
He's like,
I don't speak the language.

1567
01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:34.680
I'm not in your king.
I'm not a subject.
Subjective,
your kingdom.
Right.

1568
01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:39.060
And for the first minute and 20 seconds,

1569
01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:43.690
this guy's fucking hilarious.
Then he gets all religious or oh gee,
she's,

1570
01:39:43.691 --> 01:39:44.540
and then it gets thin.

1571
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:49.580
He looks like a freak and then he just starts singing this fucking song and

1572
01:39:50.491 --> 01:39:55.491
they're trying to handcuff him and he is doing the most simple fucking move with

1573
01:39:56.851 --> 01:39:58.920
his elbow.
Really looked to see it.

1574
01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.330
The cop keeps going over the risks go under the risk over the wrist,

1575
01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:04.890
under the wrist,
and he just keeps moving his fucking elbow.

1576
01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.840
It's literally a two inch move.

1577
01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.580
He's moving it up to inches and down to which is in this fucking cop cannot get

1578
01:40:11.581 --> 01:40:14.610
the goddamn handcuffs on him.
And the whole time he's doing this,

1579
01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:19.170
he's singing this fucking song.
He's like a poet or something like that.

1580
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:24.270
Then they tase him and as they're tasing him,
he's standing up and he's,

1581
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:29.040
he's presenting his case because his wife is filming it.
As he's getting tased,

1582
01:40:29.150 --> 01:40:31.500
he's standing up going,
I defending myself.

1583
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:36.480
I am defending myself from this unjust tasing.
And then he runs away

1584
01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:43.830
one of the greatest youtube fucking videos ever.
This guy is,
is my fucking hero.

1585
01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:48.480
I love him.
All right,
and let's stick with the Arestin this week.
Uh,

1586
01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.890
another one is a funny arrest and this is black dude getting for drinking and

1587
01:40:53.891 --> 01:40:57.580
driving.
And this guy is absolutely fucking hilarious.

1588
01:40:57.581 --> 01:41:01.390
He is adamant that he was not.
He goes,
I have been drinking,

1589
01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.550
but I wasn't driving.
I sat,
I was begging,
I want grabbing,

1590
01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:09.110
you got to see this guy.
I'm 70.
Motherfuck,
I'll take no mother fucker tests.

1591
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:14.470
And then they,
and as he was yelling,
the lady would be like,
sir.
And he just go,

1592
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:19.090
Yo,
why am I trying to reenact these?

1593
01:41:19.091 --> 01:41:22.510
These are all fucking hilarious and um,
be fair and balanced.

1594
01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:26.620
We got a drunk black guy.
Now we got a drunk fucking white dude,
uh,

1595
01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:31.060
drunk redneck arrest.
And this guy isn't drunk.
I guess he is drunk,

1596
01:41:31.061 --> 01:41:35.380
but he's fucking,
he's one of the angry as he says,

1597
01:41:35.381 --> 01:41:40.060
the meanest shit ever.
The cops going to arrest him.
Um,

1598
01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:43.630
I'll just give you a little quick little,
uh,
youtube trailers.

1599
01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:46.990
They go to arrest the guy and they already got them fucking handcuffs in the

1600
01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.450
cops.
Go and listen.
Now.
Come on man.
We don't want to have,

1601
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.700
we don't want to have to hurt you.
And guys like,
I know.

1602
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:55.060
I don't want to have to hurt you either.
Break your fucking nick.

1603
01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:01.000
Oh,
fuck it.
I can't make up funny.
Just go watch him.
Um,
oh.
Silent night.

1604
01:42:01.001 --> 01:42:04.390
Deadly night,
part five.
Watch that movie trailer.
Um,

1605
01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:06.010
for those who have weak of stomach,

1606
01:42:06.011 --> 01:42:09.460
do not watch this reporter Shit herself during interview.

1607
01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:13.180
She has on white pants too,
just to warn you.
Um,

1608
01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:17.140
and what is the last one?
Oh the last one for all the drummers out there,

1609
01:42:17.141 --> 01:42:19.570
I had a bunch of musicians,
uh,

1610
01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:23.440
specifically drummers send me all these,
uh,

1611
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.690
all these emails this week.

1612
01:42:25.691 --> 01:42:30.691
I had no idea the amount of musicians and the amount of drummers in particular

1613
01:42:31.481 --> 01:42:34.750
who listened to my podcast.
Everybody,
I,
you've got to check out Stewart Copeland,

1614
01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:38.770
Danny carry all these fucking people actually read something and rolling stone

1615
01:42:38.771 --> 01:42:41.740
about Phil Collins today and uh,

1616
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:44.890
for as much shit music as he made in the 80s,

1617
01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:50.340
like that guy's a fucking a fucking beast of a drummer.

1618
01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:55.180
Left handed drummer,
still plays those concert toms with the no bottom,

1619
01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.330
no bottom heads.
This guy,
I'm telling you,
there's not enough.

1620
01:42:59.110 --> 01:43:02.680
If anybody's got a great youtube video that just has him just playing,

1621
01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:06.340
I don't want to hear him solo in with Chester Thompson who was another great

1622
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:08.050
drama.
I just want to hear him by himself.

1623
01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:12.220
That guy is a fucking beast.

1624
01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:17.370
And the sad thing is he stepped out behind the kit and it was good in the

1625
01:43:17.471 --> 01:43:19.390
beginning and then the end,
it was just,

1626
01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:24.310
you can't hurry love since his studio.

1627
01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:29.110
Just some of the worst fucking music ever made.
Um,

1628
01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:31.870
and they're actually actually checked out rolling stone.

1629
01:43:31.871 --> 01:43:35.860
He has this whole article with it.
Either he's talking about how,
you know,

1630
01:43:36.010 --> 01:43:39.670
he became the antichrist.
He's actually confused as to why that happened.

1631
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:44.260
So I kind of felt bad for him as an artist,
but it's like,
you know,

1632
01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:48.670
look back on that music.
Phil,
do you really think that fucking holds up?

1633
01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:52.670
She seemed to have at a vigil boat.

1634
01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.580
Cha Cha Oh,

1635
01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.760
oh geesh.
Terrible music.
Um,
anyways,
so checked.

1636
01:44:01.761 --> 01:44:02.271
So somebody,

1637
01:44:02.271 --> 01:44:05.900
everybody was sending me these videos of drummers tell me all this shit that I

1638
01:44:05.901 --> 01:44:09.560
should check out.
And uh,
this was the,

1639
01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:14.570
this was the drum video that really stood out for me.
Um,
two things.

1640
01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:16.310
One,
this is a video I already knew about.

1641
01:44:16.590 --> 01:44:18.680
If you guys are into like drum and bass music,

1642
01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.760
or if you're drummers out there and you wonder where that fucking music came

1643
01:44:22.761 --> 01:44:26.930
from,
this is video that explains,
says a video video,

1644
01:44:26.931 --> 01:44:31.130
explains the world's most underrate,
most important six second drum loop.

1645
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:36.560
And it's,
um,
it's basically this,
this song from a sort of obscure,

1646
01:44:36.561 --> 01:44:41.080
I guess R and B group called the Winstons and uh,

1647
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:42.830
they had this song called amen brother,

1648
01:44:42.831 --> 01:44:46.760
which was actually a B side and it had like this,
uh,
I don't know what it was.

1649
01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:47.480
It was like,

1650
01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:52.480
I don't know musically how to say it was like a fucking two bar drum break that

1651
01:44:52.851 --> 01:44:53.780
these,
uh,

1652
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:56.390
I don't know if people used to rap over it and what they explained the whole

1653
01:44:56.391 --> 01:45:01.391
fucking thing and basically how Dj's took that to bar drum brake and isolated

1654
01:45:02.811 --> 01:45:06.590
every sound
of,
of,
of the recording,

1655
01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:09.470
every like,
I don't know how to musically,

1656
01:45:09.471 --> 01:45:12.980
like if you could cut it down to like 32nd notes,
they just isolated everything,

1657
01:45:12.981 --> 01:45:15.620
the sound of the ride cymbal,
the sound of the bass drum,

1658
01:45:15.621 --> 01:45:19.730
everything in the sign of all of it together and just spliced the whole fucking

1659
01:45:19.731 --> 01:45:22.070
thing up and then re edit it in different,

1660
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:26.180
in a different order and then sped the whole fucking thing up.

1661
01:45:26.181 --> 01:45:28.430
Created all these new drum beats and cr in sped,

1662
01:45:28.431 --> 01:45:33.431
the whole fucking thing up past the point where human beings could actually play

1663
01:45:34.881 --> 01:45:38.090
drums at that point.
And,

1664
01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:42.410
but what's great about fucking human beings is I like to believe is that we're

1665
01:45:42.411 --> 01:45:44.000
better than fucking machines.

1666
01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:49.940
So the great dramas of the world's figured out how to fucking play that fast.

1667
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.220
That's a whole nother thing.
Guys like Joe,

1668
01:45:52.221 --> 01:45:56.300
Joe Mayor actually through fucking does these different techniques to play in

1669
01:45:56.590 --> 01:45:57.890
molar method,
push Polen all that.

1670
01:45:57.891 --> 01:46:00.020
They figured out how to fucking play at that level.

1671
01:46:00.021 --> 01:46:03.980
But this video explains basically how all that drum and bass should kind of came

1672
01:46:03.981 --> 01:46:04.814
about.

1673
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:09.850
And a checkout Jojo mayor to another drum video we'll have up on the [inaudible]

1674
01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:12.510
podcast.
If you're interested in that shit.
How,

1675
01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.560
how fucking fast this guy can play and single bass drum players.

1676
01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:19.400
I got to show you this fucking video.

1677
01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:24.580
This guy can get three and four bass drum hits in a row like row row crop,

1678
01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.640
like doing like that heel toe shit.

1679
01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:34.700
It's fucking unbelievable.
It's unfucking believable how this guy can do that.

1680
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:37.860
Um,
anyways,
I know I'm boring a lot of this,

1681
01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:41.990
this is even more fucking obscure than sports.
But anyways,

1682
01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:45.380
that all the drum videos you guys sent me,
a lot of them I knew.
And one,

1683
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:47.480
this is the one that I was the least familiar with,

1684
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:52.440
cause I figure everybody knows Danny carry in a tool and all those major bands.

1685
01:46:52.441 --> 01:46:56.700
But uh,
there's this band called Russian circles,
which I had never heard of.

1686
01:46:58.490 --> 01:47:01.560
Um,
and they have a drummer called Harper Louis and there's a,

1687
01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:06.450
there's a youtube video called Russian Russian circles.
Harper Louis,
uh,

1688
01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:09.900
live at wicker park fest oh seven.

1689
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:14.370
And it just starts off with,
you know,
eight just this fucking guy.

1690
01:47:14.371 --> 01:47:18.690
If I could play drums at this guy's level,
this dude's basically,
you know,

1691
01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:23.220
as much as you want to be the guy hitting fucking 8 million drums and smashing a

1692
01:47:23.221 --> 01:47:24.480
gong that's on fire,

1693
01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:27.870
when it really comes down to what you want to be able to fucking be this God

1694
01:47:27.871 --> 01:47:32.400
damn bad ass and still be playing for the song.
It's like,

1695
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.280
it's Kinda like that David growth thing.

1696
01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:39.630
He's another fake the drum and the David Grohl did on a queens of the stone age.

1697
01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:45.030
It's like,
it kind of reminds me of that.
It's like he just,
Ah,

1698
01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:49.560
it's fucking unreal.
The whole,
it's all there.
It's all fucking there.

1699
01:47:49.561 --> 01:47:53.280
The dynamics,
the building,
the excitement playing,
you know,

1700
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:55.680
not getting in the way of anybody else he's playing with.

1701
01:47:55.681 --> 01:47:58.300
He sees the fucking shit.
Um,

1702
01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:02.550
and I got to download some of their shit's so if anybody knows what their best

1703
01:48:02.551 --> 01:48:04.830
album is,
Russian circles,
please let me know.

1704
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.480
And I'm downloading that shit this week cause uh,
I'm fucking the drummer alone.

1705
01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:12.450
I got,
I got to listen to more of this stuff.
All right.

1706
01:48:12.451 --> 01:48:16.020
I know I'm babbling on here.
I'll,
we'll end with this this week.
All right,

1707
01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:20.700
a little bit of advice here.
Listen to this fucking situation.

1708
01:48:20.701 --> 01:48:24.180
This guy got himself into,
um,
all right,
bill,

1709
01:48:24.181 --> 01:48:28.260
my girlfriend is 10 years older than me.
Oh,
Jesus.
She has two kids.

1710
01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:29.940
Oh Jesus.

1711
01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:33.420
And has been married and divorced twice.

1712
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:38.940
Dude,
what the fuck?
I'm 26.

1713
01:48:38.941 --> 01:48:42.990
Jesus Christ college graduate.

1714
01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:48.060
Has any of this made any sense to any of you?
Would anybody else be out there?

1715
01:48:48.061 --> 01:48:50.190
26 college fucking graduate,

1716
01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:54.270
have a girlfriend 10 years older than you with two kids had been married and

1717
01:48:54.271 --> 01:48:58.350
divorced twice.
Good God man.
He goes,

1718
01:48:58.351 --> 01:49:00.630
I consider myself somewhat intelligent.

1719
01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.480
I'm sure you are,
but not in this area.
Um,

1720
01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:10.890
by that I mean you should have no problem understanding this email.
Well,
yeah,

1721
01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:13.080
I know everybody trashes me.
I know,
I know.

1722
01:49:13.081 --> 01:49:17.700
I'm the worst when it comes to reading this shit.
So anyways,
here we go.
He says,

1723
01:49:17.701 --> 01:49:22.701
four weeks ago I found text messages to some dude on my girlfriend's phone that

1724
01:49:24.151 --> 01:49:29.151
although innocent enough made it clear that whoever she was texting was on more

1725
01:49:29.581 --> 01:49:33.510
familiar grounds than just some work colleague or a friend,

1726
01:49:34.710 --> 01:49:38.190
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
is there going to be a happy ending here?

1727
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:43.430
I confronted her about it and it predictably led to a lot of finger pointing.

1728
01:49:43.771 --> 01:49:45.810
We went back and forth and uh,
and uh,

1729
01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:50.830
for a few days and aired out our grievances,
but it seemed agreeable.

1730
01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:55.720
Now he makes,
I guess point number two,
two oh two more weeks passed by.

1731
01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.280
And Lo and behold,

1732
01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:02.260
I find more text messages from the same fucking guy.

1733
01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:05.290
At first I tell myself,
okay,

1734
01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:10.000
maybe she can't break things off with this dude so quickly,
Jesus Christ.

1735
01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:13.030
Do you know sometimes liberal thought is a,
is a great thing.

1736
01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:17.830
Like let's have a fair fucking trial for somebody before we hang them from the

1737
01:50:17.831 --> 01:50:20.860
nearest tree.
But then this times it's fucking stupid.

1738
01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:24.400
This is just liberal thought to the,
I mean,

1739
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:28.690
how much of a benefit of the doubt can you give somebody,
you know?
So he goes,

1740
01:50:28.691 --> 01:50:32.500
so I confront her about it and this leads to another round of finger pointing.

1741
01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:36.820
At which point she tells me to pack my shit and leave.

1742
01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:40.570
I'll dude,
I'm gonna tell you right now before I read the rest of it.

1743
01:50:40.571 --> 01:50:44.230
That's fucking great.
You didn't have to do any dirty work.
You're out.

1744
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:47.590
You fucking out.
So anyways,
he goes,

1745
01:50:47.710 --> 01:50:52.060
were separated for a week when she asked me to come back and move in.
Dude,

1746
01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:57.520
this chick is a fucking psycho.
Here we go.
We talk about our future together,

1747
01:50:58.390 --> 01:51:02.500
how,
sorry she is to have done that to me,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1748
01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:03.670
For Fuck Sakes.

1749
01:51:03.671 --> 01:51:07.510
We even talking about getting married when things finally fucking evened out.

1750
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:10.510
I was full of piss and vinegar and felt vindicated,

1751
01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:15.250
vindicated that I was the one wronged in the whole situation and that she was

1752
01:51:15.251 --> 01:51:18.970
actually making good by taking responsibility for what she had done

1753
01:51:20.590 --> 01:51:25.510
through take responsibility would have been fucking [inaudible] to the second

1754
01:51:25.511 --> 01:51:27.880
you see those weird texts.
Just get,
I'm telling you right now,

1755
01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:31.180
just get out of the relationship.
There is an oh,
sorry.

1756
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:36.400
Sorry about that.
And now that that's it.
It's over.
It's fucking over.

1757
01:51:37.570 --> 01:51:41.950
Um,
but whatever,
you're 26,
I guess you still haven't learned.

1758
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:46.260
I was dumb in my twenties.
So here we go.
Let's read the rest of this.
Um,

1759
01:51:46.410 --> 01:51:50.200
all was well and good until she didn't come home this Thursday night,

1760
01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:54.940
November 11th.
She came in Friday morning with no explanation,
no pology,

1761
01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:58.330
no nothing.
She asked me to give her some more time,

1762
01:51:58.331 --> 01:52:01.990
but I decided to cut bait and just get the fuck out of this situation.

1763
01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:05.260
Hang on a second,
everybody.
Sorry,

1764
01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:07.720
I had to give him a little applause break there.
Of course,

1765
01:52:07.930 --> 01:52:11.740
now I'm wracked with guilt of leaving the woman I loved and live with for the

1766
01:52:11.741 --> 01:52:15.550
past five fucking years.
You've got winter when you were 21 dude,

1767
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:18.940
she was 31 wait,
let's do the math.

1768
01:52:18.941 --> 01:52:22.990
She was 31 you were 21 she was already married twice.
All right.

1769
01:52:22.991 --> 01:52:26.440
This chick's is psycho and you know what that means?
She's fucking great in bed.

1770
01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:31.510
You at 21 she fucking devastated you with fucking her pussy,

1771
01:52:31.690 --> 01:52:36.430
right?
Best blow job you ever had is now what happened.
And next thing you know,

1772
01:52:36.431 --> 01:52:40.710
you were too fucking
too young and dumb media you fell for.

1773
01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:46.340
Yeah,
Jesus Christ.
He stayed there for five fucking years.
So anyway,

1774
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:47.031
I guess just check,

1775
01:52:47.031 --> 01:52:49.880
still calling him telling she still wants to get back together.

1776
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:54.140
I feel like every time I sack up and do what I think is best for me,

1777
01:52:54.141 --> 01:52:58.430
she wants me back.
And every time I do what's best for us as a couple,

1778
01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:03.230
she uses that as an opportunity to fuck with me all over again.
Yes.
Yes,

1779
01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:08.450
you're absolutely right.
Listen to your gut,
this guy,
see,

1780
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:13.940
he knows the fucking answers.
He's,
he's listening to his gut.
Good fucking man.

1781
01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:16.010
Um,
is this,

1782
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:20.210
is it just that chicks can't handle a guy that is emotionally invested or do I

1783
01:53:20.211 --> 01:53:25.211
just happen to be dealing with one of those sociopath's that doesn't give a fuck

1784
01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:29.000
what she does.
So long as it suits her in the moment.
Yes.

1785
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:32.030
There's plenty of fucking good women.
That was not plenty of good ones.

1786
01:53:32.031 --> 01:53:34.550
There's good women out there.
All right?
Just like good.

1787
01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:38.450
A good man's hard to find this.
Finding a good woman's also difficult.
All right.

1788
01:53:38.451 --> 01:53:42.590
But no,
you happen to be dealing with an absolute fucking sociopath.
All right?

1789
01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:45.860
She had a fucked up childhood.
Something happened to her.
She got touched.

1790
01:53:45.861 --> 01:53:49.100
Her fucking dad took off.
I don't know.
Or She just got the fucking,

1791
01:53:49.610 --> 01:53:52.760
she got one of those bad brains,
you know,

1792
01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:55.460
I began to tell you guys my theory on that,
the a brain,

1793
01:53:55.461 --> 01:54:00.040
the bee brain and the sea brain,
the brain is the genius to be brain is the,
uh,

1794
01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:02.480
oh,
he's a good fucking shit.
You know

1795
01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:08.420
Fitzy and then the sea brain is your fucking mouth breathing moron.

1796
01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:11.870
All right.
And when it comes to being a sociopath,

1797
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:16.760
that's like just a,
that's just like getting an option on the car.

1798
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:20.270
All brains come with that option.
It's all available like satellite radio,

1799
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:23.780
you know,
you get satellite radio and a fucking Bentley.

1800
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:26.960
You can also get it my fucking Prius.
All right,

1801
01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:31.100
so did they make any fucking sense?
You've got a sociopath with the fucking,

1802
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:33.950
she could even have the a brain.

1803
01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:36.260
That's the sad thing about having a fucked up childhood.

1804
01:54:36.261 --> 01:54:39.860
She could actually be a fucking genius,
but she's got the sociopath shit.

1805
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:44.510
So tell her go call fucking doctor Dro.
All right?

1806
01:54:46.250 --> 01:54:49.370
And you get the fuck out of the relationship.
So anyways,
he'd say,

1807
01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:53.320
I'd imagine you'd agree that I did the right thing.
Uh,

1808
01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.840
but it always helps to get a little bit of press,
better perspective on it.
Dude,

1809
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:59.930
I totally understand.
You've been in a five year relationship,

1810
01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:01.910
you're emotionally invested in this shit.

1811
01:55:02.150 --> 01:55:04.190
So you know what the right thing to do is,

1812
01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:06.710
but your emotions keep fucking with you.
All right.

1813
01:55:07.130 --> 01:55:10.430
So what you got to know is just look,

1814
01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:15.020
going through a breakup is painful.
All right?

1815
01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:16.820
It's not going to not be painful,

1816
01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:20.450
but just because it's painful doesn't mean that it's not the right thing to do.

1817
01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:25.520
You are 100 fucking percent doing the right fucking thing.

1818
01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:30.170
Your 26 year old years old,
you're in the prime of your fucking life.
All right?

1819
01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:33.620
Get out of that situation.
Okay?
She's 10 years older than you.

1820
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:38.150
By the time you're 29,
she's going to be hitting fucking menopause,
all right?

1821
01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.760
Or something like that.
Whatever.
Sliding into it.

1822
01:55:40.761 --> 01:55:42.650
I have no fucking idea what she's going to be doing.

1823
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:47.010
She's going to be wearing those mom jeans at that point if she's not already,

1824
01:55:47.670 --> 01:55:52.500
which I don't think she is.
She's probably that fucking,
you know that,

1825
01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:55.570
uh,
that anorexic cougar look,

1826
01:55:56.350 --> 01:55:59.230
you know where they got a varicose vein in between their fucking,

1827
01:55:59.231 --> 01:56:03.690
you can see their breast plate.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.
He'll stay on topic.
Yes.

1828
01:56:03.691 --> 01:56:07.230
So to just get out of that,
hang out with you fucking fellas.
No,

1829
01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:10.950
I ain't call your buddies.
Go out and fucking have some bears.
Join a gym,

1830
01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:15.570
get fucking shredded.
Go Out,
start talking shit when you're ready.

1831
01:56:15.571 --> 01:56:19.020
But don't go back to that man.
You dodged a fucking bullet.

1832
01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:23.690
The fact that you were with her for five years and you didn't knock her up and

1833
01:56:23.691 --> 01:56:27.620
you got out of it,
and even after five years,
you're only 26 years old,

1834
01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:30.860
you've made the best fucking move.
You're going to make sure,
all right,

1835
01:56:30.861 --> 01:56:32.180
and now this is what you need to do.

1836
01:56:32.181 --> 01:56:33.770
You've been in a relationship for five years.

1837
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:36.740
You need to be single for at least a fucking year and a half.

1838
01:56:37.870 --> 01:56:40.210
And I don't mean just be single and fucking booze.

1839
01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:44.940
Figure out what the fuck you looking for.
All right?
And when you meet a girl,

1840
01:56:45.090 --> 01:56:50.000
if she doesn't have it,
just walk a banger and leaf.
You know,

1841
01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:53.140
there's nothing wrong with having a good fucking time,

1842
01:56:53.141 --> 01:56:58.141
but do not get sucked into another fucking relationship because you're going to,

1843
01:56:58.930 --> 01:57:03.430
cause you're going to have to go through this shit again.
You know,
we,

1844
01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:05.350
you just sit there and you know it's fucking wrong,

1845
01:57:05.351 --> 01:57:07.960
but you don't want to go through the fucking pain of it and you keep coming
back.

1846
01:57:07.961 --> 01:57:11.170
It's a fucking nightmare.
It's a fucking nightmare.
Good for you,
sir.

1847
01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:13.420
I'm fucking proud of you.
You did the right thing.

1848
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:17.260
You sorta fucking wavering cause you go through the motions.
You're only 26.

1849
01:57:17.261 --> 01:57:20.380
She got with her when you were 21 is probably your first major fucking breakup.

1850
01:57:20.650 --> 01:57:24.520
So it's acceptable that you fucked up and went back that second time,

1851
01:57:24.521 --> 01:57:26.200
but do not go back again.

1852
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:28.600
And if any of your fucking friends are listening to this,

1853
01:57:28.601 --> 01:57:30.310
don't let him do that shit.
All right.

1854
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:35.260
Time to a fucking barstool and start throwing drinks down his throat.
Ah,

1855
01:57:35.261 --> 01:57:39.940
that's it.
That's the Monday morning podcast for this week.
Uh,
anything else?

1856
01:57:39.941 --> 01:57:42.840
Where am I going to be this week?
Oh,
this week I'm going to be at the,
uh,

1857
01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:48.390
the listener theater in Washington DC.
There's only a,

1858
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:53.320

oh,

1859
01:57:53.321 --> 01:57:54.970

1860
01:57:54.971 --> 01:57:59.260
I'll be hanging out afterwards doing a meet and greet.
I have my brand new DVD,

1861
01:57:59.261 --> 01:58:03.800

I'll be signing up,
taking pictures and all that type of shit.
Uh,

1862
01:58:03.801 --> 01:58:07.580

1863
01:58:07.590 --> 01:58:11.480
Both shows are sold out,
but for those of you who have tickets,

1864

shaking hands,

1865
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.290

And,

1866
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.450

And,

1869

You guys all have a great week.
