00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.340
So what sort of things do you think we can do to improve this graph?

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.250
&gt;&gt; So if we we're doing 100% of data I think a cool and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.240
youthful way often to show data is by using a stacked barchart.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.270
And so you can still show 100% of the data.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.910
So in this graph for example we're looking at the population of

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.590
New York over time and it let's you see changes.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.910
For example here you can see the green space,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.290
which represents Manhattan, changes from being.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.985
What is this?

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:36.450
83% of the population.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.900
And then drastically reduces over time.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.000
And so you can still make a, a meaningful comparison.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.210
In fact, I think more meaningful because it's showing 100% side by side.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.300
And it's a lot easier to, to take in the distribution of that.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.980
In a line and in a stack bar chart type format then it would in a pie chart.
