00:00:01.143 --> 00:00:02.735
Voiceover:Artemis seeks knowledge of

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:04.602
the width of Orion's belt,

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:08.101
which is a pattern of stars
in the Orion constellation.

00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:10.741
She has previously
discovered the distances

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:16.804
from her house to
Alnitak, 736 lights years,

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:20.756
and to Mintaka, 915 light years,

00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:23.758
which are the endpoints of Orion's belt.

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:26.002
She knows the angle between these

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.142
stars in the sky is three degrees.

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:31.806
What is the width of Orion's belt?

00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:32.872
That is, what is the distance

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:36.268
between Alnitak and Mintaka?

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:39.209
And they want us to the
answer in light years.

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:40.872
So let's draw a little diagram

00:00:40.872 --> 00:00:42.607
to make sure we understand
what's going on.

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:43.670
Actually, even before we do that,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.563
I encourage you to pause

00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:46.735
this and try this on your own.

00:00:46.735 --> 00:00:48.675
Now let's make a diagram.

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:50.798
Alright, so let's say
that this is Artemis'

00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:52.141
house right over here.

00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:53.756
This is Artemis' house.

00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:57.174
I'll say that's A for Artemis' house.

00:00:57.174 --> 00:00:58.666
And then...

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.004
Alright, let me say H...

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:01.605
Let me say this is home.

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:03.273
This is home right over here.

00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:04.748
And we have these 2 stars.

00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:07.467
So she's looking out into the night sky

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.169
and she sees these stars,

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:14.605
Alnitak, which is 736 light years away,

00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:17.337
and obviously I'm not going
to draw this to scale.

00:01:17.337 --> 00:01:21.750
So this is Alnitak.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.521
And Mintaka.

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:28.606
So let's say this is
Mintaka right over here.

00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:31.001
Mintaka.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.606
And we know a few things.

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:35.273
We know that this
distance between her home

00:01:35.273 --> 00:01:40.173
and Alnitak is 736 light years.

00:01:40.173 --> 00:01:42.935
So this distance right over here.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:44.338
So that right over there.

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.837
Everything we'll do is in light years.

00:01:45.837 --> 00:01:47.707
That's 736.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:48.605
And the distance between

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:54.674
her house and Mintaka is 915 light years.

00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:57.163
So it would take light 915 years

00:01:57.163 --> 00:01:58.879
to get from her house to Mintaka,

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.248
or from Mintaka to her house.

00:02:01.248 --> 00:02:04.271
So this is 915 light years.

00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:05.379
And what we wanna do is figure out

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:07.402
the width of Orion's belt,

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:11.136
which is the distance
between Alnitak and Mintaka.

00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:15.880
So we need to figure out this distance

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.335
right over here.

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:21.506
And the one thing that they did give us

00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:23.269
is this angle.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.270
They did give us that
angle right over there.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.136
They said that the angle between

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:30.216
these stars in the sky is three degrees.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:33.552
So this is three degrees right over there.

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:36.003
So how can we figure out the distance

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:38.406
between Alnitak and Mintaka?

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:40.868
Let's just say that this is equal to X.

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:42.074
This is equal to X.

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:43.404
How do we do that?

00:02:43.404 --> 00:02:45.697
Well if we have two sides

00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:47.990
and an angle between them,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.285
we could use the law of cosines

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:55.368
to figure out the third side.

00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:56.736
So the law of cosines,

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:58.534
so let's just apply it.

00:02:58.534 --> 00:03:02.871
So the law of cosines tells us

00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:05.928
that X squared is going to be equal

00:03:05.928 --> 00:03:09.176
to the sum of the squares
of the other two sides.

00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:14.433
So it's going to be equal to 736 squared,

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:28.534
plus 915 squared, minus two times 736,

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:37.135
times 915, times the cosine of this angle.

00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:41.631
Times the cosine of three degrees.

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:43.473
So once again,

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:44.541
we're trying to find the length of

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:46.501
the side opposite the three degrees.

00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:48.008
We know the other two sides,

00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:50.084
so the law of cosines, it essentially...

00:03:51.807 --> 00:03:54.061
Sorry, I just had to cough off camera

00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:56.211
because I had some peanuts
and my throat was dry.

00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:56.997
Where was I?

00:03:56.997 --> 00:03:58.324
Oh, I was saying,

00:03:58.324 --> 00:04:00.543
if we know the angle and
we know the two sides

00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:01.799
on either side of the angle,

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.294
we can figure out the
length of the side opposite

00:04:03.294 --> 00:04:04.853
by the law of cosines.

00:04:04.853 --> 00:04:06.624
Where it essentially starts off not too

00:04:06.624 --> 00:04:08.215
different than the Pythagorean theorem,

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:09.330
but then we give an adjustment

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.210
because this is not an
actual right triangle.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.264
And the adjustment...

00:04:13.264 --> 00:04:16.262
So we have the 736
squared, plus 915 squared,

00:04:16.262 --> 00:04:19.426
minus two times the
product of these sides,

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.674
times the cosine of this angle.

00:04:21.674 --> 00:04:23.669
Or another way we could
say, think about it is,

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.722
X, let me write that,

00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:31.591
X is to equal to the square root of all

00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:33.000
of this stuff.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.174
So, I can just copy and paste that.

00:04:37.482 --> 00:04:39.115
Copy and paste.

00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:44.487
X is going to be equal to
the square root of that.

00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:48.328
And so let's get our
calculator to calculate it.

00:04:48.328 --> 00:04:51.054
And let me verify that I'm in degree mode.

00:04:51.054 --> 00:04:53.727
Yes, I am indeed in degree mode.

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:55.724
And so let's exit that.

00:04:55.724 --> 00:04:58.975
And so I wanna calculate
the square root of

00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:06.641
736 squared, plus 915 squared,

00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:15.993
minus two times 736, times 915,

00:05:15.993 --> 00:05:19.657
times cosine of three degrees.

00:05:19.657 --> 00:05:22.474
And we deserve a drum roll now.

00:05:22.474 --> 00:05:24.552
X is 100, if we round...

00:05:24.552 --> 00:05:25.785
Let's see, what did they want us to do?

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:27.552
Round your answer to
the nearest light years.

00:05:27.552 --> 00:05:28.460
So to the nearest light year

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.932
is going to be 184 light years.

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:40.590
So X is approximately
equal to 184 light years.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.559
So it would take light 184 years

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:47.970
to get from Mintaka to Alnitak.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.189
And so hopefully this actually shows you

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.927
if you are going to do any astronomy,

00:05:51.927 --> 00:05:54.057
the law of cosines, law of sines,

00:05:54.057 --> 00:05:55.992
in fact all of trigonometry,

00:05:55.992 --> 00:05:59.992
becomes quite, quite handy.
