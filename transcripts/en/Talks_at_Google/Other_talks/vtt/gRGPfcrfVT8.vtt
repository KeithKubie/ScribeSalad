&gt;&gt;Hi, everyone, I'm Winnie from the Authors@Google
team.

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:09.750
So it's my pleasure to introduce Rick.
He is the best-selling author of over 40 travel

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.940
books.
He's hosted over a hundred shows on public

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.720
television and radio.
We all love him, and that's why you guys are

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.280
all here.
So he's going to share with us his tips on

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.970
traveling to Europe.
How to pack smart, how to avoid scams, eat

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.770
well while we're traveling,
and all that stuff.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.990
Stretch our dollar, all the things that would
be great for us to know

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.370
traveling on business or for ourselves.
So without further ado, let's welcome Rick

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.470
Steves, the advocate of
smart and independent travel.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.470
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:46.859
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.120
It's -- it's great to be here.
And the challenge for me will be to distill

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.870
all of the things I've
learned from 30 years of traveling in Europe

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.720
into 50 minutes, okay?
And have a little time for Q&amp;A.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.329
But thanks for having me here.
And let me just quickly, if I can just grab

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.620
these four things.
I'll give it back, yeah.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.120
Because I understand these were snapped up
by the early birds, I guess.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.730
I sent down a bunch of these things and you
can get all this stuff on

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.380
the Internet.
But I like to still have stuff in print.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.590
But what we've got here is, this is a 64-page
newsletter which

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.730
highlights our favorite destinations.
And that's basically our catalog.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.650
I love to give people a map that locates all
the hard-to-find places

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.130
that don't show up on normal maps.
Because that's what my job is to find those

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.370
quirky little odd spots.
So it's frustrating because you don't see

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.890
it on a regular map.
You can see it on this map.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.040
Just at lunch we were talking about how we
can also see it on Google

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.180
Earth in the near future, I suppose.
This is just a fun little personalized planning

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.700
map.
So those of you who got this I hope that's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.950
helpful for you.
I also had a great experience of being in

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.640
Iran as part of my work as a
teacher and a tour guide to bring home a better

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.900
understanding of Iran.
And that's a different talk than what today's

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.210
topic is.
But if you are curious about my Iran show

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.430
 -- have any of you seen my
Iran show on PBS?

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.270
You can see it on Hulu.com.
We've got it there any time you like.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.030
And it's just really an eye opener for a lot
Americans.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.340
But I wanted to people to have this print
version of my blog there.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.500
So if you missed that, obviously you can get
it on my website.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.409
But I'm glad that I was able to hand out some
of these.

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.549
And this bigger brochure explains our tour
program.

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.950
There's a DVD in here that gives you a rundown
on what we do with the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.780
10,000 people we take to Europe every summer
on 20 different

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.019
itineraries.
Okay.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.629
I'm just going to kind of whip through here,
and when I think about

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.209
this talk it's the same talk I've been giving
since I was a college kid

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.439
back in the 70s.
And it's more fundamental philosophy of travel

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.980
than specific, you know,
what is this rail pass cost or something like

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.620
that.
Cause really fundamentally is knowing how

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.719
to travel in a way that you
have the best experience.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.610
We Americans have the shortest vacations in
the rich world, and our

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.569
dollar is sort of in the tank.
So two important things, time and money, are

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.989
very precious.
And you've got to use them smartly.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.090
Well, if somebody is saying where is the best
deal if Europe?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.029
If I say, well, Portugal is really cheap.
And your travel dreams are taking you to Ireland,

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.459
the best deal is in
Ireland.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.230
Travel smart in Ireland.
Don't go where it's cheap.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.870
You want to go to Ireland or wherever.
One thing that carbonates your experience

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.491
is to meet people.
And to travel in a way where you're a part

00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:10.230
of the party instead of part
of the economy.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.480
All over Europe you got these charming people
that just do what they do

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.260
with gusto.
It's so much fun, isn't it, when you work

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.109
with people that really have
found their niche.

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.299
And when you traveling you connect with people
who have found their

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.640
niche.
You don't need to be rich to enjoy the highlights,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.590
the cultural and
artistic and natural wonders of Europe.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.480
That's a beautiful thing.
But you've got to be able to get away from

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.700
the marketing stuff that
brings you and all the other tourists together.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.180
Anybody can enjoy a fine meal in Europe for
a remarkably reasonable

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.749
price, if they are not attracted to the biggest
neon sign that brags,

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.140
"We speak English and accept Visa cards."
Okay?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.609
You need to go where the locals are going.
That's kind of common sense.

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.540
What I like to do is find these sort of places.
Back doors.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.340
Places that are hard to get to a lot of cases
that are not built up for

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.099
the tourism.
But when you get there, you feel like you've

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.409
really arrived.
This is a magic moment.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.939
Now this peculiar town, Civeta de bon dur
rago, doesn't matter in this

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.221
talk cause there's towns like that all over
Europe.

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:08.159
The key is for you to find those magical places
where when you go up

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.480
that donkey path, you find yourself in a different
world.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.310
2009, 2010, you can have that experience if
you know where to go.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.310
The typical American doesn't know where to
go.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.259
I was just in Dubrovnik a couple months ago
filming.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.020
I stepped out of the hotel, sunny day.
Great.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.360
We're going to get some get some great footage.
I look at the main street -- human traffic

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.449
jam.
Cruise people.

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.800
All the cruise people came at the same time.
All of these thousands of people inundating

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.330
the city.
If they're having a good time, it's because

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.550
they're clueless.
I mean it is just -- that's not Dubrovnik.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.370
They travelled all the way around the world
to see it -- you know what

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.280
I mean?
It's like Disneyland on a busy day.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.400
And I just said put the camera down.
We're not going to shoot this stuff.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.699
And then, you know, that afternoon the people
went back to their boats,

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.420
and Dubrovnik was a joy once again.
So we need to travel in a way where we do

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.330
the famous things.
You know?

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.770
I'm not -- of course, you got to checkout
the Acropolis.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.949
And I love the windmills and the wooden shoes.
But what gives your trip that extra dimension

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.080
is to find what I call
the back doors.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.960
Right?
The back doors.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.400
This is the book that I wrote as a college
kid, from just the lecture

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.449
of my class I was giving at the University
of Washington.

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.970
Now it's in its 30th edition.
Spend four months a year every year updating

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.750
this thing.
And the back half of this book are individual

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.860
chapters on my 40
favorite discoveries, those back doors.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.569
But you want to see Paris.
You want to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.180
and then you want to go two
hours away and hang out in Vernazza on the

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.081
Cinque Terre.
Or you want to go to Salzburg.

00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:36.990
Salzburg's great.
But don't go to Salzburg and complain about

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.710
tourist crowds.
It's inundated with tourists.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.960
It's great and it is touristy.
Accept that.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.690
Too many people go to Salzburg, complain about
the tourist crowds and

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.710
the next morning take the Sound of Music bus
tour.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.430
You know, I mean that's fun.
But that's not -- that's not Austrian.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.699
You're going to be rolling through the foothills
of the Alps singing

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.990
Doe, a Deer with 40 Japanese tourists, you
know, that's fun.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.360
But you don't go to Austria for that, I don't
think.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.990
So enjoy Salzburg.
Enjoy the Sound of Music tour, enjoy the tourist

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.569
crowds.
And then don't complain about the crowds,

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.419
but go two hours south to
Hallstadt.

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.830
And then you're communing with nature in a
gorgeous little town

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.630
surrounded by the Alps.
All these little towns I talk about are easy

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.630
to fall through the
cracks.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.370
Big towns, beautifully preserved, with lots
of great art are going to

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.211
be touristy.
They're going to be, you know, this is a big

00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:24.039
industry.
It's the number one employer and economy in

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.889
most of those countries.
We don't veto a place because it's got tourist

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.450
crowds.
But we think about enjoying it in a way that

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.120
minimizes those crowds.
As a tour operator, we take all these people

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.800
on 20 different
itineraries all around Europe.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.360
You got to go to Mont Saint-Michel.
You got to go to Rothenburg.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.009
You got to Carcassonne and Stratford.
And Brusche and Toledo.

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:44.610
But you don't have to go there when all the
tourists are there.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.110
You see?
We spend the night.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.250
We arrive at four o'clock just when the tour
groups are taking off,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.819
have three hours of sightseeing, a nice dinner,
a little romantic time

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.569
in the ramparts, a good night's sleep, a few
hours of free time in the

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:57.889
morning and then we're out of there before
the place becomes a big zoo

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.419
again.
So, I really like -- this is Toledo here.

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.240
It's the historic and spiritual and artistic
capital of Spain.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.830
It's an incredible place, mobbed by tourists
in the middle of the day

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.180
-- all yours after hours.
Most of the tour groups are staying one hour

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.229
north in the predictable
plumbing of the high-rise hotels in the nearby

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:16.909
big city.
Tour operators -- you got to know how they

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:19.419
work.
And they work to make money.

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:23.050
Their initial cost is a giveaway cost and
they make money off you by

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.850
selling you optional tours.
If they paid too much to sleep right where

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.159
the action is, nobody would
pay $50 for the optional tour to go there.

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:36.469
They pay less money to stay outside of town,
way outside of town in a

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:39.240
hotel that needs to have a price to gather
people.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.939
And then there's no way to get here but to
take the optional tour.

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:46.430
That's 50 people times $50, that's $2500 of
gravy for the tour company.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.449
Do you see what I mean?
That's the kind of thinking you've got to

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:53.169
do in order to take a tour
and take advantage of it so it doesn't take

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:55.180
advantage of you.
If you're going to take a tour rather than

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.030
go independently.
This is Rothenburg ob der Tauber.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.810
If you've been to Germany, you've probably
been to Rothenburg.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.110
It's the greatest little medieval town in
Germany.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.639
Again, packed out in the middle of the day,
all yours at night.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:10.569
So I like to spend the night in these towns.
Venice, infamous for being crowded.

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:13.040
It's never crowded early or late.
It's rush hour.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.810
In the morning, you watch the vaporettos coming
in and all the tenders

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.620
from the cruise ships.
The vaporettos are just packed with boats

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.949
coming in in the morning and
ones going the other direction are empty.

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:24.599
It's just like rush hour here.
At night, those same boats are -- it's a flip-flop

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:26.819
thing.
So just be around early or late.

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:29.699
Have a hotel right downtown.
Take advantage of those magic hours when you

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:32.500
don't have the crowds, and
Venice is all yours.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.130
Now, I think it's really important for us
to remember that Europe is

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.399
not wearing lederhosen and sitting on a stump
and yodeling.

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:43.469
Those days are gone.
Europe is a no nonsense, futuristic, lean

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:46.920
and mean business machine,
cooking up all sorts of stuff to compete with

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.390
us here in the United
States.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.360
It's a futuristic place.
It's a high-powered, energetic business machine.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.040
Germany is the size of Montana with one-third
the population and

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.220
one-third the industrial capacity of our entire
country.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.341
Now, 20, 30 years ago, this was the Berlin
Wall.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.610
Right there.
You could get killed for crossing that street.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.000
Today not a hint of the Berlin Wall except
for Americans looking for

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.220
Checkpoint Charlie.
I love Berlin.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.180
But if you go there, you got to remember the
Cold War and the Berlin

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.850
Wall is kind of old news.
We just had the 20th anniversary of it the

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.279
other day.
Half the people in the streets weren't even

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:22.750
 -- don't have any living
memory of the Cold War, you see.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.250
That's exciting history.
But remember these cities are looking forward

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.240
and we owe it to
ourselves in our travels to spend a day in

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.990
a big city.
Just seeing how it's getting stuff together.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.100
Whether it's Berlin, or whether it's Paris,
or whether it's London.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.209
You know, when you think Paris you probably
don't think of La Défense,

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:44.420
but this is where people work.
They don't work in a cute little shop on Rue

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.850
Cler.
That's a cute place to go.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.470
And I'll hang out in Rue Cler, but I would
think it's just in the

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.440
interest of honesty, it would be good to spent
half a day out here

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.700
seeing what's it's like.
I mean, the lunch I just had here was more

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.310
America, I think, than a
lunch I might have had down on the wharf or

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.010
something like that.
So these are the reality checks we can give

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.220
ourselves.
Having said that, it then is okay, I think

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.810
to get into the cute
medieval stuff.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.570
When you're going to spend a lot of time in
the cute medieval stuff

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.380
know what you're looking at.
It just behooves you to study a little bit

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.639
ahead of time, you know, and
understood what's feudalism.

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:26.000
I mean, this castle was made 700 years ago
when there were 300

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.610
independent countries in what is today Germany.
Each with its own weights and measures, and

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.620
crown jewels, and curfew
and dialect and walls, you see.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.079
Put in a remote spot for defensive purposes.
Now you go to that castle and it actually

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:43.100
makes a little sense.
And then you look at this castle, and you

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.200
realize this is not feudalism
at all.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.790
This is Romanticism.
Neuschwanstein was built in the same generation

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.579
as the Eiffel Tower,
when Germany was uniting.

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:57.180
For five years, I went to this castle and
I thought it was medieval.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.820
It's pointy.
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:08.190
Now you guys are all smart enough to have
a little better, aggressive

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.930
approach to getting prepared for your trip
than just going and thinking

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.230
pointy things are medieval.
The pointiest things are actually faux-medieval,

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.269
built in the late 19th
Century when they were reassessing it, coming

00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:20.310
out the French
Revolution.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.870
Everything was so cerebral, they wanted to
get emotional again.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.170
And underline their Christian/medieval heritage,
you see.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.160
So it's an exciting thing to recognize that
this is textbook

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.170
Romanticism.
And when you understand Romanticism, the "ism"

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.100
of the 19th Century, a
third of your sightseeing takes on some meaning.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.889
One of my favorite kinds of castle is a ruined
castle.

00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:41.610
Here with a little imagination, you're under
attack a thousand years

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.360
ago in Portugal.
What a wonderful place for the picnic.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.290
It's hard to find the ruined castles because
they're free.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.920
And when something is free nobody promotes
it.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.449
Why should they?
They're just rotting away unnoticed on hilltops

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:53.850
from Finland to
Portugal to Greece.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.529
It behooves you to get a little aggressive
in your planning and find

00:11:56.529 --> 00:12:00.160
out where some of these places are.
I recommend buying the best map you can over

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.920
there in your travels and
spend half a traffic jam just learning the

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.139
key.
Know what those little dirt roads are leading

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:08.649
to.
There's ruined castles everywhere that completely

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:11.459
get missed by the
tourism.

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:15.230
There's a lot of great ancient sites but just
because something's B.C.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.641
does not mean it's got to be seen.
All right?

00:12:17.641 --> 00:12:22.829
There is mediocre B.C. stuff.
Be select about your ancient stuff.

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:26.670
And then the stuff you choose to see, see
is it with gusto, understand

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.839
it.
Here we have the most famous aqueduct in all

00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:32.209
of Europe, the Pont du
Gard in Southern France near Aveyron, you

00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:36.220
know.
It's not -- it's not a aqueduct.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.199
It's the most scenic bridge of a 30-mile long
aqueduct.

00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:44.699
Built 2,000 years ago engineered to bring
water using gravity, losing

00:12:44.699 --> 00:12:47.970
about one inch every hundred yards into the
town of Nîmes.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.720
Imagine that.
The Romans recognizing it's stupid to carry

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.350
water when you can let
gravity do it.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.610
Let's design something to dole out that force
of gravity more

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.430
sparingly.
And imagine the jubilation on that day in

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.500
Nîmes 2,000 years ago when
water tumbled into that great city.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.600
Now with that little -- the human aspect of
it, and understand what

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.250
that was all about, all of a sudden visiting
this bridge of the Pont du

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.440
Gard in Southern France, I think it's a little
more rewarding.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.579
But not ten percent of the American tourists
that go there think about

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:19.120
it enough to really be properly turned on
by the site.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.899
I've got lots to get homesick for but it is
not an option when I'm in

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:23.889
Europe.
I'm spent a quarter -- a third of my adult

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:26.450
life, four months a year in
Europe every year for the last 25 years or

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.130
so.
And when I'm there, I am really there.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.829
Psychologically, you want to be there.
It's a trick.

00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:34.949
Some of us are really good at not being there.
We've got all this technical stuff to keep

00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:36.130
us at home if we want to,
you know.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.680
But when you're there, be there.
For a lot of people going to church is an

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.470
important part of their
daily, their weekly routine.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.829
Can't go to church in Europe because you're
far away from home.

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:45.870
Wrong.
You can go to church on Sunday.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.990
You can go to the greatest church in Christendom,
St. Peter's, and take

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.699
a flash photograph of Michelangelo's Pietà.
Or go to Mass right at the that high altar

00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:53.069
above the tomb of Saint
Peter.

00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:57.680
Two different ways to experience that church.
You can be in France during harvest time.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.660
And you got these wiry, wonderful photographic
grape pickers.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.371
You can get your zoom lens out and photograph
them.

00:14:01.371 --> 00:14:04.240
Or you can store your camera and get up there
and pick grapes with

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.569
them.
Two different ways, dramatically different

00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:08.959
ways, to experience that
scene.

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:12.780
Tonight in the little village, grape harvest,
wine -- the harvest

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.730
festival, there's just grape pickers dancing.
And some of them are tourists too.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.480
You can be part of the scene in Europe but
you got to make yourself be

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.380
part of that scene.
You'll be standing in wonderful markets.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.440
You probably have a wonderful farmer's market
around here somewhere.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.480
Every town in Europe's got one like that.
And as tourists sometimes we feel qawky.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.579
We don't speak the language.
We're not good with the metric system.

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:34.009
We don't really know the coins.
We just want to buy one apple and one carrot.

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:38.019
There's a long line of intense people behind
you that just want to do

00:14:38.019 --> 00:14:40.190
some serious business.
And you get a sense that this merchant is

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.120
not pleased to see you.
Hold your ground.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.079
You're not a gawky tourist.
You're one in a thousand year long line of

00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:49.160
hungry travelers who wants
to buy an apple and who doesn't speak the

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.670
language , okay ?
You're part of the scene.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.190
Give yourself that credit.
It makes a huge difference.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.990
Art should be fun.
If the art is not fun, you don't know enough

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.709
about it.
I know that from my own experience.

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:03.100
For years I went to the museums because my
mom said it would be a crime

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.510
not to.
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:11.170
I was surrounded by other people looking like
they were having fun and

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.370
I was convinced they were faking it.
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:16.790
Then I took an art history class and those
museums are altogether

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.050
different experiences.
Know the art.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:23.620
I wrote a book called "Europe 101."
And -- which is the story of Europe from the

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.110
Pyramids to Picasso.
And then a book named "Self-Guided Tours to

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.370
All the Museums."
And it's so much fun to be a tour guide.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.600
For 25 years I was a tour guide, learning
what they need to know and

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.440
just as important what they don't need to
know.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.100
If I study my passion for teaching over the
last 30 years, it's evolved

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.639
in an interesting way.
Kind of like Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:42.509
Starting with the basic stuff and moving into
more fulfilling and

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:45.220
creative and so on.
And I -- for the first decade, it was Europe

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.880
Through the Back Door --
budget tricks, you know.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.750
How do you catch the train?
How do you pack light?

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.709
How do you stay healthy?
Next ten years, in the 90s, I was teaching

00:15:51.709 --> 00:15:53.740
art and history and culture
appreciation.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.291
That was Europe 101 and that's makes -- you
don't go to Europe just to

00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:59.850
get a reasonable bed.
You go to Europe to enjoy the art and the

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.230
culture.
And then in the last decade, I find myself

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.620
teaching broadening your
perspective through travel.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.649
And to me that's the highest sort of thing
to come home with a broader

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:09.639
perspective.
And just last year I wrote a book called Travel

00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:13.190
as a Political Act.
Which has been a topic of a lot of talks that

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.819
I give around the country
and it's online, if you want to find it or

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:19.199
anything.
But it's -- you can get little senses of it

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:21.860
in my talk today.
But boy, when you travel, it is so exciting

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.430
to keep those things in
mind more than just how do you get a cheap

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.813
hotel and a good meal.
But how can you appreciate the art and history

00:16:27.813 --> 00:16:30.000
and culture.
And how it can broaden your perspective.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.149
When you're enjoying art, remember the most
enjoyable art, I think, is

00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:39.040
to see it what they call in situ.
Not in museum but in situ, where the artist

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.250
was paid to make it.
In that church or in that palace or on that

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.730
square, and understand it
in its physical and historic context.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.180
Here we have a piece of art by Fra Angelico,
the greatest painter of

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.870
the High Middle Ages, who was one of the most
spiritual guys you'll

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.709
ever encounter in art history.
For him, painting was a form of prayer.

00:16:55.709 --> 00:16:58.519
They said he couldn't paint a crucifix without
weeping.

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:02.050
And when he went, he was working here in the
monastery run by

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.390
Savonarola.
And Savonarola was the ranting, raving austere

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.240
monk that turned
Florence into a theocracy.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:12.100
Kind of like a Khomeini, I suppose, of the
Renaissance.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.500
And he threw out the Medici, turned the place
into a theocracy.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.539
And everybody was burning all their fleshy,
decadent, hedonistic stuff.

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:21.839
Even Botticelli was throwing some of his canvasses
on those fires as

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:26.131
they made that city a theocracy.
And to be in there and to understand, to be

00:17:26.131 --> 00:17:29.210
in that monastery and to
understand the work of Savonarola and the

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.640
work of Fra Angelico.
To look at this, you see you're understanding

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.789
it in a context.
And then I think it becomes more rewarding

00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:38.480
and more interesting.
All of us have quirky little personal interests,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.210
right?
And when you're studying -- everybody's going

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.090
to see the Mona Lisa, and
the Leaning Tower, and the Beefeaters.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.669
But you really owe it to yourself to know
if there is a little museum

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:53.610
that hits your passion in your travels.
There are museums for thimbles.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.409
There are museums for tattoos.
There's chocolate museums.

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:00.659
There's marijuana museums.
There's beetle museums.

00:18:00.659 --> 00:18:03.860
There's museums filled with art you done by
people who were locked up

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.330
because they were criminally insane.
There's all sorts of fascinating museums.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.490
And they're really quite good.
But you need to take the initiative before

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.020
you get there to find out
where they are and then plan that into your

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.120
trip.
Like you're your own tour guide.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.840
You want to see bones in Rome?
Many people want to see bones in Rome, and

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.480
they go to the catacombs.
There's no bones in the catacombs in Rome.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.760
There are bones in the Cappuccin Crypt right
downtown, and you'll see

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.860
plenty of them there.
I've been really into experiences lately.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.970
I think it's really important for Americans
to have real, vibrant

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.790
experiences.
Not just see a bunch of old stuff on walls

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.659
and museums and galleries
but to go out there in the stadium and party

00:18:39.659 --> 00:18:40.881
with the local people and
so on.

00:18:40.881 --> 00:18:44.669
And when I was in Ireland with my family,
we wanted to make sure we had

00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:47.400
some of those experiences.
And we went to the main stadium to go to a

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.600
hurling match.
Hurling is sort of the national pastime in

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.250
Ireland, kind of like
airborne hockey with no injury time-outs.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.870
It is a very fast and rugged game.
And we were in the stadium with 50,000 Irish

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.950
people.
It occurred to me the streets were full of

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.130
tourists but there wasn't a
single tourist in that stadium.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.730
It was just Irish people.
We bought the right colored banners and stuff,

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.809
and shawls and we had to
remember which team to root for or we'd get

00:19:07.809 --> 00:19:11.809
 -- or we'd get beat up.
Our kids learned a lot of creative ways to

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:14.170
swear, I'll tell you by the
end of that game.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.840
And it was a rich experience.
And no tourist in town took advantage of it.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.809
I mean, it's a clear example of how if you're
a clever tour guide, you

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:26.919
can maximize the experience.
I love nature.

00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:29.520
You probably do, too.
We got great natural wonders around here in

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.570
the West Coast.
The nice thing about Europe's natural wonders

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.720
this they are so
accessible.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.620
This woman looks pretty rugged but I'll admit
that I'm standing on the

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.670
edge of a revolving restaurant to take the
photograph.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:44.870
[LAUGHTER]
Filled with women in high-heeled shoes who

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.049
rode the lift up for
breakfast, okay?

00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:50.070
The point is all you need is $15 and a sunny
day, and you can get to

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.970
the top of those lifts.
And the beautiful news is that the traditional

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:58.080
culture survives quite
vividly in those high nooks and faraway corners.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.250
And your challenge is to get up there and
find it.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.110
Good news is that you can hike or folic all
the way across the Alps

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.090
from France to Slovenia, never come out of
the mountains.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:12.190
Enjoying trails like this and every night
sleep in a hut like this.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.970
For $20 a night.
I mean, it's -- the fun irony is sometimes

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.710
the better places you get
the less expensive they are.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:22.110
In some many cases, that's the way it is.
Here we have a nature freuden hut, a nature

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.549
friends hut.
And it's just -- I could tell you all sorts

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:25.549
of stories about this
place.

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:29.179
But it's just an amazing opportunity if you
know how to get off the

00:20:29.179 --> 00:20:32.700
beaten path and make your trip, the trip that
you really want and

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.470
deserve.
You need up-to-date information.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.809
If you have an old book on Rome, it will tell
you about the Victor

00:20:39.809 --> 00:20:42.590
Emmanuel Monument.
And everybody agrees it is about the ugliest

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.830
building in town, and it
just dominates the center.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.940
It's built up there a hundred years ago in
order to placate the king.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.610
And a new guide book will tell you can take
a elevator up to the top

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:54.520
now.
And enjoy the very best view in all of Rome

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.929
because you don't have to
look at what you're standing on, the Victor

00:20:56.929 --> 00:20:58.190
Emmanuel Monument.
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.640
It's just a -- it's some of the best $10 you
can spend in Italy right

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.970
now, is to get a view of Rome without that
man -- Victor Emmanuel

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.771
Monument by going up to that lift.
Also, you need to have up-to-date information

00:21:09.771 --> 00:21:12.091
as Europe evolves.
Of course, it's an exciting time in Europe

00:21:12.091 --> 00:21:14.770
with the unification and the
Cold War long gone.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.940
And Eastern Europe kicking into gear and catching
up with the West and

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.500
so on.
You go to Berlin, you find a city that's the

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.350
hottest city in Europe.
I mean Berlin is really exciting.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.640
This is the new capitol building in Berlin.
It was sitting on a bombed-out hulk of the

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.281
Reichstag building that was
right there in the Berlin Wall for, you know,

00:21:29.281 --> 00:21:33.000
all since World War II.
And in good European style, they didn't bulldoze

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.870
it and build a new
building when the government went from Bonn

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.690
back to Berlin.
They took the historic building, a blackened,

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.770
bombed-out hulk,
renovated it, incorporated modern architecture

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.279
into that, this
beautiful, glass dome.

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:46.770
And now you got a powerful bit of architectural
symbolism for the

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.860
German people with their new government in
Berlin.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.760
Glass dome -- open, free, open all the time,
free, designed mostly for

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.090
Germans.
But of course, tourists are more than welcome

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.970
to go up that spiral ramp
to the very top.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.870
And then you look down literally over the
shoulders of your legislator

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.970
to see what's going on on their desk.
Power comment to those legislators that people

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.049
are going to keep on eye
on them now, right?

00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:09.580
So I was up there on opening week on the very
top of this beautiful new

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:18.390
thing, surrounded by teary-eyed Germans.
Anytime you're surrounded by teary-eyed Germans,

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.100
something exceptional
is going on, okay?

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.860
And it was clear to me, this is a very emotional,
exciting, symbolic

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.130
moment.
The closing of an ugly chapter in the history

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.690
of great nation.
No more division.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.820
No more communism.
No more fascism.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.010
A new government, a united country, opening
a new century with a new

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.549
capitol building looking into a promising
future.

00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:40.960
Wow.
What a heady time to be up there.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.960
And I looked around, and I saw most of the
tourists who are Americans

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.230
didn't have a clue.
They were completely disconnected.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.059
And it just saddened me.
I thought I don't want to be in a dumbed-down

00:22:49.059 --> 00:22:52.590
society.
And without drawing too much into this, I

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.919
just really feel that there's
powerful forces in our society that would

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:59.029
find it convenient if we were
all just dumbed down.

00:22:59.029 --> 00:23:01.531
Just go shopping and be mindless producer/consumers
and so on.

00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:05.419
And I just sort of vowed in my own work as
a travel writer to expect my

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:08.810
readers and my viewers and my tourists to
be engaged and to have an

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.030
attention span and to care, and to want the
whole story and to come

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.809
back from their trip changed.
And you can too.

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:17.390
But you've got remember the system is going
to try to want to dumb you

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.250
down.
Fun in the sun, frequent flier miles, duty

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.460
free shopping, what's the
power of your sunscreen, all that kind of

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.630
stuff.
There's more important things to travel than

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.461
duty free shopping.
I think you guys know that.

00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:31.490
But for the average American that just goes
on vacation it's not really

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.690
travel.
It's just a break, which is okay but it's

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.540
a lost opportunity.
As Europe unites, of course, we've got most

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.149
of the former Warsaw Pact
countries now part of Western -- part of Europe.

00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:46.010
And overnight a few years ago, ten nations
joined the EU and the

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.970
geographical center of Europe shifted from
Belgium to about the Czech

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.980
Republic.
And it's exciting.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.010
It's a heady time in Eastern Europe right
now.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.350
I mean, when I first was going to Poland people
were taking their

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.961
windshield wipers in with them at night.
It was such a bleak economy.

00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:01.370
This clueless, command economy with no sensitivity
to the laws of

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.270
supply and demand.
Somebody forgot to order windshield wipers.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.580
Thieves got wind of that, steal windshield
wipers and sell it for a

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.100
fortune on the black market.
That's what happens when you don't have the

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.669
laws of supply and demand.
Of course, now they got the laws of supply

00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:13.899
and demand.
It's a festival of pent-up entrepreneurial

00:24:13.899 --> 00:24:17.179
spirit, and people are
leaving their windshield wipers on at night

00:24:17.179 --> 00:24:20.330
in Poland.
And when you travel around there, it is really

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.620
fun.
Prague is the gateway to Eastern Europe.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.770
And it's the greatest city.
But you've got to do more than that.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.289
Prague is quite touristy now and quite expensive.
I love it.

00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:35.059
It's the best beer in Europe for $2 a mug.
I just did a study on beer quality versus

00:24:35.059 --> 00:24:36.860
price, it's perfectly
inversely related.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:42.020
[LAUGHTER]
You know, and they had all this horrible time

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.830
with communism and their
dictators and everything.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.760
And now they've torn down all the statues.
And rather than melt them down, they've gathered

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.130
them in parks.
So you go to these statue parks and you've

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.470
got all these
social/realistic ranting and raving at each

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.961
other instead of the
people.

00:24:52.961 --> 00:24:57.799
[LAUGHTER]
And it's just a fun time to be exploring Eastern

00:24:57.799 --> 00:25:01.159
Europe.
If you want to spice up your trip, go to Turkey.

00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:04.270
I just can't say enough about Turkey.
I absolutely love Turkey.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.380
And it's changing really fast.
I had a TV show out on Turkey that was about

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.360
ten years old.
And I watched it a couple of years ago, and

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.909
I thought this is just
wrong to have this show out.

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:14.150
I need to update it.
It's just -- Istanbul is new city.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:18.539
It's a city of 10 or 15 million people.
They're drilling a tunnel now for the train

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:21.220
between Asia and Europe
under the Bosporus.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.559
And you walk through the streets of Turkey
and you realize --

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:27.530
It's so important for Americans to see a westward-facing,
secular

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.050
Muslim society.
And Turkey is great way to do that.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.720
I think it's been ten years since I flew in
and out of the same city.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.159
Think cleverly about flying into one city
and out of another city.

00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:39.190
Open jaws.
It's no financial penalty.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.390
It's half the round-trip fare from here to
there, half the round trip

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.160
fare from there to there.
And then you don't have to return, spend the

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.700
time and money to the
needless return to your starting point.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.299
And then you're able to organize your trip
in cultural -- culture shock

00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:53.159
order.
Start easy, work hard.

00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:56.200
All right?
It would make no sense to start in Istanbul

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.210
and work your way back to
London.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.900
London would be just a horrible anticlimax.
You want to start in the mild countries and

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.771
mild means England, all
right?

00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:10.460
[LAUGHTER]
I mean, I love England.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.570
If you read my England guide book, you see
my enthusiasm for England.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:17.220
But go there first, when cream teas and roundabouts
are exotic.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.169
Then go to France.
Then go to Italy, then go to Greece.

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:21.350
And finish off in Turkey.
That would make a lot of sense.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.340
And you'd work up into Turkey.
Added advantage, it's delaying places best

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.070
for shopping till the end of
your trip.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.180
I've given up trying to talk people out of
shopping in their travels

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.940
but try not shopping for 80 percent of your
trip.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.029
Finish in the more interesting, cheaper place
and buy up everything

00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:37.990
there and fly home heavy.
Another advantage of structuring your trip

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.590
in the interest of
minimizing culture shock till the end is it

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.790
delays places most
hazardous to your health until the end of

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:50.049
your trip.
Very clever.

00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:52.740
Why get diarrhea early?
Okay?

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.760
[LAUGHTER]
This is a main drag in Istanbul.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.000
And I'll tell you it's, it's this crowded
all day long and into the wee

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.230
hours.
They can't even run the trolley it's got so

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.760
many people on it.
Just to be in that kind of vibrancy is exciting

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.331
for me.
I mentioned we have a tour program.

00:27:07.331 --> 00:27:09.940
It's the hottest thing in my business right
now.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.180
We're working very hard with the 70 or 80
of us up in Seattle at Europe

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.490
Through the Back Door.
And last year we took I think --

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:21.040
Well, we took 12,000 people last year.
This year we're taking 8 or 9,000 people because

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.200
of the economy.
Everybody's down about that much.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.770
So you know it's okay.
I don't think -- when people talk about the

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.470
economy, I don't think we
should have been as hot as we were.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.909
That was all the result of goosing the economy.
You can only goose something so long and pretty

00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:35.010
soon it stops
responding.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.539
And it stopped responding.
So now we're back down to where it should

00:27:37.539 --> 00:27:40.320
be.
That's my take on it, if we're realistic.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.200
And we're fine with 8- or 9,000 people.
I'm just so excited the about job that our

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.090
guides are doing.
And if you're curious about our tour program,

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.230
our tour program is
different than most because there's half as

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.960
many tourists on the same
big bus with a guide who is fully paid up

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.779
front, and cannot make
another penny off you over the course of your

00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:59.740
trip.
So there's no tips, no kickbacks on shopping,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.450
no selling you
sightseeing.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.490
It's all included and you got a guide who
is on your side.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:09.809
And for some people that's just really appreciated.
And that's why well over half of our travelers

00:28:09.809 --> 00:28:11.710
are people who have been
with us before.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:15.010
We've got many people who have taken 8 or
10 or 12 of our itineraries.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.220
So if you're curious about that, you can check
out our itinerary on our

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:23.380
website or in the brochure I handed out today.
The big, normal 50 people on the 50 seat tour

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.130
bus is -- I want to talk
about a constructively because it can be a

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.399
good value because they sell
on impossible price.

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:32.840
It can't be that cheap.
It's no profit.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.530
They make their money off you once you get
over there.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.690
They don't even pay their guide properly.
The guide has to make money by keeping you

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.260
in the dark and taking you
shopping for kickbacks.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.610
Okay?
Now they're giving you transportation and

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.450
hotels cheaper than you could
buy it on your own.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.659
If you want to buy that shell, equip yourself
with a guidebook and skip

00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:53.029
out of the stuff they want you to do.
You could be just freeloading on the tour.

00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:55.640
Just having like a bus pass that comes with
nice, comfortable,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.880
forgettable hotels filled with Americans you
don't want to hang out

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.350
with, all right?
And I mean, I'm serious.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.019
That could be a very efficient, economic sort
of beginning.

00:29:04.019 --> 00:29:07.710
Use it as a springboard to have your own adventure.
If everybody did that, they'd have to change

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.730
their business plan but
you can certainly do that.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.260
These are people here that are probably in
timeshare condos in Southern

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.419
Spain, and they've got one day in their life
in Morocco.

00:29:18.419 --> 00:29:22.210
Excuse me a second here.
They've got one day in their life in Morocco,

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:26.090
and they're spending with
it with a bunch of other people from California.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.200
And here they are.
They've done their little walk through town,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.150
had all the Kodak moments
and they're going to the restaurant in Tangier

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.380
where every American
tourist goes when they have one day of their

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.820
life in Africa, to this
little, touristy restaurant.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:45.529
And there's a charming-looking belly dancer
who looks like Boy George.

00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:49.220
And I mean think of the conversation going
on at this table here.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.500
You know that is to me such a failure for
a traveller to put themself

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.450
into that kind of -- all I could think was
self-imposed hostage crisis,

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:02.820
you know.
You can do Tangier on your own, so easy.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.541
But these people don't do it.
Because they ask somebody in the industry

00:30:06.541 --> 00:30:08.149
is this reasonable for me to
do?

00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:11.149
And the industry, obviously, is wired to say
no.

00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:13.370
You're not capable to doing that.
Take the tour.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.980
We'll make money off of you.
So you're consumers.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.470
You can be more aggressive or less aggressive
but the choice is yours.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.210
I spent 25 years as a tour guide, I know what's
it's like.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.610
I know that the average tour guide is concerned
not about where is the

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.620
cute place for a rest stop, but where can
I park the big bus?

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.620
And can 30 people go to the bathroom at the
same time?

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.950
You know, this is a great stop for a bus driver
but not for somebody

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:39.029
who is interested in that culture.
Many people get on these tours and on day

00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:42.830
two it occurs to them we
could have done this on our own.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.710
But it's too late now.
And for a lot of people that go over there

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.220
 -- and here is the standard
experience.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.130
These people are in a cafeteria in Vienna
listening to local musicians

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.149
play the Strauss waltzes.
I mean, it's -- it used to be a palace.

00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:57.940
The advertising sounds really good.
You know, you go to a palace for lunch and

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.929
you hear the local musicians
play the Strauss waltzes.

00:30:59.929 --> 00:31:02.799
You get there and you realize you're just
part of this whole sort of

00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:07.360
mechanism for giving people canned culture.
And most of these people go home and thought

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.760
they had a good time.
So who am I to say they didn't?

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.679
I just think you can have a much more real
experience and not spend any

00:31:12.679 --> 00:31:16.880
more money if you choose to.
You can be a guest of honor at a Greek wedding

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.409
festival if you simply
put 30 miles between you and next hotel.

00:31:20.409 --> 00:31:23.230
And be in a town with no postcards.
You're staying in somebody's home.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.610
Tomatea.
Every country's got bed and breakfast for

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.179
20 -- for $30 you're staying
upstairs above the tavern.

00:31:29.179 --> 00:31:31.120
And you learn how to the play backgammon with
the locals.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.760
And you're right there the next day -- you're
a guest of honor at the

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.800
wedding festival.
That's real travel and anybody can do it.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.960
So that's what I try to do with our guidebooks
is to try to organize

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.029
the efficiency of all that information into
the book so people can do

00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:46.320
their tours without having to wait with 50
other people and have a tour

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.500
guide with a conflict of interest.
I mentioned Europe Through the Back Door is

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.610
the textbook for all of
this kind of travel.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.970
I'm just skimming the chapter heads of that
book today.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.120
And then we've got 30 different books on all
the different parts of

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.320
Europe.
And each region has it's own sort of flying

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.350
wedge of information with
DVD's, phrase books, and maps, city guides

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.330
and country guides.
It's so fun for us to be updating these books.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:11.659
I think we're the only books out there that
physically visit almost

00:32:11.659 --> 00:32:15.230
every place in the book every year.
And that's just our formula for having a very

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.970
good guidebook.
And they're very driven by connecting people

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.260
with people.
I know the people who run the hotels and the

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.360
restaurants, and they know
us.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:30.610
And they know that they need to earn the business.
Museums can -- museums can ruin a good vacation.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:34.400
And you need to be sorting through that.
We try to do that in our art book.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.030
And one thing I've worked on really hard lately,
which I'm just really

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:40.860
excited about is making my audio tours and
then offering them for free

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.179
on the internet through iTunes.
And we've had a couple million people download

00:32:44.179 --> 00:32:46.740
our tours.
They're the same tours in the book.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.370
But we've designed them so you just have it
in your ear and then just

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:53.059
be lost in that site instead of having your
eyes buried in a book.

00:32:53.059 --> 00:32:56.640
It is so cool for anybody with the MP3 or
an iPod to be able to do

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.000
that.
And I like the idea of just having it free.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.610
And we're doing a lot more of those, so we've
got all the essential

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:06.529
sites covered absolutely free.
In London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome.

00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:12.789
And that's a bigger and bigger part of our
program.

00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:16.460
Our radio show has been a lot of fun lately.
We're in 150 different cities every week for

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.429
an hour.
And it's also one of the leading podcasts.

00:33:20.429 --> 00:33:25.140
It's a 55-minute hourly show.
And a lot of it is Europe and a lot of it

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.160
is not.
So if you're curious about that, we're working

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.419
on a thing now where we
deconstruct all those shows, and then put

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:32.990
them by topic.
So you can just type in "Spain" and then get

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.360
a playlist all of the
stuff we've ever done relating to Spain.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.169
And you can just travel with that.
So when you're sitting on the train coming

00:33:38.169 --> 00:33:41.510
into Madrid, you can hear
interviews and talk to people and so on.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:44.821
And with the radio, I get so much fun, interesting
people to talk to.

00:33:44.821 --> 00:33:51.030
I was just talking to the Princess of Norway.
I got to ask her what's it like to be royalty

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.450
in the 21st Century?
And do you still marry your cousins?

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:57.889
And are you all a little bit deformed?
You know, and things that I always wanted

00:33:57.889 --> 00:34:01.279
to know and then ask and then
design it into a radio show.

00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:07.720
So it's all on our website there.
The Internet is such a powerful tool for travellers.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.720
I don't -- I don't need to tell you guys that.
But it's just so exciting what's going on.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.950
I just tell people I don't care how un-savvy
you are with this.

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:18.820
You've got to get with it when it comes to
using the cyber cafes or the

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.500
you know, the things that let you travel smarter
in Europe using the

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.510
Internet.
Tourist information offices are available

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.170
everywhere, and that's
because they're a huge part of each economy

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.680
is tourism.
And they've got all sorts of information to

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.830
help you organize your time
well.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.900
One of my favorite things to take advance
of is local guided walks.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.740
They are usually done by retired school teachers
or people that are

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.850
just aficionados of their little town.
If there's any tourism, if there's any history

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.600
there, they'll have a
guided walk organized by the tourist office

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.050
for the public.
The nice thing about that is you pay $15 each

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.150
instead of $200 for the
guide.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:53.150
And it's organized by the tourist office.
It becomes very affordable and quite a nice

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.290
thing to do.
So all over Europe, you'll find these guided

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.730
walks.
I think they're always time and money well-spent.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.810
A new kind of tour is a bike tour.
Where you get bikes and a guide, and you cover

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.290
more ground get a little
exercise and it's a fun memory.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.790
But anywhere you're traveling, if you have
a good local guide I think

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:11.720
it's makes a difference.
You do not have a burro to carry your gear.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.890
You need to pack light.
These people are packing too heavy.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.760
When I go to Europe, I see people like this
I wonder, what do you need

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.300
to have all these big burdensome bags, you
know?

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.870
Even young travellers a lot of times have
just too much.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.430
Unless you're camping, don't pack like you're
camping, okay?

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.930
You need to be mobile.
These people got it right.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.430
9 by 22 by 14 inches.
That's as much as I allow myself on a trip.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.380
I've lived out of carry-on, airplane-sized
bag for a third of my adult

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.380
life.
If I had cherpas, I would set them free.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:45.060
It's not a hardship to pack light.
It's a blessing to pack light.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.680
You just don't need that much stuff.
Now, way beyond the scope of today's class

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.210
 -- but these are very
popular kind of bags that double as a rucksack

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.940
or a suitcase.
A lot of people like wheels the same sort

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.220
of thing.
It doesn't matter either way.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.500
If you want wheels, use wheels.
It just cost you $50 extra, and you've got

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.000
a few more pounds of gear.
But it's a beautiful thing for a lot of people.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.590
As long as I'm able to carry it on my back,
personally, that's what I

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.680
will do.
This is one of our tours.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.020
And you can see, here's our guide Lisa and
she's got her --

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.340
What's that?
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.810
Yeah, right.
In Luka?

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.650
Wow, you know that street?
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.540
That's great.
I've never had anybody burst out "Via Falunega"

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.900
[LAUGHTER]
What is it?

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:35.750
Via Falunega?
Well, Lisa here on Via Falunega is traveling

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.870
well.
She's got her bag and every day she goes to

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.321
the bus or the train
station as a good traveller like that.

00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:43.720
This guy is packing like I would be with a
bag on his back.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.840
This is my son.
He's strong enough to not even put it on his

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.840
back.
He just carries it that way.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.680
But these people are mobile.
And the reality is they don't show you this

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.200
in the tour brochures, but
every day or every two days, you got to pack

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.251
up and carry it to the bus
or carry it to the train.

00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:59.420
A lot of walking with your gear.
You want to be mobile.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.380
Exactly what you put in there is covered in
my Europe Through the Back

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.130
Door book.
People just want to know exactly.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.400
I feel like kind of -- it doesn't really matter
exactly how I pack, but

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.901
they insist.
So one time I just decided, okay, I'll give

00:37:09.901 --> 00:37:12.380
it to them.
I spread everything out on the bed on the

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.750
hotel.
There I was naked with my camera just inventorying

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.640
it.
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:25.140
And you know all the little details are covered.
The language barrier for a whole generation

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.371
have been saying it's not a
big deal, and it's certainly not a big deal

00:37:27.371 --> 00:37:29.200
now.
I always used to say talk to somebody who

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.890
is young, they're likely to
speak English.

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.570
Well, those young people are now in their
50s.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:36.550
And you know just anybody who's educated in
Europe, anybody who's in

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.150
the tourist business, anybody who's in any
kind of real serious

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.470
business seems to speak English as a second
language.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.250
We're lucky.
We speak the language that works.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:49.540
If you meet a Greek hiking in the Alps who
meets a Norweigian, how do

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.020
you think they'll communicate?
Broken English.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.851
What Greek speaks Norweigian?
Think about it.

00:37:55.851 --> 00:37:59.510
It just doesn't happen.
You're Norweigian, you want to have a bigger

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.340
world than four million
people who speak your language, you're going

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.920
to learn English.
So we're the ones that are the beneficiaries

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.090
assuming you're a
monoglot.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.900
If you speak another language, that's great.
But if you just speak English, don't let that

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.430
inhibit where you can
travel.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:14.240
You remember, you got signs that are multilingual
and you can make

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.780
educated guesses.
If you're not feeling well in Denmark and

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:22.790
you see a sign with a Red
Cross on it pointing to "central sick house."

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:26.880
[LAUGHTER]
Can you read that?

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.670
Well, go get fixed up.
It's impressive to me how many Americans would

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:34.440
bleed to death in the
street corner looking for the word hospital.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.020
I've never looked up any of these words but
I make educated guesses.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.110
You got -- it's not answers out of the blue,
you know.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.270
It's an easy, educated guess, multiple choice
kind of thing.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.770
For instance, you look at this sign and it's
 -- you don't say what on

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.110
earth is that?
You say, what could it be?

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.840
These are hours so this could only be hours.
It could only be open times or closed times,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.840
that's what they're
telling you.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.070
So you think about, what would they be advertising?
They're advertising open times.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:02.500
Vom -- from. Vom/from, if it rhymes, go for
it.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.770
The Fourth of July.
On the left you see six words, most of which

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:10.310
end in "tag," first one?
Monday.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:16.060
Good.
"Mittwoch" -- midweek, Wednesday.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:23.600
"Tag" is like Guten Tag.
Soup of the "tag." There's a lot of "tags"

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.120
you'll encounter.
It's open from 9 to 11 "und" from 4 to 6.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.320
Anything over 12, subtract 12 and add p.m.
At the risk of insulting my students, I just

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.100
make a real point you know
get this 24-hour clock.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.490
There's a lot of people been over there for
two weeks, they still go

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:43.430
giddy every time it goes over 12, you know.
So 16 minus 12 is 4 p.m.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:47.650
On Wednesday afternoon, something different
happens.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:50.820
Okay.
There's only two possibilities: Open or closed.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.650
Everything else is open.
This is different.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.770
With all the confidence in the world you can
tell your friends on

00:39:54.770 --> 00:40:02.250
Wednesdays, on Mittwoch, after Mittwoch, nachmittag,
it's geschlossen.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.620
If there's two thieves in town you're going
to meet them.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.820
You know?
Because thieves target Americans.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.100
Not because they're mean but because they're
smart.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.340
If I was a street thief in Europe, I'd specialize
in Americans.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.180
I'd have a little card that says "Yanks Are
Us."

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.410
We're the people with all the good stuff in
our purses and wallets.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.110
So leave your valuables at home or in the
hotel room or tie them under

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.250
your waist tucked in like a shirttail in a
money belt.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:28.840
Very, very important.
It's not dangerous over there.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.920
It's just petty theft.
Nobody's getting knifed and mugged, all right?

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.750
Beggars are all over the place.
And you're going to see them because you're

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:36.590
out in the streets.
And they target the tourist attractions and

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:39.530
so on.
Beggars are not beggars -- that's their front.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.440
They are pickpockets.
When you know that, and if you're wearing

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.940
a money belt, it's no big
scary deal.

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.221
In fact, if you know beggars are actually
pickpockets and you're

00:40:47.221 --> 00:40:49.850
wearing a money belt, having a gypsy's hand
slip slowly into your

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:56.040
pocket is just one more interesting cultural
experience.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:01.170
[LAUGHTER]
Every year, several times a stranger's hand

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.900
slips slowly into my
pocket.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.600
And I just leave them there.
They think I'm dead.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:14.750
[LAUGHTER]
Terrorism -- I'll just tell you in a nutshell,

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.570
terrorism is overrated.
And I think you should tell all your friends

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.020
that.
And every time Americans freak out because

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.000
of something like this to
get a grip.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.391
All right?
We are 300 million people.

00:41:24.391 --> 00:41:29.190
We're four percent of this planet.
We spend as much as everybody else put together

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.200
on our military, and
even Obama cannot get elected without promising

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.370
more.
We got military bases in 140 countries.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.310
Only the United States of America can declare
somebody else's natural

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:42.410
resources on the other side of the planet
quote, "vital to our national

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:46.280
security interests."
At least those poor people would prefer if

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.890
were honest enough to say
vital to our accustomed material lifestyle.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.580
Half of the world's trying to live on $2 a
day.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.960
That's not a liberal or a conservative thing,
that's just a fact.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.140
The average lot in women on this planet is
to walk for water every day.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.990
A billion people are trying to live on $1
a day.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.280
When the United Nations get together to try
to deal with the problem

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.880
that matters to the desperately poor half
of humanity, routinely our

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:13.020
country is outvoted 140 to 4.
Who stands with us on issues of child labor

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.120
laws, water, third world
debt relief, land mines and this kind of thing?

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.360
Who stands with us?
Israel, Marshall Islands and Micronesia.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.370
That's the coalition of the compassionate,
caring ones.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:29.590
Now that's -- doesn't matter what I think.
That's what the other 96 percent of humanity

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:32.300
thinks, if they know.
If they're at all engaged.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.470
They look at us like an empire because we
act like an empire.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.060
We don't like to think of ourselves as an
empire.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:42.620
But, you know, it doesn't really matter.
So are there going to be disgruntled people

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.510
at the fringes of an
empire?

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:47.420
Have there ever been an empire that didn't
have disgruntled people at

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.130
the fringes?
The empire gets to call them whatever they

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:53.120
want.
Barbarians, anarchists, terrorists, whatever.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.130
I mean, it's so easy to condemn people if
they're terrorists.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:59.360
Somebody doesn't like our oil plant in Nigeria,
they're terrorists if

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.060
they disagree with us.
They're just terrorists and we'll all go amen,

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.750
kill them.
So we've got some interesting challenges to

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:06.560
deal with.
We're making some progress.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.670
But there's always going to terrorism and
there always will be

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:14.950
terrorism and Norway will not be targeted.
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:19.590
Now, tomorrow if an American is beheaded by
a Jihadist in Madrid, it

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.880
doesn't matter.
That's one person.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.220
You know?
I mean, 300,000 people -- why, you know the

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.420
story.
I mean every week a hundred thousand kids

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.090
die because nobody's got any
money for inoculations.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:33.090
If you cared about people, there's plenty
of things we could do.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.330
So we just got to remember, if you're really
hate terrorism, the best

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:39.540
thing we can do is travel, learn about the
world, come home and help

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.780
our country fit better into this planet.
And to realize that the worst thing we can

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.340
do if there is a terrorist
event is to be terrorized by it.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.370
England as a matter of principle does not
let the terrorists terrorize

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.520
them.
And it's quite effective.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.540
We, as a matter of principle, freak out every
time there's a terrorist

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.820
event.
And that's exactly what terrorists want to

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.020
happen.
They have send the video clips for our people

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:03.570
to air and we do.
And then we all clench our fist and try to

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:06.320
hit them.
So it's a real weird thing going on.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.160
And we got to start standing up and getting
a grip on this with the

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.200
media that can make so much problem this way
with a general electorate

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.820
here that has a tough time understanding this
sort of thing.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:22.730
Don't let terrorism stop you from traveling.
Terrorism is a good reason to travel.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:26.980
And if you want to be statistical about it,
anybody knows you're safer

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:31.790
in Europe than you are here.
We lose 15,000 people a year to handguns on

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:35.680
our streets.
Europe loses one-eighth of that.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.680
Because they don't have guns like we do.
Europeans laugh out loud when they hear that

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.170
Americans are staying home
for safety reasons.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.310
If you care about your loved ones you will
take them to Europe tomorrow

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:50.860
for God sakes.
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:55.270
This is how I sell tours.
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:58.440
The stop U.S.A. stuff, whenever you see that
 -- and you don't see it

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.050
anywhere near as much now as you did a couple
years ago --

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:03.660
but it's not anti-you or me. It's anti-American
war, anti-American

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.330
trade policy, anti-American that kind of stuff.
They love the ideals of America, and they

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.760
love Americans.
And they're thankful for what we've done in

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.350
the past.
That's good news.

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:18.230
You do not need to wear a Canadian flag.
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.050
I just took a thousand people to France and
asked each one of them in a

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:24.560
survey how were you treated by the locals.
Nobody complained, you know.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.880
It's just exciting to be over there and they're
happy we care.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.110
Europe's uniting 300 million people with the
one big free trade zone

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:32.960
now.
300 million people with the same coins in

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.110
their pockets.
The key for changing money, ATM.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:38.400
I've changed my last traveller's check.
That's for sure.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.650
Europe is getting more and more automated.
And if you're not comfortable with machines,

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:49.110
you will stand in line and
get lousy service and pay a premium for it.

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:53.000
Anybody who has to stand in line to buy something
in Europe can do it

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.970
but it's the last priority for them.
And people get disgruntled about it.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.340
And they're the root of their own problem
because they refuse to use

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.790
the machines.
I'm pretty slow when it comes to using machines.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:05.310
I'd rather give money to a real person at
a window but that's becoming

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:09.610
more and more expensive in Europe.
And you just got to get hip with the machines.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:11.790
Europe is deregulated from a flying point
of view.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.800
Nowadays you fly anywhere cheaper than taking
the train.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.482
So before you buy a long train ticket or bus
ride drop into a travel

00:46:17.482 --> 00:46:20.530
agency or go online and figure out what the
deal is for the best budget

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:25.870
flight.
Europe has an internal Marshall Plan, investing

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.900
in their infrastructure
like we cannot imagine.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.130
It's a bugaboo for me cause every time I go
to update my book, the

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:34.660
driving time is shorter.
And I have to rewrite it.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.392
I mean, there's new bridges.
There's new tunnels, more important than ever

00:46:37.392 --> 00:46:39.190
to realize that if you
want to smell the roses, you got to get off

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:42.350
the Autobahn and onto those
small roads.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:45.490
When I really talk about packing light, I'll
tell you some people just

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:49.040
don't want to pack light.
And then I say, you should rent a car.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.260
You can even rent a trailer.
Okay?

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.760
But if you're going to be going by train that's
where it's really

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.260
important to pack light.
By car, you can put everything in the trunk

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.520
and drive from door to door
to where you want to go.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.210
It's quite nice.
Europe is small and it's smaller by rail.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:05.800
And Europe is investing itself now where you
got these super bullet

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.760
trains all over the place.
This is the new grandest, most powerful exciting

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.190
train station in
Europe in Berlin, the Hauptbahnhof.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:15.020
Major train lines coming together at different
levels at right angles.

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:18.050
And it's just breathtaking to be in Europe
these days and see these

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:22.481
bullet trains and to use them.
Just recently, I was in Munich at the train

00:47:22.481 --> 00:47:25.990
station and I was taking
pictures of trains coming into the station.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:28.730
Specifically, birds little cute little birds
squished onto the

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:32.020
windshields of the trains.
And my first thought when I saw that little

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.450
bird was, you'd wait all
your life to see a bird squished to the windshield

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:37.610
of a train where I
come from, you know ?

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:39.920
[LAUGHTER]
I'm sorry.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:45.490
I just -- it's not very nice.
But if you're -- if you're a slow bird, avoid

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:49.410
those shiny parallel
rails on the earth there, you know.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:53.610
It's just fast on those trains.
And things are synchronized.

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.160
I mean, if there's two trains a day coming
into this little village on

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.780
the fjord, they'll be two boats a day leaving.
And you'll have just enough time to get a

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.720
cup of coffee get on the boat
and carry on.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.480
Own over Europe, except in Italy, where the
train comes in just in time

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.540
to see the boat pulling out.
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:14.400
You can count on that synchronicity, all right?
Now, the big question for consumers is if

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.451
you're on a budget are you
going to go first class or second class?

00:48:16.451 --> 00:48:19.780
Second class is four seats across and more
crowded.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.060
First class is three seats across less crowded.
They cost 50 percent more per kilometer to

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.430
go first class instead of
second class.

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:28.600
If I want to get something done and if I just
to be quiet and luxurious

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.710
and I've got some extra money, it's nice to
go first class.

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:33.670
But if you're concerned about transportation,
nearly every train in

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:37.520
Europe has both first and second class cars
on them going precisely the

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:42.090
same speed, all right?
So the best deal, I would say, is second class.

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.450
Any night you spend on the train you save
a whole day on the itinerary

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:48.130
by sitting there up all day, and I love sleeping
on the train.

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:51.650
And for $25 or $30 you get a cueshet, a door
that locks, and an

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.830
attendant that takes care of your passport.
And it works really well.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.010
We sell a lot of you're rail passes at Europe
Through the Back Door if

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.600
you're curious about any of the Eurail stuff,
we're happy to help you

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.530
out on that.
I'm going to go pretty quick here because

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.770
I don't even -- I think I'm
running out of time.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:09.500
But, actually let me check.
What time is it?

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.090
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]
Is it ten minutes to two?

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.110
10 to 2.
Okay, so I'm to going.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:16.270
This is going to be like movies.
Use the public transportation.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:20.710
I just love Europe's public transportation.
When it comes to eating, you really -- as

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.430
I mentioned earlier, you
don't want to be attracted to the biggest

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.990
neon signs that brags we
speak English and accept Visa cards.

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:28.100
We want somebody who loves their work, who's
got a low-rent kind of

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.960
place away from the tourist crowds with the
small menu in one language

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.410
that's handwritten.
Small because they're not catering to people

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:39.550
who want a huge choice.
Handwritten because it changes every day according

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.250
to what's fresh in
the market.

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:44.800
And in one language because their passion
is for feeding local people

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.980
well.
They're well-happy to have tourists there.

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.940
But when you see that one-language menu, small,
changing all the time,

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.650
and you take one look and you see a local
crowd of happy people, you

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:55.550
know it's a good value.
So that would be a good restaurant right here

00:49:55.550 --> 00:50:00.120
in downtown Rome.
You can go to, you know, self-service cafeterias

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.030
in any department
store and eat cheap with the locals.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:05.570
You can go to bus stations and eat bad and
cheap with the locals.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:08.950
There's just plenty of ways you can eat cheap.
Europeans are feeling the crunch just like

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:11.990
we are.
And you find a lot of Germans sharing that

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:13.800
bratwurst and kraut and a
beer, you know.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:18.000
It's just everybody's on a tight budget, it
seems like, and more people

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.160
are just ordering water and sharing dessert
and so on.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.850
So if your budget requires that, you can do
that and people will

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:26.690
understand.
Lots of good food for immigrant labor.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:29.520
All over Europe they've got immigrant labor
just like we do in the

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.670
United States.
And wonderful food for that budget level.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:36.210
And I'm a big fan of Turkish food when I'm
in Germany, for instance.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:41.330
Every place in Europe has the daily special.
The Blue Plate special, the doggen schwet,

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.950
the plat du jour, pub grub,
the pre-dinner.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:48.480
The pre-theater dinner and so on, where for
$15 you get a good hot,

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.000
meal.
This is Stockholm downtown, the old part of

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.750
town.
It's $10 for a lunch with a salad, bread,

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.340
and a drink.
Stockholm's famously expensive.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:03.140
$10 for lunch with a drink, that's not too
bad, 2009.

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.890
And then you save enough money to dine out
and spend 50 bucks every 2

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:08.150
or 3 nights, you know.
It just depends on your budget.

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:10.281
No matter how tight your budget is you owe
it to yourself to get out

00:51:10.281 --> 00:51:13.820
there and splurge a few times.
Learn how to say, you know, "three spoons,

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:18.800
please."
Picnicking is your budget mainstay.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.391
It's hard to spend much money picnicking and
I just love the quality of

00:51:21.391 --> 00:51:24.460
the food.
This would be for more than one person.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:27.450
But I'm talking -- I'm talking per person
cost.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.670
If there's just you, yeah, and your partner,
this is a quick dashboard

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:32.970
lunch between castles in Wales.
It's hearty.

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:36.930
It's nutritious, it's fast, it's cheap.
And you're going to relax and dine that evening.

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:40.440
My son was just in Rome for a semester.
And he taught me how cheaply you can live

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.250
even in the very expensive
city if you're away from the tourists.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.610
You know, that's the big trick.
You're going to spend double for your coffee

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.170
if you're within any sight
of any tourist attraction.

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:56.790
I want to talk just for a second about budget
hotels.

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.070
And I'm glad I got help with slides here because
I lot of people think

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:01.163
I'm talking about this.
I'm not talking about this at all.

00:52:01.163 --> 00:52:04.640
This is Turkey -- $3 for the double, barely
worth it actually.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:10.080
But there are lousy hotels in Europe.
You know, nongovernment-regulated flophouses

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:14.480
where for $25, you get a
bed and a kitten tossed in for no extra.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.849
And I'm not talking about these, either.
What I'm talking about is an alternative to

00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:18.030
this.
This is what defeats people.

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:20.650
This is what people are spending $300 or $400
a night on, running out

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:23.210
of money early, flying home shaking their
heads, thinking my goodness

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:26.270
how can people afford travel in this crazy
day and age.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.300
Well, they're buying into that intercontinental
category.

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:32.740
If you want to go local, there are guest houses,
there are B&amp;B's, there

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:36.110
are Zimmers, there are all sorts of fun penzionnes
where you are, for

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:39.860
$80 or $100, enjoying a great double including
breakfast.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:43.740
You just got to know where to go.
I mean Francois here runs a wonderful little

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.680
two-star hotel less than
$100 next year.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.570
Downtown Paris on a pedestrian-only street,
seven blocks from the

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:52.700
Eiffel Tower.
A market of -- just a pedestrian market right

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.640
in front of her hotel.
You step out in the morning, you feel like

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.300
you must have been a poodle
in your previous life.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:01.520
I mean, it's just amazing on Rue Cler, if
you want to have that.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.140
Smoking is no longer a big deal in Europe
because smokers die younger.

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.440
It's that simple, there's no more smokers
over there.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.991
And they don't let you smoke in the pubs or
anything like that.

00:53:10.991 --> 00:53:13.270
So a lot of people used to love the pubs but
hate the smoke.

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:16.520
Now you can love the pubs and not have smokey
clothes when you leave

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.520
there.
The big deal about having a toilet in your

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.030
room is no longer an issue
because almost every room in Europe has been

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:23.480
gutted and retrofitted
with a little yacht-type heads.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.850
You're going to get a decent toilet and shower
in your room.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.380
If you find a room without a toilet and shower,
you'll save quite a bit

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.350
of money.
Most people want to spend 30 bucks extra a

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.350
night to have that
convenience.

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:36.400
B&amp;B's -- every country's got B&amp;B's, you just
got to know where to look.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.970
This woman runs a beautiful place in Florence.
I just love to stay with her.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:43.170
$70 or $80 for a double and Mama Roboti is
your host, you know.

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:46.990
This is Kathleen Farrel who runs a little
place in the west coast of

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.690
Ireland.
And she's just so excited that Ricky from

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:53.980
"Seedle" is here.
And you know, now, you be back by 8 o'clock

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:56.390
because Denny and his band
are playing Irish folk music tonight at the

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:58.360
pub.
I mean, she's excited about your visit.

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.560
And that's the beautiful thing, that sort
of irony of spending less and

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.240
getting more, because you're staying in somebody's
home who's excited

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.780
about your visit.
If you traveling with a family, the more people

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.400
you pack into the room,
the cheaper it gets.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:13.000
That's kind of common sense.
And youth hosteling is open to anybody.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.700
Europe has thousands of youth hostels.
There are new institutional high-rise hostels

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:20.070
offering institutional
kind of beds like this one in Copenhagen which

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:21.600
is a huge saving
compared to hotels.

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:26.750
And again it's open to absolutely anybody.
And they're very good sources of information

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:29.630
where you can rent
bicycles or team up for this or that, and

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.640
cook together in the member's
kitchen and so on.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.380
A lot of people think youth hosteling, can
I still do that?

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.680
Well, these people are youth hostelers.
And they took "youth" out of the name of this

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.600
system.
If you're over 55, you get a discount on the

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.310
membership card, okay?
So if you're alive, you are young enough to

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:49.640
hostel.
There's no age limit for this kind of travel.

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:53.570
You do have to be a good walker.
If you're wondering is this a little demanding

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:55.600
for me physically or
anything like that -- I would say the most

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.311
gruelling thing about
European travel is the heat and the crowds

00:54:58.311 --> 00:55:01.600
of summer.
Do yourself a favor and go on shoulder's time,

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.780
you know, April,
October, a beautiful time to go. In Europe,

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.310
they say there's no bad
weather just inappropriate clothing.

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:09.950
So dress for the weather and you should be
fine.

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:12.980
It's crowded with people that live there.
It's crowded with all of us who hustle in

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:15.830
every year.
As far as I'm concerned, there's two IQs of

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:19.430
Europeans travellers --
those who wait in lines and those who don't

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:21.640
wait in lines.
If you're waiting in line, you're messing

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.110
up.
You may be a great computer software designer

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.760
but you just are screwing
up because you don't know how to get into

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:31.020
the Colosseum without waiting
for two hours to get your ticket.

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:36.120
This line is not waiting to get into the Colosseum.
It's waiting to buy a ticket to get into the

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.090
Colosseum.
All over Europe the lines are to get tickets

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:40.500
not to get in.
And there's lots of alternative ways to get

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.090
tickets.
And that's your challenge is to find those

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:44.950
out.
The Colosseum ticket also includes the Palatine

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:47.870
Hill.
A lot of times a site nobody wants to go to

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:50.420
is paired with the site
everybody wants to go to, so they can make

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.250
you buy entrance to both of
them.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.990
That's a way to raise prices and encourage
people to go to the site

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:58.420
nobody wants to see.
The good news is you can go to site nobody

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.260
wants to see, buy the ticket
there, and walk by all these people.

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:06.040
And you'll save an hour of your time in Rome,
and not get the sunburn

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.580
by standing out in line all day.
This is a huge line to get into the Versailles

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:13.260
Palace in Paris.
Now if you're -- I mean, so many people it's

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.980
Tuesday.
All the museums are closed, what should we

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.120
do?
Let's go to Versailles, it's open.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:20.430
Not a unique brainstorm.
Any guidebook recommends you avoid Versailles

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:22.330
on Tuesday.
The average tourist does not get around to

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:25.430
reading their guidebook
until they're about right there in the line.

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:29.290
[LAUGHTER]
And then they realize, oh, we should have

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:33.070
gone on Monday.
If you arrive any day of the week but Tuesday

00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:35.600
late in the day, you can
be waltzing all alone with your favorite travel

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.680
partner in the Hall of
Mirrors.

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.740
That's good news.
And more and more important sites are letting

00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:42.960
you make appointments in
advance so that you can just walk right up

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.700
and go in.
That's the beautiful thing about Internet

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:49.370
combining with your travels.
Or you have the option of just simply going

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:51.440
where there are no
tourists.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.320
I spent four months last year traveling in
and probably two months of

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.140
the time, there were not a hint of a crowd
anywhere and I was having a

00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:00.240
great time.
Go to an island in Greece you can't even name.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.720
There's always enough commerce there you can
play backgammon with this

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.732
guy.
You've never forget this game and I'm sure

00:57:04.732 --> 00:57:06.370
he never has forgot that
game either.

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.370
All right?
You need to be an extrovert.

00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:14.320
If you see four cute guys sitting on a bench,
ask them to scoot over.

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:19.670
I've been saying this for 25 years and it
works great.

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:21.790
Well, we've had a lot of fun making our TV
show over the years.

00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:25.750
I know it runs here on KTEC, is that the channel?
The public television channel?

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:29.390
KTEH, that's right.
KTEH and KQED.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:33.430
And I appreciate you staying tuned to that.
We've got a lot of great shows in the works

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:35.830
right now.
I'm very excited about what we're able to

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:39.780
do through public television.
And my crew just works so hard to put some

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.360
good stuff together.
It's fun as a tour guide and a TV producer

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.671
to be able to pack all that
into the DVD's now, where he can have all

00:57:44.671 --> 00:57:48.220
of our shows in one quite
affordable anthology.

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:51.920
Our tour program is just something we're very
proud of.

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.150
Beautiful, big comfortable buses, great drivers,
and small groups.

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:59.090
Groups that are like-minded.
Because of the way we promote our tours, it

00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:01.780
makes the kind of people
that take our tours actually fun to hang out

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.960
with.
So if you want the economy and efficiency

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:09.110
of organized travel without
the downside of organized travel, look around

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:12.030
and consider our company.
And I think you'll find that it is, when all

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:14.830
the dust settles, if your
time is worth a lot, it's really -- you're

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:19.190
going to experience probably
30 percent more per day without the downside

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:22.960
of organized travel.
When I go on a vacation, I get a deal but

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.231
I take my own tours.
And it's just a lot of fun.

00:58:25.231 --> 00:58:29.260
This is my wife and I on our Greece tour recently.
Our guides make the art fun.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:32.110
And we know local guides that you've seen
on our TV shows that really

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:35.280
tell the story in a vivid, intimate kind of
way.

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:38.090
This is our first tour that we're doing way
back in the 70s, and today

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:41.880
we've got tours all over Europe.
So it's really a fun, fun sort of work to

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:45.030
be in and you can learn more
about that on our website or in the material

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:47.850
that we passed out.
My passion is for people to do it on their

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.210
own.
Anybody who wants to do it on their own certainly

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:53.010
can.
My confidence is based on feedback I get from

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:54.700
people whose
grandchildren said you shouldn't be doing

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:57.520
this, over there having the
time of their life, coming back with money

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.890
in the bank for next
summer's trip.

00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:01.990
If you want to travel this way, the key is
equip yourself with good

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:05.060
information and expect yourself to travel
smart and then you can be

00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.880
your own tour guide.
That what we do at Europe Through the Back

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.710
Door.
This is my gang up in Seattle.

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:13.050
And Europe is better designed than ever.
They'll carve your wooden shoes.

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:16.120
You can go to those art museums now with great
high-tech sort of

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:22.870
information on the different teaching devices.
The traditional culture survives if you know

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:26.250
where to find it.
That's the good news even in this modern day

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:28.340
and age.
You can be up there and switch on the right

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.240
day when the goats are
brought through the town.

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:35.310
You can find yourself on those wonderful far
corners, and gorgeous back

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:38.510
door sites that make Europe such a magical
place to visit.

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:39.740
All right.
Thank you have much.

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:46.080
Happy travels.
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:50.460
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:55.750
[APPLAUSE]
Thanks a lot.

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:58.990
And -- thank you.
And I got to say for everybody that enjoys

00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:01.780
the work you guys do here
it's really a thrill for me just as a consumer

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:05.240
of Google stuff to be
able to be here and see what this is and thank

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.930
you for that.
Do I have time for questions?

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.710
Okay.
So if, if you got to go, you're going to miss

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:13.201
out on a lot of important
information.

01:00:13.201 --> 01:00:15.300
Okay.
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.410
Okay.
[PAUSE]

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:34.210
&gt;&gt;Okay. So whoever has questions if you guys
could comp here to the

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:40.490
mike.
[PAUSE]

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:47.240
RICK STEVES: Okay, question?
Yeah?

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.990
&gt;&gt;I've watched all of your programs.
And I always wonder when are you going to

01:00:53.990 --> 01:01:01.960
plan to travel to Russia?
Saint Petersburg, Golden Gate, Ring around

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960
the Moscow would be
fantastic sites for you to explore with the

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960
rest of us?

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960
RICK STEVES: The question is when am I going
to go to Russia.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.540
As soon as Russia learns how to welcome tourists
with no visa and

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:12.320
better, well-organized, fair system for hotels.
I love going to Russia.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.990
It's beautiful to go there.
Saint Petersburg is one of my favorite cities,

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:19.160
really.
And we take our tours there with Helsinki

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.310
and Estonia.
But it's -- Russia's going to warm up to that.

01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:25.870
And I think it's great for people to go to
Russia.

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:30.250
But from a mass tourism point of view, it's
still -- I am not convinced

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:35.420
that the infrastructure is there with a -- sort
of a price for locals

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.730
that's not gouging them.
And the visa thing is frustrating to me.

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:40.830
But obviously it's going happen and it's very
exciting.

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:44.110
As soon as Russia's opened up to tourism more,
I'm going to make a TV

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:46.020
show there for sure.
Next?

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.250
&gt;&gt;Thanks for coming.

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.490
RICK STEVES: Yeah.

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:52.150
&gt;&gt;You mentioned Europe as a new modern place,
and Berlin obviously is

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:55.310
very modern.
So I like to see things like architecture

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:59.490
and new cities and things
like that so -- are there any highlights that

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:00.490
you would mention?

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:03.500
RICK STEVES: Well, I love skyscrapers and
modern cities, like I showed

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.090
three slides there.
And I've found that in many cities, they protect

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:11.610
the skyline in the
downtown core because they don't want modern

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:14.910
architecture obliterating
beautiful domes and historic spires.

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:19.000
Outside of that protected area, that's where
you get the Manhattan.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.500
And I think it's really important when you're
a tourist to find out

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.610
where are the people working, where's the
real work-a-day life.

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.200
And take the commuter train out there and
wander through just the

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.240
modern skyscraper Manhattan kind of areas.
Because there's lot of modern art there, there's

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.240
beautiful skyscraper
architecture.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.890
And there's a vibrancy you don't feel in the
touristic old core.

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:38.180
Yeah.
But man, there's great modern architecture

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.090
all over Europe these days.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.090
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.090
RICK STEVES: Yeah.

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:48.090
&gt;&gt;Hi, thanks for coming.
I found lots of really nice places in Europe

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:49.580
and I live in constant
terror that you will one day put them in one

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.630
of your books, and they'll
be ruined for me.

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:52.630
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:57.260
RICK STEVES: If I give you my e-mail address
maybe you can send me a

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:59.400
list and I'll -- I promise I won't put them
in anything.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.360
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:08.330
&gt;&gt; So, I mean, seriously.
You know, I myself worry when I write up a

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.415
place on my blog.
You know, how do you reconcile, well, you

01:03:10.415 --> 01:03:11.670
know, this is a cool place.
I'd like to tell people about it but you know

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:17.500
it definitely cannot
tolerate 200 visitors a day.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.970
RICK STEVES: Well, that's a very good question
and it's an issue that

01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:23.640
I do think about.
I go back to my favorite places -- I don't

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.710
know if you know the Cinque
Terre, for instance is a little villages,

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:28.050
five villages in the Italian
Rivera.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:30.721
And every time I go there, I'm a little nervous
because it gets more

01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:34.740
and more touristy, you know.
And all of a sudden, nobody is -- nobody is

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.180
picking the grapes anymore.
All the grape fields are just going to waste.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.690
And everybody's got their cyber cafes and
their laundromats and their

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:44.090
little boutique hotels and so on.
And I come into town every year or two and

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:47.110
local people are thrilled to
see me because I'm stoking their economy,

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:49.190
the tourists are just having
a blast.

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:52.250
And then there's always a few people like
you that think I should have

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:57.390
kept it a secret.
And I'm not -- my job is not to protect these

01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:00.400
places.
I'm sort of like the hired hand to find them.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.840
And what I would say, there are places that
I find that really could

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.790
not handle the crowds.
And I would never promote a place that really

01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:08.470
didn't welcome the crowds
or couldn't handle the crowds.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:11.250
And what I need to do is to try and find more
places so I can spread

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:13.810
the crowds out a little bit.
But it's an interesting issue.

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:17.070
And it's a nice problem for a travel writer
to have to have that much

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.190
of an impact on a place.
I wish I could find more Cinque Terres, and

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:21.080
I wish I could find more
Gimmelwalds.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:26.090
There are more Cinque Terres but they're not
as accessible as the Cinque Terre that I've

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:29.480
been pushing because it's just two hours away
from Florence or the Leaning Tower of Pisa

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.610
where everybody goes anyways.
If you go down to the Pardi Islands or down

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:35.930
around Sicily, there's a
lot of places just about as magical.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:42.120
But they're different.
So I'm just -- yeah, it's just I'm just doing

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.120
my best it ruin these
places.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.980
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:51.880
&gt;&gt;Last year I was in Switzerland's Chalet
Fontana, one of the places

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.860
mentioned in the book.
It was completely swamped of English speakers.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.860
A couple of months later, I went to the other
side of the Ebenese

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.660
Overland, everybody was German, everybody
 --

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:03.860
RICK STEVES: Yeah, yeah. That's for sure.
Did you meet Denise there at Chalet Fontana?

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.860
&gt;&gt;Yes, I did.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.000
RICK STEVES: Yeah, she's the wonderful lady
that runs that.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.320
You know, Americans go to the same places.
And the Germans go to the same places.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:15.050
And people with my book go to the same places.
It's just a reality.

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:21.860
And I -- I remind people if you want to not
see Americans, you're

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:25.850
holding the wrong book.
You know, I'm trying to spread it out.

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:28.890
Now having said that, we've been talking about
the marque destinations.

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:32.770
Honestly, I just spent ten days in Basque
Country, in Galicia

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:37.580
Northwestern Spain.
And I write about it enthusiastically and

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.990
in 10 days, I probably saw
ten people with my book.

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:46.690
I just spent 20 days across Scandinavia.
And in 20 days, maybe a saw a hundred people

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:50.620
with my book.
And then I go to Rome and in one day, I see

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.750
300 people with my book.
So it's really interesting, we all are inclined

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.250
to go to the same
marque destinations.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:00.200
But if you want to go to Estonia, you're going
to find a back door

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.640
wonderland.
And you've got all the information -- if you

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.850
like my information,
you'll have it because I cover it.

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:09.310
But Americans don't go there.
If I just wrote books on places that sold

01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:12.900
well, I would drop my
Scandinavia book and I wouldn't be covering

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:16.460
Galicia.
So I have to be realistic.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.200
I'm a business and I'm not going to write
a book to Moldavia because it

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.780
would be very expensive to do and it would
change really fast.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.980
And nobody would -- in relative terms, nobody
would go there.

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.160
I wrote a book once to the former Soviet Union
and it sold in the

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.120
hundreds.
You know, you've got to be tuned in.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.880
I'd write a book to Paris and it subsidizes
all those other books.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.430
So that's just an interesting little business
thing I have to consider.

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.430
Yeah?

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:41.870
&gt;&gt;With the growing popularity of the automated
machines for tickets and

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:43.810
so on -- but a lot of them only take chip
and PIN cards.

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:50.610
Is there any movement on being able, for Americans
to be able to get

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:51.870
one of those?

01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:55.080
RICK STEVES: You know, that's a good issue.
And I'm not -- I'm not very -- I don't have

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.850
much of an appetite to
learn about that.

01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:02.890
I've got a graffiti wall on my website.
It's our version of -- Lonely Planet has the

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:04.130
Thorn Bush or something
like that.

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:07.790
And I -- I ask the perplexing questions like
that and I let everybody

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:11.480
who has got experience share their information.
If you went to the ricksteves.com graffiti

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:16.600
wall, and look in there
under technical challenges or credit card

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.960
issues or whatever, you'd
find a lot of people talking about that.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.760
But that is a frustration for a lot of Americans
is that Europeans have

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.850
a little chip embedded in their card that
makes our card not work.

01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:29.790
You can always use our card to get cash.
And I almost exclusively get my -- I use my

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:32.780
ATM to get hard cash and I
spent hard cash.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.820
I find that's the best deal.
But there are -- there is a frustration about

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.380
that.
And I hope that that gets straightened out.

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:42.460
I'm sure there's people working on that but
I don't choose it get into

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.460
it.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:47.050
&gt;&gt;So, I've personally experienced problems
with trying to plan with

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:56.120
others in there's a lot of people who either
experience a lot of

01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:00.780
anxiety about, say, going off the beaten path
or not do tour groups or

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:01.780
even doing something like staying at two-star
hotel.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.780
They are very much focused on the main touristy
areas.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:07.910
Do you have any suggestions for people who
want to travel with others

01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:11.340
on convincing the people they want to travel
with to sort of take this

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.050
more holistic view, and really spend, you
know, instead of visiting

01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:18.510
four countries in two weeks, spending some
time really getting to know

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:19.510
a place.

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:21.290
RICK STEVES: So you've got friends who are
front door travellers and

01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:23.100
you're a back door traveler?

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.870
&gt;&gt;Well they're first-time travellers. They
have a lot of anxiety about

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.300
being a back door traveller.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.480
RICK STEVES: Anxiety because they're going
to be physically roughing

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.640
it or because they're going to places that
aren't featured in Conde

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.640
Nast?

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:41.900
&gt;&gt;Anxiety because they have no past expectations.
For example, they don't realize how easy it

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:46.460
is to find an English
speaker in Western Europe.

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.460
Or the fact that you can --

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.290
RICK STEVES: Well, it sounds like they need
to be drugged and dragged

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:54.440
over there and then introduced to it.
So that they realize that their fears --

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.230
&gt;&gt;Stage one complete, but --
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:57.230
-- more ideas.

01:08:57.230 --> 01:09:00.390
RICK STEVES: Once they did one trip, they'd
be fine.

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:07.650
If you went to -- you if -- I don't know.
If you go it my website and look at some of

01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:10.750
the chatter of people who
have travelled there, if you go it my tour

01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:14.770
section and see the online
scrapbooks that people have made, you can

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:18.170
see how there's real normal
travellers that are inclined to take normal

01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:21.870
tours that have been --
found their way into this and really have

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:24.970
their apprehensions overcome
by their own experience.

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:29.390
But some people you can't force to be back
door travellers.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:34.120
And that's probably good news for the rest
of us who are back door

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.120
travellers.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.150
RICK STEVES: So don't work too hard on it,
please.

01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:43.230
&gt;&gt;All right.
So I don't actually have a question for you,

01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:47.060
Rick.
But I just wanted to tell everyone here that

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.380
you're going to stick
around for a few minutes to do autographs.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.370
So for people who are interested in that,
please start lining up at the

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:51.370
front.
Oh my God, that's everyone.

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:52.370
RICK STEVES: All right.

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.370
&gt;&gt;All right. Thanks.

01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:54.370
RICK STEVES: All right, good. thank you very
much.

01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:55.370
It's fun to be here.
