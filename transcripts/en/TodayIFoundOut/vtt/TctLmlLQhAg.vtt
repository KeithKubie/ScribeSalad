00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:19.010
The 
People Who Can’t See Faces

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.940
“Prosopagnosia” or in less medical terms:
“face blindness” is a condition in which

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.590
people more or less can’t cognitively see
faces.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.470
Once thought to be incredibly rare, with only
100 or so documented cases up until the last

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.630
decade or so, it’s now thought that around
1 in every 50 people suffers from this condition;

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.270
though for most, they just have a really hard
time recognizing people by their faces.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.720
For some, the condition is so severe that
they can’t even recognize their own face,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.230
let alone someone else’s.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.200
There are also instances of people with prosopagnosia
who are unable to tell whether what they are

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.510
looking at is a face at all or simply a picture
of an oddly shaped rock or just random objects.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.180
To be clear, face blindness isn’t a problem
with the people’s ability to see, nor do

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.579
people with this condition have memory problems.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.660
They just can’t, or have difficulty with,
recognizing faces.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.310
Specifically, when most people see faces,
their brain processes the face as a whole,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.240
rather than by its individual parts.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.930
For people with prosopagnosia, they see the
individual parts, but are not capable of perceiving

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.360
the face holistically, making it incredibly
difficult to recognize someone by their face.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.100
It turns out that there is a special part
of our brain that has facilities for “seeing”

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.290
faces and recognizing them later.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.630
This shouldn’t be too surprising as most
people know from experience that when they

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.340
see people from other racial backgrounds they
aren’t very familiar with, there is often

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.070
that politically incorrect thought, “They
all look the same.”

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.750
However, if you spend time around a lot of
people in that other race, you’ll quickly

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.140
find that your brain begins to be able to
distinguish between people that not long before

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.000
you thought all looked the same.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.140
Once this happens, you’ll easily and quickly
be able to distinguish between such people

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.119
and might well wonder how on Earth you used
to think that people of that ethnicity “all

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.180
looked the same”.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.300
This hints at the fact that there must be
some facility in your brain that trains itself

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.670
to recognize certain types of faces and, once
trained within a culture, makes these distinctions

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.690
much more readily.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.350
Now, this preceding example doesn’t definitively
demonstrate that there is indeed a specific

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.090
part of the brain that handles processing
faces.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.540
But, it turns out, that is the case.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.540
The part of the brain that’s thought to
not function properly in the cases of prosopagnosia

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.209
is known as the fusiform gyrus, This handles
things like visual word recognition, color

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.620
processing, and face and body recognition,
among other things.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.280
This system of the brain allows people to
more readily distinguish faces than they would,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.489
say, one rock from another rock, or other
similarly complex inanimate objects.

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.209
For people with prosopagnosia, they rely more
on the brain’s facilities of object recognition,

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.480
which takes much more training to distinguish
one similar looking object from another.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.319
This more generic object recognition system
is how an arborist can instantly recognize

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.840
what tree a leaf came from, even if it’s
extremely similar to another leaf from a different

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.910
type of tree.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.209
They can do this through significant training.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.190
Similarly, a geologist can recognize what
type of rock something is even if it strongly

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.440
resembles a different type of rock- again,
they can do this only after quite a bit of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.860
experience and training.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.660
For most people, we simply learn faces quickly
and easily without conscious thought using

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.060
the special “facial recognition” mechanism
of the brain designated for this, rather than

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.590
relying on the generic object recognition
system.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.989
It was thought until relatively recently,
that most people with this condition came

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.450
by it simply from damage to their brain (via
strokes, tumors, severe head injuries, etc.).

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.400
But more recently, it’s been discovered
this isn’t the case at all and far more

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.101
people suffer from prosopagnosia from birth,
though most have it mildly enough that they

00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:54.909
can adequately compensate by doing things
such as paying particular attention to a person’s

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.480
hairstyle, body shape, posture, voice, etc.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.680
Another trick often used by people with prosopagnosia
to compensate, not in recognizing people,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.060
but in at least not appearing rude, is to
adopt the practice of always looking down

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.849
when walking, so that they can act like they
don’t see people, in case they come across

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.290
someone they know, but don’t recognize.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.280
When they do encounter someone, many on the
more extreme side often adopt the practice

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.330
of being overly friendly to everyone, in case
the person they are talking to isn’t a stranger.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.770
In the course of the conversation, they try
to determine whether it’s someone they actually

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.120
know or not and who the person is.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.889
How clever people are at naturally masking
face blindness is “probably why [the disorder]

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.689
went unnoticed for so long,” says Dr. Thomas
Grüter of the Institute of Human Genetics.

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:42.960
As one woman with this condition, Cecilia
Burman, said, “People think I’m just snobby…

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.639
It makes me really, really sad to lose new
friends because they think I couldn’t bother

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.650
to say hello.”

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.659
Burman’s fairly low on the spectrum in that
she has trouble recognizing her mother’s

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:56.270
face and even has difficulty recognizing her
own face in pictures or the mirror.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.650
The problem isn’t just about saying “hello”,
though.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.050
Not surprisingly, people with face blindness
also tend to have problems interpreting facial

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.240
expressions.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.430
This can make it difficult at times to properly
gauge a person’s mood or the like, which

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.509
can further make someone with face blindness
seem insensitive or misinterpret what someone’s

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:14.509
saying.

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.740
You can take a couple simple online quizzes
to help assess whether you might be someone

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.960
who suffers from face blindness (see links
in the show notes)

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.779
In the end, there is no known cure for prosopagnosia
and treatment options have proven fairly ineffective

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:25.779
to date.

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.099
The primary way to treat the condition is
simply to teach people to pay attention to

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.009
things like hair style and color, body types,
etc. to help recognize people.

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.699
As most born with this condition already do
this naturally, there really isn’t a whole

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.529
lot in the way of actual treatment that can
help them yet.

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:45.319
Bonus Facts:
• People on the Autistic spectrum (including

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.300
Asperger’s, which incidentally is a name
distinction that’s probably soon to be going

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.789
away in favor of just calling everyone on
the spectrum “Autistic”) usually demonstrate

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.610
some level of prosopagnosia.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.279
• While people with prosopagnosia have difficulty
consciously recognizing faces, studies have

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:07.089
shown that they are subconsciously recognizing
the faces in that there is a skin conductance

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:12.979
response when they see faces of people they
know, but aren’t recognizing.

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.530
• Given that many of the people who were
born with prosopagnosia seem to have close

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.939
relatives with the condition (often quite
a few of them), it’s thought that face blindness

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:25.900
is directly caused by a defect in some dominant
gene, which results in the brain’s mechanism

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.270
for being able to holistically see a face
not developing correctly, making it harder

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.779
to distinguish one from another.

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:36.629
In fact, if you have prosopagnosia, there
is a 50% chance that a child you have will

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.649
also inherit it.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.659
• One of the tell-tale signs of prosopagnosia
is if someone generally has difficulty following

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:48.380
the plot of a TV show or movie because they
can’t keep track of which character is which.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.059
Because of this, kids with prosopagnosia will
often strongly prefer cartoons, where characters

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:59.430
almost always wear the same clothes and often
sound very distinct when they talk.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.259
• The earliest known case of face blindness
was documented in the 9th century.

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.189
This idea was generally ignored until the
20th century.

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:12.389
It was given its name, prosopagnosia, in 1947
by German neurologist Joachim Bodamer, who

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:16.819
studied the disorder, including studying a
man who, after a head injury, could no longer

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:25.099
recognize his own face, nor the faces of his
friends 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:34.330
and family.
