You know what, if you picked all of them you're right on. We've heard the term

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.570
virtualization in the context of virtual memory systems. Data centers today

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.350
catering to cloud computing use virtualization

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.190
technology. Java virtual machine. Virtual Box is

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.700
something that you may be using in your laptop for instance. An IBM VM/370,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.480
was the mother of all virtualization in some

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.230
sense, because way back in the 60s and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.090
the 70s, they pioneered this concept of virtualization.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.990
Google Glass, of course many of you may

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.210
have heard the hype behind it, as well

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.530
as the opportunities for marketing that this provides.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.680
Cloud computing, Dalvik Virtual Machine in the context

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.370
of Android, VMware Workstation as an alternative to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.570
Virtual Box, and of course the movie, Inception,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.700
has a lot of virtualization themes in it.
