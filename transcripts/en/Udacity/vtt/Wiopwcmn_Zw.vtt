00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
Alright welcome to the last problem set.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.850
Let's go ahead and dive in with a question about decidability.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.940
Given a program on a RAM and an input to that program, which of the below are decidable?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.000
The RAM runs at least 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.880
The RAM runs at least 1,000,000 steps and will eventually terminate.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.710
Or the RAM runs at most 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

00:00:19.710 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that are decidable.
