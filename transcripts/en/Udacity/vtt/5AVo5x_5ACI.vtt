00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.480
This is true.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.649
Adding the terms in
the parentheses first,

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.830
we see that 2+(5+3) becomes 2+8,
which equals 10.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.460
Likewise, we see that (2+5)+3
becomes 7+3, which also equals 10.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.930
Regardless of the order or how
the terms are grouped, adding three or

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.860
more terms together will
always give the same sum.
