00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.310
&gt;&gt;Female Commentator: Hi everyone and welcome
to Authors@ Google Ann Arbor.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.560
We are proud to have Steve Lehto here again
with us today. You may remember him from his

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.599
recent chat with us about Michigan's Columbus:
The Life of Douglass Houghton.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.199
Today he's here to present to us and talk
to us about Chrysler's Turbine Car. So forward

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.119
written by Jay Leno, and we have the Wall
Street Journal article for all of you to view

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.119
as well.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.029
This story takes place in 1964. Chrysler built
a fleet of turbine cars; automobiles with

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.860
jet engines and lent them out to the members
of the public. The fleet logged over a million

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.610
miles; the exercise was a raging success.
And this is the story.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.040
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Thank you.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.670
Well, if you look at the image on the screen,
this right here is a bunch of guys standing

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.250
around a car and the reason that this is a
momentous moment, 1953, is that these gentlemen

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.071
are lowering a jet engine into a car.

00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:59.210
And many people who've heard of the turbine
car project know that Chrysler and GM and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.560
Ford all experimented with jet engines in
cars for a period of time. But a lot of people

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.770
are not aware of the fact that Chrysler actually
spent 25 years developing jet engine technology

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.429
in the automotive field, and they actually
got further along than anybody else did.

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:16.840
So this a great occasion and I'll talk to
you some more about some of the people in

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.430
this photograph. On the far right is a man
named George Huebner. He was the head of the

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.280
turbine car program and a very, very flamboyant
gentleman. I only found one photograph of

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.280
him where he's not wearing an expensive suit,
but in this image you'll see that he is.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.049
And then standing next to the car with his
right hand on the fender of the car wearing

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.679
a dark suit is a guy named Dr. Sam Williams.
I'll talk some more about him as well.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.219
But like I said they were just here lowering
an engine in a car, this would be 1953.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.140
So they did put the jet engine in the car
and they took it out for a spin and they called

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.590
up all the local press and said, "Come on
out. Bring your news cameras, your reporters,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.039
your journalists." And of course that's the
whole host of people you see in the left hand

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.590
side of the screen there.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.719
And this is the public unveiling of the first
jet powered car. And it was a huge news event

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.680
if you look at the papers from the time; not
just the local papers, but even the national

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.360
newspapers like the New York Times or even
like Time Magazine or Look Magazine or Life

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.110
Magazine or any of those there'd be stories
about the jet powered cars being built by

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.110
Chrysler.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.540
And a lot of people who aren't familiar with
the technology might not know this, but jet

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.830
engines offer some big advantages over the
typical piston engine.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.130
A jet engine's got fewer moving parts; it
weighs less; it spins, the internal parts

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.789
spin rather than reciprocate, meaning that
pistons go back and forth and cause an engine

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.460
to shake or vibrate; a piston engine spins
so therefore it's much smoother.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.440
But the important thing now that we look back
on it and realize is a jet engine will burn

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.730
on, run on anything that burns. So you can
run a jet engine on not only on gasoline,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.770
but alcohol, kerosene, diesel, vegetable oil,
peanut oil, Chanel No. 5, vodka, tequila,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.080
VO5 hairspray. They'd actually do demonstrates
running the cars on these things.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.080
But again, during this time frame gasoline
cost so little that very few people cared.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.260
They say, "Well why do we need a cheaper alternative
to gasoline when we've got gasoline?"

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.260
So the program gets developed; they start
building these cars and as they're developed-developing

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.020
them they're making the engines more and more
efficient.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.461
Here's another one of the cars that has a
turbine engine in it. Many of the early cars

00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:27.360
were simply other Chrysler products that they
had shoe-horned a jet engine into.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.470
So again nothing on this car would tell you
it's a jet engine except that it sounded different.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.340
So when this car drove by you it would sound
like a low flying jet.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.451
And I can tell you 'cause I've driven one,
and I'll talk about that in a minute, but

00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:45.240
that's-that's the-the main difference to the
average person on the street.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.123
This right here is a picture of George Huebner
and like I said it's the only picture where

00:03:49.123 --> 00:03:53.260
he's not wearing a jacket. And the reason
is, and he's the second man from the right,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.650
he was ahead of the turbine car program and
he's the one who came to Chrysler and said,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.390
"I really want to build jet powered cars here,"
and he got them to put up the investment,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.490
let him hire the team. He his whole turbine
department built around this.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.930
During the same time though, Chrysler was
actually known as being the engineering company.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.360
Of the Big Three, Chrysler was best known
as being the innovators in engineering.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.510
They also did stuff with the space program.
So the man standing to Huebner's right with

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.600
the ax on his shirt, that's Wernher von Braun.
And those of you who remember the Apollo program,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.350
Wernher von Braun is a German scientist who
came over here after World War II and helped

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.520
us put a man on the moon. And Huebner worked
with von Braun on missiles at Chrysler.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.350
Chrysler helped build the missiles for the
Redstone Program and some of the earliest

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.410
space stuff was built by Chrysler.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.040
And in case you're curious, Chrysler also
helped build a lot of military stuff; so army

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.270
tanks, for instance, Chrysler had built 'em.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.700
So we don't think of them today in the military
sense nor do we think of them in the rocket

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.260
sense, but at the time Chrysler was known
cutting edge technology.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.620
So here's George Huebner dressed more appropriately
wearing a nice suit and tie.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.790
He was actually in, it-it's an interesting
thing. He was an extraverted engineer. And

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.430
anybody who knows an engineer knows how-how
oxymoronic that is. That he's outgoing, flamboyant,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.150
loved attention and publicity, and he was
an engineer.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:22.790
In fact after he passed away his, all of his
papers and research were donated to the Bentley

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:30.610
Historical archives which is where I did a
lot of research for this book , so it's right

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.180
around the corner here.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:42.840
But this is George Huebner and any time a
camera was around it seems he got himself

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.300
photographed near a turbine powered car.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:06:04.320
And so this is a car about 1961 or '62 and
that's a jet engine under the hood and some

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:14.669
of the items that go into a jet engine there,
and I'll talk to you about that in just a

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:15.669
second.

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.419
And I'll, yeah, okay.

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.419
[pause]

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:28.980
And this is another turbine powered car that
George Huebner is kneeling behind and this

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:36.290
one does say across the decklist it's says
"Turbine Special."

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:50.570
And as Chrysler became more and more confident
that the cars would work they started putting

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:58.560
things on the cars indicating they were in
fact turbine powered.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.710
George, here in this picture, is demonstrating
that the exhaust gases coming out of this

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.430
car are not dangerous.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:11.000
One of the most common misperceptions about
the program was that the jet engines were

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.060
dangerous. And I to this day run into people
who say, "Oh I understand they killed that

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:29.800
program because the-the exhaust was so hot
it burned the pavement or catch cars on fire

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.240
or kill children."

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.150
[chuckle from audience member]

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:39.340
And the-the exhaust was actually cooler than
the exhaust coming out of a typi-typical piston

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.180
engine car at the time.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:47.240
So that's George Huebner holding a handkerchief
by the by the exhaust here to demonstrate

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.240
that.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.190
On another occasion he brought out some pretty
young women wearing dresses, skirts, and had

00:07:54.190 --> 00:08:00.220
them adjust their nylons in front of the exhaust
pipe to show that it wouldn't burn a woman's

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:08.080
nylons. And of course the photographers ate
it up because they were mostly men and the

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.270
women were pretty so.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.360
[audience chuckles]

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:18.250
Here's another Chrysler powered car again,
you know as Turbine Special.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:24.050
As they got the cars practical they decided
they were gonna start doing endurance stuff

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.890
with 'em to show how dependable they were.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:35.969
So on a couple occasions George Huebner, and
remember this is a guy that's a very, very

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:42.860
high executive at Chrysler, and some of his
co-workers actually drove these cars cross

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.860
country.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:51.670
So they would take a car to like say the New
York Auto Show and have a press event outside

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:57.920
and then the guys all drive off to the sunset,
and a couple thousand miles later they'd have

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:05.940
a press event in Los Angeles where they all
arrive at some hotel and say, "Hey guys were

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.120
here. We just drove this thing cross country."

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.510
So several of these cars were driven cross
country, and relatively trouble free.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.770
While researching the book not only did I
interview the engineers who designed these

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:26.910
things, I actually designed or interviewed
some of the engineers who drove these things

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.640
cross country.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:40.630
And they were just talking about you just
get on the freeway, just cruisin' along in

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:46.740
a jet powered car and you know it's pretty
cool.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:59.830
So here's one of the cars in the top that
was driven cross country and you see on the

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:06.410
side there's a map there just in case you
get lost to let you know where in the country

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.780
that car has been.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:17.380
And again Chrysler was doing this. They were
getting a lot of publicity out of this.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.440
And some people have looked back in the program
and said, "Obviously were not driving jet

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:28.480
powered cars today. What did Chrysler get
out of this program if they didn't get jet

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.860
powered cars?"

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.810
Well they got a lot of free publicity. Well
not free, but it wasn't advertising that they

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.810
didn't pay money for.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.870
So anytime these cars would show up some place
the press would show up and then you'd see

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:44.490
these stories splattered all over the papers:
Chrysler Unveils Another Jet Powered Car.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:51.410
Here's George Huebner on one of his cross
country trips. That's his wife. And these

00:10:51.410 --> 00:11:01.560
are obviously publicity photos, but they'd
be leaked to the press as if they were candid

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:09.220
shots. And I can tell you that they're not
candid 'cause among other things again George

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:16.120
is very well dressed. You'll notice he's sticking
his head out the window 'cause he learned

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:22.399
very early on if you don't do that, you don't
show up in the pictures as-as prominently.

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:29.970
And of course you'll notice that he's showing
the intricate workings of the turbine engine

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:30.970
to the bellhop

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.970
[laughter]

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.180
there on the top right.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:42.010
And on the bottom right he's discussing the
shape of the contiguous 48 states with some

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:48.010
executives from Chrysler who just happen to
be there when he left.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.010
[laughter]

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.010
But again, publicity shots.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.030
And a lot of these photographs were taken
'cause they had publicity guys following these

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:59.589
guys around photographing everything, interviewing
them, and feeding these stories to the press.

00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:07.930
So like I said, the program started in 1953.
It ran 'till 1978. So for 25 years there's

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:13.779
a steady supply of this stuff in the press.

00:12:13.779 --> 00:12:22.400
So this is an aerial shot looking down on
the engine; one of the jet engines that they

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.779
put into a car, a turbine engine.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:34.589
And you'll notice that in the front those
two things that look like beer kegs. Those

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:36.800
are actually air cleaners.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:55.279
So for the car guys in the room you know that
an air cleaner normally sits on top of the

00:12:55.279 --> 00:13:05.750
engine, but a turbine engine, of course, uses
huge quantities of air as well as pretty large

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.600
quantities of fuel.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:17.440
And a lot of the noise you associate with
a jet engine if you were to go walk along

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:26.160
the tarmac at an airport, the sound you hear,
half of the sound is coming from the front

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.270
end where the air is coming into the engine.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:37.730
And so to quiet these engines down they got
those gigantic air cleaners there and they

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:47.760
figured out if they faced 'em at each other
it would actually kind of cancel out some

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:53.470
of the noise. So in later years they actually
got a housing that went over the whole thing,

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:58.930
but those are just two gigantic air cleaners.
And then directly behind that is the turbine

00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:59.930
engine.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:04.570
They would come up with different generation
turbine engines and they would number them.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:15.050
So this is a cutaway of the fourth-generation
turbine engine and at this point in time they'd

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:23.260
worked out enough of the problems of the technology
to where they had an engine that was dependable

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.120
and was relatively bullet proof.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:38.640
Because they came up with an idea to promote
the project that they were gonna build a fleet

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.390
of cars and lend them to the public.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:49.700
So that if you were in America in 1963, you'd
hear on the news that Chrysler's building

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:59.650
jet cars and they're willing to lend them
to anybody who wants one. If you want one

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:04.790
write to Chrysler and they might give you
one.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:16.930
And so they got flooded with requests for
these cars, but to do that obviously Chrysler's

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:29.269
gotta have a car that they can toss a key
to you and say, "Here, go drive this car,"

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:34.350
knowing that the average knucklehead's not
gonna take it out and blow it up.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:41.810
Because as you can imagine if they were to
do that with like say a Dodge Vipers, let

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:48.450
people drive 'em, half of them would come
back with blown engines, right? So they had

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.959
to make the engines bullet proof in that respect.

00:15:52.959 --> 00:16:00.670
And so this is the fourth-generation engine
and this is the engine that they decided was

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.399
good enough to do that. And it actually was.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:11.920
So they actually assembled the cars in a plant
on Greenfield Road in Detroit. The plant is

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.950
still there although the plant now is being
used to make popcorn, I kid you not.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:18.950
[laughter]

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:29.260
And the cars in the background, I'll show
you some better pictures in a second, but

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:34.980
the cars were hand built in Italy by a company
called Ghia.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:46.389
And some of you car guys know this that there's
a Karmann Ghia car that Volkwagen marketed.

00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:52.829
Ghia is a builder of they're referred to as
coach builders, but they build the bodies

00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:57.970
of cars; they did a lot of show cars for Chrysler.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:07.931
And the cars in question were often referred
to as the Ghia Turbine Car built in 1963.

00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:10.220
They build a fleet of 55 of these cars.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:16.880
The cars were relatively, for the most part,
hand built. They had aluminum body panels.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.720
They had leather interiors and 54 of the 55
cars were identical: same color, same interior,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.819
same everything, down to the point where even
the same key would start all 55 cars.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:28.819
[laughter]

00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:36.200
So this right here is what the Ghia Turbine
Car looks like in color. That paint is referred

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:43.410
to as Turbine Bronze. Chrysler wanted to come
up with a color that was unique but also seemed

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.030
kind of space age.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:50.310
And if you were in Southeastern Michigan in
particular, but anywhere in America, between

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:56.790
'63 and '66, you would see these cars on the
road from time to time. You couldn't miss

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:01.250
'em because they are an unusual color and
they sounded like jets.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:08.890
So I was born in 1962. I remember as a very
small child seeing one of these cars and the-the

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:15.080
two things you remember: the color and the
sound.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:22.470
So this car right here is the one that Jay
Leno owns, and I'll tell you a little bit

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:28.360
about the story in a second.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:39.640
But that's what all these cars looked like.
The car was designed by a guy named Elwood

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:48.770
Engel. And Elwood Engel had come over to Chrysler's
design studios from Ford. And when he was

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:54.130
at Ford he worked on the Thunderbirds.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:19:03.049
So many people look at this and they go, "Hey
it's a T-Bird." Well it's similar 'cause the

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:17.230
same guy designed it. Some people would jokingly
call this the Engel Bird. But it's the Chrysler

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.270
Ghia Turbine Car.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:28.050
And we call it the Turbine Car because it
actually does not have a name. They toyed

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:41.160
with the idea about naming it something. You
don't have cars that don't have names. And

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:50.600
they were gonna call it the Typhoon and they
had some other names they kicked around, but

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:57.450
they decided just to go ahead and just called
it the Turbine Car.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:06.380
So on the side there next to the gas cap on
the left you'll see the tail end does say

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:13.860
Turbine on the side, but that's all it says.
It doesn't say anything else.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:26.000
A lot of people like the space age styling
of the car. Everything about the car was designed

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.669
to remind you that this is a jet car. So you'll
notice those things stickin' out the back

00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:35.309
with the fins on 'em, those are the backup
lights.

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:40.030
But they're designed to look cool. People
always assume you walk over and like feel

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:45.600
hot air coming out of those. No, no, no that's
just backup lights.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.070
And again notice the really unusual sweep
to the back there to evoke like fins and rockets

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.580
and so on.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:21:01.130
They put those styling touches, those aluminum
fins on everything. The bezels around the

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:13.240
headlights have got cooling fins on them.
The little rod that holds the rearview mirror

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:22.000
to the glass of the windshield has got cooling
fins on it. It doesn't need 'em obviously,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
but they did it because they thought it was
cool.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:36.330
So this is inside one of the cars, and I'll
you little bit more about this car in a second,

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:43.120
but again all the cars looked identical on
the inside.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:54.950
And if you just glance at this, at first glance
you think, "Well that looks like any other

00:21:54.950 --> 00:22:03.740
car from the 1960's." Except that the right
hand side is a tachometer which goes to 60,000

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:11.370
RPM. Your average car today goes to about
6,000 RPM. But of course a turbine engine

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:17.770
spins very, very fast so the tachometer is
a 60,000 RPM.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:24.350
The temperature gauge goes to 2,000 degrees,
whereas the temperature gauge in your car

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.580
might go to 200.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:33.230
But again it's measuring something different.
The temperature gauge in your car measures

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:41.410
the coolant temperature in the radiator. These
cars don't have radiators. They don't have

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:42.799
oil systems.

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:50.210
These cars, like I said, have fewer moving
parts. They also have fewer systems involved.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:56.990
So it's actually measuring the temperature
at the gas generator stage where the fuel

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.970
is being burned. So that would be quite high.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.730
Again you'll notice the styling touch with
the aluminum fins up there by the front of

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.320
the center hump there. Again just-just the
aesthetic purpose.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.160
And other than that it's a typical 1960's
Chrysler styling.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:17.220
So the cars were lent out and what they did
is they said, "If you wanna borrow one of

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.289
these cars for three months [inaudible].

00:23:19.289 --> 00:23:26.299
They got buried as you might imagine with
requests from people saying, "I want one."

00:23:26.299 --> 00:23:36.809
So they went through all the people's names
that they got and they tried to scatter them

00:23:36.809 --> 00:23:44.670
around the country, but they lent them out
to 203 different families over the period

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.350
of two years.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:53.840
And what they would do is they'd pick some
family in Nebraska and they'd say, "Hey, you're

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:59.780
gonna get a car. Is that cool?" They'd check
'em up, make sure they don't have a criminal

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:09.059
record or something. And then they would call
the local press and have a big press event.

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:10.370
[audience chuckles]

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:17.679
And so a lot of times George Huebner would
show up; they'd toss the people the keys to

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:23.960
their new turbine car; and sometimes there
would just be a guy from-from Chrysler. And

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:30.970
it was often a guy named Bill Kerry, who's
this gentleman here. He's also the man on

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.409
the cover of the book.

00:24:32.409 --> 00:24:38.760
And Bill Kerry's a fascinating guy. I interviewed
him for this book. And he was a technician

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:48.370
at Chrysler who came to Chrysler when he heard
that they were gonna start building turbines.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:57.830
He'd worked in the military on turbine aircraft
technology on helicopters. And when he went

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:05.520
to Chrysler they said, "We've got just the
job for you. You're gonna be the main mechanic

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:16.429
on this fleet of cars." So when they built
the 55 cars and lent them out to the public,

00:25:16.429 --> 00:25:24.669
Bill Kerry was the guy who was tasked with
going around, keeping the cars running, delivering

00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:31.190
them to people, and then if they broke down
he got the phone call.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:39.850
And he told me that occasionally he'd get
a phone call at 3 o'clock in the morning and

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:51.230
they'd say, "We just got a phone call from
one of the users down in Texas. The engine

00:25:51.230 --> 00:26:03.130
just blew up." And he would literally hop
on a, on a plane, fly to Texas, swap the engine

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:14.820
out, and he'd try to do it as quickly as possible
to get the car back on the road again.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:22.679
Now the cars that were involved in the program
logged over a million miles over the period

00:26:22.679 --> 00:26:29.809
of a couple years. And statistically speaking
it was very, very successful. The cars were

00:26:29.809 --> 00:26:37.169
very, very dependable. But even so he did
get these odd late night phone calls.

00:26:37.169 --> 00:26:41.059
This is obviously a posed photograph though
were he's pointing at the engine just in case

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:46.659
people didn't know where it was and you have
a nice young 60's couple straight off a sitcom.

00:26:46.659 --> 00:26:55.480
The man in the hat and the thick glasses and
the woman with her little babushka on who

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:05.559
are, who are probably just wishing the photographers
would go away so they could get the car and

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:11.059
drive it. But these were gigantic, big press
events.

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:17.880
And I also interviewed a lot of people who
got to borrow the cars.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:28.710
And if you think about it, you get to borrow
a jet car for three months and Chrysler said,

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:40.429
"As long as you put gas it in or fuel of some
sort and give it back to us we'll pick up

00:27:40.429 --> 00:27:55.080
all the rest." So they paid for the maintenance,
they paid for the insurance, and if you had

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:01.440
any problems they'd come out and fix it no-no
questions asked, no charge.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:09.470
And so I got a lot of photographs from people
I talked to like this one. And here's a family

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:15.010
that drove their car cross country and it's
someplace near the Continental Divide and

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.130
they hopped up to take the picture.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:22.080
And the amazing thing about the turbine engine,
along with the other stuff I told you, is

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:32.290
that you could go out on a, on a pitch, cold
day, as cold as you can make it, and hit the

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.690
starter and the car'll start instantly.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:44.160
It does not have the problem with the thick
oil you have in a piston engine, there's much

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.610
less friction inside the engine so the cars
can start immediately. And because they got

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:58.700
their heat for the inside of the car off the-they
ran the exhaust gases through the-the heating

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:07.020
unit, you would have hot air instantly as
well. So the defrosters and the heat worked

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.020
instantly.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.570
And for the engineers, turbine engines run
better with cold air because cold air is denser.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:28.659
And so everyone I talked to who lived either
out West or drove them out West, they said,

00:29:28.659 --> 00:29:36.850
"Yeah these things ran great in the mountains."
Which is lots of people have trouble with

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:43.440
piston engine cars driving through the mountains
because of the carburetors and so on.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.870
So again, this is some people just drivin'
theirs cross country.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:52.020
At the end of the program they rounded the
cars up and they were thinking about what

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:57.820
to do next. And they considered the idea about
mass producing jet powered cars. They thought

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.419
these cars were practical enough to do that.

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:13.520
The problem is that right at the late 1960's
three things happened. The problem smog became

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.789
very, very apparent in America and people
in America started complaining about smog

00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:21.289
and, "We need to do something about smog especially
in California."

00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:29.600
So the Environmental Protection Agency was
formed and they were given the task of doing

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:38.390
something to clean up the air and the first
thing they attacked was automobiles and tailpipe

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:39.390
emissions.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:46.809
And the guys at Chrysler spent all their time
making the engines run more efficiently and

00:30:46.809 --> 00:30:48.440
more bullet proof; they hadn't really thought
that much about emissions. So they couldn't

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.440
do anything about the emissions on that short
notice.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.087
The other problem is that the OPEC oil embargo
hit in the late '60s early '70s where we actually

00:30:52.087 --> 00:30:54.280
had a gas crisis in America. And the federal
government again stepped in and announced

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.330
CAFE standards which is the Corporate Average
Fuel Economy standards for all the cars that

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.159
one car company builds.

00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:04.390
The turbine cars did not get good gas mileage.
It wasn't bad gas mileage, but it wasn't good.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.929
And the problem was CAFE standards is that
the government announced is simply, "You guys

00:31:07.929 --> 00:31:13.100
have gotta come out next year and have your
gas standards here, the next year here," and

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.706
it escalated up. And they hadn't been working
on that.

00:31:15.706 --> 00:31:20.990
So while they were thinking about, "Could
we defeat these problems?" And there were

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:25.510
some engineers at Chrysler who thought they
could, Chrysler ran into financial trouble.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.740
And we all know that Chrysler went bankrupt
last year. Well they actually almost went

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:38.290
bankrupt in the late 1960's, early 1970's.
And right while all those things were happening

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:45.830
the guys at the turbine program were saying,
"Yeah, but we can build these cars." And they

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:46.830
couldn't.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:51.539
So this was the car that they were going to
put on the road. They actually toyed with

00:31:51.539 --> 00:31:54.100
the idea about building 500 of these.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:32:01.159
Now this right here is a Coronet. It's got
a turbine engine in it, but it's the only

00:32:01.159 --> 00:32:09.289
one they built. They built one of these and
this has got the next generation engine past

00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:11.440
the one I showed you, the cutout of.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:17.610
So this right here was what the Chrysler engineers,
if you'd talk to them in 1966, if you'd ask

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:22.620
them, "Could you make a car right now to sell
to the public that would blend right in, perform

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.960
like-like a regular car, that the average
person could drive, that's just as dependable

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.480
or better, do you have one?" That's it right
there.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.250
Unfortunately, the three things I just told
you about interfered.

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:36.530
The other strange thing about the whole program
is as I mentioned to you in the beginning

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:41.169
that the car was multi-fuel. The car would
literally run on anything that burned and

00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:43.000
you could mix those fuels.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
So let's suppose you've got a tank full of
kerosene and one day you're driving down the

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.130
road and you get low-low on fuel and you don't,
can't find kerosene, well you pull into a

00:32:55.130 --> 00:33:05.960
station, you put diesel into it. You can't
find diesel you can put tequila in it. If

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:15.320
you can't find tequila, you can put Chanel
No. 5 in it. It's gonna be expensive, but

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.131
you can do it.

00:33:17.131 --> 00:33:26.080
And at the time that they first started the
program in '53, they almost never even mentioned

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.221
that aspect of it. I mean I can find you press
releases where they go, "Turbine engine is

00:33:29.221 --> 00:33:30.221
better. It's lighter; it's simpler; it weighs
less." And they wouldn't even mention the

00:33:30.221 --> 00:33:31.830
fuel economy or the-the multi-fuel aspect
of it.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:40.380
Later on as they were struggling with tail
piping standards and the CAFE standards, somebody

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:45.039
said, "Wait a second. This thing will burn
non-petroleum based fuels. We could run alcohol

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:48.299
that our farmers could make by growing corn
or growing grass. Maybe we should emphasize

00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:49.299
that a little bit.

00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:52.520
So Chrysler started emphasizing it. But again,
this is 1973. And this is a Plymouth Satellite

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.420
and in front this, that's a turbine engine
in that car there, in front of it is engine,

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.380
a-a fuel stand that's got six different fuels
on it. And it's got everything on there from

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.559
non-leaded gasoline to alcohol to a variety
of mixtures and so on.

00:33:57.559 --> 00:34:02.870
And they do these demonstrations where they
would actually go up and fire the car up,

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.870
have it running and flip switch, switch, switch,
switch to show that it would flawlessly on

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:04.870
these different fuels.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:05.870
But again, this is so late in the game that
it didn't have that much of an impact.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:06.870
One of the guys I interviewed for the book
was a test driver who drove these things out

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:07.870
at the Chelsea Proving Grounds and he literally
put hundreds of hours just driving a turbine

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:08.870
car with this big laps and that big oval out
there.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.870
And he told me that he did a couple laps out
there running vegetable oil. And he goes,

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:10.870
"Yeah," he goes, "it smelled like they were
baking cookies."

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:11.870
[laughter]

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:12.870
But imagine what the world would be like if
we were all driving cars that made it smell

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:13.870
like we were baking cookies?

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:22.049
So this is one of those things that I like
to point out; this is sheer irony. One of

00:34:22.049 --> 00:34:25.089
the ugliest cars ever built in Detroit and
it's got a jet engine in it. That is an Aspen,

00:34:25.089 --> 00:34:27.480
the sister car of the Volare. And again Chrysler
was, the engineers were still working on developing

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480
the engine, making it better and better and
better.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.079
The engine in this car was light years ahead
of the one that they'd loaned out to the public.

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:33.750
But, like I said, they couldn't make it run
clean enough; the-the fuel economy wasn't

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.440
good enough; and Chrysler was at this point
really teetering on bankruptcy so they couldn't

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.440
do it.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.690
And one of the guys I talked to who was involved
in the program intimately, I said, "What would

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:39.690
it have taken you guys. Let's suppose that
Chrysler said, 'Let's pull the trigger. Let's

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.079
make these cars; mass produce 'em; put 'em
on the road.'" And he said, "You would have

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:48.329
had to build whole plants from the ground
up because they didn't have the infrastructure

00:34:48.329 --> 00:34:51.089
to manufacture the internal parts of the jet
engine." And he said, That would have cost

00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:53.079
us about a billion dollars in 1970." And they
didn't have a billion dollars.

00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:54.250
So this car, in front of the helicopter, is
the last turbine car Chrysler built. That's

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:55.250
1978. And again, extremely advanced engine
in this car; extremely efficient; extremely

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.250
cutting edge.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.250
But at this point they were, they knew the
program was winding down and Chrysler pulled

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.619
the plug on the program in 1978. So that you
had 25 years of development of this and then

00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:02.829
[makes cutting sound]
and nothing. So that's the end of the program.

00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:07.089
[Inaudible] at the end of the user program
there were 55 of the Ghia Turbine Cars out

00:35:07.089 --> 00:35:12.400
there. Chrysler rounded them up and destroyed
46 of 'em. And this is very reminiscent of

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:18.099
the, "who killed the electric car, the EV1?
General Motors at the end of the program rounded

00:35:18.099 --> 00:35:19.099
all cars up and destroyed them.

00:35:19.099 --> 00:35:23.489
And I've spoken to the guys in the program
and said, "Why did they do that?" And all

00:35:23.489 --> 00:35:27.640
the car companies are hesitant to let their
prototypes get put out in the world. Because

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.489
if you think about it right now when we think
of the turbine car program we think, "Oh,

00:35:31.489 --> 00:35:34.309
this is a suite of cars, they look really
cool, they ran really nice."

00:35:34.309 --> 00:35:35.309
If they let these cars get out to just average
people, you're driving your turbine car along

00:35:35.309 --> 00:35:36.309
the engine explodes. You and I can't fix it.
So either now the car doesn't run or we rip

00:35:36.309 --> 00:35:39.549
the engine out, we drop in a V8, now we have
a turbine engined body that's running a piston

00:35:39.549 --> 00:35:44.329
engine and it starts diminishing the PR of
this car.

00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:50.219
So they actually sent word out to museums
and said, "If you want one of these cars you

00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:52.650
can have it." So they actually got six museums
who took 'em up on the offer. They shipped

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.049
the cars out and they destroyed all the rest.

00:35:54.049 --> 00:35:55.319
And I've actually interviewed guys who were
there at the wrecking yard in Romulus when

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:56.319
they actually crushed and burned these cars.

00:35:56.319 --> 00:35:57.319
And I had one guy tell me, he goes, he goes
"I was crying like a baby." I mean he'd worked

00:35:57.319 --> 00:35:58.319
on these cars for years and now they're destroying
them.

00:35:58.319 --> 00:35:59.319
There were people who wanted to buy the cars.
Chrysler was getting letters from people saying,

00:35:59.319 --> 00:36:00.319
"I wanna buy one. I don't care what it costs,
I'll buy one." And Chrysler's going, "We can't

00:36:00.319 --> 00:36:01.319
sell it. It's a prototype."

00:36:01.319 --> 00:36:03.650
So this car right here is one of the survivors.
This photograph was taken in Fort Wayne, Michigan,

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:04.650
the Fort down by Detroit. And they have at
the Detroit Historical Society so many cars

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.650
they can't display them all at their museum.
And they were one of the people who took 'em

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.650
on the offer to accept one of these cars,
but they had not place to put it so they stuck

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.650
in their storage facility inside the bubble
here.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.650
I got to get in to see it and photograph it
because I was trying to track down as many

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:09.650
of them as I could.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:10.650
The Henry Ford Museum's got one. Chrysler
has one at their museum as well, Walter Chrysler

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.650
Museum up in Auburn Hills. There's one at
the Smithsonian. There's one at the St. Louis

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:12.650
Museum of Transportation. There's one at the
Petersen Museum in L.A. And then two of them

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:13.650
are privately owned, one of which is owned
by Jay Leno.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:14.650
That's me to the left of Jay Leno, 50 pounds
ago. And people say, "Wow, Jay's shorter than

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:15.650
I thought." And I say, "No, no, I'm taller
than you thought."

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.650
[laughter]

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.650
But that's Jay's turbine car. He actually
bought that from Chrysler about a year ago

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:18.650
when he came into town to do his free shows
at the Palace for unemployed people.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:19.650
And Chrysler had kept three cars for themselves.
The three cars they kept were identical because

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:20.650
all the cars were identical.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:21.650
So Chry-Jay went over to Chrysler after he
did one of his shows and he was talkin' to

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:22.650
some of his friends over there and he said,
"You know you guys have got three of these

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:23.650
cars. Do you really need three?"

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:24.650
And I wasn't privy to the conversations, but
my understanding is that he talked them into

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:25.650
selling him one of the three cars. They know
he's a car guy; he'll take care of it; he's

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.650
not gonna blow it up and drop a Slant-6 engine
into it. He'll take care of it and he'll see

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:27.650
to it that it-it-it-it's good.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:28.650
So he got the car and he brought it to California.
This photograph is in Jay Leno's garage. And

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.650
that's also what he calls the facility where
he has 105 cars, 95 motorcycles, a steam engine,

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:30.650
a bus, and a bunch of other crazy stuff. He
loves technology.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:31.650
And about an hour after this photograph was
taken he took me for a ride in one of his

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.650
steam cars. He's got a collection of steam
cars. He's also got a collection of electric

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:33.650
cars.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:34.650
And he is as nice as he seems on TV. It's
not an act. He's an honest to God nice guy.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.650
And just as a side note, I'm actually doing
book signing with him day after tomorrow in

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:36.650
Burbank. I'm flying out and he's gonna sit
with me and sign books, which is a nice thing

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:37.650
for him to do.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:38.650
But he let me drive the car. And that was
the cool thing is that I had talked to him

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:39.650
previously about that I had written this book
and he said, "Well, if you're ever in California,

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:40.650
I'll let you drive the car." So I got to California
as fast as I could.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:41.650
And I go out there and we go out for a drive
and we're drivin' around Burbank and-and we

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.650
stop so we could take some pictures. And the
pictures I showed you earlier are up at the

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:43.650
parking lot we took that day.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.650
And then we're walking back to the car and
I said, "You know Jay you did tell me I could,

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:45.650
I could drive it." And I thought he was gonna
say I just drive it in circles around the

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:46.650
parking lot which I would have been happy
to do so I could say I drove it.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:47.650
He said, "Oh here you go," and tosses me the
keys and-and he let me drive it. And I said,

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:48.650
"Where we going?" He says, "Oh, go back to
the garage."

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:49.650
So I got to drive that car in traffic. And
of course I'm sittin' at a light thinking

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.650
to myself, "I'm gonna be the knucklehead who's
behind the wheel and we get rear-ended by

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:51.650
somebody and I'm gonna go down in history
as the guy who wrecked Jay Leno's turbine

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:52.650
car."

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.650
[laughter]

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:54.650
Didn't happen though; we got it back safely
as evidenced by the photograph.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.650
So that's the story of the Chrysler Turbine
Car.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:56.650
And then while I was out there I was talking
to Jay and I'd still hadn't found a publisher

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:57.650
for the book. And he said to me, he goes,
"Well if it'll help you sell the book I'll

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:58.650
write you a forward for the book." And he's
written forwards for other car books. And

00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:59.650
I said, "I think it'll help."

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.650
[laughter]

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:01.650
And he agreed to write the forward for me
and that actually is what got me an agent

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:02.650
which got the book sold. And the book came
out a month ago and it's actually doing pretty

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:03.650
well so.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:04.650
It's interesting because a lot of people are
familiar with the idea that there were turbine

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:05.650
cars on the road and some people even remember
that Chrysler did this. But they had no idea

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.650
how long the program lasted, 25 years, or
how many of these cars they'd built, 'cause

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.650
they built 55 of those cars right there.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.650
And there was a period, there's a certain
generational thing when I do book signings

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:09.650
I can tell the older guys will go, "I remember
those cars." And the young people of course

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:10.650
went, "What you talkin' about?"

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.650
[laughter]

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:12.650
And it's because there was as time when you'd
see those cars everywhere. And they-they were

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:13.650
almost common place. And the fact that they
disappeared completely, and now people go

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:14.650
"I wonder whatever happened to those turbine
cars?"

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:15.650
So that's also why I wrote the book. So --

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.650
[pause]

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.650
Any questions?

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:18.650
Okay.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:19.650
&gt;&gt;Female in audience: Talk to me about when
you went to see all the families that had

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:20.650
driven these. What were kind of the stories
that they had?

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:21.650
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Oh, yeah. No, I had a couple
pictures in there of that, but you're right.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.650
I actually, Chrysler put out a really nice
book at the end of the program like, like

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:23.650
a, I'm not sure what they did with it, but
they put together a-a-a synopsis of the program.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:24.650
It said, because they had their PR people
go out and interview these people and-and

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.650
they-they collated all the data and they actually
gave us, I actually have a list of the names,

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:26.650
occupations, and ages of every single person
that had one of these cars; 203 people.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:27.650
Now remember this back in 1964 or '63, '65.
So I had to go and try to track these people

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:28.650
down.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.650
So what I actually did is I sorted them by
age and started from the youngest and went

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.650
up. And I actually found something, 'cause
think of about if you're 25 years old that

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:31.650
long ago, next thing you know a lot of these
guys are no longer with us.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:32.650
But I tracked down maybe a dozen of them.
And the stories were universally the same.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.650
They loved the car. Everywhere they went it
drew a crowd. They'd be driving to church

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.650
and people would be waving and following 'em
and like they-they drive someplace and people

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:35.650
would follow them to get out to talk to them.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:36.650
People would park in front of their house
and others would come up and knock on the

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:37.650
door and say, "Hey, can I look at your car?"

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.650
Chrysler actually anticipated some of this
and interestingly enough, for 1963 you cannot

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:39.650
pop the hood in this car without getting inside
of it. You also cannot pop the trunk without

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:40.650
getting inside of it, even if you have the
keys.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.650
Because back then even though cars you walk
up underneath the hood and just feel and pop

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:42.650
the hood with the thing underneath the hood.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.650
They were so worried about looky-loos wanting
to come by everywhere you'd go it would be,

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.650
"Well, I wanna look underneath the hood."
So they made it that way 'cause they anticipated

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.650
it and sure enough that's what happened.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.650
I actually spoke to some families who said
that by the end of the three months they were

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.650
almost getting sick of the attention. They
loved the car, but they couldn't go someplace

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:48.650
without causing a commotion.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:49.650
And so I-I-I spoke to one family in particular
and they said that they'd park in their driveway

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:50.650
every single day during dinner time people
knocking on the door, "Hey can I see your

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:51.650
car? Can I see your, can I go for a ride in
your car?"

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:52.650
And sure enough you can't turn that down.
So you're givin' people rides everywhere givin'

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.650
people rides in the car.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:54.650
That one family said they actually stuck it
in the garage and closed the door when they

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:55.650
wanted peace and quiet 'cause otherwise they
couldn't get any rest.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:56.650
And one of the guys I interviewed for the
book was 16 at the time that his parents got

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:57.650
one of these cars. And Chrysler actually said,
"Hey, do we have a problem lettin' this kid

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.650
drive the car? I mean he's in the family.
He's got a license." They let him drive the

00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.650
car. So a 16 year old boy for three months
is driving this car to and from school --

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.650
[laughter]

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:01.650
he's gonna drive it around and it's all downhill
from that point. I don't care what car you

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:02.650
get, when you turn 17 you got to drive a turbine
car.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.650
[laughter]

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:04.650
And-and he told me he said, "It was, it was
the hugest deal," because he was the kid who

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:05.650
got to drive a jet car. But again, everywhere
you go it's causing a commotion.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.650
One guy told me he said, he goes, "You couldn't
make a short trip in it. You couldn't like

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:07.650
hop in it and run to the store for a loaf
of bread and come back. It would turn into

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:08.650
an hour long trip because everywhere you'd
go people would say," "Hey, is that your car?"

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:09.650
"Hey, can I talk to you about the car?"

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:10.650
And it got to the point where you-you had
to do this.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.650
When Chrysler was interviewing people about
the program they would, and I actually have

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:12.650
the question sheets they used, they were clearly
aiming at trying to find people who were outgoing

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:13.650
and would-wouldn't mind that kind of activity.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.650
But also they'd asked you, "How often do you
drive your car? Where do you drive your car?"

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:15.650
And then, "Where do you park your car when
you're at work?"

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:16.650
And I talked to a guy who's a dentist in California
and he told me that he thinks he got the car

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:17.650
because his dentist office was right at a
major intersection. And he said, "Well I'd

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:18.650
have to park my car in front of my office."
And he wasn't sure if it was a good or bad

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:19.650
thing. He said the guy called him right back
and said, "Yeah, that's a good thing."

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:20.650
Because this-this turbine car's in front of
this doctor's office all day long and that

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:21.650
was getting the image out there.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:22.650
One of the cars actually starred in a movie.
There's a movie called The Lively Set starring

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.650
James Darren and some other unknowns. And
if you see the movie like on some really bad

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:24.650
channel on cable, in the opening credits it's
like, "The Lively Set" in typical '60s as

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:25.650
an announcer going, "They raced! They loved!
They had a good time! They listened to rock

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.650
and roll music!"

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.650
And it goes, "Starring James Darren," whoever
the co-stars, "And the Chrysler Turbine Car."

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:28.650
And it's credited like it's an actor.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.650
[laughter]

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:30.650
And it's kind of funny because these shots
in the movie where they-they do these close-ups

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.650
and-and do a back up in front of a blue screen.
Chrysler, that's the one thing Chrysler wouldn't

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.650
do is they wouldn't let Hollywood get their
hands on the car. So they actually sent the

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:33.650
car to Hollywood and said, "You can film it,
but the only guy that can drive it is a guy

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:34.650
named George Stetcher." And George Stecher
was a mechanic on the program.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.650
So all the shots of the close up are in so
close you can see the guy sittin' in the wrong

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.650
car. The second they back up they always back
up far enough that you can't see it's actually

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.650
a Chrysler mechanic driving it, not James
Darren.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:38.650
So IMDb calls the movie a "horrid piece of
trash." But

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:39.650
[laughter]

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.650
it's got some great car chase scenes in their
of a turbine car and some regular cars racing

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:41.650
around out in the desert which makes no sense
at all for an auto race. But

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:42.650
[laughter]

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:43.650
typical Hollywood it's, so like I said, the
car is credited like it's an actor. So that's

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.650
kinda cool.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:45.650
[pause]

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:46.650
&gt;&gt;Male in audience: What's the performance
of that compared to a normal car? You think

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:47.650
a jet engine's gonna have a lot of horse power.
Is that, did they scale it way down so that

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.650
it wouldn't be kind of ridiculous?

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:49.650
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: It was scaled way down to fit
underneath the hood and it was also geared

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:50.650
so it would behave more like a normal car.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:51.650
One of the most amazing innovations with this
car was that it has automatic transmission

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:52.650
in it. And it has a torque flick auto which
is a very, very common Chrysler transmission

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:53.650
from the era. And to put power from turbine
engine to the rear wheels they simply have

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:54.650
the turbine spinning and a wheel, a-a-a fan
blade, that's facing backwards and there's

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:55.650
nothing here and then there's another fan
blade that's attached to the input shaft of

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:56.650
the transmission. So there's air blowing over
this fan which drives the rear wheels in essence,

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:57.650
okay?

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.650
So what that did was it allowed them to basically
not worry about people tearing up clutches

00:38:58.650 --> 00:38:59.650
of manual transmissions, but it also made
it much simpler for them to build.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:00.650
The neat thing about that was is that the
car didn't accelerate really quickly because

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.650
they had it geared so that it would run better
at highway speeds. But if you really want,

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:02.650
back in the 60's people want to step on the
gas in the car, launch like a rocket.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:03.650
So some automotive guys who test drove the
vehicles for auto magazines complained and

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:04.650
said, "Hey I drove this car and zero to 60
is like horrible."

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:05.650
Well it was horrible if you didn't know what
you're doin'.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:06.650
And George Huebner read a review, I think
it was Motor Trend Magazine, where a guy said

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:07.650
the-the acceleration is horrible. I, it's
horrible. These cars will never sell because

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.650
of that.

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:09.650
And George Huebner challenged the guy to a
race. And he let the guy pick another Chrysler

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:10.650
product and he got in the turbine car and
he puts his foot on the brake and floors it.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:11.650
[laughter]

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:12.650
And because of the way that there's-there's
no torque convertor in there, you can do that.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:13.650
He winds it to 45,000 RPM. The guy says, "Go,"
and he takes his foot off the brake and goes

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:14.650
swoosh. The thing takes off like a rocket.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:15.650
[laughter]

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:16.650
Now, but he didn't want people to know about
that because that's obviously not good for

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:17.650
the engine to do it too often. But the point
is that you could make them go fast. It was

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:18.650
a question of what they were building it for.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:19.650
And the program was designed to actually have-have
a vehicle that anybody could drive without

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:20.650
having to think too much about it being different
than a typical car of the time.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:21.650
So, one drawback the car does not have air
conditioning, because air conditioning is

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:22.650
a parasitic draw that you can't do much about.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:23.650
Later versions of it they put the air conditioning
compressor on the power stage or on the-the

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:24.650
the alpha stage and could get around some
of that. But other than that it's fine.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:25.650
[laughter]

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:26.650
Anything else?

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.650
&gt;&gt;Female Commentator: Any other questions?

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:28.650
Well, thanks again for coming in today. We're
honored to have you as always and we wish

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:29.650
you lots of success with the, with the book.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:30.650
&gt;&gt;Steve Lehto: Thank you.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:30.651
[applause]
