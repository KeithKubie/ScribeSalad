you're going to be dealing with that all
 

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:36.090 align:start position:0%
you're going to be dealing with that all
right<00:20:31.450><c> and</c><00:20:32.160><c> so</c><00:20:33.160><c> in</c><00:20:33.820><c> our</c><00:20:33.970><c> training</c><00:20:34.770><c> we</c><00:20:35.770><c> do</c><00:20:35.890><c> that</c>

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:36.100 align:start position:0%
right and so in our training we do that
 

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
right and so in our training we do that
if<00:20:36.280><c> you</c><00:20:36.370><c> get</c><00:20:36.490><c> a</c><00:20:36.549><c> doctorate</c><00:20:37.179><c> degree</c><00:20:37.539><c> or</c><00:20:38.049><c> if</c><00:20:38.289><c> you</c>

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:38.410 align:start position:0%
if you get a doctorate degree or if you

stab<00:20:38.740><c> lachey</c><00:20:39.070><c> center</c><00:20:39.570><c> then</c><00:20:40.570><c> you</c><00:20:40.720><c> get</c><00:20:40.870><c> level</c>

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:41.230 align:start position:0%
stab lachey center then you get level
 

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.570 align:start position:0%

00:20:52.529 --> 00:20:52.539 align:start position:0%
well okay so what we've done with the
 

00:20:52.539 --> 00:20:56.250 align:start position:0%
well okay so what we've done with the
training<00:20:52.840><c> is</c><00:20:53.080><c> that</c><00:20:53.350><c> we</c><00:20:53.559><c> have</c><00:20:55.140><c> Crips</c><00:20:56.140><c> and</c>

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:56.260 align:start position:0%
training is that we have Crips and
 

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.770 align:start position:0%
training is that we have Crips and
bloods<00:20:56.380><c> for</c><00:20:57.010><c> example</c><00:20:57.429><c> in</c><00:20:57.520><c> LA</c><00:20:57.820><c> some</c><00:20:58.630><c> of</c><00:20:58.720><c> the</c>

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:00.610 align:start position:0%
leaders have gone through there and our
 

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
leaders have gone through there and our
strategy<00:21:01.270><c> for</c><00:21:01.480><c> training</c><00:21:01.929><c> is</c><00:21:02.260><c> to</c><00:21:02.470><c> get</c><00:21:02.650><c> those</c>

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:02.890 align:start position:0%
strategy for training is to get those
 

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
strategy for training is to get those
who<00:21:03.159><c> have</c><00:21:03.280><c> involved</c><00:21:03.820><c> in</c><00:21:03.970><c> the</c><00:21:04.120><c> violence</c><00:21:04.659><c> to</c>

00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:04.929 align:start position:0%
who have involved in the violence to
 

00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:10.470 align:start position:0%
who have involved in the violence to
become<00:21:05.799><c> teachers</c><00:21:06.340><c> of</c><00:21:06.970><c> non-violence</c><00:21:09.480><c> so</c>

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
become teachers of non-violence so
 

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.130 align:start position:0%
become teachers of non-violence so
that's<00:21:11.289><c> the</c><00:21:11.500><c> strategy</c><00:21:11.710><c> like</c><00:21:12.370><c> in</c><00:21:12.580><c> Nigeria</c><00:21:13.419><c> most</c>

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:14.140 align:start position:0%
that's the strategy like in Nigeria most
 

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
that's the strategy like in Nigeria most
of<00:21:14.260><c> our</c><00:21:14.350><c> trainers</c><00:21:14.710><c> now</c><00:21:15.059><c> Nigerians</c><00:21:16.059><c> who</c><00:21:16.900><c> were</c>

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
people then it became a non-violent camp

oh<00:22:23.630><c> I've</c><00:22:24.630><c> changed</c><00:22:24.960><c> the</c><00:22:25.140><c> camp</c><00:22:25.380><c> site</c><00:22:26.570><c> okay</c>

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:27.570 align:start position:0%
oh I've changed the camp site okay
 

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
oh I've changed the camp site okay
because<00:22:28.440><c> what</c><00:22:29.070><c> you</c><00:22:29.250><c> do</c><00:22:29.460><c> defines</c><00:22:29.940><c> the</c><00:22:30.210><c> place</c>

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:30.450 align:start position:0%
because what you do defines the place
 

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.620 align:start position:0%
because what you do defines the place
not<00:22:30.900><c> the</c><00:22:31.020><c> name</c><00:22:31.200><c> of</c><00:22:31.410><c> it</c><00:22:32.030><c> it's</c><00:22:33.030><c> the</c><00:22:33.120><c> activity</c>

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:33.630 align:start position:0%
not the name of it it's the activity
 

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.590 align:start position:0%
not the name of it it's the activity
that<00:22:33.870><c> goes</c><00:22:33.900><c> on</c><00:22:34.610><c> okay</c><00:22:35.610><c> so</c><00:22:36.270><c> that's</c><00:22:36.480><c> the</c>

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
that goes on okay so that's the
 

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.290 align:start position:0%
that goes on okay so that's the

transformation that we're talking about
 

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.660 align:start position:0%

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:41.670 align:start position:0%
