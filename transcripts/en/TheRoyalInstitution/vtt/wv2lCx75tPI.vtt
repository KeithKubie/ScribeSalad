00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.388
There's a great deal we do not yet know
about luminescence,

00:00:10.388 --> 00:00:13.980
about the way in which
animals produce light.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.700
But we know approximately
how it goes.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.860
They have in their bodies a fluid
which is the equivalent of this.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.680
And then they have in glands a fluid
which is the equivalent of this.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.820
And they're able to squirt in little jets,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.440
almost, the equivalent of this
into the equivalent of that.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.840
And let me show you what happens
when you do that.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.780
Let's have the lights down.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.780
Now then.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.560
One, two, three, squirt.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.660
Do you see that? Shall I do it again?

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.020
One, two, three, squirt.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.920
You see a blue light?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.640
Now as a matter of fact,
I know it's terrible thing to say

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.980
but I think that is so marvellous,
let's do it on a bigger scale.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.040
[CLAPS HANDS TOGETHER]

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.640
Right.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.340
[SOUND OF STIRRING GLASS]

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.680
Lights down again.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.560
One, two, three

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.400
[AUDIENCE GASPS]

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.280
How about that?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.340
[APPLAUSE]
