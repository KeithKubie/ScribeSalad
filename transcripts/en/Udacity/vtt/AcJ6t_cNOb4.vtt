00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.580
It turns out there isn't a right answer for this question.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.720
It could be either. It all depends on the kind of

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.430
SNV we're talking about. Is it an SNV in the tata

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.190
box of the promoter region? Is it an SNV in a

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.750
critical coding region portion of the gene? It all depends. And

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.090
in this lesson. We're going to find out which kinds of

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.840
mutations can have a bigger or smaller effect. But, hopefully you

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.540
were able to come up with soem scenario and justify it.
