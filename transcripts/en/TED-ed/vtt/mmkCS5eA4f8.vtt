00:00:07.028 --> 00:00:11.148
You’ve been chosen as a champion 
to represent your wizarding house

00:00:11.148 --> 00:00:15.098
in a deadly duel against
two rival magic schools.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.119
Your opponents are fearsome.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.548
From the Newt-niz school,

00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:23.249
a powerful sorcerer wields a wand
that can turn people into fish,

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.589
but his spell only works 70% of the time.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.439
And from the Leib-ton school,

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.938
an even more powerful enchantress wields 
a wand that turns people to statues,

00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:37.707
and it works 90% of the time.

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:42.568
Lots are drawn, and you’re chosen 
to cast the first spell in the duel.

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:44.771
The Newt-niz magician will go second,

00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.198
and the Leib-ton enchantress third,

00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:53.067
after which you’ll repeat casting in
that order until only one of you is left.

00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:55.639
The rules of magic duels are strict,

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:00.058
and anyone who casts out of
order immediately forfeits the duel.

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:01.598
Also, to prevent draws,

00:01:01.598 --> 00:01:04.876
the rules stipulate that 
if everyone’s still standing

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:06.568
at the end of the first round,

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:09.158
you’ll all be turned into cats.

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:11.538
Now, you must choose a wand.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:14.859
Your wizarding house presents you 
with three options:

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.348
the Bannekar, which binds 
one target with vines

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:21.655
and casts effectively 60% of the time,

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:25.047
the Gaussian, 
which turns one target into a tree

00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:27.206
and works 80% of the time,

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:30.579
and the incredibly rare Noether 9000,

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.827
which banishes one target 
to a distant mountaintop

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.667
and casts perfectly 100% of the time.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:41.866
Your opponents are masters of strategy, 
as well as sorcery,

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:46.407
and you know they’ll make the choices that
maximize their own chances of success.

00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:48.439
Which wand should you choose

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.429
and what strategy should you employ

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.087
to have the greatest chance 
of winning the duel?

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:56.788
Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:56.788 --> 00:01:57.877
Answer in: 3

00:01:57.877 --> 00:01:59.098
Answer in: 2

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:00.823
Answer in: 1

00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:03.583
You reach for the Noether 9000 first.

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:07.858
After all, it makes sense to enter 
the duel with the most powerful wand.

00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:11.053
But before you pick it up, you consider 
what would happen.

00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:13.232
As the most dangerous wizard,

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:16.668
you’d also be the target 
of the other two magicians,

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:20.167
and you’d need to take 
care of the most dangerous of them first.

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:25.746
But afterward, there’s a 70% chance you'd
be struck down by the remaining wizard.

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.359
That’s trouble.

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.301
Maybe it’s better to take the Gaussian.

00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:31.589
It works 80% of the time,

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:36.558
which means you wouldn’t be a target
until the enchantress was incapacitated.

00:02:36.558 --> 00:02:39.357
But if you succeeded in transforming her,

00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:42.955
you’d probably be turned 
into a fish immediately after.

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:44.829
If you transformed the sorcerer,

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.736
the enchantress would almost 
certainly turn you to stone.

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:51.806
It would really be better if you missed.

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.638
And that’s when you have an idea:

00:02:53.638 --> 00:02:57.067
what if you took the Gaussian, 
then missed on purpose?

00:02:57.067 --> 00:03:00.288
Then, you would wait for the sorcerer 
to attack the enchantress,

00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:04.769
and you’d have an 80% chance 
of winning against the sorcerer.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.169
It’s a good idea, but there’s a problem;

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.038
the sorcerer could also pass his turn

00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:14.329
and the enchantress, knowing that
she couldn’t pass without becoming a cat,

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.828
would cast her spell on one of you.

00:03:17.828 --> 00:03:21.128
And since you’re the most dangerous 
between you and the sorcerer,

00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:22.818
you’d be the target.

00:03:22.818 --> 00:03:25.318
And that’s when you see 
what you really need to do:

00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:29.524
take the weakest wand, the Bannekar,
and miss on purpose.

00:03:29.524 --> 00:03:32.889
Now the sorcerer knows that 
he’ll be targeted by the enchantress

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.607
and he’ll have to try to turn her into 
a fish to avoid being turned into stone.

00:03:37.607 --> 00:03:40.397
Seventy percent of the time he’d succeed

00:03:40.397 --> 00:03:43.447
and you’d have a 60% chance 
of winning the duel

00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:45.877
at the beginning of the next round.

00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:48.896
If he fails, chances are he’ll be 
turned to stone

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:53.628
and you’d still have a 60% chance of
winning the duel against the enchantress.

00:03:53.628 --> 00:03:57.658
There’s a slim 3% chance 
you’ll all be turned into cats,

00:03:57.658 --> 00:03:59.537
but when everything’s accounted for,

00:03:59.537 --> 00:04:03.396
you have better than even odds 
of winning with this strategy.

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.689
And that’s the best you can do.

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:11.577
Here’s what the probability of winning 
for the different strategies looks like.

00:04:11.577 --> 00:04:14.098
Who would’ve thought 
that the best way to take your shot

00:04:14.098 --> 00:04:16.227
would be to throw away your shot?
