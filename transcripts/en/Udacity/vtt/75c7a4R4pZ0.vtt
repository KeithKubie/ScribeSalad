00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.810
So in terms of any other stories or graphics I think this one tells a really

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.510
direct story, it's really clear to get that information out of it.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.510
Are there any examples that you have where, that's not the case,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.980
let's say the data visualization is misleading.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.310
Absolutely.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.870
So one repeat offender when it comes to breaking rules of

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.770
data visualization is Fox News.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.110
We'll look here at an example that I typically look at in my workshops.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.450
So, here what we're looking at,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.726
we have to imagine ourselves back in the fall of 2012.

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:35.073
And we're looking forward to 2013 to say what's going to happen if

00:00:35.073 --> 00:00:36.384
the tax cuts expire?

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:40.441
So on the left hand side we have what the top tax rate is now at 35%.

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:46.500
On the right hand side what it'll go to as of January 1st at 39.6%.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.970
Do you notice any issues, with this graph?

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.330
&gt;&gt; I should, I guess be worried because there's a big gap difference between

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.130
the two bars.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, your data spidey sense if probably going off here, right?

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.960
Because this increase looks huge.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.810
Why does it look huge?

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.470
&gt;&gt; For me it's the, the length of the bar.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.360
The one on the right is much bigger than the one on the left.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if we look at the details here which are small and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.800
off to the right, maybe so that we miss them.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.516
It's because our y axis doesn't start at zero.

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:14.426
&gt;&gt; Hm. &gt;&gt; It starts at 34.

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:18.714
Which means the way this is plotted, the visual increase between the two is

00:01:18.714 --> 00:01:23.478
460%, versus the actual increase if we plot this you know, with the bars going

00:01:23.478 --> 00:01:28.128
all the way down to where they should be, the increase is something like 13%.

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:31.738
So the specific rule that Fox News is breaking here is,

00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:34.720
bar charts must have a zero baseline.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.260
When we're looking at bar charts,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.660
what our eyes are doing are comparing the end points of these bars.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.500
So it's actually really important to have the entire context of the bar there to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.620
do that.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.770
In the right way.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.060
More generally this brings into question sort of ethical concerns, right?

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.270
&gt;&gt; Hm. &gt;&gt; And they're breaking the rule here, also don't lie with data.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.610
So beyond ethical concerns, it's just a really dangerous space to play in,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.510
because all it takes is that one discerning audience member to say.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.770
Hey yeah but that y axis doesn't start at zero, and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.340
whatever message you're trying to communicate then gets thrown out the window.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.170
&gt;&gt; Well, I know this was probably true for

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.530
bar charts with like the perception that we have here.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.730
Are there any cases where we don't necessarily have to start the y axis at zero?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah with line charts you can get away with not starting at zero.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.680
You still want to be very careful when doing so.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.380
Because our eyes are comparing the sort of relative points in

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.440
space rather than to an axis, the way that they are with bar charts.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.304
In general, you want to

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:37.280
try make it clear to the audience that you're doing that.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.570
And not zoom in so far that you're making minor changes appear to be really big.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.070
Right, so

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.640
you want to take the context of what it is you're showing into account there.
