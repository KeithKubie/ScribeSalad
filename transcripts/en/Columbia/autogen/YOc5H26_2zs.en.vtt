delay for example of three months can
 

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:52.179

that in any capitalist economy where you
have asset markets obviously these

you tend to have bubbles because people

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200
you tend to have bubbles because people

bubbles and the bubbles have the impact

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:07.650
bubbles and the bubbles have the impact
 

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:11.329
bubbles and the bubbles have the impact
of actually generating a boom likewise

the collapse of the bubbles creates a

more expansionary allowing the countries
 

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.370
more expansionary allowing the countries
around very large deficits but they also

twenty-five percent I think

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.090
twenty-five percent I think
 

01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:30.610
twenty-five percent I think
probably know the numbers and the IMF

in most countries there is this one one

exception well it is a little bit

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:49.820
exception well it is a little bit
 

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.450
exception well it is a little bit
interesting that the developing

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:52.460
interesting that the developing
 

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.460
interesting that the developing

the most part to the extent that was
 

01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:59.560
the most part to the extent that was
anticipated I think one of the reasons

01:03:59.560 --> 01:03:59.570
anticipated I think one of the reasons
 

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:07.770
anticipated I think one of the reasons
for this is that especially China

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:07.780
for this is that especially China
 

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:12.070
for this is that especially China
engaged in very strong policies of

01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:12.080

percent to around nine percent but that

01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:18.980
percent to around nine percent but that
 

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.760
percent to around nine percent but that
was still very strong growth and that

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:21.770
was still very strong growth and that
 

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:24.040
was still very strong growth and that
maintained the relatively strong

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:28.450
countries that were buying commodities
 

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:35.500
countries that were buying commodities
were thereby helped India has also done

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:35.510
were thereby helped India has also done
 

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:37.990
were thereby helped India has also done
in some ways much better than was

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000
in some ways much better than was
 

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.840

anticipated both of these countries are

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:40.850
anticipated both of these countries are
 

01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:45.660
anticipated both of these countries are
countries where there are large

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:45.670
countries where there are large

potentials for domestic economic growth

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:49.390

huge markets within their own country
 

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.060
huge markets within their own country
and that is one of the questions going

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:55.070
and that is one of the questions going
 

01:04:55.070 --> 01:05:01.240
and that is one of the questions going
forward about China particularly right

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:01.250
forward about China particularly right
 

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:05.320
forward about China particularly right
now and a postponed coming to that until

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:05.330
now and a postponed coming to that until

i come to the the discussion of global

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:07.550
i come to the the discussion of global
 

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:10.540
i come to the the discussion of global
imbalances at the end because China is

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:10.550
imbalances at the end because China is
 

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:15.820
imbalances at the end because China is
at the center of that discussion but I

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:15.830
at the center of that discussion but I
 

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:18.310
at the center of that discussion but I
think it is interesting that at this

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:18.320
think it is interesting that at this
 

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.020
think it is interesting that at this
juncture the developing countries

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:22.030
juncture the developing countries
 

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:23.890
juncture the developing countries
particularly in Asia are doing

01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:23.900
particularly in Asia are doing
 

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:27.200
particularly in Asia are doing
reasonably well and that in

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:27.210
reasonably well and that in
 

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:29.420
reasonably well and that in
the economies of Europe and United

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:29.430
the economies of Europe and United
 

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:31.250
the economies of Europe and United
States are not doing so well so there's

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260
States are not doing so well so there's
 

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.440
States are not doing so well so there's
been a kind of decoupling and the

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:33.450
been a kind of decoupling and the
 

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:36.579
been a kind of decoupling and the
question that is being asked now is this

01:05:36.579 --> 01:05:36.589
question that is being asked now is this
 

01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:40.190
question that is being asked now is this
can this be sustained is this just a

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200
can this be sustained is this just a
 

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.339
can this be sustained is this just a
temporary thing or is it a more

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:43.349
temporary thing or is it a more
 

01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:46.880
temporary thing or is it a more
permanent feature and i'll come back to

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:46.890
permanent feature and i'll come back to
 

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:49.640
permanent feature and i'll come back to
make a few remarks about that let me

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:49.650
make a few remarks about that let me
 

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:54.109
make a few remarks about that let me
talk about now some of the reasons that

01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119
talk about now some of the reasons that
 

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:57.579
talk about now some of the reasons that
i feel relatively pessimistic about

01:05:57.579 --> 01:05:57.589
i feel relatively pessimistic about
 

01:05:57.589 --> 01:06:03.910
i feel relatively pessimistic about

something that the UN Commission
 

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:15.230
something that the UN Commission
emphasized which is in a world of

that lower-income people consume is much
higher than that of upper income and so

higher than that of upper income and so

it bother you keep consuming as if your

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:00.850
it bother you keep consuming as if your
 

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.810
it bother you keep consuming as if your
income was going up and of course the

01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:03.820
income was going up and of course the
 

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:06.630
income was going up and of course the
way they did that is through debt and

01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640
way they did that is through debt and
 

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.849
way they did that is through debt and
the reason they could do that it was

01:08:08.849 --> 01:08:08.859
the reason they could do that it was
 

01:08:08.859 --> 01:08:11.250
the reason they could do that it was
because of the sort of housing prices so

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:11.260
because of the sort of housing prices so
 

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:13.770
because of the sort of housing prices so
their their net worth looked like it was

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:13.780
their their net worth looked like it was
 

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:17.820
their their net worth looked like it was
good but it was phony and that debt

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:17.830
good but it was phony and that debt
 

01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:20.999

sustained consumption is not going to be
 

01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:24.630
sustained consumption is not going to be
feasible going forward so that's one

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640
feasible going forward so that's one
 

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.840

discussion of going forward from the
 

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.840
discussion of going forward from the
crisis very little discussion about that

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:33.850
crisis very little discussion about that
 

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:36.180
crisis very little discussion about that
inequality and how that can be rectified

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:36.190
inequality and how that can be rectified
 

01:08:36.190 --> 01:08:39.599
inequality and how that can be rectified
and therefore the the problem that that

01:08:39.599 --> 01:08:39.609
and therefore the the problem that that
 

01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:42.200
and therefore the the problem that that

that the Commission the UN Commission

that the Commission the UN Commission
emphasized was a demand for reserves

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:56.190
emphasized was a demand for reserves
 

01:08:56.190 --> 01:08:59.340
emphasized was a demand for reserves
that was related in part to the crisis

if you did not have enough reserves the

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000
if you did not have enough reserves the
 

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.939
if you did not have enough reserves the

that led to deep recessions and
 

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.470
that led to deep recessions and
depressions and so they and many other

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:29.480
depressions and so they and many other
 

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.729

human wedding reserves is that is money
 

01:09:36.529 --> 01:09:39.579
human wedding reserves is that is money
that's not spent and so there's a

01:09:39.579 --> 01:09:39.589
that's not spent and so there's a
 

01:09:39.589 --> 01:09:41.499
that's not spent and so there's a

deficiency in global aggregate demand
and the magnitude of this in the decade

01:09:45.029 --> 01:09:45.039
and the magnitude of this in the decade
 

01:09:45.039 --> 01:09:48.339
and the magnitude of this in the decade
and the last decade it has been enormous

01:09:48.339 --> 01:09:48.349

having to do with export-led growth

policy being undermined by the WTO and
therefore putting more of the burden of

therefore putting more of the burden of
 

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:27.640
therefore putting more of the burden of
export-led growth to exchange rate which

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:27.650
export-led growth to exchange rate which
 

01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:29.529
export-led growth to exchange rate which
means when you use exchange rate

01:10:29.529 --> 01:10:29.539
means when you use exchange rate
 

01:10:29.539 --> 01:10:33.040
means when you use exchange rate

exchange reserve build up the point I'm
 

01:10:36.139 --> 01:10:38.200
exchange reserve build up the point I'm
making here is that there had been

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:38.210
making here is that there had been
 

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:41.260
making here is that there had been

up and the question is why did that

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760
up and the question is why did that

focusing on right now are the

important because countries have learned

important because countries have learned

important because countries have learned
that those countries that had large

them to have Keynesian policies to have
 

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:14.589
them to have Keynesian policies to have
expansionary policies so the worry is

01:11:14.589 --> 01:11:14.599
expansionary policies so the worry is
 

01:11:14.599 --> 01:11:17.319
expansionary policies so the worry is
that there will be an increase in demand

that there will be an increase in demand
 

01:11:17.329 --> 01:11:20.109

key part of a dealing with the problem
of global reserves is to reduce the

have to build up the reserves if they

have to build up the reserves if they

had filled in the gap for a while was
 

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.990
had filled in the gap for a while was
government stimulus packages but those

01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000
government stimulus packages but those
 

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.740

and ability of governments to renew it
 

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:31.580

is diminished because

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:31.590
is diminished because
 

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:34.840
is diminished because
to the huge increase in deficits and

to the huge increase in deficits and
 

01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:42.200
to the huge increase in deficits and
national debts I don't think this is a

national debts I don't think this is a
 

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:46.190

but then the solution was investment in

01:27:06.490 --> 01:27:06.500
but then the solution was investment in
 

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.760
but then the solution was investment in
productivity and and that seems to be

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:09.770
productivity and and that seems to be
 

01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:12.069
productivity and and that seems to be
getting away from the the idea that we

01:27:12.069 --> 01:27:12.079
getting away from the the idea that we
 

01:27:12.079 --> 01:27:13.810
getting away from the the idea that we
have a consumption problem that stems

have a consumption problem that stems
 

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:18.609
have a consumption problem that stems
from a distribution problem and this

01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:18.619
from a distribution problem and this
 

01:27:18.619 --> 01:27:20.649
from a distribution problem and this
this seems to underlie a lot of the

this seems to underlie a lot of the
 

01:27:20.659 --> 01:27:23.339
this seems to underlie a lot of the

still more and so maybe I'll be able to
 

01:35:56.959 --> 01:35:59.699
still more and so maybe I'll be able to

regarding in our the crisis facilities
 

01:36:02.869 --> 01:36:06.819
regarding in our the crisis facilities
and in his own from what I see the so I

and in his own from what I see the so I
 

01:36:06.829 --> 01:36:09.459
and in his own from what I see the so I
seem to be quite responsive and we

seem to be quite responsive and we
 

01:36:09.469 --> 01:36:11.979
seem to be quite responsive and we

when we think of the crisis we actually
 

01:36:37.789 --> 01:36:40.449
when we think of the crisis we actually
are thinking in terms of the falling

output the unemployment and so on but
 

01:36:42.619 --> 01:36:45.699
output the unemployment and so on but
even before the crisis actually happened

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:45.709
even before the crisis actually happened

particular crisis is superimposed or
 

01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:57.790
particular crisis is superimposed or
something deeper and I think this is

01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800
something deeper and I think this is
 

01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.109
something deeper and I think this is
linked to the whole question of

linked to the whole question of
 

01:36:59.119 --> 01:37:02.049

out of this particular crisis the issue
 

01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:06.459
out of this particular crisis the issue
is to come out of this crisis in a way

stimulus not only has to be co-ordinated

01:37:26.739 --> 01:37:26.749
stimulus not only has to be co-ordinated
 

01:37:26.749 --> 01:37:29.290
stimulus not only has to be co-ordinated
across countries but also has to take

01:37:29.290 --> 01:37:29.300
across countries but also has to take
 

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:31.719
across countries but also has to take
the form in which that stimulus

01:37:31.719 --> 01:37:31.729
the form in which that stimulus
 

01:37:31.729 --> 01:37:34.390
the form in which that stimulus
simultaneously also gives rise to an

simultaneously also gives rise to an
 

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.310
simultaneously also gives rise to an
expansion in food production to a

01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320
expansion in food production to a
 

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.799
expansion in food production to a
revival of peasant agriculture and so on

01:37:38.799 --> 01:37:38.809
revival of peasant agriculture and so on
 

01:37:38.809 --> 01:37:41.469
revival of peasant agriculture and so on
I emphasize peasant agriculture because

01:37:41.469 --> 01:37:41.479
I emphasize peasant agriculture because
 

01:37:41.479 --> 01:37:42.879
I emphasize peasant agriculture because
you can have an increasing food

01:37:42.879 --> 01:37:42.889
you can have an increasing food
 

01:37:42.889 --> 01:37:45.129
you can have an increasing food
production even if you have corporate

01:37:45.129 --> 01:37:45.139
production even if you have corporate
 

01:37:45.139 --> 01:37:47.739
production even if you have corporate
farming but then the vast numbers of

01:37:47.739 --> 01:37:47.749
farming but then the vast numbers of
 

01:37:47.749 --> 01:37:49.120
farming but then the vast numbers of
people who wouldn't have the purchasing

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:49.130
people who wouldn't have the purchasing
 

01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:51.310
people who wouldn't have the purchasing
power to buy the food which would be so

01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:51.320
power to buy the food which would be so
 

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.620
power to buy the food which would be so
produced so it's extremely important

01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:53.630
produced so it's extremely important
 

01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:55.390
produced so it's extremely important
given the fact that the displaced

01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400
given the fact that the displaced
 

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.089
given the fact that the displaced
peasantry is not going to be absorbed in

01:37:58.089 --> 01:37:58.099
peasantry is not going to be absorbed in
 

01:37:58.099 --> 01:38:01.120
peasantry is not going to be absorbed in

01:38:03.489 --> 01:38:03.499
an expanding capitalist workforce it's
 

01:38:03.499 --> 01:38:05.030
an expanding capitalist workforce it's
essential that I

01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040
essential that I
 

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.340
essential that I
truly the way of coming out of the way

01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:07.350
truly the way of coming out of the way
 

01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:09.260
truly the way of coming out of the way
of coming out of this crisis must be one

01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:09.270
of coming out of this crisis must be one
 

01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:11.330
of coming out of this crisis must be one
that actually sustains and supports

01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:11.340
that actually sustains and supports
 

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.540
that actually sustains and supports
peasant agriculture and also raises food

01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:14.550
peasant agriculture and also raises food
 

01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:16.880
peasant agriculture and also raises food
production so that the basic problem of

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:16.890
production so that the basic problem of
 

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:19.370
production so that the basic problem of
hunger is overcome even as we come out

01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:19.380
hunger is overcome even as we come out
 

01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:21.290
hunger is overcome even as we come out
of the crisis I think that's where the

01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.300
of the crisis I think that's where the
 

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:23.090
of the crisis I think that's where the
whole political issue is very important

01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100
whole political issue is very important
 

01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.430
whole political issue is very important
because I think one of the main features

01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440
because I think one of the main features
 

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.490
because I think one of the main features
of contemporary capitalism is that it is

01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:28.500
of contemporary capitalism is that it is
 

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:31.640
of contemporary capitalism is that it is
engaged in dispossessing small property

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:31.650
engaged in dispossessing small property
 

01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:33.410
engaged in dispossessing small property
dispossessing small producers

01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:33.420
dispossessing small producers
 

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:35.540
dispossessing small producers
dispossessing petty producers

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:35.550
dispossessing petty producers
 

01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:37.850
dispossessing petty producers
dispossessing peasants and so on as you

01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:37.860
dispossessing peasants and so on as you
 

01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.860
dispossessing peasants and so on as you
know both in India and China there have

01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:39.870
know both in India and China there have
 

01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:43.220
know both in India and China there have
been very substantial numbers of clashes

01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:43.230
been very substantial numbers of clashes
 

01:38:43.230 --> 01:38:45.470
been very substantial numbers of clashes
where the peasantry has resisted

01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480
where the peasantry has resisted
 

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.100
where the peasantry has resisted
actually the disposition from land for

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:49.110
actually the disposition from land for
 

01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:51.020
actually the disposition from land for
the purposes of industrialization zhan

01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:51.030
the purposes of industrialization zhan
 

01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:53.750
the purposes of industrialization zhan
so i think it's it's it's quite

01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760
so i think it's it's it's quite
 

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.910
so i think it's it's it's quite
important that the issue of capitalism

01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920
important that the issue of capitalism
 

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.550
important that the issue of capitalism
must be discussed in the context of an

01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560
must be discussed in the context of an
 

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:01.010
must be discussed in the context of an
entirely alternative routes trajectory

01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020
entirely alternative routes trajectory
 

01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:02.990
entirely alternative routes trajectory
that would have to be a non capitalist

01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000
that would have to be a non capitalist
 

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.210
that would have to be a non capitalist
trajectory that actually respects the

01:39:05.210 --> 01:39:05.220
trajectory that actually respects the
 

01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:06.920
trajectory that actually respects the
