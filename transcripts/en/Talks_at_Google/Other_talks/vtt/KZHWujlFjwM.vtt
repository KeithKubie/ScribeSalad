ADDY BROWN: Good afternoon,
and welcome to another Google

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.270
Authors event.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.010
Today, we feature a Googler.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.750
We have Gopi Kallayil,
featuring his new book,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.376
"The Internet to the Inner-Net."

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:16.000
My name is Addy Brown,
and I'm the head

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.540
of the industry on health
insurance in San Francisco,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.020
and I'm honored to be
opening for Gopi here today.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.460
Gopi and I go way back, having
worked on several summits

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.910
together, and now
we're coming up

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.780
on our 10-year Googleversary.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.776
He and I have been
friends for a long time.

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:33.650
I want to share with
you a quick story on how

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.690
this book came to life for me.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.740
I was out to dinner a
couple weeks ago with Gopi,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.060
and while I was waiting
for him, I sat at the bar

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.790
and finished up the last
couple of chapters of his book.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.620
The couple next to me took an
interest in what I was reading,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680
having seen the
title of the chapter,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.660
"Attitude of Gratitude."

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.090
Now, this couple was very
skeptical of this type of book,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.420
so it took me a few minutes
to explain to them why

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.040
this content and author
were so relevant, timely,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.320
and different.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.040
Now they just couldn't
wait to meet Gopi.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.810
Within two minutes
of Gopi's arrival,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.390
he had them and half
the bar, including

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.460
the bartender, engaged
in a lively activity

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.310
around attitude.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.840
I ended up gifting my
book to this couple,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.500
and I've since heard
from them on how special

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.450
and changing this
event was for them.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.060
True Gopi magic in action.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.370
From be the bison, to be the
ice cube, to be grateful,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.100
this book helps free your mind
from the Times Square world

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.860
that we live in today
and really helps

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.900
you take back
control of the things

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.928
that you have control over, like
your attitude and perspective.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.812
I know Gopi doesn't
need any introduction

00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:48.020
inside of these walls, but
let me refresh your memory

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.930
as to why he is so talented and
why we are so lucky to have him

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.730
here today.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.129
Gopi is the chief brand
evangelist at Google.

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:56.920
He works with the sales
teams and customers

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.460
to help grow customer brands
through digital marketing.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.540
Before joining Google, Gopi
was the management team

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.110
of two Silicon Valley
venture-funded startups

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.430
and a consultant at McKinsey.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.880
He also led large information
technology projects

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.530
for global corporations in
India, China, and the US.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.910
He earned his bachelor's
in electronics engineering

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.070
from the National Institute
of Technology in India.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.430
He received his MBAs from the
Indian Institute of Management

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.920
and the Wharton
School of Business.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.140
He is an avid yoga practitioner,
triathlete, public speaker,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.200
global traveler, and
Burning Man devotee.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.910
His most recent
passion is music,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.332
and he has just released
his first album.

00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:39.790
I also just learned
that he answers

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.690
every single email in his
inbox-- truly incredible.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.482
Please welcome my
dear friend, Gopi.

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:47.659
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:48.700
GOPI KALLAYIL: Thank you.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.150
Speaking of an
attitude of gratitude,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.320
how appropriate that I
get introduced by Addy,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.200
a dear friend at Google
for many years ago,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.310
and her name could very well
have been attitude as well,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.500
given what a positive
outlook to life

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.135
she always represents for me.

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:10.260
I want to start out with
a question for all of you.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.550
How many organs are
there in your body?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.950
20?

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.800
Any other guesses?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.467
How many organs?

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:21.050
It's incredible, right, to know
we're sitting there wondering,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.560
puzzled?

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.150
Even though this is
instrument or tool

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.000
we all use every single day,
and we're not even sure.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.090
I wasn't sure either, so I asked
some doctor friends of mine,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.950
and they pondered
about it a while,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.430
and they said we're not sure.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.430
It all depends on
how you count organs.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.690
So then I went to my most
trusted source, Ms. Google,

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.770
and Ms. Google told me there
are 78 organs in the human body

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.880
by popular consensus among
medical practitioners,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.930
and the largest
of that being the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.940
AUDIENCE: Skin.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.120
GOPI KALLAYIL: Skin,
yeah, largest organ.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.330
I want to introduce you
today to this 79th organ that

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.910
is now available to us,
not created by nature,

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.810
not created by
some higher power,

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.030
depending on your belief
system, but created entirely

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.050
by human beings-- this
little device here.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.460
And does that kind of shock
you that I'm addressing this

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.500
as the 79th organ in the body?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.200
But in many ways, it's started
behaving like a human organ.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.850
It has a skin.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.440
You touch it.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.980
It responds.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.890
It has eyes.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.820
It recognizes objects,
faces around you.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.440
It has ears.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.140
You speak to it.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.590
It understands you.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.960
It has a voice because
it can talk back at you,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.140
talk at you sometimes.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.890
And clearly, it seems to have
this enormous mental brain

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.560
power because this tiny 79th
organ in the palm of your hands

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.057
is connected to all published
publicly available human wisdom

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.640
out there through
the internet and can

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.950
answer practically
any factual question

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.490
that you are searching for.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.490
And it must have a mind, spirit,
and consciousness of some level

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.940
because otherwise, why
else would all of us

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.290
walk around with our 79th
so close to our heart,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.450
sleep with it next
to our bedside?

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.880
How many of you do that?

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.380
OK, about half the room.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.680
And most importantly, you
go anywhere on this campus,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.910
or practically walk around
any city in the world today,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:29.080
you'll find people with the 79th
organ lost deeply in prayer.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.870
But all jokes apart, it's
technologies like this

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.200
that has become so pervasive.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.050
The numbers are astonishing.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.980
This past February, we reached
a unique point in human history.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.890
There are now an
estimated 7.2 billion

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.230
mobile devices and 7.1
billion human beings.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.990
For the first time
in history, we

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.140
have a technology that exceeds
the number of human beings,

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.270
and that puts us at
this unique inflection

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.990
point in human history with a
lot of implications, some of it

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.420
really powerful, positive
impact that it has had,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.560
this kind of pervasiveness
of this technology,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.350
and sometimes completely
unintended, unexpected kind

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.590
of consequences.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.420
Let me give you an
example of the first one.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.580
Three years ago, I decided
to visit the largest

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.182
gathering of humanity, a
festival called the Kumbh Mela.

00:06:26.182 --> 00:06:27.890
It's a festival that
takes place in India

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.807
on the banks of the
river Ganga [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:31.890
with the other confluence.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.180
And it's a festival that
attracts 100 million people--

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.659
100 million people-- over the 51
days the festival takes place.

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.200
In fact, on the day
when I got there,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.490
there were 31 million people.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.247
And in India, when
they say there

00:06:44.247 --> 00:06:45.830
were millions of
people at a festival,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.350
it is not a figure of speech.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.100
It means there were
actually millions

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.290
of people gathered there.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.265
That was what 30 million on a
single day on the banks of one

00:06:54.265 --> 00:06:55.510
river looks like.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.730
Now, this festival is
famous for attracting

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.230
a lot of Hindu holy
men-- spiritualists,

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.770
monks, yogis, mystics.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.920
These are career professionals
who have dedicated their lives

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.090
to exploring the inner journey.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.180
They spend a bulk of
the time in practices

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.840
like meditation and
silence and contemplation,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.090
which is interesting.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.740
So early one morning, as walking
along the banks of the river

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.410
as the sun was coming up, and
I spotted one of these mystics

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.920
on the banks of the river.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.230
And this person, he was
not engaged in a yoga pose.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.290
As the sun was coming up, he
was not lost deep in meditation.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.520
He was not chanting
Sanskrit mantras.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.350
Instead, he was jabbering
away on a cell phone,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.810
and I was thinking, what
is he doing this morning?

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.930
Who is he talking to, Lord
Shiva his venture capitalist?

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.650
And I was thinking, what are we
doing with the technologies we

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.718
build here, driving
to distraction

00:07:55.718 --> 00:07:56.968
these professional meditators?

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.590
But all jokes apart, it is true
that these kind of technologies

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:11.750
have really put us in an amazing
amount of power and capability

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.800
in our hands, and
I want to tell you

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.580
one story where it illustrates
deeply the extent to which

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.660
it is touching human
lives around the planet

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.712
in a positive way.

00:08:19.712 --> 00:08:21.420
And for that, I actually
want to take you

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.760
to a tiny rice farming
village called Chittilamchery

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.780
in southern India.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.170
And I took this photograph
three weeks ago, four weeks ago.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.280
I was there.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.049
And this is a place that
has a very, very soft spot

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:39.039
in my heart because
this is my home village.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.360
This is where my parents were.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.049
This were the pictures I took
as I went down memory lane

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.064
and looked at the
green paddy fields

00:08:45.064 --> 00:08:46.730
that my grandfather
used to grow rice in

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.960
and visiting the village
temple and befriending again

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.050
the current local resident
village elephant, et cetera.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.100
So it had a very, very
sweet experience for me

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.190
as I went through.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.220
And the reason I feel this
strong sense of connection

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.300
with this particular
village, and where

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.160
this connection with
technology becomes

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.990
really vivid in my mind, is
if I go back several years ago

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.960
and look at this
rice paddies, they

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.170
are the same rice paddies
that fed our families.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.520
And this is where
my grandparents

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.700
lived their entire life
as poor rice farmers.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.320
And this is the same village
where my parents also

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.550
grew up as the children
of poor rice farmers,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.940
with a very modest
kind of background

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.590
that you get to experience
in a rural Indian village.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.090
So they grew up
without electricity.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.630
They grew up without
running water.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.760
And the only education
that they have

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.650
is a modest 10
years of schooling

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:44.000
in the local Indian
rural village school.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.870
And yet, they created the
circumstances and conditions

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.880
for their kids, me
and my three siblings,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.950
and we went on to get 10
advanced degrees, including

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.220
two from US Ivy League
business schools,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.800
even though my parents had
never set foot in America.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.470
So often, the question
is asked, "What

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.380
caused that kind of social
mobility in one generation?"

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.020
It was simply access
to information.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.540
But it's very slow access.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.040
I still remember after
graduating from engineering

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.220
school when I wanted to get
information on graduate schools

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.390
to apply to, I took an
eight-hour train trip

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.650
from the town where our college
was to the nearest big city

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.980
of Chennai to get access to the
only physical copy I knew where

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.620
I could get us access
to of the "US World News

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.900
Guide to Graduate Schools."

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.350
Eight-hour train journey.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.610
Now, of course, we pull
out the 79th organ,

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.390
and if it takes eight
seconds, it seems forever.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.230
We get restless about it.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.280
But it was still
access to information

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.780
that really changed
the family's trajectory

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.890
and caused that kind
of social mobility.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.880
So when I went back this
time four weeks ago,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.570
I looked at the school
where my mother studied.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.220
In terms of
infrastructure, it does not

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.480
look very different
from 30, 40 years ago,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.690
but for one difference.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.932
In that school And tens
of thousands of schools

00:11:02.932 --> 00:11:05.390
like that around the world--
it's not just in this village,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.080
but any part of
the world that you

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.610
can look at-- kids with
access to computers

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.110
and the kind of
amazing technologies

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.776
that we are building
and the information

00:11:12.776 --> 00:11:15.390
we are putting on top
of it now have access

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.830
to the same amount
of information

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.450
as you all currently
have sitting here

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.460
or somebody has at the top
universities in the world.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.340
So clearly, thanks
to this technologies,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.030
in an era where
information is like oxygen,

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.140
we are leveling the playing
field for information.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.670
Huge amounts of
benefit, and all of us

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.880
are participants in creating
that kind of an ecosystem.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.260
And it's really transformed
life on this planet.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:48.630
All well and good, but that
puts us also in direct conflict

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.146
with something else
that we fundamentally

00:11:51.146 --> 00:11:53.020
need as human beings,
and that is what I want

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.940
to examine in this talk today.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.060
On the one hand, so I say--
I illustrated with this two

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.540
examples, these technologies
are playing an amazing role,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:09.170
but it also comes at a
certain kind of price,

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.280
the price for attention, the
price to-- the distraction

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.620
that it brings to our life.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.660
And we're all trying to cope
with the amount of information

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.880
that comes because all of these
technologies-- they constantly

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.027
clamor for attention.

00:12:21.027 --> 00:12:22.860
We have to respond to
the hundreds of emails

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.170
that come to us, the pings,
the rings, the tweets.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.290
And it is around the clock.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.240
There is no question.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.477
The old rhythm of life--
when the sun goes down,

00:12:33.477 --> 00:12:34.310
you turn things off.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.070
Automatically,
everything shut down,

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.550
and your body and
the pace of life

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.700
slow down-- that is
simply not possible

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.080
because around the clock,
it is daylight somewhere,

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.540
and somebody is trying to
contact you and communicate

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.450
with you, and you
feel that urge,

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.330
that irresistible urge to
want to respond to that.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.280
And that puts us in this very,
very paradoxical situation,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.910
and that is these
technologies are useful.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.290
We need to respond to them.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.510
We need to work with them.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.070
But they constantly
seek our attention.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:05.174
And yet, there are these other
technologies that we use,

00:13:05.174 --> 00:13:07.340
which I'll talk about in a
minute, that seem to need

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.840
a different kind of response.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.950
So before I go to that, let's
not forget one simple fact.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.480
Right now, even as
internet technologies

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:20.210
are playing an amazingly
useful role in our lives,

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.885
most people still do
not have access to them.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:25.510
I know it's kind of hard for us
to comprehend and believe that.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.110
We've gotten so much used to it.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.550
But even now, a
full-fledged access

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.390
to internet and
internet-based services

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.400
is available only to an
estimated 2.5 to 3 billion

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.940
people, which means
most people in the world

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.930
do not have access to it.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.740
And even in the midst of
that kind of digital divide

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.000
we're trying to address,
there is one technology

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.920
that is universally available
to every single human

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.370
being on this planet, all
7.1 billion human beings.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.800
We use it every single
day, and I still

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.390
think of it as the most
sophisticated, most complex

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:04.980
piece of technology that
we know of, and what is it?

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.320
Yeah, our brain, right?

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.450
Our brain, our body, our
breath, our consciousness--

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.030
and with a tongue-in-cheek
kind of way,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.980
I'm calling that
as a technology.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.910
And I address this as the
most sophisticated kind

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.390
of technology.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.360
And using just a simple example
[INAUDIBLE] come to light.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.010
Noga, how old is
your daughter now?

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:24.670
AUDIENCE: Almost two.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.120
GOPI KALLAYIL: Two, right?

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.400
She's learning language, right?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.470
And she's learning three
languages simultaneously,

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.970
right?

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.293
Hebrew, English, and?

00:14:30.293 --> 00:14:31.190
AUDIENCE: A little
bit of Spanish.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.814
GOPI KALLAYIL: A
little bit of Spanish.

00:14:32.814 --> 00:14:35.080
And this three-year-old
does not have

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.000
to be taught complex rules
of grammar in each language.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.170
Somehow, they pick it up.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.760
Why are these sounds and words?

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.280
And if you just watch that
itself, it is fascinating.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.860
We're not even
close to replicating

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.850
that kind of behavior in any
of these technologies created.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.090
And that's why I said
this still continues

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.660
to be one of the most
sophisticated, complex piece

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.350
of technologies, and we
get to use-- not only

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.630
do we get to use it
every single day.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.270
I had this moment
of epiphany when

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.670
there was a teacher from
India who came here to Google,

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.550
and during a lunch, his
name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.500
He made this point.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.510
He said your entire life
experience will be filtered

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.291
through this technology.

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:18.540
Think about that for a minute.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.560
Your entire life experience-- so
right now, Noga's having lunch,

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.430
and that lunch is being
processed by this technology.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.192
You're sitting here listening
to this conversation with me,

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:28.900
and if you're trying
to make sense of it,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.960
it is being processed
by this technology.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.060
Before we started, I
played a piece of music

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.500
by the Toure-Raichel Collective.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.520
And if the music had an
emotional impact on you,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.510
and that is because it went
through this technology,

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.630
left some kind of an imprint
on your internal system,

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.160
and either made your heart race
or made your mind calm down.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.690
So anything you
experience in this life

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.260
is being filtered by
this inner technologies,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.060
and the quality of
your life is determined

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.940
by the quality of how this
technology is maintained

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:08.190
in the state of peak performance
and optimal performance.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.630
And if you are trying to
comprehend what exactly

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.730
do you mean by that,
think of the time

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.320
when you last had, say, the
flu, a simple thing that might

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.940
have passed in six, seven days.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.510
But the minute your
body state changes you

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.654
to a flu, all of a sudden,
your favorite food,

00:16:22.654 --> 00:16:23.570
you don't want to eat.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.349
You don't want to be
with your friends.

00:16:25.349 --> 00:16:27.390
The music that you might
have otherwise enjoyed--

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.770
all of a sudden, you want
to shut it down and curl

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.830
under a blanket because
something shifted

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.089
in this inner technologies.

00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:37.380
And therefore, there is the
simple fact and realization

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.730
that struck me, that
the quality of our life

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:44.010
is determined by the quality
of this inner technologies.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.340
And this is where
the intersection

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.430
with these kind of
technologies and what

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.200
this inner technology needs
puts us in direct conflict.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.210
So on the one hand, all of this
needs your constant attention,

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.960
and you need to react quickly.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.390
And you might be distracted,
or your attention

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.080
might be fragmented.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.410
But for this technology to be
in a state of peak performance,

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.920
it needs its moments of quiet.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.014
It seems to need its
moments of withdrawal

00:17:11.014 --> 00:17:12.930
and a little bit of
spaciousness in your life.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.859
So how do you bring those
two things together?

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.730
So periodically, you need, as
I in a fun way refer to it--

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.260
you need to unplug
from the internet,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.430
and on a regular places--
unplug from the internet,

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.790
and on a regular basis
plug into your inner net.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.120
So thought about
this long and hard,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.430
and how do you make
it work, especially

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.930
for people in this
audience who live

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.880
in this part of the
world in Silicon Valley

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.670
and work in an
industry like this,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.230
and as I jokingly
tell my friends,

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.520
are actually actively
involved in creating more

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.170
weapons of mass distraction?

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.300
So how do you make these
things come together?

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.640
And this is where in the book,
I talk about some rituals

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.650
that I've tried-- experimented--
that seem to work for me.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.420
So among the 32 chapters, I
explore at least one idea.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.950
How do you stay connected
with the internet while still

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.450
taking full advantage of all
of these outer technologies?

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.700
So the one thing I
want to be clear here,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.190
there are lots of advice
and books you'll find,

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.650
and people talking
about it, but here, I'm

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.700
not advocating by any
stretch of the imagination

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.780
jettisoning these
kind of technologies.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.360
I'm not asking you to go on a
retreat off to a zen monastery

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.000
somewhere.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.300
I'm saying stay plugged in.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.630
Have full engagement
with the life

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.690
as it happens
around you, and yet

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.330
carve out a little bit of
space, some kind of ritual

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.780
that on a daily basis you
are able to practice in order

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.190
to plug into your inner net.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.000
So of the different
techniques I talk

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.400
about, let me explore
five of them with you,

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.990
and if we have
time, maybe even go

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.970
into a little bit of
a practice session.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.100
So the first one I urge readers
in this book to consider

00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:00.710
is to focus on the essential.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.410
So as German
philosopher Goethe said,

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.220
things that are more
important should not

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.340
be at the mercy of things
that are less important.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.230
Things that are more
important should not

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.600
be at the mercy of things
that are less important.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.700
And the benefit
of knowing clearly

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.110
what your top priorities,
what the essentials are,

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.910
then gives you an opportunity,
as the demands on your life

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.520
ask you to fragment your
attention over many things--

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.410
you can say yes to a
few of those essentials

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.000
and say no most of the other
things that may be distracting

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.130
you because then you're
very clear how you choose

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.780
to spend your time, your
life energy, and what

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.380
you choose to spend it on.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.736
So how many essentials
do you need?

00:19:39.736 --> 00:19:40.860
I would say start with one.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.500
Have a clear idea what your
most important core essential

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.030
is, maybe three.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.677
In my case, I have five.

00:19:47.677 --> 00:19:49.510
And I'll tell you how
I arrived at the five.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.470
Years ago, I was involved with a
Silicon Valley startup company,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.040
and it was a very stressful,
highly demanding time

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.600
of my life.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.120
Most of my waking hours were
spent on building the company,

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.230
up on the business plan,
raising funding, et cetera.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.810
And when it got to a point when
the stress was a bit too much,

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:12.420
I felt I needed a break, so I
left with a dear friend of mine

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.370
to spend a weekend
in a retreat center

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.800
in a monastery on the Big Sur
coast called the New Camaldoli

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.700
Dali Hermitage.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.070
It's a Benedictine
monastery, and the 11 monks

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.050
who stay there own a little
bit of income for the monastery

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.700
by having these cottages,
where you can go and stay

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.750
that everyone-- one person
stays in one cottage overlooking

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.250
the Pacific Ocean
or the mountains--

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.400
a beautiful setting.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.066
And the idea is that
while you're there,

00:20:39.066 --> 00:20:43.030
you spend most of your time in
a silent, contemplative kind

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:43.530
of state.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.000
So they provided the
facility to do that.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.510
And what I also found amusing is
that these are fairly reclusive

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.670
monks, busy with their
practice, but their URL

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.730
is www.contemplation.com.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:21:00.880
And how a bunch of reclusive
monks did internet squatting

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.400
and grabbed a killer
URL in their category

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.050
just boggles my mind,
but they did it.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.370
They have www.contemplation.com.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.520
So I was staying
in this monastery

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.430
and spent the weekend
mostly in silence

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.305
because that's what they
encourage you to do.

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:15.270
It gave me a chance to
step back and reflect.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.830
And it struck me
while I was there

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:22.240
that my startup has
a business plan,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.070
but I have no business
plan for my life.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.330
I have no business
plan for my life.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.830
So I spend the
entire weekend saying

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.996
I'm going to write one down.

00:21:30.996 --> 00:21:33.600
I call it a business plan, but
something that comes to a close

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.181
equal.

00:21:35.181 --> 00:21:36.680
You might call it
mission statement.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.100
I call it the organizing
principles of my life.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.500
Essentially, I was
asking the question,

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.650
what are the top
essentials for my life?

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.380
And I was also very insistent
it should not be too detailed.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.650
It should not be too complex.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.310
I don't need to write a
whole 30-page essay about it.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.400
It should fit on
one sheet of paper,

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.080
and that should be the case,
I recommend, for all of us.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.570
What is truly
important in life, we

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.440
should be able to articulate
on one sheet of paper.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.180
And I wasn't satisfied
with that process.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.360
Having got it down
to a sheet of paper,

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.240
I wanted to reduce
it even further.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.700
I wanted to get it down to
its pure, beautiful essence,

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.160
and I reduced it to five words.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.340
So about 14 years ago,
I did this exercise.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.070
And for these 14
years since then,

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.300
I carry around these five
words, metaphorically

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.270
speaking on my fingertips so
that at any point in time where

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.260
a million things call
for my attention,

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.610
I always go back to those five
essentials and ask myself,

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.560
am I spending my time,
attention, energy on those five

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.570
essentials so that I can say
no to most of the other things

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.506
that are distractions?

00:22:36.506 --> 00:22:37.880
So that's one of
the first things

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.046
I would encourage you to do.

00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:41.980
Ask yourself as you leave,
if you already don't know it,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.410
what are your essentials?

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.070
Using that as a starting
point, the second ritual

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.370
on a daily basis in the
midst of all of this frenzy

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.410
I ask you to practice is
to do one thing at a time.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.230
Now, there is nothing sacred
about this particular device.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.860
This is something that you've
been hearing all your life.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.930
Your grandma told
you this, and this

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.150
is the equivalent of
saying that if you

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.260
eat vegetables and
exercise regularly,

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.240
you will be healthier.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.790
But this reason I felt that
we needed to reset and revisit

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:19.060
is despite knowing this, when
it comes to actual practice,

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:23.330
we seem to be struggling as
a species, as a generation.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.440
So last week, I was
passing through an airport,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.700
and I saw this woman in front
of me in the security line.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.360
And tell me if
you either seen it

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.680
or you've personally
done something like this.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.510
So she was moving forward
in the security line,

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.420
and she was pushing
her bag with her feet

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.930
because her hands were occupied.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.520
So she was pushing a
little-- sorry, with her leg.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.420
And she was speaking
on the phone.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.070
She also had lunch in her hand.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.070
So she's pushing the bag,
speaking on the phone,

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.397
her lunge in her hand,
when the caller asked

00:23:55.397 --> 00:23:56.980
for some piece of
information, and she

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.400
said, let me get it for you.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.756
She now cradled it,
pulled her tablet,

00:24:01.756 --> 00:24:03.630
and was looking up
information with one thumb

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:04.920
with the sandwich in the hand.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.280
She got up to the security desk,
and the gentleman, the security

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.750
officer, asked for her
boarding pass and documents.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.360
And she sat the iPad down,
reached into her wallet,

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.180
pulled it, gave it to him, and
then went back to the iPad.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.430
And this time, she was doing
five things at the same time.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.080
And I looked at it
and said how did we

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.620
get here as a civilization?

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.570
How have we survived
as a species?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.080
And I look back on my own
life and said, often, this

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.570
is the way I am behaving.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.990
It is the curse of what
blogger Linda Stone calls

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.280
continuous partial attention,
continuous partial attention

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.540
on three different things.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.480
And I often catch
myself, and I have

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.040
to be very aware and conscious
of this, sitting in meetings

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.730
trying to pay attention to
what somebody is presenting

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.900
and discussing, while
at the same time

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.230
I'm trying to answer an email.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:00.150
I have three chat windows
open, and simultaneously trying

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.860
to get through lunch as well.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:06.612
At the end of the meeting, if
you ask me what was discussed,

00:25:06.612 --> 00:25:08.070
I only have a little
bit of an idea

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.450
because I wasn't
paying full attention.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.950
If you ask me how did the food
taste because you had lunch,

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.200
I couldn't tell you because
I was just mechanically

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.130
wolfing it down.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.700
And often probably send the
wrong embarrassing text message

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.570
in the wrong window.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:23.950
She did forgive me.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.471
So this is how we
end up carrying on

00:25:27.471 --> 00:25:29.720
on a day-to-day basis, and
it comes at a certain price

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.400
because this technology,
the brain and our body,

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.840
is extremely good if you
ask it to do one task.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.240
And you try to make it do
five tasks at the same time,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.369
it completely falls apart.

00:25:42.369 --> 00:25:44.160
But when I talk about
this, a lot of people

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.890
today argue that no, an
entire generation of people

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:47.690
are coming up.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:51.010
They have become extremely
good at multitasking.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.120
If that is the case,
I would ask you this.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.070
How many of you would
be willing to go

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.950
into-- if you had to--
open-heart surgery

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.600
where the surgeon says, "I'm
really good at multitasking.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.550
And while I'm operating
on you, I like baseball.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.640
I like the stock market.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.000
I'm going to have the
TV on with both channels

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.650
and just pay attention to that."

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.180
How come, if you're so
comfortable that we have become

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.540
a generation of
multitaskers-- how many of you

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.090
ever seen a virtuoso
musician practicing

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.320
on the cello, the violin,
while watching a game on TV

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.690
simultaneously?

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.410
So if you look at any
example of peak performance

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.320
in any discipline, there is
a single-pointed attention

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.100
that has been
brought to the task,

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.110
and that is what I'm
urging you to consider.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.740
At least catch yourself when
your attention is fragmented

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.360
and come back to
the simple ritual

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.050
of do one thing at a time
because that puts this

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.860
into a state of
peak performance.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.806
And more importantly,
your energy level changes.

00:26:42.806 --> 00:26:44.180
When it's fragmented,
when you're

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.865
jumping between three
things, it exhausts you very,

00:26:46.865 --> 00:26:48.360
very quickly.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.740
The third ritual that I
talk about in this book

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.560
is commit yourself to at
least one minute of connection

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.270
with your inner-net.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.510
Just one minute.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.410
How many minutes
are there in a day,

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.500
math wizards in the audience?

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.160
1,440.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.830
OK, there are 1,440 minutes.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.950
Take at least one
of those minutes

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:15.410
to just give yourself, the
most important technology,

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.950
your fullest attention
with whatever practice

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.260
that may help you get there.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.520
So I'm not advocating
any particular one.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.790
In my own case,
yoga and meditation

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.830
are two of my practices
just to unplug from it all

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.330
and plug into my inner-net.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.290
This morning, I did it
before going to work.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.415
A few minutes of yoga, a
few minutes of meditation,

00:27:32.415 --> 00:27:33.637
it sets the tone for the day.

00:27:33.637 --> 00:27:35.220
So at this point,
you're sitting there

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.830
thinking, one minute of yoga.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.040
That's such a ridiculous idea.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.190
What can you get
done in one minute?

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.970
This is nonsense.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.710
But I'll tell you how I arrived
at this particular decision

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.070
and the kind of
impact it has had.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:54.270
So years ago, after I spent
some time in an Indian ashram

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.830
and become a yoga teacher,
during the time of my training,

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.660
every day I did four hours
of physical yoga on a mat.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.650
I spent an hour meditating,
plus many other practices.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.160
It was really incredible on
the kind of mental mind shift

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.160
that I experienced during
the time I was there.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.820
I was in college at the time.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.130
I left that place
with this commitment

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.060
saying I am going
to commit myself

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.470
to doing this every single
day, meaning every single day,

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.990
I'm going to practice at
least one hour of yoga and 30

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.650
minutes of meditation.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.050
And how long did that last?

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:28.150
Three days.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.260
I went back to
college, and my life

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.891
had been completely taken
over by staying up till 3 AM,

00:28:32.891 --> 00:28:34.390
partying with
friends, and listening

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.320
to Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.750
So for years, I struggled,
and I kept failing.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.290
I kept falling off the wagon.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.880
Most days, I could not
live up to my commitment.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.140
And I joined Google.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.636
I came here, and I'm still
struggling many years later.

00:28:48.636 --> 00:28:50.510
The fact that I didn't
seem to have integrity

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:54.130
towards my practice-- when I
went and talked to Meng one

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.660
day-- Meng, as many of
you-- probably everybody

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.800
in the audience knows, the
esteemed and famous author

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.860
of the book "Search
Inside Yourself."

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.950
So Meng looked at me and
said, "Gopi, why don't you

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.824
start with one breath?

00:29:06.824 --> 00:29:09.240
Because even if you're trying
to meditate for a full hour,

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.710
it's really 600 breaths
strung together.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.870
You have to get past
your first breath

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.660
before you get to the
rest of your practice."

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.110
And since I'm a compulsive,
neurotic overachiever,

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.920
I said I can do
better than that.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.850
I commit myself
to a whole minute.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:27.050
So that is what led to this
commitment of one minute

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.130
every single day.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.030
But here's what
happened magically.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.294
Now, there was not
a single day where

00:29:33.294 --> 00:29:34.960
I could argue with
myself, saying, oh, I

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.690
don't have the time, because
my brain would say if you can't

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.520
give yourself one minute,
one minute of the 1,440,

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:47.810
to nurturing your inner-net,
this technology, what

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.450
is the point of living?

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.650
So that became easy.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.450
It was a hurdle that I crossed,
and now a week went by.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:54.230
Two weeks went by.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.300
Six weeks went by.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.190
And for the first
time, I could look back

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.680
and claim, legitimately,
that hey, I

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.730
did yoga and meditation
every single day, even

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.840
if it was for one minute.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.799
So the idea here is
whatever that you're

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:09.590
trying to do to form
that inner connection,

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.240
find the lowest possible
threshold that you

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.250
can't say no on a daily basis,
and commit yourself to it.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.100
But then, what I
was not prepared

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.990
for is the magic that
unfolded down the line, which

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.370
is on many days,
I would sit down

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.240
for maybe a minute of
meditation or for a minute

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.600
of yoga practice.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.650
And then it would go by.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:33.300
I would feel so good internally
that the quest would pop up.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.280
What else is out there that is
so much more important that I'm

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.800
rushing off to?

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.905
This feels so wonderful,
even this one minute

00:30:39.905 --> 00:30:41.280
that I've committed,
that I would

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.260
go to the second minute,
the third minute.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.410
And before long, it was
so easy to get into a 20-,

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:47.890
30-minute kind of practice.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.990
So something shifted
there, and this is really

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.250
what I'm asking you to
engineer, by starting

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.300
with a single,
one-minute commitment.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.870
So again, as part
of this exercise

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.350
as you sit here and listen,
I'm asking you to think about,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.027
what is that one minute,
every single day,

00:31:02.027 --> 00:31:03.860
on a regular, disciplined
basis, that you're

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.620
going to commit to to find that
connection with your inner-net?

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.490
The fourth ritual that I want to
talk about, creating some kind

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:16.830
of a weekly appointment for
connecting to your inner-net.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:21.980
So there are 168 hours in
the week, and most of us,

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.260
given our personal
life, professional life,

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.410
feel that we don't have that
much control over our schedule.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.910
It gets hijacked all the time as
people add meetings and demand

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.120
us to be doing different
things, which is all true,

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.240
which is just one of the
downsides of how technology has

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.130
enabled our calendars
to be completely exposed

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.632
and managed and manipulated
by other people.

00:31:44.632 --> 00:31:46.590
So you feel like my
schedule is out of control.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.550
Other people are dominating
it, taking over it,

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.270
asking me to show up
at these meetings.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.870
All well and good.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:58.560
But of those 116
hours in the week,

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.810
commit at least one
hour on a regular slot,

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.000
fixed day of the
week, to something

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.200
that gives you about
60 minutes of forming

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.560
that inner connection.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.110
For me personally,
it is Monday, 5:30.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.030
It's a fixed slot.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.890
I teach yoga to the
yogalers at Google.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.550
And for the 9 and 1/2
years I've been at Google,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.770
I've never missed a single
class unless I'm out

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:23.540
of town, in which case, someone
like [INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.360
would sub for me.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.500
But for the yogalers community,
we always make it available.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.970
That is like one
commitment's non-negotiable.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:30.940
And I communicate that.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:35.330
So I'm asking you to pick one
fixed slot every week that

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.060
is sacred to you,
and you communicate

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:41.060
to your people who work with
you, people in your family,

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.320
and try to hold that.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.780
So the other rest of
your 167 hours in a week

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.180
can completely fall apart.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.140
No problem.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:53.710
But that one hour you hold
yourself accountable to it.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.000
Simple ritual--
and try it and see

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.670
how magic will unfold
as a result of that.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.530
The final piece of the five
that I want to talk about today

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.580
is this notion of
friend yourself.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.230
And what I mean by there is
that ever since social media

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.500
technology was
available to us, it

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.950
has put an amazing amount
of power in our hands

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.710
where now we are able to
communicate on a regular basis

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.380
to thousands of people
around the world using one

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.170
of the social media platforms.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.109
And we even brag to
each other, saying look

00:33:23.109 --> 00:33:25.150
at the number of people
who follow me on Twitter.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.610
Look at how many connections
I have on LinkedIn,

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.220
or Facebook, or Google Plus.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.260
All well and good.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.906
It definitely has
scaled how much,

00:33:32.906 --> 00:33:34.890
how far we can communicate.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.070
But in the midst of all
of this, periodically it's

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.010
important to step
back and remember

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.500
that the most important
relationship we will ever have

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.670
is the one with ourselves.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.950
The most important
relationship you will ever have

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.870
is the one with yourself.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:53.070
So even as in the midst of
how your life gets sucked

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.130
into the rhythm of
someone else's life

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.380
and you start feeling a
sense of moral inferiority

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.170
because everyone
else on social media

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.690
is having such an amazing
life on the beaches

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.960
that they have traveled to and
the parties that they have gone

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.929
to and the festivals
that they are at,

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.896
you still find that
connection back to yourself,

00:34:11.896 --> 00:34:12.520
that friending.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.719
So metaphorically speaking,
what I'm asking everyone

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:18.699
to think about is
on a regular basis,

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:21.130
listen to the tweet
from your heartbeat.

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.690
Listen to the chat
request from your brain,

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.139
and listen to the status
update from your body

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:29.151
because there is something
that it is trying to tell you.

00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:31.400
And before you get into all
these friend relationship,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:36.330
ask yourself the question,
have you friended yourself?

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.250
So these are the five rituals
that seem to work well for me.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.350
And my main message
here is not exactly--

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.250
feel free to replicate these
five, but find your own

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.440
three or five on
a regular basis.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.199
And most importantly, just
ask-- examine your life

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:53.980
to the extent
where you say, what

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.860
is it that I need to do
on a regular daily basis

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.450
to find that connection
to my inner-net?

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.890
Because as I started off
and said in the beginning,

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:04.420
the most important
thing that you can do

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.840
is to pay attention to
this inner technology

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.420
because everything
you'll experience,

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.170
you have experienced
in life so far

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.210
and that you'll
experience going forward,

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:21.570
is being filtered by this
particular technology.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.780
And these rituals help
you move this technology

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.299
to stay at a peak performance.

00:35:25.299 --> 00:35:27.340
And I want you to leave
this talk asking yourself

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.910
the question-- or if you decide
to read the book, triggered

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.470
by these ideas--
what are going to be

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.370
the rhythm of your life,
the rituals in your life

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:38.390
on a daily basis that
allow you to put your most

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:43.120
important inner technology into
a state of peak performance?

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.800
So to give you a little
flavor of what I write about

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.710
in this book, I'll just read
a paragraph here and there,

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:52.784
just to get a sense of how
we approach this topic.

00:35:52.784 --> 00:35:54.200
And if you have
time, then I'll go

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.570
into a little bit
of practice session

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.080
as well before closing up.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.800
If all you read is
just the foreword,

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.050
then I encourage you to do it.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:07.080
Pico Iyer, a good friend of mine
who is a very well-known travel

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.300
writer, and his most recent book
is called "The Joy of Quiet"--

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.480
he's spoken at
Google two times--

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.840
he agreed to write the
foreword, and he's an eloquent,

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.902
eloquent writer, and
his prose is brilliant.

00:36:18.902 --> 00:36:20.735
So if all you do is
just read that foreword,

00:36:20.735 --> 00:36:22.380
I encourage you to
because there is

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.760
a way by which he
articulates it,

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.030
and he said, "If Googlers and
their colleagues in the valley

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.950
are the unacknowledged
legislators of tomorrow's

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:33.170
mankind, I thought
we need people

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.970
with this rich and
humble sense of something

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:40.340
beyond our ideas and
calculations, high achievers

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:46.440
who know the value of surrender
as much as of control.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.210
"If these Googlers are, in
fact, the new millennium's

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.540
first masters of
the universe, let

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.320
them be guided a
sense of mystery

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.240
as much as mastery,
of unknowingness

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:04.210
of everything we can quantify
as well as everything we can.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.790
Walking around the mega screens
and beach volleyball courts

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.210
of the Googleplex
gave me a sense

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:14.464
of the field on which our
new rulers meet and play.

00:37:14.464 --> 00:37:15.880
But listening to
the music gave me

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.410
hope for something
more lasting,"

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:20.040
and he goes on to say "through
which our engineers can work

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.070
on not just our tools, but
of the souls that put them

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.810
to best use."

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:34.140
And as part of the introduction,
I went on to-- actually,

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.380
Pico then continues, "Yet
what many of his friends

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.930
and colleagues are trying
to do even more impressively

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:45.220
is ensure that there is
a space for Walden Pond,

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.280
even amidst the digital
wonders and blinking lights

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.770
of the Google campus, and that
helping to advance technology

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.200
and our sense of
possibility comes

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:05.450
from singing kirtans as much as
from producing spreadsheets."

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.010
So one of the stories I
describe in the introduction--

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:12.420
I was driving down-- and I
drive down the 101 every day.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.240
And one day, I suddenly
turned and saw--

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.823
I don't know how
many of you notice it

00:38:15.823 --> 00:38:18.130
if you come in the direction--
there is a giant Buddha

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:21.341
statue the 101 freeway.

00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:22.340
Somebody's installed it.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.069
And I just kind
of-- how many days

00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:26.610
had gone past without noticing
it, and it suddenly struck me,

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.026
it's right here
in Silicon Valley.

00:38:28.026 --> 00:38:30.240
I'm not in Nepal,
or Tibet, or Bhutan.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.334
And what is a giant
Buddha doing here?

00:38:32.334 --> 00:38:34.250
And then I started paying
more attention to it

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.800
on a daily basis, and I
went on to write in my book.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.780
"On my way to work, I pass
the perfect juxtaposition

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.680
of my two worlds.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.820
On the side of highway
101, the main artery

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.580
through Silicon Valley, looms
a huge statue of the Buddha.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.930
His back to the industrial
park where he sits,

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.870
he smiles at the harried tech
workers hurrying to their jobs

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.550
at Google, and
Facebook, and Apple.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.630
I don't know if they
even notice him,

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.460
but the Buddha, not
at all concerned

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.250
whether he's been
acknowledged or not,

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:07.590
sits with a serene
look on his face,

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.010
holding his hands up
as though in blessing.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.680
Go in peace.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.950
Go slowly.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.660
"There is an incongruity to it.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.630
A philosopher from
2,500 years ago who

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:22.390
urged the middle path now
sits along a traffic-clogged

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.960
freeway, ferrying
people on their way

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.300
to most likely built products
and system that will improve

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.490
our lives and connect
us to each other,

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:36.070
yet also add to the frenzy
and deluge of information we

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.690
face in our accelerated lives.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:41.760
When I see the Buddha in
the brief second of turning

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.300
my head, I'm
reminded that I need

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:50.020
to pause and reflect
on something larger

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:56.090
than the day's schedule that
currently occupies my mind."

00:39:56.090 --> 00:40:00.450
And that is really
the core message

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.870
that I'm trying to
deliver through this book,

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:06.710
that on a regular
basis, we all need

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:09.350
to take a few seconds,
a few minutes of time

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:12.420
on a regular basis on every
day, in the midst of all

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.280
the clamor of the
rhythm of our life

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.500
as to what is it that
is larger than ourselves

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.280
that we are trying to do
here, that we connect with,

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.120
and how will we realize it.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.500
And then I conclude
in the final chapter

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.660
next, where I say, "Such
enormous possibilities

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.960
in our lives staring at us.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.770
But to live in this
new world opening

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:36.820
to us, to adapt to the demands
of the world that will emerge,

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.990
we need new rules for living.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.940
Our children will
need new rules.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.670
Going forward,
more than ever, we

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.870
need to tune into
our inner technology

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:48.250
and bring it into
balance with the outer.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.400
"In many cases, we can
draw on the old ways that

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.320
will serve us, the
wisdom traditions

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.850
that we benefit from 2,500
years of experimentation, trial

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:02.540
and error by other human
beings who have gone before us.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.160
This is a guide book that
never goes out of date,

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.600
yet it is dynamic.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.830
We can build on it, move
forward, or in our world,

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.910
in our lives, even though we
can learn from the old ways,

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:17.370
we can't click the Back button.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:20.820
We have to click Next."

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.170
[APPLAUSE]
