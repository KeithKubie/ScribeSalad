[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:09.291
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:11.540
-Well, now, we're going
to turn to ethics,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.520
which is something
that undergirds

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.390
all of these discussions.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.050
And to introduce our speaker,
we have Danielle Allen

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.460
who is the Director of the
Safra Center for Ethics

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.840
here at Harvard University
and a professor here

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.130
in the Departments of
Government and at the Graduate

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.480
School of Education.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.580
Professor Allen is a political
theorist, author of many books

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.700
that you can see
in your program,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.970
and co-editor of the
award-winning Education,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.080
Justice, and Democracy.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.560
She's also been a chair of
several prestigious boards,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.000
including the Mellon Foundation
and the Pulitzer Prize

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.215
Committee.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:46.840
She is a member of
the American Academy

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.070
of Arts and Sciences and the
American Philosophical Society.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.774
So it's a real pleasure
to welcome Danielle Allen.

00:00:53.774 --> 00:00:57.148
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.690
-Well, we are all here
to hear from Mr. Caplan,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.860
so I won't spend long
on my introduction--

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.840
only call your attention to some
of his important biographical

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.420
details.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.480
It matters a lot to me that he
majored in philosophy, which

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.420
I take to be an excellent
starting point for tackling all

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.920
of the hardest
questions-- many of which

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.120
emerged already in
the first two panels

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.370
that we've heard this morning.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.745
And I'm very much
looking forward

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:25.520
to hearing Arthur
Caplan direct us

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.230
to what he considers the
foremost ethical problems

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.290
involving DNA.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.420
He is currently the Drs.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.970
William F. and Virginia
Connolly Mitty Professor

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.900
and head of the Division
of Medical Ethics at NYU

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.760
University.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.790
After having also been
at Penn for many years,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.670
he has published many books.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.880
You'll also know him
from his writings

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.200
for bioethics on NBC.com
and WebMD Medscape.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.879
He is currently involved in
several important projects--

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.420
too many to go
through all together--

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.200
but he asked me to call out
his work for the World Health

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.730
Organization on ethical
issues related to Ebola

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.180
and also his work on an
experimental advisory committee

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.570
at the moment with
Johnson &amp; Johnson

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.669
where the question
is how to allocate

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.900
unapproved medications.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.000
So it's with great
pleasure and interest

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.264
I welcome Arthur Caplan.

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:21.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.620
-Well, it has been said that,
to do the ethics of genomics,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.420
you do need a lot of
training because you

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.890
have to learn to say no in a
variety of different languages.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.770
But this will not be a talk
about saying no or saying

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.030
what objections or
problems there are.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.940
In fact, it may not be
a talk about anything

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.060
at all because I
don't see my clicker.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.340
Is that up here?

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.310
Did that walk?

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.171
Oh, here it is.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:52.670
Got it.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.520
So let me summarize
where we're going to go.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.830
I've been interested
in genetics,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.060
and it's followed into
the practice of medicine

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.740
for many, many years.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.730
In fact, way, way long ago,
I believe in the 16th century

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.160
when I was working as a
post-doc at The Hastings

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.030
Center, a thinktank-- one
of the original locations

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.290
to think about ethics,
medicine, and science.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.880
We were all very excited
when we got a paper published

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.000
in The New England
Journal on ethical issues

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.820
around genetic screening
for sickle cell disease,

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.830
and it turned out
to be very important

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.140
that we wrote that paper.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.250
They were at least
two states that

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.330
had required sickle cell
testing and prohibited children

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.390
from coming to school if they
were positive for sickle cell.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.830
So I wouldn't say we
were way on the cutting

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.650
edge of societal
understanding of genetics.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.120
And we basically tried
to argue at that time

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.830
that it was very important to
have good counseling if you

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.490
were going to do mass
genetic screening.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.950
The other area that was of
keen interest at the time

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.490
was what to do about
prenatal testing

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.300
in terms of genetic analysis.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.130
And some of you will know that
the field of genetic counseling

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.850
began right after World War II.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.370
It started with
chromosomal analysis,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.990
and the disease that really
caught peoples' attention

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.150
was Down syndrome because you
could accurately diagnose it.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.760
And those programs began to
flourish right after the war

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.550
and basically use this new
knowledge of chromosome testing

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.810
to offer it to women, but
the only way to get DNA

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.770
was to take it by needle from
fluid in the amniotic sac

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.740
surrounding the fetus.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.460
That's risky.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.340
It can cause an abortion
to happen if you manipulate

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.950
the fetus or the fluid.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.150
You can introduce
infection, and there are

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.350
a variety of other problems.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.090
And so ultimately, this first
type of testing prenatally

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.070
was confined to
women at older ages--

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.500
particularly over 35--
because they were considered

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.510
to have the greatest risk
of having a child with Down

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.180
syndrome because the increasing
incidence of the disease

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.267
associated with older age.

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:23.350
Subsequently, it turned
out, about 30 years later,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.660
we found out that there was also
a little bit of an association

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.470
with older men.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.415
But as was pointed out
earlier, their contribution

00:05:29.415 --> 00:05:31.910
to reproduction's never been
fully appreciated anyway,

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.400
so nobody really chased that
very hard to begin with.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.240
Well, I'm going to
tell you a couple

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.150
of little interesting
facts about DNA testing.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.450
One interesting fact
was genetic counseling

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.580
was firmly and strongly
and unabashedly neutral.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.830
When it first began,
genetic counselors

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.120
almost swore an oath.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.290
We will never direct,
influence, shape

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.040
the opinion of our patient
or our counselee in any way,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.240
shape, or form.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.640
We're just here to
give information.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.210
For those of you very old, it
was a Jack Webb philosophy--

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.510
just the facts.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.230
-[CHUCKLING]

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.792
-That's it.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.000
We don't tell you what to do.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.030
We don't tell you what you
ought to do with these results.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.346
We just give you information.

00:06:22.346 --> 00:06:25.320
Part of the reason they
took this neutral stance

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.260
was that they were just
coming out of World War II.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.110
They were just coming out of
an era of Nazi race hygiene.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.890
They were just coming out of
an era of forced sterilization

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.040
of people on racial grounds.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.270
They were coming out of
an era of, if you will,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.840
coerced eugenics.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.410
They wanted nothing to do
with that period of history,

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.800
and they partly drew
the line and said,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.090
"We don't counsel people
about what to do,"

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.430
because they didn't want
any association with, let's

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.860
call it, Nazi race hygiene.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.280
Secondly, they wound up
being neutral in their way

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.230
because they knew that that
was the right way to counsel

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.000
because they had
all studied Freud.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.320
The dominant way to
counsel at the time

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.850
was to have the
patient talk a lot

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.650
and the counselor not respond
very often at all, if at all.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.840
I mean, you listen
to Woody Allen.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.730
He says his the
analyst talked to him

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.710
only when soliciting the bill.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.930
-[CHUCKLING]

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.730
-But there was a notion that
you would reach objectivity

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:39.000
with your patient if you didn't
try to impose your values.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.320
You let them talk.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.660
And so that was very
much in the air.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.060
So a combination of factors led
the original genetic counselors

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.830
to really take a
position that's neutral.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.190
Now, some things have changed.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.300
What has changed
since that time is we

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.870
do a lot more genetic testing.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.040
And in particular,
we're starting

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.320
to do more tests that
involve neurological testing.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.070
So genetic testing
is being done for

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.960
various neurological conditions
in fetuses, newborns, children,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.030
and adults.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.050
Fragile X is one that
you will all know,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.170
but there are many where people
try to examine something having

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.550
to do with cognitive abilities.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.520
There are some early stage
tests that are going on with

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.150
Alzheimer's.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.630
And much as we heard in
the previous talk, too,

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.930
some of the testing is being
offered, what I would say,

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.379
prematurely.

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:31.420
It's not really verified.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.640
The science isn't great.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.340
But for some of
the tests, they're

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.030
excellent because partly we're
not talking gene sequences.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.020
We're talking broken
or missing chromosomes.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.130
So these are a bit
easier to detect.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.520
So brain and behavior
are especially

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.910
provocative in American society.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.630
When we start talking about
testing for those things,

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.350
we're in a
highly-competitive society.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.970
Many people will seek
any means possible to get

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.620
an edge with respect
to mental performance.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.140
And especially, they
fear mental deficiency.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.050
But what I mean is for getting
an edge on mental performance,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.760
they will, in fact, carefully
select their neighborhood

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.770
so they can put their kid
in the right nursery school

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.180
so it's a guarantee that they
can enroll here something.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:17.680
Right?

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.200
I mean, people go crazy
to try and give their kids

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.380
any sort of an advantage.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.190
And it's not confined
to the United States.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.356
You can see it in Singapore.

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:28.600
You can see it in
many other societies.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.830
So what I'm going to talk about
for the rest of these remarks

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.390
is Down syndrome.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.180
And it's the early forerunner
test, as I told you,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.120
but what has been changing
about Down Syndrome?

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.860
Well, back in the day, when
this testing first begin,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.600
there were plenty of kids
around in cities, in towns,

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.530
and out in the community
who had Down syndrome.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.300
In fact, I've been to
Ireland a couple of times

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.280
myself recently.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.340
And one of the things
I quickly noticed

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.850
is there are more
children on the streets

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.010
and around who
have Down syndrome,

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.220
but they're not here anymore.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.020
What's happened
with Down syndrome

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.410
is it's something, as you can
see from these survey results,

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.910
that many people have
negative attitudes about now.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.000
They don't think
they would want to go

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.810
to school with kids with Down.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.480
They think they
will be slowed down

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.360
if they have to have a
Down's kid in the classroom,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.330
and there are a lot of
attitudes about Down

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.110
that just aren't often
discussed in polite company

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.160
basically because it's a
cognitive defect that people

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.784
worry about.

00:10:33.784 --> 00:10:35.950
I'm going to skip this just
in the interest of time.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.990
This is a really
interesting case,

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.410
but ask me about it later.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.520
Other neurological tests that
are coming down the road.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.870
Not here yet.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.284
This is the future
aspect of DNA.

00:10:47.284 --> 00:10:49.700
We're going to be looking at
propensity to become addicted

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.930
to nicotine, cocaine, heroin.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.900
These are all marker-type
things with neural transmission

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.200
factors that we're going
to be able to test for.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.750
Probably find certain
genetic characteristics that

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.820
could be dubbed "antisocial."

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.332
This could make you
a criminal or a CEO.

00:11:07.332 --> 00:11:08.780
-[LAUGHING]

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.840
-Or maybe those are
hard to distinguish.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.130
We'll leave that for
the business school.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.090
Probably got some genetic
disposition to homosexuality

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.210
that will be detectable.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.520
Risk for autism, absolutely.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.610
Response to various
types of medications

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.800
for your schizophrenia,
your depression,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.090
your bipolar
disease, absolutely.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.190
So this whole area
brain and behavior

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.930
is one that is going to be
upon us very, very fast.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.270
The Down syndrome experience
I'm about to describe to you

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.830
is very predictive for some
of the ethical challenges that

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.030
are in store.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.120
What's wrong with
getting your fetus tested

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.260
or your kid tested?

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.850
Well, parents can overreact.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.510
They can keep their
addicted risk child isolated

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.900
in a kind of
super-helicopter environment,

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.784
not let them get near
anything that might give them

00:11:58.784 --> 00:11:59.825
a pleasurable experience.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:03.910
-[CHUCKLING]

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.975
-Just seeing if you're there.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.240
-[CHUCKLING]

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.450
-You could keep your
antisocial risk child

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.535
under close surveillance,
any kind of behavior that

00:12:12.535 --> 00:12:13.910
was indicative
that they might be

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.260
going in the wrong direction,
try to deprogram them

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.990
if they thought
homosexuality might emerge.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.350
So you could get a
lot of bad parenting

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.980
if you were worried about
hypercompetitive parents who

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.160
really care about the brains
of their kids-- less the bodies

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.170
of their kids-- and you could
see them ending pregnancies

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.420
just on these risk
factor kinds of things.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:41.300
I have not surveyed, but we're
doing a survey now of attitudes

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.740
about when parents might
end a pregnancy for any

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.641
of those reasons on that list--
homosexuality, autism, and so

00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:48.140
on.

00:12:50.632 --> 00:12:52.590
So Down, just to remind
you, is the most common

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.420
chromosomal condition.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.600
There are a lot of people
with Down syndrome.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.190
It has cognitive developmental
delays associated with it,

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.810
but the effect is usually mild
to moderate and the individuals

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.850
who have Down's possess
many strengths and talents.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.896
That sounds pretty good.

00:13:09.896 --> 00:13:12.020
That's a description of
Down from the Down Syndrome

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:12.520
Association.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.855
This is the description
from the CDC.

00:13:18.855 --> 00:13:20.230
People with Down
syndrome usually

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.960
have an IQ in the mildly
to moderately low range.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.050
And then they list a variety of
common health problems, which

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.820
isn't on the Down
syndrome page, including

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.490
hearing loss and sleep apnea and
ear infections and eye diseases

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.620
and a lot of heart
defects, a lot

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.930
of health problems associated
with the chromosomal anomaly--

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.550
not described on the
Down's Association page,

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.304
described on the CDC page.

00:13:44.304 --> 00:13:45.970
I just pulled one
other one out for you.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.180
It's not as clear,
but it basically

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.710
is the Mayo page online.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.890
And it says kids with Down have
a variety of complications.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.740
They lead with heart
defects, talk about leukemia.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.860
There's nothing there
about mild to moderate,

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.095
and there's nothing there
about a lot of potential.

00:14:01.095 --> 00:14:03.090
You can see Down's
in a lot of ways.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.300
And if you don't think values
play a huge role in how

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.050
we understand what's
a testable condition

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.400
or something worthy
of being tested for,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.830
you're not paying attention.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.900
But interesting enough,
how do you counsel?

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.110
There's three different sources
I gave you about Down right

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.500
online.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.920
Do you talk to the parents of
kids with Down's and with Down

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.830
Association?

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.570
Do you talk to the CDC?

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.010
Do you talk to a medical
site, like the Mayo Clinic?

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.660
You're going to get
three different stories.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.420
Here's a story from a parent
named Tara McCallan, who's

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.740
Canadian, but there are
plenty of these stories

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.190
from all around the world.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.050
She had a hard time
accepting her Down's kid.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.480
She's thought a lot about
ending the pregnancy,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.420
but she had the baby.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.345
Today, she celebrates
her differences.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.710
She basically says-- I
didn't put it up there.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:55.700
But that picture that
you're seeing there is up

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.700
on a billboard in Toronto,
and it's basically saying I

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.680
celebrate Down's.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.410
We should all
celebrate Down's kids.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.230
They really make a
contribution to our lives,

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.490
to their siblings' lives,
to the lives of families.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.820
There has been a
movement, in other words,

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.450
to make Down's more mainstream.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.780
And literally, you can see it.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.550
I'm sure many of you
have seen the Down's kid

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.000
who's in the beauty pageant,
the Down's child who's

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.320
now a fashion model.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.220
There's a Down's child or
two who are cheerleaders,

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.880
and many, many other
activities intended

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.400
to say, look, Down's
kids might be different,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.870
but they're certainly
not some kind of pariah.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.780
And I'm hinting at the fact that
they're certainly not something

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.565
that you would abort.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.560
So this is the American
College of Obstetrics

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.430
and Gynecologists's
recommendation about getting

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.190
screened if you're a mom.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.070
And you'll notice
something-- they

00:15:54.070 --> 00:16:00.970
think that, in terms of testing
for Down-- when the testing is

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.260
very, very good, they have
both a chemical test to see

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.390
if protein is present
in the amniotic fluid.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.690
And you can also do ultrasound
testing to see the shape

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:17.140
of body parts of the fetus,
which indicate Down's.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.300
You can do this, as I
said, by amniocentesis.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.570
You can do it by chorionic
villus sampling, which

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:27.000
is taking a piece of the tissue
from the lining of the cervix.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.954
Things get in there as well
that you can test for, cells.

00:16:30.954 --> 00:16:33.120
And there's actually cord
analysis that can be done,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.600
although that's even
dangerous to do, too.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.085
So there's a lot of
ways to test for Down's.

00:16:40.085 --> 00:16:41.460
I'm not going to
talk about them,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.080
but you could also
test the embryos

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.100
and not use ones that are
Down that you've identified

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.457
and only select embryos
at an IVF center.

00:16:49.457 --> 00:16:51.040
You might go there
even if you weren't

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.350
infertile to test your
embryos if you were trying

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.120
to avoid a kid with Down.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.100
This is what's coming.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.480
And this is the
future, and this is

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.020
why bioethicists will have
employment for some time

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.520
to come.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.500
Cell-free DNA analysis.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.619
So it turns out that
you can pull DNA

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.619
from the fetus out of
the circulating blood

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.890
of the mom at about 10 weeks.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.494
So you don't have
to do amniocentesis

00:17:22.494 --> 00:17:24.455
and you don't have to
do chorionic villus

00:17:24.455 --> 00:17:26.996
and you don't have to go through
all the rigmarole of getting

00:17:26.996 --> 00:17:30.000
a test, growing out the cells,
and finding out-- perhaps

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.770
at 18, 19, or 20 weeks--
whether Down's is present

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.090
in your fetus.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.000
You can do it all at 10 weeks.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.390
Earlier for many people
morally would be better.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:45.430
Harder to end a pregnancy
later and more risky.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.390
It can indicate--
you can do that test

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.010
and say, well, I want to do the
amniocentesis as a follow-up.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.990
But the more accurate
cell-free DNA testing

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.620
gets, the less likely
that's going to be.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.160
Right now, cell-free DNA
testing is recommended for women

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.360
at higher risk-- meaning
older or because they've

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.990
had another test and it's
becoming confirmatory.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.650
But the honest truth
is this-- cell-free DNA

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.570
testing, within the next
three to four years,

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.570
is going to be
routine in obstetrics

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.130
for every single
woman who's pregnant.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.020
It's cheap to do.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.820
It's part of blood analysis.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.080
You're just going to run it.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.890
I doubt there will be
a separate consent.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.830
It will just get done as part of
the battery of things that get

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.020
done when you come in pregnant.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.520
Interesting enough, you're
going to come in and get

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.860
that testing done
in a setting where

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.680
there's no genetic counselor.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.390
You're going to have
an obstetrician.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.390
Are obstetricians non-directive?

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.100
Oh, yeah.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.600
-[LAUGHING]

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.433
-They say things like,
"You look like you're

00:18:43.433 --> 00:18:44.970
getting a little diabetic.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.610
You're going to lose weight,
get in bed, and not move."

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.900
-[LAUGHING]

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.630
-It's pretty directive.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.996
Most physicians are directive.

00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:53.370
They don't say
things like, "Gee.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:58.315
Your blood pressure's
220 over 140.

00:18:58.315 --> 00:18:59.450
Do what you want."

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.740
-[LAUGHING]

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.635
-Right?

00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:03.010
So we then
hospitalize you, bring

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.551
you-- put you on medicine, and
then we're going to intervene.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.420
Let me summarize it this way.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.070
Every single woman
who gets pregnant

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.320
is going to have
cell-free DNA testing.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.140
We have a window
into the fetus that's

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.400
emerging that will
go past Down syndrome

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.940
but includes Down syndrome.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.490
And counseling is going
to be done by a doctor,

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.770
not by counselor.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.210
There aren't enough counselors
around in the United States

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.251
to do genetic counseling.

00:19:30.251 --> 00:19:32.090
There are probably
12,000 of them total

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.921
in the whole country.

00:19:33.921 --> 00:19:35.420
This counseling is
going to get done

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.910
by people who don't have
the tradition of neutrality

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.340
or non-directiveness
that I was talking about.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.100
They're very
directive, and they're

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.510
going to be sending
messages to women

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.430
about what they think they
ought to do if Down is detected.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.680
What that message
is, I'm not sure,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.090
but I know what some
people are worrying about.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.540
So not too long ago, I
heard about some laws

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.810
that were quietly passing
both at the federal level,

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.770
but interesting enough,
at the state level.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.201
The Down Syndrome
information Act.

00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:06.450
There was one in Pennsylvania
where I was at the time.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.140
Eight states actually have it,
and Massachusetts turns out

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.700
to be one of them.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.990
These states require
medical professionals,

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.880
when they do a test
for Down, to provide

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.210
evidence-based
information on Down along

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.300
with support contacts
and resources

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.840
to Down Association individuals.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.450
Other states have
the bills pending.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.900
The fact is abortion,
after a detection

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.300
of Down in the US percentage
of pregnancies that are ended,

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.980
probably somewhere
between 70 and 85%.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.590
Down's Association
people look at that,

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.560
like the mom who had
the poster of her kid

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.430
and said this kid
contributes a lot to my life

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.550
and is a meaningful family
member-- although she's

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.950
one of the few moms to
have a Down's child.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.310
And by the way, the rate in the
UK, abortion for Down is 90%.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.620
Denmark is about 88%.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.040
So this condition, when
detected, ends pregnancies.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.290
The Down's association
is well aware of that,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.700
and they are passing
laws that say--

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.820
when you counsel someone
who has had Down detected,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.960
we want a message
sent that's positive.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.550
We what you to talk about the
opportunities, the contribution

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.410
that they can make as
individuals to a family.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:30.280
We don't want sort of an
antidisability message sent.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.570
We want to see
that you are trying

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.520
to give people hope that
they should accept the Down's

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.290
child into their lives.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.440
And there's at least one
state that has banned abortion

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.150
for Down, North Dakota.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.920
And Ohio has a
bill pending right

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.210
before the governor today.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.620
Now, that probably
is unconstitutional

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.020
given the way Roe
v. Wade is written,

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.520
but it doesn't much matter.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.190
It's sending a huge
message, and I'm

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.160
going to tell you a little
bit here about the politics.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.635
There's the Down
syndrome numbers,

00:22:04.635 --> 00:22:05.760
which I already told about.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.010
Just racing.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.330
Watching the clock here.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:13.540
That's what the UN Rights of
Persons with Disabilities says.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.270
We're signatories.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.440
Don't discriminate
against the disabled.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.290
Respect difference.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.210
Accept persons with
disabilities as part

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.590
of human diversity and humanity.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.730
Respect evolving capacities
of children with disabilities.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.840
If you have an 85%
to 90% abortion rate,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.950
some in the Down
community and some

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.160
in the disability community
are going to say-- really?

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.460
That is nice rhetoric.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.200
Why are you killing us?

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.800
I'm going to tell
you-- and I'm not

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.570
going to bother with
the slides anymore.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.530
I'm just going to end on a sort
of highly provocative note.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:48.900
What's the future?

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.830
The future is a lot more
ability to do prenatal testing

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.530
than we ever could because
the means to do the testing

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.110
is coming out of
the bloodstream.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.800
The bloodstream gets
tested regularly.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.440
It's minor.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.040
It's easy to do.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.210
More and more labs and
more and more locations

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.590
will have the
capability to do this.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.800
It will be routine.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.500
I would probably
predict that, if you

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.690
don't offer this in
three or four years,

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.590
you'll be sued for not
following standard of care

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.980
as an obstetrician.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.970
That is, the legal
expectation will

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:25.570
be that you do offer free-cell
DNA testing of the fetus.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.100
It's also the case
that we're going

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.220
to expand into many areas
that make people very

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.860
nervous-- homosexuality,
autism, problems

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.940
of antisocial behavior.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.350
And whether you think there's
such a thing as antisociality

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:44.230
that can be impacted in
terms of really identifying

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:49.560
some genetic factors or
other personality disorders,

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.230
somebody's going to market it.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.100
The word will go out that,
if you have this footprint,

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.637
you're at a higher risk
of having a kid who's

00:23:57.637 --> 00:23:58.720
going to run into trouble.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.380
Those of you who remember
the extra Y chromosome

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.610
fiasco from probably
20 years ago

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.470
where there was a criminality
gene that was highly-touted

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.180
and something to be
avoided and-- excuse me,

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.470
a criminality chromosome
and was easily detected.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.500
There were a number of
abortions done because

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.810
of that criminal
chromosome being picked up

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.570
although the
association turned out

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.050
to be weak and fairly specious.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:27.120
It's coming again, and what's
coming down the road for all

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.550
of us into the future
of genetic testing

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:35.000
is the ethical challenge of
the spin of the counseling.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.835
We have a lot of rhetoric that
says we accept the disabled.

00:24:37.835 --> 00:24:39.600
We want to integrate
the disabled.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.790
We're ramping.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.500
We have bathrooms--
I just went to one

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.130
out there-- for the disabled.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.870
But the disability
community is going

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.530
to say, if there
aren't going to be

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.410
any disabled people--
at least, those

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.680
that have congenital
disabilities because you're

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.590
going to kill us all
in the womb-- then

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.990
in what sense are we
to believe that you

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.290
have a respect for disability?

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.890
And we're going
to pass laws that

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:10.160
make you tout to potential
parents the advantages

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.880
or the opportunities
or the enrichment

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.010
that can be brought by
adding "difference"-- not

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.450
"disability"-- into families.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.880
And we want those messages sent.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.360
Because if you've got
an 80% abortion rate,

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.300
then I don't care what you say.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.160
You're not neutral.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.810
And if all you talk about is the
risk of Down when you counsel,

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.560
that isn't neutral.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.150
So make it neutral by
balancing, by having

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.250
much more directive counseling.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.670
So who are the friends of
this political movement?

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.880
It's right-to-life and pro-life.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.199
The enemies are
the more secular.

00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:49.240
Think of them as the
Planned Parenthood proponent

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.220
crowd who respect choice and
have built their argument

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.700
around reproductive
freedom, around choice.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.320
Pro-life basically says
we respect the disabled,

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.820
and you can see the
states passing these laws.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.790
They're basically moving
through politically

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:09.650
with the support of pro-life
groups backing them up.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:10.600
I'll end on this note.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.270
That alliance is powerful.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.423
Years ago, we had a practice
that I knew about very well.

00:26:16.423 --> 00:26:19.410
It was one of the reasons I
got interested in bioethics.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.920
When a child was born
with Down or spina bifida

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.130
or other congenital defects,
if the parents said,

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.590
"There are medical
complications.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.200
Don't treat my child.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.100
We don't want them
to live," the doctors

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.430
would put the baby in a
corner and let them die.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.710
They wouldn't feed them,
and they would die.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.680
This is not a secret.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.150
It was published in The
New England Journal, Duff

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.260
and Campbell-- two major
neonatologists at Yale--

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.320
wrote it up.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.540
John Lorber wrote it up many,
many times in British Medical

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.862
Journal and lots of
publications and defended

00:26:50.862 --> 00:26:53.320
the practice saying parents
should have the right to choose

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.170
not to treat these infants.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.210
Some of you will remember
that C. Everett Koop did not

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.990
make his mark initially on HIV.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:03.680
He made his mark on
the "Baby Doe" laws.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.810
Conservatives and pro-lifers
stepped in and said you cannot

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.390
kill these infants.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.142
You should not allow them to
die from treatable conditions.

00:27:11.142 --> 00:27:12.600
No matter what the
parents say, you

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.490
should protect disabled kids.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:19.200
From that alliance was
formed a connection

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.610
between the disability community
and the pro-life community.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.840
There is no such alliance
on the other side.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.340
The alliance
maintains, and that's

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.860
why you're seeing these
laws moving through saying

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.770
we want to enrich the
message about Down's, we

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.040
want to cut the abortion
rate for Down's, or we're

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.610
going to ban
disability as a reason

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:43.370
to have an abortion-- backed
up by the pro-life side

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.640
of the argument about abortion.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.550
That's the future.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.610
We are on the edge, not just
of genetic breakthroughs,

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.260
but of one hell of a
battle about what you

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:58.830
say to somebody when you detect
Down or autism or homosexuality

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.440
or whatever the
congenital defect might be

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.530
and what freedom you have
or are going to have to act

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.360
to terminate that pregnancy.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.346
And I don't think people
are watching it closely,

00:28:11.346 --> 00:28:13.720
but I'm here to tell you I
think that's the future I see.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.633
Thanks.

00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:19.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.210
-Thank you very much.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.340
We'll take some questions.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.900
If you could, again, come
up to the microphone.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.380
Say your name, and keep
your question as a question.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.275
That would be great.

00:28:31.275 --> 00:28:33.610
While we're waiting
here a second,

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.336
I'm struck by-- you
spoke a lot-- sorry.

00:28:36.336 --> 00:28:37.507
You're on mic, but I'm not.

00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:38.840
So I have to get in front of it.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.850
It's OK.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:47.160
About the implications
for abortion of diagnosis,

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.260
of these genetic-based
deficiencies,

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.760
but I'm struck by-- we have
increasingly an ability

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.650
to cure some of them.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:29:01.820
So already, for example, we test
for a G6PD deficiency at birth.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.240
This is a genetic
enzyme deficiency,

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.060
which, if you avoid certain
foods and medicines,

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.900
you can lead a
perfectly normal life.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.540
If you don't know
about that, you

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.344
end up with a disability
that can be pretty profound.

00:29:14.344 --> 00:29:16.010
We're going to be
talking this afternoon

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.160
about CRISPR technology
which will increasingly

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.650
provide the potential
for gene editing--

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.340
perhaps the cure of such things.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.548
I don't know if you can get
rid of a whole chromosome

00:29:25.548 --> 00:29:30.180
as in Downs but other
such potential therapies.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.410
Would you mind saying
a word about what

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.660
you think about
therapy as opposed

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.460
to abortions that change
the ethical dilemma at all?

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.700
-So I think there
will be opportunities

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:44.150
to do some human
germline interventions

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.470
and potential cures.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:50.500
I would expect them to be
around in about 20 years.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.290
Looking in the human
germline is going

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.200
to turn out to be one
tricky, difficult process,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.390
and it won't take too many
disasters of something

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.070
going wrong-- a la Jesse
Gelsinger and gene therapy

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.770
not that many years ago-- before
somebody says knock that off.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.600
Keep doing it on
animals, and call me

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.050
when you're absolutely sure
you know what you're doing.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.770
I've seen this enthusiasm
explosion many times.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:14.987
I saw it for fetal tissue.

00:30:14.987 --> 00:30:16.070
I saw it for gene therapy.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.270
I saw it for embryonic
stem cells-- all of which

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.300
in recent memory
have been cured.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.404
We can't even convince
people to eat GMO.

00:30:24.404 --> 00:30:25.820
So why anybody
thinks you're going

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.810
to run around doing
germline human modification

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.230
without enormous
controversy is beyond me.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.740
So that's point one.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.570
Point two.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.060
Even if you could do it and
do it accurately and even

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.525
if George Church comes later
and says, oh, it's wrong,

00:30:40.525 --> 00:30:44.120
I can pinpoint everything,
and I can fix this

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.160
and [INAUDIBLE] has turned into
the giant Google of its day.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.770
That's inside baseball
jokes for all of you.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.532
I think that the
you're going to still

00:30:53.532 --> 00:30:55.240
have a fight on your
hands because people

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.040
are going to say, as they do in
the Deaf movement today, germy?

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.860
Germy of what?

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.446
I'm just different.

00:31:02.446 --> 00:31:04.130
Why are you curing me?

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.950
In fact, you proved my point.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.635
You're a bigot.

00:31:07.635 --> 00:31:10.880
It's sort of-- I don't
need to be cured.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.850
I'm just different.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.410
I'm Asperger-ish or
maybe I'm autistic

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.440
or maybe I have an
oddball personality.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.510
Anybody seen my paintings?

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.362
-[CHUCKLING]

00:31:19.362 --> 00:31:20.945
-You know, it's that
sort of argument.

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:23.130
So I think we'll be in
the middle of that even

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.550
with intervention possible.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.270
Yeah?

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:27.770
-Hi.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:28.561
I'm Andrew Bergman.

00:31:28.561 --> 00:31:32.214
I'm a PhD student in the
Department of Applied Physics.

00:31:32.214 --> 00:31:33.880
I apologize if this
is a stupid question

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.240
or at least poorly-formulated.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.110
A lot of--

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.210
-Well, a stupid question
for a stupid talk.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.960
Very appropriate.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.860
-Sounds good.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.850
A lot of your conversation
about Down Syndrome

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.510
was connected specifically
to the issue of having

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.570
abortions to prevent it.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.030
I'm wondering-- in some
hypothetical, futuristic

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.540
scenario where you can
maybe just take a supplement

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.900
or something that is just
not connected to abortion

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.590
any longer, it wouldn't
affect anything

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.040
else other than, let's say,
the probability that you have

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.880
a Down syndrome
child-- how would that

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.855
affect the
conversation about now

00:32:06.855 --> 00:32:08.230
this sort of
preventative measure

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.787
that has nothing
to do with abortion

00:32:09.787 --> 00:32:11.370
because the embryo
has not yet formed?

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.680
-Well, it's not totally
crazy because we've

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.260
seen it in our lifetime.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.110
Neural tube defects in encephaly
where the brain doesn't

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.890
form totally, and
problems of spina bifida

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.560
have been cut
significantly by putting

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.270
folic acid into the diet.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.120
I hate to say this publicly
because it sometimes

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.530
makes people who hate
fluoridation nuts,

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.320
but it's in your bread.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.290
It's in there.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.370
It was put in, and the
rates have fallen both here

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.040
and in countries that had
historically high rates,

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.580
like the UK and
Ireland, Scandinavia.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.580
Their rates have fallen.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.470
So the public
health intervention

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.080
was deemed so important to
prevent these problems that,

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.400
without consent or,
so to speak, almost

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.690
surreptitiously, we
put it in the diet

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.604
to try and get a solution.

00:32:58.604 --> 00:33:00.020
I think that'll
happen and I think

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.450
that'll happen for some
things, but it's not going

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:02.616
to happen for a lot of them.

00:33:02.616 --> 00:33:06.200
Some of them are just-- there
are massive genetic accidents,

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.024
or there's just serious
risks associated

00:33:09.024 --> 00:33:10.690
with different types
of mutation affects

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.530
that we don't understand or
age-based things and so on.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.920
So yeah, some of
it will get solved

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.240
by environmental
prevention, but I

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.360
suspect there'll be plenty of
other things-- maybe Downs--

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.101
where we're still going
to have this argument.

00:33:25.101 --> 00:33:26.502
-[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:26.502 --> 00:33:27.910
-Yeah.

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.592
I guess maybe I
said this poorly,

00:33:29.592 --> 00:33:31.800
but how do you think it
would affect the conversation

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.760
from these advocacy groups?

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.140
Sort of like what
would their response

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:41.132
be now that it's disconnected
from an abortion?

00:33:41.132 --> 00:33:42.590
All these different
groups will not

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.360
have the same sort
of rallying cry.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:44.860
-Yeah.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.490
I think the pro-life
groups would definitely

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.920
dissipate in their support for
attention to these matters.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.440
If you take abortion away,
they're not as interested.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.570
-I'm Lauren [INAUDIBLE]
Russell with [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.180
Research and Communications.

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.960
I have a different
kind of question,

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.360
a little bit along the lines
of the first one, which

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.800
is-- I think we are learning
enough about genomics to use it

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.739
as a preventative tool,
recognizing that there's

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:15.520
a wide variation of
population response

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.969
not only to drugs
but to installed

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.600
medical and dental devices.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.239
And that's a topic
I'm working on.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:27.199
I actually testified at the FDA
hearing on Essure a week ago

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:30.800
Thursday, and it's very clear
that women on the tail ends

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.719
of the bell curve don't-- their
immune systems do not handle

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:39.860
nickel, PET, titanium,
and it's extremely harmful

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.000
to their health even if
it's installed properly

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.060
and doesn't go migrating
around in the body.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.440
I personally got
mercury poisoning

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.050
from my dental fillings because
of methylation variance.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.870
How can we push the
field-- because we do not

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:55.770
have the genetic right
to appropriate care.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.570
I don't believe that
concept is even developed.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.980
So how can we get
people like you

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.730
in this room to discover
and push and develop

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.600
the field of genetic rights
to appropriate care that's

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.470
right for us?

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.380
-Well, part of the
good news for you

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:18.750
is that the medical complex
is shifting very quickly

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.650
to touting
personalized medicine.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:22.150
Right?

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.720
And that's partly genomic.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.460
Personalized medicine
is particularly

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:33.440
loved in the United States where
individualism, autonomy reign,

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.910
and no one likes better to hear
that medicine is made for you.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.860
Some of you may have seen ads
on TV for cancer treatments,

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.740
and they say we don't give
you just any old care.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.790
We make medicines and a
treatment plan for you.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:48.920
OK.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.150
That sounds good.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.370
I'm not sure it's true.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.330
So the reason I
don't think it's true

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.360
is that, if you go and
look at the cures we have

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.250
for different types
of cancers, there's

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.530
only three or four of them.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.390
We can tell whether one
is likely to help you

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:05.380
or not in many instances, but we
don't have personalized cures.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.730
It's going to come.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:07.490
Very popular.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.406
I don't think you're
going to have to push it.

00:36:09.406 --> 00:36:11.740
It's just the
science, the amount

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.050
of data, the amount of
science, human variability,

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:17.152
gene interactions, epigenetic
interactions on top

00:36:17.152 --> 00:36:19.610
of that-- it's just going to
take a while to figure it out,

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.901
but I think that day is coming.

00:36:20.901 --> 00:36:23.680
We will, in fact, say you're
at high risk of having

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.820
an adverse event if
you're exposed to x,

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.840
and this is not the
right deodorant for you

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.049
because you're going to get
a skin irritation from it

00:36:31.049 --> 00:36:32.006
and that sort of thing.

00:36:32.006 --> 00:36:33.040
I do think it's coming.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.200
And we want it, as
I said, because we

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.990
are so keenly interested in
personalizing our medicine,

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.130
but you can't sort of
rush the science past

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.530
where the science is.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.917
It's going to take some time,
but it is going to come.

00:36:45.917 --> 00:36:48.000
-So you think that-- because
what I'm trying to do

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.080
is jumpstart, speed up the
spread from the right medicine

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.530
to the right device, which
is not on the radar screen.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.019
-It's just a hard science.

00:36:57.019 --> 00:36:58.560
I'm not opposed to
what you're doing.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.080
It's hard.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.992
-Thank you.

00:37:03.231 --> 00:37:03.730
-Hi.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.438
-You tell me if I got
to run out of here.

00:37:05.438 --> 00:37:06.630
Make this last one?

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.570
OK.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:08.070
-Hi.

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.320
I'm Logan Walsh, and I'm an
undergrad at Gordon College.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.130
And you mentioned
Planned Parenthood

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.176
and kind of that issue.

00:37:14.176 --> 00:37:16.550
And with everything that's
happened in the news recently,

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.140
how do you see that kind of
playing out in this argument

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.766
and do you think that's going
to sway the issue in any way

00:37:21.766 --> 00:37:24.390
and what can we look for in the
next couple of years in regards

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:25.529
to that?

00:37:25.529 --> 00:37:26.570
-That's a great question.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.942
It allows me to end the session.

00:37:28.942 --> 00:37:31.150
I guess we're going to a
coffee break on a completely

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.050
depressing note.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.072
-[CHUCKLING]

00:37:34.072 --> 00:37:35.780
-You'll notice, in
the Planned Parenthood

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.420
debates about fetal
tissue, that no one

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.590
feels bound to debate the
topic in any relationship

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.110
to the facts.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:45.610
-[LAUGHING]

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.380
-So we're getting
Carly Fiorina who

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.240
says she sees things in
tapes that aren't there

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.910
that no one else can find.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:55.690
We're having all
kinds of arguments

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.240
about selling fetal tissue,
changing abortion methods.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.550
But when the nine attorney
generals in different states

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.630
have looked, they can't
find anything that indicates

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:06.370
that that practice is going on.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.277
We did see some flip
language going on,

00:38:09.277 --> 00:38:11.360
but it didn't show that
anything was happening, so

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.720
to speak, there.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.250
So the depressing part
is this-- oftentimes,

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.360
when the subjects are women's
health, reproductive health,

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.610
abortion, we get more ideology,
I suspect, than we get facts.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:25.970
We have lots of attitudes
about who's making decisions

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.745
and why, about what's
really driving things.

00:38:29.745 --> 00:38:32.450
I've been a little disappointed
in the fetal tissue debate

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:37.270
because-- I think
it was in 1992.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.735
I wrote the first articles
about how to ethically procure

00:38:39.735 --> 00:38:40.630
a fetal tissue.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.080
I know what the rules are.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.270
There were three basic
ones-- consent the woman,

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:47.040
don't change the
abortion technique,

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.710
don't profit, just
get processing fees.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.625
If you really cared about
fetal tissue procurement,

00:38:52.625 --> 00:38:55.000
you would just say you were
adhering to these principles.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.060
They've been around for-- I
don't know-- 30 years almost,

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.190
but nobody's addressed it.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.820
It's just a hobby horse
for the abortion debate.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.950
End of story.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.280
If I said tomorrow
I've established,

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.320
without any dispute, that
fetal tissue is being ethically

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.220
procured, people
would still want

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.970
to defund Planned Parenthood.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:13.500
[CHUCKLING]

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.895
So to me, that's
the depressing note.

00:39:16.895 --> 00:39:18.770
I don't think that
particular issue is really

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.040
being debated on the merits.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.660
It's just getting
debated on the politics.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.560
Thank you.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.760
