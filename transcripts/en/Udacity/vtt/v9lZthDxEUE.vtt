00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.689
The options are the places where we can
specify the intrusion detection logic.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.820
There are four main
categories of rule options.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.730
The first is meta data.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.620
This does not actually
affect intrusion detection

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.340
because it contains information such
as revision number to the rule.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.871
Payload, this is where we can specify
the logic to examine the packet payload.

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:28.941
Non-payload, this is where we specify
the logic to examine the packet headers.

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:32.630
Post-detection, this is where
we can specify triggers,

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.801
such as storing the packet
information in a table so

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:38.620
that we can correlate
it with other packets.
