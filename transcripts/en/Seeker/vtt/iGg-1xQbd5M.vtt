00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.200
In the story of an epic journey across the Pacific Ocean,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.260
one particular character might quickly come to mind.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.040
Ben saw it first, actually; it was just 
straight on the bow of the boat

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.720
three meters away â€“ it was, like, bigger than Ben.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.680
Before we left, we finally managed to 
get in touch with a shark specialist

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.760
to ask what to do in case of sharks.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.480
That specialist was Dr. Charlie Huveneers,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.800
a biologist who works to unlock 
the mysteries of shark behavior.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.540
Charlie and his team hope to find scientifically sound ways to help sharks and humans share the ocean.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.980
There's a lot of situations when sharks and humans
will be interacting, will be in the same area

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.000
without anything happening.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.080
Overall, some of these pelagic species
are typically quite curious.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.580
Evolutionarily, if you're living in the middle of the ocean, you'd need to be curious

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.840
and investigate random objects to be able to survive.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.860
Unfortunately, it's hard to be in the mind of a shark to be able to understand why in some cases

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.720
sharks do decide to attack.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.240
In the case of Ben, like any other human, the risks overall from shark attacks are very, very low.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.440
However, Ben will be spending a fair amount of time in the water, swimming in a fairly remote location

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:42.340
where white sharks are more likely to be occurring.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.052
Sharks have a fearsome reputation. 
But only a handful of the hundreds of known species

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.800
could pose a threat to humans.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.200
Nonetheless, the crew consulted with Charlie on their options to lower Ben's risk of a dangerous encounter.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.720
A deterrent is effective when it can 
reduce the risk of a shark bite.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.420
There are things like chemical repellents aimed at overwhelming the olfaction, the smell of the shark;

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.000
there are wetsuits that are trying to somewhat camouflage the person wearing it;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.940
there's no silver bullet.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.420
It turns out that the same super sensory adaptations that have allowed these prehistoric predators to flourish

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.520
in every ocean for 400 million years... may also be the key to how we can coexist with them today.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.060
The electromagnetic sense that sharks have is called the ampullae of Lorenzini.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.500
It is small pores that are located on the snout of the sharks, that are filled with a gel.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.400
That gel is conductive, and allows that electric field
to be passed on to the sensory organs

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.100
and then processed by the brain. And that enables them to feel and detect a very weak electromagnetic field

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.530
in the water.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.560
So if sharks use these heightened senses to detect prey, can we design technology

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.360
that can tap into the sharks' electromagnetic receptors, 
to keep both humans and sharks safe?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.760
To find out, Charlie and his team placed five different deterrents in known shark hangouts

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.620
and attempted to lure the sharks 
towards some tasty tuna.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.100
Two were based on electric fields.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.000
We had a total of 300 trials. During those trials, 
we tested about 44 sharks,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.940
interacting with our experimental gear, 
and these sharks did more than 1500 passes.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.760
What the team found was that only one of the deterrents tested had any effect on the behavior of the sharks:

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.420
the Shark Shield, that targeted the sensitive ampullae.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.440
When you have the shark shield, 
it is very annoying for sharks.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.660
So at first they are curious and they come close, 
but if they come too close

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.920
it's a bit like a very loud speaker for your ear.
You won't stay around.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.570
It doesn't harm you, but it's a bit annoying.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.220
Without any deterrent, the shark was taking the bait that we were presenting them about

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.780
about 96% of the time.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.780
Once we used this electric field deterrent,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.920
the proportion of bait being taken by the shark 
was reduced down to 40%.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.640
The crew keeps this device aboard the dinghy
while Ben swims,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.700
but Ben didn't need it during his recent peaceful encounter with a mako shark.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.020
But it seems such a moment with a shark that isn't a man-eating machine

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.860
is still quite difficult for some to imagine.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.120
Some studies have suggested that the public tends to overestimate the occurrence of shark attacks

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.920
by 10 or even 100 times.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.660
There's just so little we actually know
about these fascinating fish.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.200
We've got more than 500 different species of sharks

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.660
and out of those there are still a lot of species that are currently unknown.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.860
We don't even know their reproductive cycle.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.700
We don't even know where they've been feeding.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.660
The reason why I stay in the water whenever we have any type of sea life

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.140
is to observe it and try to understand it a little bit more.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.160
It's not about Jaws, the movie that we all know.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.800
Sharks are not like that.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.800
Sometimes they are like us, or like any  animals; 
they are curious.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.920
When people mostly first dive with sharks, the first thing they say is "wow, that was impressive.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.040
That was beautiful." They're more in awe

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.840
rather than they were in fear.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.960
Ben's swim across the Pacific is amazing.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.700
Obviously, you know, he has to be careful

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.900
But in most cases, he'll be quite lucky to be able to observe these animals in a natural environment

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.180
that not many people get to see as well.
