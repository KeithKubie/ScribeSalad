'How you doing, Bernardino?'

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:08.007 align:start position:0%
Now, some folks down
at the Piggly Wiggly

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.209 align:start position:0%
in the produce section,
real upset.

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.210 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You've been there?
- They're upset.

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:12.779 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah.
- You've been there?

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.781 align:start size:94% position:6%
(Junior)
'Did you see anything while
you were down there?'

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.350 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm...
I haven't been there for...

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:18.551
...seventy years?

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:19.719 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Seventy years?
- Oh.

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.087 align:start size:94% position:6%
Yeah. I mean,
I haven't been there for...

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.156 align:start size:94% position:6%
I mean, I was there
seventy years ago, I guess.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.058 align:start position:0%
You were there at the
Piggly Wiggly seventy years ago?

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.026
Yeah. So it's been a while.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.728 size:78% position:39%
Yeah, that's a long time.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.164 align:start position:0%
4:20 this afternoon.
Think hard. Produce section.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.266
Area with fruits and vegetables.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.535 align:start position:0%
A gentleman, Caucasian

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.438 size:81% position:41%
about 5'10", roller skates

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
which made us think...

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:41.107 align:start size:53% position:47%
Maybe it's Terry.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.475 align:start position:0%
Maybe Terry
would know this guy.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:45.411 line:0%
Maybe the person that works
there is stupid and ugly.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.914 align:start position:0%
See, it seems,
again to me like you might

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.382 align:start position:0%
know this person
in the produce section.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.917
I feel like it's coming back.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.986
I don't know any fat women with
red hair in the produce section.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.722 align:start position:0%
Alright, so this is
starting to fall into place.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.258 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Our witness, Kelly O'Brien--
- She sounds like a bitch.

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.528 align:start position:0%
She was a little thick,
and she wasn't super nice.

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.696 align:start size:88% position:13%
- She wasn't super nice.
- That's true.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.898 align:start position:0%
But maybe you
got off on the wrong foot

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:08.201 align:start position:0%
because what were you doing
in the produce section?

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:12.805
I was trying fruit on.

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:15.608 align:start size:84% position:16%
Mm-hmm.
That's exactly what we got.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.343 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Oh, [bleep]. God!
- You see?

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:20.246 align:start position:0%
Let him go. Let him go.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.115 align:start size:91% position:9%
(Junior)
'I didn't think
you could skate on grass.'

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.316 align:start size:81% position:19%
'Look at that
son of a bitch go.'
