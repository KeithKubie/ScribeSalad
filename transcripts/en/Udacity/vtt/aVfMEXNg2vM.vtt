00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.960
Okay. You have now successfully used Git to merge some branches.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.130
At this point, you might be wondering whether Git can always automatically

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.130
determine how to merge branches.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.825
Let's think this through by taking a look at another simple example.

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:14.220
In this example, just like in the last one,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.460
the original file contains a couple of lines, A, B and D.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.640
Remember, these are just stand-ins for lines, not the content themselves.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.430
Again, like in the previous example, Jake's file and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.930
Rachel's file look a little bit different at the end of the day.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.475
This time, at the end of the day, Jake's file contains the lines, A, B prime and

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:38.470
D, where B prime just stands for a modified version of B.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.450
And then Rachel's file at the end of the day contains A, B double prime.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.920
Again, another modified version of B, but not the same one as Jake's.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.560
And D.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.830
If it helps to think about this in more concrete terms,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.740
you can imagine that this file is a recipe and that B is a line that calls for

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.040
preheating the oven to 375 degrees.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.910
Then B prime, for instance, could call for preheating the oven to 400 degrees.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.765
And B double prime could call for 350.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.300
Then again, this content really could be anything.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.720
Just like you did in the last exercise, consider for each line whether or

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.850
not it should be in the final version.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.070
If you think it should be, mark it as yes.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.420
If you think it shouldn't, mark it as no.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.290
And if you don't think that we really have enough information,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.090
mark it as unknown.
