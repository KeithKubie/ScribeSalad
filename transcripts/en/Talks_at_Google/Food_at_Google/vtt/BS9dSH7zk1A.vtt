00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.830
MALIA DELL: Thank you very much.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.690
Hello, thank you all
for coming today.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.840
I am so excited to
be here speaking

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.310
at the Cambridge office
for Google for two reasons.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.200
Firstly, Cambridge is
my old stomping ground,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.590
and this is kind of where
I originally got the idea

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.920
to write "Food That Works."

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.320
And secondly, because without
an amazing tool like Google--

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.420
it took me four years
to write this book--

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.110
it would have taken
me over a decade

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.350
to amass amount of research
that this book required,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.070
so thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.120
you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.900
So today I wanted to
share my process of what

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.550
I did to write this book, the
research, writing the recipes,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180
illustrating the
book, food styling,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.110
taking the photographs,
self-publishing, and now

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.290
I'm on a book tour
marketing my book.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.124
So as Jonathan mentioned, "Food
That Works" is a food system.

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:12.040
It's not just, hey,
here's a bunch of recipes.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.230
Good luck.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.750
It gives you a
plan for the week,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.620
so we don't have
to think about ugh,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.050
what do I buy at the store?

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.300
What do I have at home?

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.900
What are we going
to eat this week?

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570
None of us want to
think about that.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.510
We're all busy, and this offers
you a guide, a strategic plan,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.360
to survive the 9 to 5.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.800
It offers five weeks
to choose from,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.410
and it gives you shopping lists.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.530
So you take the book right
to the store with you,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.850
or on my website,
I have a shopping

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.870
lists that you can print out
that are printer friendly.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.640
And you buy everything
on the list,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.120
you get home from the store,
and there's prep work.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.610
You bust it out real quick
kind of like a restaurant does

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.400
to prep all your
ingredients, so they

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.250
are readily available
to you during the week.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.890
And then it gives
you recipes that

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.662
utilize all those ingredients,
so there's no waste,

00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:01.620
so you don't think about
connecting those dots.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.130
I kind of did all that
sweet math for you.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.090
So ultimately, by prepping
your food in this way,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.650
you will be able to have
access to more homemade meals

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.610
and have to settle
for less meals out.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.422
Your fridge will kind
of be prepared is

00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:17.380
this quick grab-and-go.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.570
You can just slam together
food and out the door you go.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.680
So that will save you
time during the week,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.310
it'll save you money,
and ultimately, you'll

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.600
probably feel better
eating these homemade meals

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.397
instead of eating out.

00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:32.230
I'll talk a bit more
about "Food That Works"

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.020
and how it's set
up, but first, I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.250
want to give you a little
bit about my background

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.650
and the journey
creating this book.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.980
I grew up all over the place,
but I'll give you the "Cliff

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.950
Notes" version here today.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.050
I grew up in Honolulu, we lived
in Chicago, rural Vermont,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.780
all over Massachusetts.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.160
I studied abroad in
Florence, Italy in college.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.410
Then I lived in southern
Spain, Turkey, and now

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.680
Mid-coast Maine.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.310
I know, it's kind of
a wide stretch there.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.030
But Massachusetts is where I
spent the majority of my time.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.510
It's where I went to
high school and college.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.650
And right out of college, I
got a really great job working

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.000
for Gap, Inc. Doing
corporate real estate,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.280
and the office is
actually in Waltham.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.320
And settling into this
new job and my commute,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.050
I realized how difficult
it was to feed myself well

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.410
during the week.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.160
I didn't know how to cook.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.710
I wasn't really interested
in learning how to cook,

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.720
and I didn't really
eat all that well.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.190
But I kind of just assumed
that since I was busy,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.680
this was the way
that it had to be.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.890
So on the way to work,
I would stop and pick up

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.850
something for breakfast.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.920
For lunch, I would go
down to the office park

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.600
and grab something in
the limited cafeteria.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.720
Then for dinner, I'd get
home, swing open the fridge.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.930
Eh, no food, and I
would order takeout.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.410
So I'm sure a lot of us
can relate to this routine,

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.760
and it's easy to do
when you live in a city.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.740
But I was feeding myself
terribly three times a week,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.870
and I didn't even know it.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.910
My energy was zapped.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.320
Getting myself to go to the
gym was a daily struggle.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.500
And why was my energy
drained at 22 years old

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.130
is really my question.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.090
But I just continued this cycle
for several years actually.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.100
And today one of the
most common questions

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.930
that people ask me is what
motivated you to write a book?

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.290
And it's a really good question.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.220
And my most common
response is I wanted

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.560
to capture a weekly
plan for people,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.960
so they didn't have to
recreate the wheel that

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.250
offered shopping lists, prep
work, and recipes in one spot.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.600
And I couldn't find a
cookbook that did this easily,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.420
so I wrote one
myself, which is true.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.490
But when I really think back
to what my motivation was

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.800
to start cooking for
myself 26 years old,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.890
it was because I wanted
to live in Spain,

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.080
I wanted to go back to Europe.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.070
And I started cooking for myself
and prepping my meals for work

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.600
not because I wanted
to lose weight

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.490
or because I wanted
to eat better.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.700
It was because I
wanted to save money.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.200
I wanted to take a year
off, go back to Europe,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.560
and move to Spain,
and learn Spanish,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.750
and that was a
huge goal of mine.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.790
So how was I going
to make this happen?

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.910
I decided that I need to
save X amount of dollars

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.400
so I could take a
year off from work.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.410
Then I was going to
buy a plane ticket.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.230
So prepping my food
became something

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.290
that I wanted to get into.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.250
The first thing that I decided I
had to do to start saving money

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.150
was-- I was making really great
money at my corporate job,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.450
but I was spending a
ridiculous amount of money

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.140
out each week on
food and beverage.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.580
So I realized that I
was spending $7 a day

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.380
on a venti triple
pump Chai latte.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.410
That's $140 a month.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.970
So I made a rule for
myself I was no longer

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.170
allowed to get Chai lattes out.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.900
If I wanted one so bad, then
I could make it for myself,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.850
which I just didn't.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.600
And to my surprise, I got
over my heavy Chai addiction.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.434
I just started realizing
that these foods that I

00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:40.850
was putting into
my body every day

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.600
were actually slowing me down.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.810
And whenever I had the
urge to get a Chai,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.800
I would think Spain,
Chai, Spain-- OK, easy.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.710
So I decided that I want
to start cooking for myself

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.060
and prepping meals, and
I wasn't very good at it.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.240
I wasn't really succeeding.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.250
I had a loose plan when I'd
go to the grocery store,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.650
and I didn't have
recipes in mind.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.370
I would kind of just
throw things in my cart.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.750
And then I would get
home, put it all away,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.900
and realize that
during the week,

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.670
it was a lot harder
to assemble meals

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.220
from all these random
things than to actually have

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.680
a plan going into it, right?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.320
So I figured that I need to
have some sort of strategy

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.200
to be better at this.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.360
Because it's a lot more
difficult to--poof!--

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.010
just come up with a random meal
from all these ingredients.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.920
And I was wasting a lot of food,
which made me feel terrible.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.830
I'm crazy about
food waste, and I

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.090
think that we all can do a lot
better on the household level

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.180
reducing our food waste.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.250
So that was kind of a mission
that motivated me as well.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.225
And it actually is
really satisfying

00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:55.850
when you get to the point where
you're really good at your food

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.580
shop, and you get home, and
utilize all your ingredients,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.660
and everything gets
used up beautifully.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.990
And it really deepens
your respect with food

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.830
and helps you
connect to your food.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.164
Does anyone here have those
really successful food shops

00:08:09.164 --> 00:08:11.663
every week where you use every
single ingredient and nothing

00:08:11.663 --> 00:08:12.670
goes bad in your fridge?

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.480
Anybody?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.540
No, no, no.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.210
Yeah, see, because it's
difficult. It's not easy,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.930
and that takes planning.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.840
And luckily, I'm pretty
good at this game.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.030
My friends call me
the Cupboard Queen

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.790
because I love showing up
to a friend's house who's

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.130
like, I have no food.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.672
And I rustle around in their
cabinets and in their fridge,

00:08:33.672 --> 00:08:35.380
and am like, OK, if
we chop some of this,

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.520
add a little bit of that,
and add a can of beans,

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.620
then we can make tacos.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.760
And I do, I love that
challenge, but I don't love it

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.830
on a Tuesday night when I get
home from work, and I'm tired

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.370
and I'm hungry.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.980
Who would do that to themselves?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.600
So I realized that I have
this 1o-minute window

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.850
when I get in the
door and I'm hungry,

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.770
if there aren't healthful
options nearby quick for me

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.140
to grab, I will tear into
a bag of anything that

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.580
is closest, right?

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.320
So I've destroyed an
entire box of Triscuits

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.350
just waiting for my
dinner to heat up.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.300
Oh, you've done it.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.950
Come on.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.440
So sometimes when I
get home from work,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.130
I feel like Chris Farley.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.810
You know in that SNL skit with
David Spade and Adam Sandler?

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:22.490
"Lay off me.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.220
I'm starving!"

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.460
That's how I get it, and I'm
sure you can relate to that.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.500
I know this about
myself, and I realized

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.950
that in order to feed myself
the way that I want to eat,

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.210
I need to have prepared
whole foods in my fridge

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.270
ready to grab on the fly.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.170
And whole foods do take
a little love and prep.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.840
You can't just
bite into a potato.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.360
You do have to cook it.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.680
But that's what this
book aims to help you do.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.510
And I learned that the only way
to succeed at feeding myself

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.760
homemade meals three times a
day, Monday through Friday,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.230
was to have a plan when
I went to the store,

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.480
to prep those ingredients
so that they were

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.550
quick and easy to grab, and
throw into meals, and assemble,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.844
and lastly, minimal
cleanup because-- I'm

00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:12.260
sure you can all
agree with me-- I

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.040
don't want to do
dishes during the week.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.540
And this book helps
you so you don't

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.300
have to get the cutting board
out twice and make a mess.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.470
And it's all kind of
planned out for you,

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.020
so the recipes are
really minimal,

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.360
minimal cleanup, minimal tools.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.560
So my homemade food
began becoming so good

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.770
that I was no longer eating
out, and I didn't really

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.460
miss it to be honest.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.830
My confidence in
the kitchen grew.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.220
I started teaching myself how
to prepare the meals that I

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.180
was normally ordering out.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.570
And that way, I could cook
them however I liked them.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.890
So, say, in my chili,
if I love extra beans,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.580
I could add extra beans.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.290
So that was really a neat
learning moment for me,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.285
was understanding that by
cooking, I have more power

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.160
to create the meals the
way that I love them,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.970
and I don't need to settle
for the alternate out.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.670
And my confidence
grew, and I started

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.140
modifying these recipes
to have more healthful

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.160
ingredients and little
ingredient substitutions.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.460
So that's also what's great
about "Food That Works."

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.790
It's really flexible.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.400
If you're a vegetarian, you
can substitute out things,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.770
and I really recommend
people doing that.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.400
These recipes are
just guidelines.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.120
There's really not many rules.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.720
They're there for you to change
and fix however you like them.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.030
And don't get me wrong.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.360
I love my fine
dining experience.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.880
I love eating out.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.100
Sometimes there's nothing that
I appreciate more than going

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.670
to a restaurant and being
served beautiful food

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:50.360
that a ton of love and thought
went into by a team of chefs,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.130
and to share that food
across the table from someone

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.200
special in some sexy ambiance.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.070
But those are special occasions,
and they have their place

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.250
in life.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.140
And they're very
different from stopping

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:11.260
for a bagel, or a sub, a
gas station slice of pizza.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.480
What I'm interested
in is our daily meals,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.610
and the ways in which we choose
to feed ourselves three times

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.110
a day.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.540
And I learned quickly
from my experience that

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.070
not being prepared, I was forced
to settle for all these meals

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.800
out and sign up for these
sub-par ingredients,

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.360
and foods that were
full of extra added fat,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.910
and preservatives, and
things that I really didn't

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.280
want to be putting in my body.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.690
But since I wasn't
prepared, I had to do it,

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.760
and it would always
be disappointed.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.350
When you spend top dollar for
a meal for the cheapest quality

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.494
ingredients-- for example, when
you buy a $15 salad, and you

00:12:50.494 --> 00:12:51.160
look down at it.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.230
It's a tub of iceberg lettuce
with a portion of chicken

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.200
that's this big,
and three olives,

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.230
and a little ring of red onion.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.460
You're like, man, I could
have made this so much better

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.570
had I just been prepared.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.970
So I decided that I wasn't going
to settle for my meals anymore,

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.370
and that I could do
better, and that I needed

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.730
to make my meals a priority.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.170
So thank goodness
that I had connected

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.710
with my motivator, this
bigger goal of going to Spain.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:27.920
Because had I not, I wouldn't be
where I am today in my career,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.830
and to be here speaking
with you today.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.030
So initially, my motivator
was to save money,

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.770
but then I felt a
shift in my health.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:46.210
I felt I had more energy, my
skin cleared up, I was happier,

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.950
I slept better,
and hey, my clothes

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.500
fit a little bit better.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.870
And there's so many perks when
you start cooking for yourself,

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.560
and it's endless.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.870
Just the joy of finding
this hobby that you love,

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.030
and then also all of
the physical perks,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.800
and just improving your
memory, and your health.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.770
And it just really,
really impacted my life,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.030
and that's why I decided to
kind of try and capture it

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.610
in this book for other people.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.230
So I encourage you to
find your motivators.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.780
You work hard, and you deserve
quality food three times a day.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.950
So whether your motivation is
to alleviate a health issue,

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.110
to fit into those skinny
jeans in your closet,

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.840
to increase your
stamina for life,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.160
to be more
self-sufficient, maybe it's

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.230
to set an example
for your children,

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.560
or maybe it's just
so that you can

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.860
be a more useful
human in the event

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:47.030
that we have a zombie apocalypse
or something like that.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.690
I started bringing
my leftovers to work,

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.600
and the smell started
wafting through the office.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.230
And my curious coworkers
would come over and be like,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.925
what is that?

00:14:56.925 --> 00:14:57.750
You made that?

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.440
How do you time to
cook all this food?

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.620
And it really wasn't until my
coworkers started asking me

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.840
for my recipes that I thought I
might be on to something here.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.550
This is a tool that a
lot of us could use.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.150
And so I thought,
well, maybe I'll

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.960
just bind this little
pamphlet for my coworkers

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.850
and give it to
them and as a gift.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:22.070
And that is truly how the idea
to write "Food That Works"

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.230
began.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.920
I never set out to write
a 166-page cookbook.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.930
It was more these serendipitous
little events that

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.060
triggered this path for me.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.630
So shortly after
that, I started kind

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.310
of keeping my successful
shopping lists,

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.816
and my little
scribbled down recipes

00:15:40.816 --> 00:15:42.190
that were on
napkins and whatnot,

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.544
tucking them into a folder
just for future reference

00:15:44.544 --> 00:15:46.460
in case I'm going to put
this package together

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.640
for my coworkers who kept
asking me to email them recipes.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.610
And only a couple
months later, I

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.690
ended up reaching
my savings goal.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.680
I knew if I didn't go to
Spain, that I would regret it

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.170
for the rest of my life.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.600
I had to do it.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.930
So in 2011, I gave
notice at work,

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.890
I packed up my life
here in Boston,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.820
I bought a backpack and a
one-way ticket to Spain.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.540
And I had no idea how
this trip living abroad

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.140
was going to impact
the rest of my life,

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.820
but the unknown
was a place that I

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.780
felt like I needed to hang
out in for a little while.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:37.290
So I trusted, I took a leap of
faith, and I got on the plane.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.654
And just a side note
here, I use this website

00:16:39.654 --> 00:16:41.820
called Workaway, which you
might want to write down.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.530
It's amazing, this website.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.820
Workaway.info, and it's
volunteer opportunities

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.440
all over the world.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.260
So host families will
welcome you into their home,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.470
and they offer you your
room and all of your meals,

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.230
and in exchange, all you do
is volunteer for them 25 hours

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.300
a week.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.580
So this is how I was able
to afford to stay over there

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.869
for a year on my minimalist
little gypsy budget.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:07.599
And the projects are amazing.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.300
Anything that you're good at,
someone needs help with that.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.730
So the projects range from
help us release turtles

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.380
into the wild in
Costa Rica, or help

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.310
us harvest lavender
in southern France,

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.450
or help us paint a mural in
our home in southern Spain.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.630
So I encourage you to
check out this website.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.250
It's so amazing,
and maybe it'll just

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.530
help you plan your next trip.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.850
I ended up living with
these beautiful host

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.650
families for nine months
in Spain and Turkey.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.550
And I kind of had the idea
that I wanted to do this book.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.232
So any chance that I had, I
was in the kitchen observing,

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:49.690
asking them what they're doing,
taking notes in my journal.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.600
I was the first to volunteer
to go to the grocery store,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.720
so I was kind of picking
up all these little tips

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.910
that I was learning in
the Mediterranean while

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.440
living over there.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.180
After nine months,
I ran out of money.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.350
And, again, I knew I
wanted to start this book,

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:11.010
and I needed to be near American
grocery stores to do so.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.870
So I was ready to come home.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:18.080
But at that moment, I realized
just how gypsy I really am,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.100
and I realized I don't actually
have a home to return to.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.190
And this would freak
a lot of people out,

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.660
but considering my life has been
a series of moving and planting

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.020
new roots, it was something
that I was accustomed to,

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.810
and it didn't really faze me.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.200
My parents happen
to have been living

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.920
in Mid-coast Maine at the
time, so I thought, oh, I'll

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.660
put my backpack down there,
say hi to my parents,

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.480
give them a kiss
because I miss them,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.460
and then figure out what
my next step would be.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.270
It didn't take long for me to
realize that Maine is magical,

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.790
and I thought that it would
be the best place for me

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.520
to give birth to this book.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.950
Good place to focus, hibernate.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.730
So not long after I landed
on the shores of Maine,

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.360
I met a man who asked
me to house-sit for him

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.680
and take care of his cats.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.042
And he had this funky
studio artist loft

00:19:13.042 --> 00:19:14.500
space that used be
a church that he

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.570
converted into
this awesome space,

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.050
and he asked me to house-sit.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.720
So what started off
as will you house it

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.970
for me for three weeks turned
into six weeks, turned into six

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.630
months, turned into I've
been living in that space,

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.870
working on this book full-time
for the past three years.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.560
So it's been pretty
amazing, and like I said,

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.600
all the things kind of pushed
me towards finishing this book.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.640
And it's been such an
amazing journey so far.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.450
So I immediately
started doing research.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.230
I spent a lot of
time at the library

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.990
and at the good old
American grocery store,

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.712
researching ingredients, doing
calculations, figuring out

00:19:52.712 --> 00:19:54.670
all the quantities that
you see in the shopping

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.044
list on the book,
and making sure

00:19:56.044 --> 00:19:58.520
that the ingredients get
utilized and nothing goes

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.000
to waste.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.080
And to support myself while
I was writing the manuscript,

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.380
I began working at this
restaurant called Primo.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.340
It's a very special
restaurant in Maine.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.410
And the chef who
owns it, her name

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.550
is Melissa Kelly, the two-times
James Beard Award-winning chef.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.820
She is such a force.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.420
She is so amazing.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.250
And I really, truly
learned what hard work

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.020
was from watching her.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.190
But Primo is a farm-to-table
restaurant in the true sense.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.560
They have their
animals in the back.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.800
They raise pigs and
chickens every year.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.810
They grow all of
their vegetables

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.110
and harvest them fresh, and
it's what you see on your plate.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.510
So the synergy of that
place is just so amazing,

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:42.280
and it really taught me
to connect with my food,

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.880
and understand
where it came from,

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.710
and the cycle of life
of plants and animals.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.940
So learning from
her in her kitchen

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.710
and just watching this
amazing restaurant that

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:58.330
functioned as this machine, I
learned the pace of a kitchen,

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.850
and how important it is to
bust out one task, clean up,

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.420
move onto the next thing.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.000
I learned the importance of
prepping your ingredients, so

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.490
your mise en place, right?

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.320
So before every shift,
I would watch the chefs.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.400
They would chop all of
their ingredients, all

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.941
of their garnish,
everything would be

00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:15.094
perfectly ready and organized.

00:21:15.094 --> 00:21:17.010
So when an order came
in, they were just like,

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.520
handful of this, handful
of this, plate, next.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.436
Handful of this, handful
of this, plate, next.

00:21:20.436 --> 00:21:23.230
And that's what I wanted to
capture in "Food That Works,"

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.660
is this is the most
efficient way to do it.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.870
This is how they're
rocking it in this kitchen.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.230
There has to be a way that
I can apply this for myself

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.260
in my home kitchen.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.070
Also, like I mentioned,
I learned a great amount

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.120
of respect for food
working in a restaurant.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.619
I don't know if any of you have
ever worked in a restaurant,

00:21:39.619 --> 00:21:43.180
but it is hard work,
and just understanding

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.900
that all of these ingredients
took a lot of effort to create.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.770
And just really if every
single thing in a kitchen

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.380
gets utilized, then it
can get utilized again.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.200
And then even after
that, it goes to compost

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.905
or it goes to feed the animals.

00:21:59.905 --> 00:22:01.280
So I really wanted
to incorporate

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.110
that in my book and
kind of ease people

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.420
into really respecting
their ingredients.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.340
If you buy it at
the store, having

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.510
a duty to use up
the chicken breast

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.160
that you bought because that
once was an animal's life.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.370
I also learned the importance
of keeping an organized fridge,

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.250
labeling things, keeping
food in rotation,

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.800
knowing what needs to
get used up first--

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.540
that was a great lesson
for me-- and just how

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.240
to run an efficient kitchen.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.260
And this experience of working
at Primo that kind of landed

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.500
in my lap, it really
influenced the organization

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.240
that you see in
"Food That Works."

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.280
So it basically teaches you
how to be your own sous chef.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.500
And whenever you order a
salad out or a sandwich out,

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.320
someone came into work
that day and chopped up

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.470
all those ingredients,
and I'm teaching you

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.260
that you can do that type
of prep work for yourself,

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.910
and I walk you through it.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.510
So at this point, I
had the manuscript,

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.630
and I realized it
was really rough,

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.094
and I realized that I needed
people to test my recipes.

00:23:05.094 --> 00:23:07.510
I had tested them, but you
need other people to test them.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.190
And most cookbook
authors will hire people

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.920
and pay them to test
each recipe, sometimes

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.110
multiple times.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.340
But I didn't have that luxury.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.570
So I finished the five
weeks, and then I decided,

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.390
how can I figure out a way
to have people test this?

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:29.470
And there was this class in
college called Research Methods

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.670
that was required of
all sociology majors

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:33.480
to take in their senior year.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.279
And I dreaded this
class at the time,

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:38.570
and I thought ugh-- just
going to through motions-- how

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.050
is this ever going
to apply to my life?

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.250
Well, it was the
very skills that I

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.300
learned in that class
that enabled me to come up

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.220
with a plan to have
my book and my recipes

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.050
tested nationwide for free.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.690
I targeted a sample
population of people.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.990
I requested their participation.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:04.430
I sent out surveys and
recipes for them to test,

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.160
and I solicited
the feedback that I

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:11.300
needed in order to improve
my recipes in my book.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.030
I collected all the
data, analyzed it,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.790
and incorporated the changes.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.870
And ultimately, it
improved my book,

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.820
so it's easier for
other people to follow.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.290
So after I did all
of that, I ended up

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.850
writing a big thank you
letter to my Research Methods

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.970
professor, telling her how her
class that affected my life.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.609
And she was elated because I
am sure that professors don't

00:24:35.609 --> 00:24:37.650
always get to hear back
from their students years

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.270
later of how their
class impacted them,

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.480
but we stayed in touch,
and she's now the chair

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.390
of the sociology department.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.770
And next week I've been invited
to return to my Alma Mater

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.710
and speak to those
very students who

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.860
are sitting in that
Research Methods class,

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.088
so it kind of comes full circle.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.930
This book took me
four years to write.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:07.100
And around year two, I had
some big decisions to make.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.640
I thought, do I keep
going and investing

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.980
all of my time and money
in this massive project?

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.190
Do I actually reel
in professionals

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.230
and get editors and
designers involved?

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:30.560
Or do I just throw in the towel
and get a real job that pays?

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.480
After much reflection
and some tears,

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.870
I decided that I had to
finish, that I had a good idea,

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.220
and that this book could
help a lot of people.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.250
And as Googlers, I
know you understand

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.650
the importance of a good idea.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.980
And when we have them,
we have a moral duty

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.490
to bring them out
into the world.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.690
So I decided to hire freelance
editors and cookbook designers

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.350
to complete this book.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:04.440
And I had never hired a
freelance anything before,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.060
so I Googled how to hire
a freelance editor, what

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.040
is the difference between a
copy editor and a proofreader,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.160
how to negotiate a contract
with a freelance designer?

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.820
So I educated myself
on the process.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:21.060
I ended up hiring an amazing
team of designers called

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.530
Camden Design and a
great team of editors

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:28.370
who are in Washington DC,
Cookbook Construction Crew.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.180
And since I have a
captured audience here,

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.990
I'm just going to
throw this out there.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.760
"Food That Works" has
been out for 90 days now,

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:42.230
and not one person has found
a typo in "Food That Works,"

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.050
and that's unheard of.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.600
It's my first book, so either
no one's found a typo yet,

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.890
or that was some
damn thorough editing

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.235
that we did for 18 months.

00:26:53.235 --> 00:26:54.610
So I'm just going
to throw it out

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.340
there to everyone who's here,
a little challenge, if you are

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.570
able to find a typo
in "Food That Works,"

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:06.630
and you let me know about it,
I will buy you a Chai latte.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.790
So contact me.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.670
Seriously, I would
love to hear from you.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.553
So then it came to completing
the book, wrapping it up.

00:27:14.553 --> 00:27:17.160
I taught myself to food style.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.740
I food styled all the shots
that you see in the photographs.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.970
I took most of the photographs
in "Food That Works,"

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.830
and hired photographers
to help me

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.880
with ones that I couldn't take.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.110
And I illustrated the book.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.080
All those little doodles you
see, that's me having fun.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.850
And it was really
important for me

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.470
that it was a user
friendly guide.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.850
How do I turn what I was
doing in my own kitchen

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.520
and how I was
rocking out, how do I

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.030
turn that into
something, a manual

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.870
that people could
actually follow?

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.260
So it was really
crucial that the design

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.810
was simple and basic.

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.600
I didn't want people have to
turn the book to figure out

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.055
what they were doing next.

00:27:52.055 --> 00:27:55.490
It's supposed to save you
time, not be a daunting thing.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.360
So the designers
really heard me,

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.620
and I love the way
the book came out.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.080
It's exactly how I
envisioned, and I am

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.420
so proud of the final product.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.560
It's receiving amazing
reviews online,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.960
and it's doing far better than I
ever, ever could have imagined.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.330
I would be lying if I stood
here and painted this project

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.260
as all peaches and prosecco.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.660
There was a lot of
challenges, and it

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.130
was a huge undertaking for
someone in their 20s to commit

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.682
to, or anyone for that matter.

00:28:30.682 --> 00:28:32.390
And there was a lot
of pressure because I

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.530
self-funded the production
of the entire book myself

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:39.510
and did so on a
very minimal budget.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.470
But it was the very project that
had me jumping out of my bed

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:48.080
every single day before
my alarm went off.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.880
I was so passionate
about working

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.930
on this, and every free minute
that I had, I was in love.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.530
I was committed.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.300
And I wanted to see this thing
through and get it out there

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.050
to the world.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.750
So basically
working on this book

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.170
was like creating my own
graduate thesis project, right?

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.890
It took about the
same amount of time.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.490
It cost the same.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.790
And instead of having a piece of
paper to show you for my work,

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:19.310
I have this book that you
now hold in your hands.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:24.180
So now I'll explain a little bit
of how "Food That Works" works.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.940
Like I said, it's
more than a cookbook.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.340
It's a food system.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.740
It has five weeks.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.900
If you look at the pages
on the side of the book,

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.470
there's all different
colored tabs.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.707
And the five weeks in "Food
That Works" have themes.

00:29:38.707 --> 00:29:40.540
So you pick a theme
that sounds good to you.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:45.110
For example, red week is
Italian-American type dishes,

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.290
and blue week is
Mediterranean theme,

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:51.440
and orange week is
Mexican-Southwestern.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.390
So you pick a menu that
sounds good to you.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.900
You're like, yeah, I want to
eat turkey tacos, and burgers,

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.300
and meatballs this week.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.240
And I actually tried
to pick recipes

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.860
that I feel like we
all know and love,

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.070
and things that we
typically order out.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.617
And you bring that week
to the store with you.

00:30:10.617 --> 00:30:12.700
So say you're like, yeah,
I want to do green week,

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.510
you shop from the green
week shopping list.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.290
And like I said,
it's all figured out.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.890
It's all whole foods.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:21.560
This book is really trying
to help you move away

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.860
from purchasing processed and
packaged versions of the foods

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.190
that you love, and
instead, ease you

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:31.010
into cooking more for yourself.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.230
And it's kind of a game for me
when I go to the grocery store.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.727
I'm looking at
all the ingredient

00:30:35.727 --> 00:30:38.060
labels on the back and kind
of like, what's in this now?

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:38.935
I'm not getting that.

00:30:38.935 --> 00:30:41.800
And really trying to challenge
myself to find the best quality

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.400
and not settle for all
these extra additives,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.000
and preservatives, and things.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.980
So the book talks a lot
about quality of ingredients,

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.910
and there's a whole
section on how

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.710
to shop for them while
you're at the store.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.690
Because as we all know,
once you get it home,

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:57.940
you're going to eat it, right?

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.520
So it's making the smart choices
while you're at the store

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.100
and really knowing what's in it.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.060
And I really urge people to
read the ingredient label

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.260
and select the version
that has the least

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.120
amount of listed ingredients.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.980
There's also an ingredient
guide in the back of the book.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.790
There's 50-plus
entries in there,

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.979
I believe, that I wrote
that are all descriptions

00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:20.770
about each ingredient
in "Food That Works."

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.519
So say you have a
question about something

00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:23.570
when you're at the store.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.999
You're like, what's Braggs?

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:27.040
I don't know what that
is, or where it's located.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.581
You can flip to the
back of the book,

00:31:28.581 --> 00:31:30.900
and it explains what
it is, how to store it,

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.340
the nutritional benefits.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.540
So I definitely encourage
you to check that out

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.110
because I wrote all
of those for you.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.060
And then when you go
home from the store,

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.310
this is the most crucial
part of "Food That Works,"

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.185
it's doing your prep.

00:31:43.185 --> 00:31:44.810
So there's a little
prep list in there,

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:46.079
and it says, OK, here we go.

00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:48.370
We're getting this in the
kitchen, turns some music on,

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.760
we're going to bang this out.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.510
So you chop all of
your vegetables up,

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:56.100
you get the oven going, you bake
some chicken breast just plain,

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.930
you bake some
sweet potatoes, you

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.690
get some hard boiled eggs
going, and you're just

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.060
moving through it.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.190
So during the week,
when you're hungry,

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.370
you can just grab a
plain chicken breast

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.870
and turn it into whatever meal
it is that you're in the mood

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:09.370
for.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.869
It's more like a
blank canvas that's

00:32:10.869 --> 00:32:13.876
sitting there for you to
make a creation with, right?

00:32:13.876 --> 00:32:15.250
And same with all
the vegetables.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:16.560
You can grab handful of
this, handful of this.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.270
Boom, omelette.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:17.890
Out the door.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.265
You only have one
thing to clean,

00:32:19.265 --> 00:32:22.510
which is the pan, and maybe the
fork if you eat with a fork.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.390
And so it's the
same with dinner.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.060
You get home.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.220
You're starving.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.070
You're just, handful of this,
handful of this, pasta dinner.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.330
So it's really teaching you.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.897
It's nothing glamorous or crazy.

00:32:32.897 --> 00:32:34.480
This is cooking
Monday through Friday.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.479
I didn't try to make this
whole elaborate thing.

00:32:36.479 --> 00:32:38.610
I tried to keep it
very simple for you

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.860
because I'm sure I'm
in the same boat.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.310
When I get home, I'm hungry, and
I don't want to think about it.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:49.270
It just needs to happen
quickly so nobody gets hurt.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.660
And like I said before, it's
all crossover ingredients.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.580
So it teaches you the art of
OK, I bought these peppers.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.090
They're all chopped, but I
don't just have one meal in mind

00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:58.810
to use them for.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.756
I know now that I can
put them in, and this,

00:33:00.756 --> 00:33:01.780
and this, and this.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.440
So it teaches you how to
use up those ingredients.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.750
And I found that when I do
spend the time prepping my food,

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.870
I'm more likely to use
those ingredients, right?

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.760
Because now I've
invested time in it,

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.310
and I've spent time
chopping it or cooking it.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:18.860
And so I when I peer
into my fridge, for me,

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.420
it's not usually a question
of what do I want to eat now?

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.570
What am I in the mood for?

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.760
It's more, OK, what do
I need to eat first?

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.440
What's going bad first, right?

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.600
So that's how you keep
that food in rotation

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.860
and use it up
before it goes bad.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.880
And the best part
about "Food That Works"

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.670
is it turns your fridge into
the ultimate grab-and-go.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:40.650
So, like I said, it's your
own salad bar basically.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:41.700
You look in there.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.580
It's a sexy fridge.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.100
It's all organized.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.340
You can see what's in there.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.180
You know that everything
is fresh and new.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.970
And you can grab handfuls,
and make creations, and boom,

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.990
you're out the door.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.030
I really tried to make
these meals portable

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.680
because I, personally,
don't eat many of my meals

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.320
from home, at the
actual home anymore.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.460
And I think with our
schedules today, many of us

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.060
don't, and that's
the reality of it.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:08.030
With that being said, I like
to show people and emphasize

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.130
that even though we don't eat
many of our meals in the home,

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:15.095
it doesn't mean that we
can't have homemade meals.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:22.760
Also, this book teaches
you to modify, like I said.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.199
Anything that you like,
you can add extra of that,

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.260
and it will taste good to you.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.469
There's not many rules
in "Food That Works."

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:31.969
And once you get
in the kitchen, you

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.969
feel liberated because
you start to learn like,

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:36.989
oh, if I just add extra
this, then yeah, it's great.

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.199
And so that's really
when it becomes fun.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:43.429
And it's really supposed to be
a casual book and a refreshing

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.510
approach to getting
back in the kitchen

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.510
and shopping for ourselves.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.290
And I'm going to read
a little page here

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.340
from "Food That Works" quickly.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.460
These are just tips.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.060
Again, there's not many
rules in "Food That Works"

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.380
because I don't like
rules, and I don't

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.463
subscribe to many of them.

00:35:00.463 --> 00:35:03.170
But some tips in "Food
That Works"-- first, I

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.630
mention read ingredient labels.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:09.180
Brand, package, color--
none of that matters.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.420
All you care about is
the ingredients label.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.900
A long list indicates that
it's highly processed.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.390
Your body doesn't want all that.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.690
Just put it back.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:22.020
Shoot for 10
ingredients or fewer.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.530
Compare different brands
and select the one

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:26.667
with the fewest
listed ingredients.

00:35:26.667 --> 00:35:28.250
So that's that
challenge I was talking

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.000
about when you're in the store.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.570
For example, a can of beans
should read beans, water, salt.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.780
Clean and simple.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.570
Second, by single
ingredient foods.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:45.240
Potatoes, peppers,
apples, tomatoes--

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.560
these are whole foods.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.960
Picture things that you can
see growing out in nature.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.110
Single ingredients.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.270
And when you look down at your
cart after shopping this way,

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:59.690
you'll be surprised when you
see more recognizable foods

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:04.240
and less packaging, and
ink, and advertising.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.630
Third, refuse to buy anything
that lists high fructose

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:14.960
or hydrogenated in
the ingredients list.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.580
Like I said, I don't subscribe
to many rules in life,

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.880
but this is one
that I do not break.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.830
Simply decided to eliminate
these from your diet,

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.900
and you are already winning.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.580
It doesn't have to be a
huge complicated thing.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.750
But if you decide not to
eat these two ingredients

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:33.960
and you're reading
labels, it really

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.410
weeds out the amount of
things that you can buy,

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.510
and that you'll sign up to eat.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.910
Fourth, stick to the list.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.950
These lists will prevent
impulse purchases

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:46.230
and allow for quick
navigation through the store.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.389
So stick to your
mission, in and out.

00:36:48.389 --> 00:36:50.180
And this book will help
you save time there

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.730
so you have time to pursue
the other things in life

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:53.450
that you're passionate about.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.741
I know we don't all want to
spend tons of time shopping

00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:58.830
and prepping our food, so
this is supposed to help you.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:00.685
And lastly, buy organic.

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:02.310
I have a whole section
in the book that

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.210
talks about organic, what
it is, why it's important,

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.780
especially for certain
foods in particular.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:12.070
But eating organic foods
reduces our pesticide intake.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.130
Especially with produce,
make the splurge for organic.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.290
You're worth it.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:23.350
So as you can tell, cooking
has profoundly changed my life.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.690
And what next?

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.340
Well, now I speak.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.400
I speak at companies
and universities

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:37.020
all over the country about this
habit of cooking for ourselves.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.455
And lots of people will
say cooking is addictive,

00:37:40.455 --> 00:37:42.080
and I see all the
non-cooks in the room

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.950
always roll their eyes.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.380
And it's not that
cooking is addictive.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.760
It's that learning is addictive.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.890
And that's what my
book aims to do,

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.530
is to get you addicted
to learning about what's

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.910
in your food, and how it was
grown, and where the heck

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.840
it came from.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.520
And from there, there
are so many things

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.290
that this brings to our lives.

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:09.120
Our brains seek novel
experiences and innovation,

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.750
and cooking utilizes all
five of our senses, right?

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:15.250
From selecting it, to
smelling it, to prepping it,

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:19.600
to cooking it, to then
sitting down and eating it.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:25.330
And I know that cooking may
not be the desire for everybody

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:28.020
in the room, but
considering it's something

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:32.430
we have to do three times
a day, is feed ourselves,

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:37.330
it's not exactly a bad
hobby to entertain.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.950
And I want to show people
that changing your diet

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:44.400
doesn't have to be this
huge, extreme overhaul.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.830
It starts with small changes
and the decision to start.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:52.640
And I've seen lovely
reviews that people

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.690
have left online after
cooking through this book.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.340
And some of them say, yeah,
I don't cook every week

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.530
from "Food That Works."

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.655
I don't use it religiously.

00:38:59.655 --> 00:39:02.970
But now I keep a thing of
hard boiled eggs in my fridge

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.200
at all times.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.952
So that when I'm hungry and I'm
on the go, I can just grab one,

00:39:06.952 --> 00:39:08.660
throw it in my bag,
and I'm out the door.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.580
It's a great protein
snack, and I love it.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.380
So it's these small
things that you pick up

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.532
that you incorporate into
your world that work for you.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.700
And the glory, like I said,
of cooking for yourself

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.163
is that you can modify.

00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:27.780
I can't say that whenever I
cook any of my own recipes,

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.510
they ever come out the same.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.890
They're always different.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.890
And I encourage you to
sneak in new ingredients,

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.740
and drop things
that you don't like.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.940
I hope that this
book really helps

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.360
people think about cooking
differently and not that it

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.270
needs to be this daunting chore
that we have to get through,

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:50.050
but instead, a
creative, fun challenge.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.520
So now that I've been
talking for a while,

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.190
I want to talk a little
bit about wellness,

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:59.080
and I'm really
encouraged to know

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:03.550
that Google fosters a
culture here that really

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:07.110
breeds creativity and wellness.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:10.910
And in a small way, that's
what my book aims to do,

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:15.920
to help people achieve a
healthy lifestyle, both at home

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.450
and at work.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:20.270
Considering we spend so much
time at our jobs these days,

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:24.390
it's important to focus
on that part of it.

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.570
And I recently heard
this adage that I really

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:31.420
liked, which is you spend
one hour at the gym,

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.120
but it's what you do in the
other 23 hours of the day that

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.680
really matters.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.810
And I really liked
thinking about that

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.170
because how can we
take care of ourselves

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.057
better in the other 23 hours?

00:40:45.057 --> 00:40:47.390
And there's many things that
contribute to our wellness.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.340
It's not just diet and gym.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.740
And in wellness
coaching, we go at it

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.440
with a more holistic
approach of all

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.920
of the aspects of our wellness.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.620
So there was actually a really
great talk at Google in 2012

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.450
by Kelly McGonigal.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.550
She's an author and
health psychologist

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.060
at Stanford University.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:12.620
And in her talk, she
talks about the brain,

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.690
and how it functions,
and the four facets

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.660
that really affect our brain
function and our productivity,

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.632
therefore, affecting our
decision-making and will power.

00:41:21.632 --> 00:41:23.340
And the four things
that she talked about

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:29.600
were exercise, meditation,
sleep, and diet.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.150
So let's start with exercise.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.026
I'm going to ask you if you'd
please stand, and join me,

00:41:35.026 --> 00:41:36.900
and we're going to do
a couple exercises just

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.260
to get moving around
a little bit, just

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:44.110
to wake us up before we
all head back to our desks.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:47.780
So first, if you can start with
your feet hips width apart.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.250
And you're just going to gently
twist, swinging your arms,

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.860
nothing crazy.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.693
Don't hurt yourself.

00:41:53.693 --> 00:41:55.360
We're not going to
break a sweat here.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.990
Just letting your hands bang
against your lower back.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.800
This is good for the lower back
if you've been sitting a lot.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.730
It's a good massage
for the kidneys,

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:06.540
stimulates the kidneys.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.790
And breathe.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:10.570
And smile.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.550
It helps to smile while
you're doing this.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:13.770
No one's looking at you.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:14.480
Don't worry.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.010
It feels good.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.760
And you can do this
any time your desk

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.830
if you feeling that 3:00
PM slump hitting you

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:22.750
in the face like
a ton of bricks.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.940
So the next one, I
like to call it you

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.150
pull down with your arms, and
you're bringing your knee up.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.470
So it's not about speed.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:33.090
It's about control.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.670
So really crunching your
abs when you come down.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.190
This is good for the hips.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.240
Loosen up the hip joints.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.140
You've been sitting
your car, long commute.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.860
Just pulling down, pulling down.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.000
And breathe and smile.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.280
And then the next move is
a similar move to that.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.940
I'm going to turn
this way for you.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.490
You're pulling with your
arms, and basically you

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.460
want to keep them at
90 degrees and almost

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.920
make your two shoulder blades
kiss in the back, right?

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.930
So it's a pull and a butt
kick, kicking behind you.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:03.327
This is good for your quads.

00:43:03.327 --> 00:43:04.910
It's good for your
shoulders if you've

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.204
been typing at your computer.

00:43:07.204 --> 00:43:08.227
Ah, feels so good.

00:43:08.227 --> 00:43:09.560
And these are things you can do.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.960
These are available
to you any time.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.335
I know your co-workers might
think you're a little weird,

00:43:13.335 --> 00:43:14.690
but this will wake you up.

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.470
I swear, it's like
a cup of coffee.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:17.570
And you're already here.

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.460
You can go right
into the running man

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.800
if you're feeling that.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.917
Preps you right for it
if you're feeling funky.

00:43:22.917 --> 00:43:25.000
There's actually one more
that I want to show you.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
This is my favorite one.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.510
It's a shoulder stretch.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.400
It's actually for your neck.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.660
We hold a lot of tension
and stress in our necks.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.300
So you're going to
take your left hand,

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.190
bring it behind your body.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.140
Grab it with your right hand.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.080
And then you're going to
tilt to your right ear

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.290
to your right shoulder.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:46.060
And it's elongating these
muscles in your neck.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.780
So wherever you feel the
tension in your neck,

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.740
you just want to breathe into
it and visualize the muscle.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.580
Take a deep breath.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:03.630
Letting go of any of that
tension that we hold there.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:06.300
Bring it over to the other side.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.820
Whenever I'm doing
stretches, I don't like

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.260
to just go through the motions.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.680
It's really about putting
your mind in that muscle,

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.460
and thinking about it loosening.

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.510
All right, bring it back.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:23.050
Take a seat.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.600
Thank you very much.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.290
So the next one that she
talks about was meditation.

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:34.360
Silencing our minds for
just a few moments a day

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.570
has amazing effects on
our responses physically

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.500
and emotionally to stress.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.230
So don't worry.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.130
I'm not going to make
you meditate right now,

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:49.090
but I would like to ask you
to please close your eyes.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:53.480
Try to clear your
mind for a moment.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.970
Take a big inhale.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.324
And exhale through your mouth.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.190
Relax the muscles in your face.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:13.730
Now I'd like you to
visualize someone who

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:16.922
brings great joy to your life.

00:45:21.744 --> 00:45:22.243
And smile.

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:30.310
If you were able to
thank them right now,

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:32.198
what would you say the them?

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:48.460
In your head, say
their name and smile.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.910
Now open your eyes.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:59.470
Feels good, doesn't it?

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:03.140
Just a few moments in
gratitude and making

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:08.930
the decision to smile can really
relax you throughout the day.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:12.020
Smiling releases
endorphins, and who

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:15.730
can't use a good dose of
endorphins at 3 o'clock

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:18.040
on a Thursday, right?

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.900
So that is available
to you at any time.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.860
If you're feeling stressed,
you can close your eyes

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.290
and visualize someone that
you really care about.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:27.310
It helps.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.080
The next one was sleep.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.880
Sleep is so important for us.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.940
It affects every part of our
lives, and our decision-making,

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.034
and our productivity,
our personal lives,

00:46:37.034 --> 00:46:37.825
and our work lives.

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:42.484
And I'll be honest with you.

00:46:42.484 --> 00:46:44.650
Over the course of writing
this book for four years,

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:47.950
I suffered from a
serious bout of insomnia.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:49.440
It was terrible.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.820
I tell you, I would not
wish that on anyone.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.640
It's a curse.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.020
And so now I really, really
take my sleep seriously.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.010
It affected everything.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:01.560
It affected my food choices.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.480
I was more prone to
grab sugary things

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:08.110
and junk to artificially power
me through my exhaustion.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.460
I was short with my
friends and my family,

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.682
and it was miserable.

00:47:11.682 --> 00:47:12.890
I was miserable to be around.

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:14.820
I didn't even want
to be around me.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.110
So I encourage you.

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:19.400
If your sleep is an
area of your wellness

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.340
that you would like
to improve upon,

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.400
only you can make
that a priority,

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.070
and change your habits
around nighttime

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:29.520
when you're ready to go to bed.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.220
And really consider it
as an important thing

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.100
that you deserve to
get a good eight hours,

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.700
and work on that if
it's a goal for you.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.680
I tried to work five minutes of
sleep into this talk right now,

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.000
but I couldn't really swing it.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.770
And lastly, our diets.

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:47.240
So coming full circle,
back to what we eat.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.790
There's so many fads, and
cleanses, and detoxes,

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:54.540
and all these things today,
and it seems so complicated.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.500
And my approach is far more
simple and maintainable.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.270
It's cook your own damn food.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.340
When you cook for
yourself at home,

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.310
you're not signing up for all
these extra additives, right?

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:12.680
So when you make a
homemade lasagna,

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.410
you don't sprinkle
monosodium glutamate

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:18.740
on it or preservatives.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.510
And when you make
homemade granola,

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.970
you're not drizzling
high fructose corn syrup

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:24.120
all over it.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.160
Cooking for yourself
and cooking at home

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.940
is clean and simple by nature.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.540
So that is all we're
trying to get back to here.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.660
It's not rocket science.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.240
It's putting foods that
we like on a plate.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.850
The hard part is doing
it within our schedules,

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:42.000
but you have to make
yourself a priority.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.110
And I'm here today to tell
you that it is possible to do,

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:49.620
and I wrote "Food That Works"
in order to help you get there.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:54.380
So let's spare ourselves the
obesity, the health issues,

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:59.890
the insecurities about food, and
instead, know our ingredients

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:03.470
and how to cook them.

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:04.840
You can start tonight.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.000
It's not far from your reach.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.900
It's about the distance
from your grocery store

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.750
to your kitchen.

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:16.220
It's you, the tenacious,
hard working Americans,

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:21.060
that inspired me to
write "Food That Works."

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:25.380
Fuel your body with the
best ingredients possible,

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.690
and you are creating a
platform from which to launch

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:31.150
your talents into the world.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.050
Thank you.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.960
So I think we're doing
a little Q&amp;A now.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.420
If anyone has any questions,
food-related questions,

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.710
shopping questions, you
can just come up to the mic

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.880
and ask your questions
so everyone can hear you.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.460
AUDIENCE: So I had gotten the
book at the beginning of this.

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.130
And I when I was
scanning through,

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:57.010
you had some little
tips in here.

00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.280
And there was a
section about PLUs,

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.037
and I thought that
was fascinating.

00:50:02.037 --> 00:50:04.370
If you could just say that
to everybody in case somebody

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:05.730
is not getting the book,
that would be appreciated.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.947
MALIA DELL: Yes, thank you.

00:50:06.947 --> 00:50:08.530
Yeah, there's a great
section in there

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.070
that talks about
organic, why it's

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:12.400
important to select organics,
certain foods that you should

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.858
look for, and words
that you should

00:50:13.858 --> 00:50:15.620
look for on the packaging.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.214
And one thing that I
learned during the research

00:50:18.214 --> 00:50:20.130
for this book is, you
know the little stickers

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.590
that you see on the produce
at the grocery store?

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:27.720
It's called a PLU sticker,
which is a price look up code.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.720
And basically any sticker that
you see that starts with a 4--

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.180
so it'll be like,
4695-- anything

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:36.800
that starts with a number
4 is commercially grown.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.830
So that means that
they do use pesticides,

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:43.040
and you don't exactly
know what's on it.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.030
And so in order to reduce
your pesticide intake when

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:48.080
you buy commercially
grown produce--

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.620
because I can't always afford
to buy everything organic--

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.930
but the things that I
buy commercially grown,

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.877
I'm sure to peel or scrub
really well, wash really well.

00:50:58.877 --> 00:51:00.960
So that's how you know if
it's commercially grown.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.660
And if you see a number
9 starting the number,

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.450
that means that it's organic.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:07.194
So that's a fun,
little tip for you when

00:51:07.194 --> 00:51:08.360
you're at the grocery store.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.490
You can check it
out and make sure

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:10.906
that things are
in the right bins.

00:51:10.906 --> 00:51:13.600
Because sometimes like,
what kind of apple is this?

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.280
It's a little confusing.

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.450
So thanks, that's a good point.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.550
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if we wanted

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:23.050
to create our own
weekly plan, do

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:26.710
you have a suggestion for
a strategy for planning

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:29.110
those such that you use
up all the ingredients?

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:32.340
Because I do plan my
meals, but I'm really

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.614
terrible at using everything.

00:51:34.614 --> 00:51:36.030
So I was just
wondering if you had

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:38.420
a general strategy when you'
were putting those together.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.920
MALIA DELL: I love to hear that
you're making your own weeks

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.390
because that's awesome.

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:44.720
I guess I would say
you can do it two ways.

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.780
You could probably
start from whatever

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:50.650
your favorite ingredients are
that you use across the board.

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:54.800
So say, for example,
you love potatoes.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.720
And then I would find a bunch
of recipes that use potatoes,

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.600
and kind of build
out from that so

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.820
that I knew that I could use
it up in multiple things.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.530
So you could start
with the ingredient

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:09.240
and build out a
shopping list from that.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:12.970
Or you could start off
with recipes that you like.

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:18.022
And then read the lists on the
recipes, and say, OK, well,

00:52:18.022 --> 00:52:19.980
it says that I need this
many peppers for this,

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.620
I need this many
peppers for this one.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.610
OK, so I need to buy four
peppers for this whole week.

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:28.300
But my biggest recommendation is
prepping that food in advance.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.700
That's going to save you so
much time during the week.

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.540
You're not going to want
to do it during the week,

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.560
and that's the sad part.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.480
It's like, we buy
all these ingredients

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.190
with great intentions, like, I'm
going to cook this cauliflower.

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:40.967
And then during the
week, you look at it,

00:52:40.967 --> 00:52:43.300
and you're just like, yeah,
I have no food in my fridge.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.670
I'm going to order takeout.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:48.220
So it's really having a plan,
and prepping it in advance

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.357
so that you're more
likely to use it.

00:52:50.357 --> 00:52:51.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:53.270
MALIA DELL: Yeah, good luck.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.620
All right, well, thank you
all so much for coming today.

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.970
[APPLAUSE]
