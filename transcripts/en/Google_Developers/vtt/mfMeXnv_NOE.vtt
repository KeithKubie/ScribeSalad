[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good evening.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.450
Thank you all so
much for helping

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.110
us celebrate International
Women's Day at Google.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.450
This is the first of many
Women Techmakers events

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.310
that we hope to host.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.770
And actually this
is one of over 110

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.620
that we are
convening, or helping

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.050
to put on, in the
month of March.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.280
So this event is one of many,
as you saw in the beginning.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.190
We have events today that
happened in Boulder, Colorado,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.386
in the Philippines, in
London, and New York.

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:40.510
And so if you look at our
hashtag Women Techmakers,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.930
you'll see a lot of
different languages, voices,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.080
and perspectives because of
this international community

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.500
that we're bringing
greater visibility to.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.940
And so the Women Techmakers
program has three pillars.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.410
And those three pillars,
I think, each one of them

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.290
we built on today.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.360
And so of those we have
visibility, community,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.720
and resources.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.220
And so I think we really
increase the visibility

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.810
by seeing Pavi and Laura and
all of these great women come up

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.120
on stage and share
their stories.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.579
We have created
community together.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.453
I think especially during
the creative skills

00:01:14.453 --> 00:01:15.430
for innovation course.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.020
Which I thought was fantastic.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.480
I love seeing all
of your prototypes.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.750
And then resources.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.160
We've exchanged email addresses.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.660
And we've come up
with greater ideas

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.100
of what we can do to solve
for the particular issues

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.250
that we might see
in the industry.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.090
And so I'm really excited
for what's to come.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.810
And so with this, I would love
to check out our new website.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.700
We actually launched it sometime
around 8:00 PM last night.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.020
[LAUGHTER] g.co/WomenTechmakers.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.060
I would love your
feedback and your ideas.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.670
I want you to tell me
what we're missing.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.080
I want you to tell me what I
need to add, what you love,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.320
and if you want to be featured
on an upcoming Women Techmakers

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.850
show, If you want to
contribute to our newsletter.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.500
I just want this to be something
that we build together.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.480
Because Women Techmakers,
it's something for all of us.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.570
I really feel that the
Women Techmakers program

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.115
is Google joining the
already existing movement,

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:14.490
standing on the shoulders of
the people that have already

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.670
laid the groundwork for
supporting women in technology.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.630
And so this isn't just
a Google initiative,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.350
this is an initiative
for our entire community.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.460
And so with that,
I want to offer you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.654
the women-techmakers at
google.com email address.

00:02:28.654 --> 00:02:30.070
It goes directly
to me, and I will

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.160
respond to every single
email in responding

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.620
to feedback or ideas.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.600
Again we are an open community.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.410
And we want you to
be a part of building

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.230
the future of Women Techmakers.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.114
So next, I want to
share a little bit

00:02:47.114 --> 00:02:48.780
about a friend of
mine, Megan Smith, who

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.600
is about to get on stage.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.350
Megan Smith spearheaded
Women Techmakers.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.910
Women Techmakers
is a program that

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.280
would pop up around Google I/O.
And that's our big developer

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.060
conference that
we hold at Google.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.570
And we sat down sometime
middle of last year

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.479
and decided that they should
be a yearlong global program.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.020
It really shouldn't
be just something

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.090
that pops up once a year.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.660
And so with that we've
created these pillars,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.514
we've created these
opportunities.

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:15.305
And I'm really proud
of the work that Megan

00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:18.600
is doing for women, not just
for women within Google,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.770
but outside of Google as well.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.130
And some of the work that
she's done within Google

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.340
is, as you'll see, she's a
VP over at Google X. She's

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.270
working on some of the
most radical moonshots

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.800
our company has ever thought of.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.040
And with that, she
also leads Solve for X.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.400
I encourage you to
go to solveforx.com,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.750
where we're thinking
about, and trying

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.300
to find moonshot thinkers
that are applying breakthrough

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.330
technologies to global issues
in creating a radical solution.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.940
She also works at
the Malala Fund.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.400
And that's just
incredible in itself.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.230
She's really about empowering
women inside of Google,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.860
and great thinkers
inside of Google,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.660
as well outside of Google.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.340
And so with that, Megan Smith.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:06.570
[MUSIC  PLAYING]

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.500
MEGAN SMITH: Hello.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.530
It's incredible be here.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.946
It's incredible
to see all of you.

00:04:10.946 --> 00:04:14.080
Because as we were thinking
about Women Techmakers

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.890
and imagining what it could
be, a big part of that is,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.209
we know that there's maybe
about 16 million programmers

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.990
in the world, and we
know if we're 10 or 15%,

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.564
that means there's at least
two or 3 million of us.

00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:27.980
I'm actually a
mechanical engineer

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.980
so I'm not a programmer,
but I can program a little.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.190
So I'm a little bit in.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.560
But where are we?

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.210
Why can't we see ourselves?

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.180
Why can't we be seen?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.160
And so visibility, as Natalie
said, is the first pillar.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.150
I want to talk today, I'm
going to jump all around,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.120
but I really want to talk
about heroic engineering,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.330
and a little bit about
the network and debugging

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.710
inclusion in some
interesting ways.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.620
And so, I want to start with
what I call the ground truth.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.960
And I want to go
to World War II.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.060
Much of the computer
industry that we are in,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.380
the modern computer industry,
has its roots in World War II.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.860
Because people had
to do heroic things.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.580
And this is a picture
from Bletchley Park.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.230
What I love, it's a picture
of Jean Valentine, who's

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.960
a veteran code breaker
from Bletchley Park.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.120
She also has a Googler,
who is a granddaughter,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.650
her granddaughter is a Googler.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.350
And so that's exciting.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.210
But she was part of
the Bombe operators.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.590
The ground truth for me is that
technical women have always

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.610
been in our industry.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.480
In fact, they are
some of the founders.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.410
And so I think
it's one of things

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.050
that we have to know, embrace,
and start making visible.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.410
Not only Ada, who is awesome.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.152
Walter Isaacson is working on
a book about the new digital--

00:05:42.152 --> 00:05:43.360
the start of the digital age.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.650
And he's been in the Bodleian
Library reading the Byron

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.150
Collection, reading Ada's paper,
the stories are totally true.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.590
And it's a very exciting thing.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.294
So starting with
our code crackers--

00:05:56.294 --> 00:05:58.210
There's a story that I
got to visit Bletchley,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.250
and I encourage you if
you're ever in London,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.660
take the train 45 minutes out of
Paddington station and go here.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.520
There were 10,000 people
stationed at Station X,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.110
and more than half
of them were women.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.070
And they cracked
the Enigma codes.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.540
And people credit this tech team
with saving 11 million lives

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.550
and shortening the
war by two years.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.540
One of my favorite stories, I
came into the main house there,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.510
and I met this woman,
this older woman

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.520
who is now retired
and volunteers there.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.440
And she said, she was five
years old at Bletchley

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.100
during the war.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.099
And she and her twin
sister, her little brother,

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:37.930
and older brother
lived in the stables.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.090
And they were in this one
section stables next door

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.290
to Dilly Knox's team.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.030
And Dilly Knox was one of
the astonishing mathematical

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.540
leaders of Bletchley.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.170
And he led a team of
women mathematicians.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.470
And she said to me, her
mom used to always say,

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:59.140
"Shhh, the girls are working,
shhh, the girls are working."

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.260
I want that to be
Hollywood movie.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.950
And I want to know about
those girls who were working,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.570
and who saved all those lives,
and started our industry.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.080
The second image that I want
to show you is Charles Vest.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.670
This is president Chuck Vest.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.040
Sadly, we lost him in December.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.750
He was the 15th
president of MIT.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.270
And I am on the MIT board.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.120
I was at a meeting yesterday
and the day before,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.630
and we had a celebration
of his life at MIT.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.320
One of things that I knew about,
but it was sort of vague to me,

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.861
and I wanted to bring it back
because it was just brought up.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.800
There was a moment
when the MIT faculty

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.860
women did an incredible
watershed story.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.680
They took it upon themselves to
look at lab space and science

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.170
and all the unfairness that
was going on on campus.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.160
And to Chuck's credit,
when they came to him

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.326
with the results of the
study-- actually in process,

00:07:48.326 --> 00:07:50.170
he kept encouraging
them to do more.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.250
And then once they
came with the data,

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.470
he added a quote to the
front of that paper that

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.840
was really impactful in science.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.500
And he said, "I
have always believed

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.200
that contemporary
gender discrimination

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.620
within universities is part
reality, and part perception."

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.130
Vest wrote in a much cited
preface to the MIT report

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.580
on gender equity.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.140
"But I now understand
that reality is by far

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.890
the greater part
of the balance."

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.480
And it was so incredibly
said that they got so

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.300
many phone calls, outreach
from across the world.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.940
Everybody wanted
to act on this data

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.660
and follow that leadership.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.750
So thinking about the ground
truth of measuring problems

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.532
and getting the
word out about them

00:08:29.532 --> 00:08:30.990
is one of the
fundamental things we

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.520
can do in the spirit of
Chuck and those women who

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.340
did that work.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.780
And then this slide
is from this morning.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.260
I started the morning with,
actually with Little League,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.820
opening day with our boys.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.060
And then I came over to
this mentorship walk,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.980
run by Vital Voices.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.146
Do people know Vital Voices?

00:08:48.146 --> 00:08:49.360
Yes, no, a little bit?

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.950
It was started by
Hillary Clinton

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.550
as a gathering, just a
little after Beijing.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.220
But really to start to highlight
these astonishing women

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.800
out there who are doing amazing
work in their communities.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.140
I think of these
guys almost as CAA

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.880
for incredible entrepreneurial
women around the world.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.100
And they find these rock
stars and they help them,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.560
almost like angel or
venture investing into them.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.080
And Elise was onstage, and she
said something interesting.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.230
She said it's
International Women's Day,

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.160
and yes, we need help
from the world for women.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.160
But really, it's not that women
need the world to help us,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.380
it's that the world needs women.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.000
They need us to step up and do
the amazing things we already

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.290
do and do them even more.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.210
And I want to flip
into heroic engineering

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.350
now, because that's
what we all do.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.792
So this is a really cool slide.

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:39.750
It's an image of one of
our engineers hooked up

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.920
to data centers
to Google traffic.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.670
And some people may
have seen this before.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.540
But basically, the dots
represent certain amounts

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.310
of search traffic.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.860
And the red is English, you
see some Spanish in the lighter

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.280
green, yellow, and then the
darker green, the Portuguese,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.760
a little French over here, blue.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.440
But basically to me what
this imagery represents,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.440
it happens to be Google
traffic, but it's really

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.750
about the internet.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.280
We are wired as a
planet in a way that's

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.720
really different from the past.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.470
And so that presents
extraordinary opportunity.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.060
And Clinton always says
21st Century is really

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.730
the age of creative
collaboration.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.009
And look at what's going on.

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:17.050
And just to kind of touch
on the feeling of that,

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.090
we had the Google Science
Fair students actually

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.260
here in this room, the 15
winners from around the world.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.640
And I was a science fair kid.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.140
I don't know if we have other
science fair people out there,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.900
yes.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.034
I went to the library and I got
these books on solar energy.

00:10:31.034 --> 00:10:33.200
And I looked at them, and
I did my project that way.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.370
These guys are on the web.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.147
And they do breakthrough work.

00:10:37.147 --> 00:10:38.230
I mean, we did great work.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.313
They do breakthrough work.

00:10:39.313 --> 00:10:40.980
They are advancing the field.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.300
The 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 year
olds, advancing the field,

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.290
connecting, because they can
do science at that level.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.310
It's a whole other
magnitude for science fair.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.460
Thinking about the
computer scientists,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.710
you guys are the most
wired people in the world.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.500
These are computer
science graduates

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.670
at the University of
Herat in Afghanistan,

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.570
80 miles from the Iran border.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.314
They are wired.

00:11:03.314 --> 00:11:04.480
They are starting companies.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.260
This is their start-up center.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.280
This is happening across the
planet, and it's exciting.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.260
Just thinking about how
data and point of view

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.540
has become adjacent.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.760
Of course there is
Wikipedia, which I love.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.490
This is a tool called Map
Maker that Lali put together

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.450
in Bangalore with a team.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.700
Most of the world doesn't
have metadata for mapping.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.640
And it's been a challenge
for our geo teams

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.170
and open street map and others.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.290
This is Lahore, Pakistan,
a couple years ago.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.620
You would go on the map and
look at emerging countries,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.500
and there would be one line.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.500
And you'd know there was
a million people there.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.380
So this is leveraging the
diaspora and adjacency,

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.250
and the adjacency of
data and knowledge,

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.650
to have the people of Lahore
draw themselves on to the map.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.880
And so this is what we're seeing
out of crowd-sourced data.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.280
And in fact, astonishing
activity on this tool.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.660
Mapping is so important
because it helps with commerce,

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.940
it helps with
ambulance deliveries,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.106
it helps with city planning.

00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:56.070
We need this data.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.180
People help themselves.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.070
And data that was
adjacent comes together.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.376
Sal Khan, people know
Sal, the Khan Academy.

00:12:03.376 --> 00:12:04.750
This is a really
old screen shot,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.750
but I love it because
the density of it,

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.710
it's so incredible.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.710
This one guy teaching
all these classes.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.950
And it's not to say that
one person should really

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.700
teach all classes, but it's this
moment of somebody stepping up

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.020
in a heroic way and saying,
we need to change education.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.730
I have an idea.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.890
Let me just start.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.430
And it shows the
cracks in the dam,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.305
and the beginning of
the change of education.

00:12:25.305 --> 00:12:28.610
These are CS for High School,
awesome computer science high

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.360
school teachers who
are now collaborating.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.294
We flash mobbed them together
into a physical weekend

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:34.210
a couple of years ago.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.480
Now hundreds of them are
collaborating on the web

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.050
to fix the curriculum.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.340
Master teachers are
going to fix the schools,

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.030
not people sort of
putting down teachers.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.298
FIRST Robotics, do we have
FIRST Robotics people?

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:48.390
Yes, no, yes.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:53.250
Nationals, shouldn't school
feel like "Friday Night Lights"?

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.730
This is the nationals
in Saint Louis.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.950
This is in our son's third grade
school classroom, very hands

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:00.450
on.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.270
And what I love with this idea
that education could really

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.260
teach children that in
effort, there's joy.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.010
And we're doing
in Malala, we talk

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.190
a lot about what does it mean
to have a quality education?

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.110
Is it just like this content?

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.080
Because we know that a
lot of very smart people

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.450
have done some pretty awful
stuff, some very educated

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:19.950
people.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.780
So what does it mean to
have ethics and effort

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.570
and be included and be
in the 21st century?

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.000
So thinking about the web that
way, and how we work together.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.860
This is that an
experiment in Ethiopia

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.370
where people have tablets.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.070
And they've gone
to a village where

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.522
no one can read within 10 miles.

00:13:37.522 --> 00:13:39.730
And the experiment is could
the kids teach themselves

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.980
if they have the same apps
that we're giving our kids.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.050
Could they just start
collaborating and do that?

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.770
And in fact, in the first
week they used 50 apps.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.180
And they're so close to reading.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.420
It's incredibly exciting.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.170
And I put them near last
year's science fair winners

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.337
because the two guys
there are from Swaziland.

00:13:54.337 --> 00:13:56.920
And I think very soon these kids
will be these kids if we just

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.760
get them the content
and get them each other

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.468
and get them the master
teachers network.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.690
Network data to get us out of
climate change information, not

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.300
only the engineering
we need to do,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.591
but the information technology
work that we need to do.

00:14:11.591 --> 00:14:13.820
This is Earth Engine.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.140
I've got to work at the
beginning of Book Search.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.687
And I would have never
thought of this application.

00:14:18.687 --> 00:14:20.270
You know we're
scanning all the books,

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.269
working with the publishers,
with the libraries,

00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:23.290
and engaging that way.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.140
This is a tool,
the New York Times

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.510
published this particular data.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:31.526
But all the words that were
ever written are now adjacent.

00:14:31.526 --> 00:14:33.400
And that's a data set
that's very interesting

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.505
to traverse across.

00:14:34.505 --> 00:14:36.630
This is someone doing an
analysis that the New York

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.190
Times published
on the word women.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.140
The word women is not used
very much in books in English

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.430
from 1800 to 2008 until the
modern women's rights movement

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.000
started.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.570
What can we learn
about ourselves

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.350
by reflecting the data
back to ourselves?

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.154
So this is the
network I showed you.

00:14:51.154 --> 00:14:52.820
But when the globe
spins around, there's

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.440
still many places where
the network is not.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.060
This is a serious problem.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.720
Lots of talent is not included.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.550
900 million people in Africa are
not in the global conversation.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.060
It was so excited to
see the Oscars because

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.660
in the main shots every time
when Ellen was like running

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.720
around with pizza,
you were seeing

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.070
people who are from
Africa, finally in the mix,

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.750
finally collaborating with us.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.480
That's awesome.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.210
The truth is that as of
2005, this is actually

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.790
the network map
for this continent.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.820
There was no cable.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.990
That lightweight
pink means planned.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.620
No cable next to a continent.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.550
I'm not sure what the
World Bank was doing.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.190
And then over here it's missing
a whole bunch of countries.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:39.630
So this is a super huge failing
of the development world

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.660
and the people doing that work.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.510
The good news is it
looks like this now.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.230
And I think one of
the greatest changes

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.640
we will see in the world is
as our colleagues from Africa

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.500
join us.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.140
And so this is an
image of iHub Nairobi.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.540
You could be South of Market,
you could be in Silicon Alley.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.500
David Sengeh is a
Ph.D. student at MIT

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.440
wrote a great blog
about aid to Africa

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.110
becomes made in Africa, the fab
lab movement alive and well.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.600
This is what the actual network
is looking like right now

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.790
globally, so a lot of
gray we've got to fill in.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.340
We are doing crazy projects
at Google X like Project Loon,

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.760
using balloons as
an intermediary

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.470
to try to get the web to places.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.210
We have this idea of moonshots.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.230
So moonshot being, like
the original moonshot,

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.670
what's a huge problem or
opportunity in the world?

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.830
Is there some technology that
sounds like science fiction

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.400
but we could bring it to bear
on some kind of radical solution

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.452
for solving that problem.

00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:36.910
There have been
moon shot pioneers.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.250
We're doing it at
X, but I wanted

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.833
to call out one of
my favorites, which

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:42.010
is George Washington Carver.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.550
When he went from Missouri,
when he was invited by Booker T.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.610
Washington to go to Tuskegee in
Alabama and join the faculty.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:53.750
He saw the problem of the
monocrop culture of the US

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.350
and the malnutrition
and the problems

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.030
that we had of not understanding
crop rotation and the future

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.920
of how agriculture had to be.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.290
And he went into the lab
as a heroic scientist,

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.599
as a heroic engineer.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.619
And he worked through
all kinds of ideas

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.630
for sweet potatoes and peanuts.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.630
And the stories went on.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.588
And then he figured out
how to radically get it

00:17:11.588 --> 00:17:13.109
out there using Jesup Wagons.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.380
And he changed our country.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.720
So Google X, just a
quick touch on it,

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.609
people think we
have a lot of hype.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:23.450
But the truth is it's really
a skunkworks kind of place,

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.405
really messy, really fun.

00:17:25.405 --> 00:17:27.780
The slight difference between
maybe other parts of Google

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.120
is that we are a
lot of hardware.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.070
That's where the
big difference is.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.080
We're looking for people who are
optics engineers in robotics,

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.820
and bio and these
other disciplines

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.800
that Google hasn't
classically had.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.700
Desks look like this.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.880
Our goal is to do
these moonshots.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.400
And culture, we want to
feel like Willy Wonka.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.250
It's got to be fun, interesting,
collaborative, unusual.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.460
Isabella who, we
were doing a video,

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.500
and she's the designer of Glass.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.040
She's like, well, I didn't
feel odd coming to Google X

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.390
because kind of everybody's odd.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.880
I thought, that's good.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.990
But this idea of
Peter and Petra Pans

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.480
surrounded by awesome teams.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.280
So, Solve for X is the thing
that I'm actually personally

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.190
most passionate about
at X. Which is, could we

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.610
make a platform to help
all these amazing moonshot

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.410
pioneers out in the
world be more visible.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.440
We often celebrate what people
finished in our science history

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.630
books.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.000
We celebrate the success.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.150
But could we help people
who are in process?

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.550
Elon Musk, 2008, when everyone
thought he was insane.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.870
Why is he buying that factory?

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.070
His rockets are blowing up.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.920
And look at Space X
now, look at Tesla now.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.870
So how can we celebrate people
when they are in process?

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.610
And the other
thing I do a lot of

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.000
is, we make sure that people
from all different continents,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.060
people of different races,
men and women, people

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.518
of different age groups, are
really celebrated on the site.

00:18:47.518 --> 00:18:52.570
So people can see, you
can't be what you can't see.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.170
So I'm going to flip it
to this last part which

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.500
is about debugging inclusion.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.440
And so networks are
incredible places

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.410
to do our heroic engineering,
to change commerce, et cetera.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.580
I'm from Buffalo so in addition
to the Silk Road, which

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.200
is such an incredible
example of a network that

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.854
changed the world, I
added the Erie Canal.

00:19:13.854 --> 00:19:16.020
The Erie Canal is interesting
for the US development

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.930
because it dropped the grain
price by a factor of 10

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.230
to get goods in and
out of the country.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.000
It really changed the game
from a commerce perspective.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.690
But it also is the
place where most

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.320
of the major abolition
and suffrage conversations

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:30.820
happened.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.090
In fact, Seneca Falls is right
here with one of the locks.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:39.460
And how many people know about
the Declaration of Sentiments?

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.890
Yeah, it's so interesting to me.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.080
So the Declaration of Sentiments
is the watershed document

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.050
around women's rights.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.820
It's the first women's
rights convention.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.710
I can't believe, in
and around visibility,

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.010
that it's not taught
in all of our schools,

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.100
in elementary school.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.200
But Elizabeth Cady Stanton
wrote this document.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.991
You should read it.

00:19:55.991 --> 00:19:57.720
It has 15 sentiments.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.240
Many of them are true
in some countries still.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.670
It's the watershed moment
for us in the beginning

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.650
of women's rights.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.240
I feel like we're making
huge progress, right?

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.560
We stand on the
shoulders of giants

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.270
from Elizabeth, to people
like Kathrine Switzer, who

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.180
had her numbers stripped
off in the Boston Marathon.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.230
A moment of extreme
violence in the,

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.120
Boston Marathon from the '70s.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.000
The guy didn't want
her in the race.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.264
But she finished that race.

00:20:26.264 --> 00:20:28.680
And I would encourage you to
watch the Makers videos which

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.310
have her story and others.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.320
We did Makers at Google
videos, by the way,

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.903
of Pavni and others, if you want
to see some of their stories.

00:20:34.903 --> 00:20:36.737
But really getting
the stories told,

00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:38.320
the work that Sheryl's
doing, the work

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.486
that is happening at the UN.

00:20:39.486 --> 00:20:41.290
I feel like we're
making progress.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.470
But in tech, we still have
to work on our visibility.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.969
I did a panel session
on STEAM and STEM

00:20:47.969 --> 00:20:49.010
at the Makers Conference.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.480
And Mae Jemison, the first
African American woman

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.320
in space, said, technical
women have an issue,

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.290
because we're a
minority in tech.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.020
And we're often unseen.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.370
And women have been
kind of convinced

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.707
not to follow math and science.

00:21:02.707 --> 00:21:04.040
They are sometimes afraid of it.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.670
And so we're a
minority amongst women.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.450
And they sometimes
don't include us.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.500
And so we're totally invisible.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.360
And so I think that we,
the technical women,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.425
need to show up.

00:21:13.425 --> 00:21:14.800
And we need to
have conversations

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.770
with our colleagues.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.520
So they're not afraid
of what we're doing.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.730
And include them, and get them
excited about we're doing.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.250
Because it's really
a way that we're

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.059
going to solve a
lot of problems.

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:24.600
I won't go into all
the details here.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.735
But you see the
Bletchley Park folks.

00:21:26.735 --> 00:21:30.730
The Eniac, which is the first US
digital computer, World War II,

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.460
University of Pennsylvania,
first programmers were women.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.010
Their stories haven't been
told, of course Grace Hopper.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.340
katherine Johnson, African
American woman now 96,

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.720
calculated the trajectories
for Alan Shepard, John Glenn,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.440
and the Apollo mission.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.530
We need to know about her.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:46.440
She's awesome.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.720
Her job was to be a computer.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.510
She wrote 26 papers.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.890
She was [INAUDIBLE]
author 26 papers at NASA.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.360
Her name is only on one.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.450
Hedy Lamarr, et cetera,
the Apollo women.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.530
Who saw the movie "Jobs"?

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.420
Do you remember the
Macintosh scene?

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:07.507
So Steve, Ashton-- he did a
good job I thought-- walks in,

00:22:07.507 --> 00:22:10.090
and there's these guys hanging
out in this skunk works project

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.290
called the Mac.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.710
Burrell Smith is kind of
asleep on a desk and wakes up.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.240
Burrell is the guy
on the far side here,

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.290
he's got the keyboard here.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.050
Bill Atkinson is in
the middle, starts

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.120
engaging the actor
of Jobs, Ashton.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.610
He has the Mac shirt here.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.440
He is in the middle there.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.000
Some of the other guys on
this side are in the scene.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.200
Andy Hertzfeld actually works
at Google now, he's amazing.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.850
I worked with him
at General Magic.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.956
There's a scene where
Steve Jobs goes and finds

00:22:36.956 --> 00:22:38.330
this engineer who
is a rock star.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.310
He is coding.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.660
He has a conversation.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.570
Andy said he will join
the Mac in two days.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.370
Steve says OK.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.710
And then unplugs his computer,
picks up the computer

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.610
and brings it to the team
in that moment, true story.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.330
Andy is there.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:52.890
Are there some
people on this screen

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.340
that are not in the movie?

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.530
This is the "Rolling
Stone" historic photos

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.000
of the original Mac
team, documenting

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.200
the team that created the Mac.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.860
Who is missing?

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.350
AUDIENCE: The women.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.970
MEGAN SMITH: All of them.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:11.750
So in this picture there's seven
men, four women, and a baby.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.690
This is Joanna Hoffman.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.210
She graduated in
physics from MIT.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.240
And she was the product
manager of the Macs.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.720
Steve's right hand person.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.140
Kind of like Salar or
Susan for us, like amazing.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.690
Susan Kare.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:28.080
What was so cool about the
Mac was its graphics, right.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.520
And so, Bill Atkinson
wrote the back end.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520
Susan did the front end.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.110
Everything you saw was Susan.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.630
Why did Hollywood
write them out?

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.679
I don't know.

00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:39.720
But the good news is we're
working on this stuff.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.510
The documentary about the Eniac
programmers is just completed.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.634
It's going to go through
the film festival circuit.

00:23:44.634 --> 00:23:45.190
It's awesome.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.850
And the stories are true.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:52.149
A wonderful ICANN lawyer
interviewed four of the six

00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:53.190
of them before they died.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.290
So we have that record.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.020
So we can resurrect
that lost history.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.850
And then in terms of
Geena Davis and Hollywood,

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.620
Geena has been measuring
the lack of women and girls

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:04.980
in children's television.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.340
And the lack of women, like
80% of the jobs in children's

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.080
television held by
male characters.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.730
And so we're starting
to use CS to help

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.910
make her tools more real time.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.540
So lots of good stuff there.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.960
The founding of
Women Techmakers,

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.000
which we invite all of you to
become collaborators on this.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.710
It's really about visibility
and community and resources.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.570
We started with Google
I/O because it's

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.900
the place where we reach
out to the most developers.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.620
That was our strategy there.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.060
We're doing a lot of stuff
around trying to debug this.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.377
We don't know the answers
how to fix these problems.

00:24:37.377 --> 00:24:38.960
We've inherited the
weight of history.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.990
None of us created
the bias that exists

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.200
in the world for
women and minorities.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.470
But we can work to fix it.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.432
One of them is doing unconscious
bias training on all of Google.

00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:48.390
It's really helping us.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.848
I think the biggest
breakthrough is

00:24:49.848 --> 00:24:52.140
in the Doodle Team,
which was receptive.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.800
But we really, as a company,
would have never meant to

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.660
not celebrate a woman's
birthday in the doodles.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.680
And we did that for seven years.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.672
We never celebrated
a woman's birthday.

00:25:02.672 --> 00:25:04.380
And then we realized,
people pointed out,

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.670
and we started to dig.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.490
History is biased.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.690
We only do doodles about
people who are not alive.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.690
So we weren't finding
them and celebrating them.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.600
So they started to
get to 20 to 30%.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.690
This year after doing
bias training, and the way

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.500
the world has changed, as of
January 1, they are at 50/50.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.530
And you could see it.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.720
It's changing.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.860
So I'll end with two slides.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.240
First, this one.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.670
Which is remember,
the girls are working.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.330
And they always have been.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.110
And they always will be.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.850
And then I think
one of the secrets

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.110
is, I was really lucky to get
taught acoustics by Professor

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.140
Bose, who we lost last year.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.550
And one of the things that
he would do as a professor,

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.830
he would also give us advice.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.520
And one of the greatest
pieces of advice

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.200
he gave us was, you guys
are high performing people,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.250
you are doing your stuff.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.040
But figure out what
you love to do.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.700
What are you passionate about?

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.940
And do that.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.320
Because you will be
unstoppable, if you do that.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.580
And so I just encourage you.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.381
The diversity of all
of the millions of us,

00:26:02.381 --> 00:26:04.380
the technical women, the
computer science women,

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.920
is broad.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.920
This industry and this
planet needs us badly.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.570
So bring what you want to do,
and what you want to discover,

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.570
what you want to make.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:15.000
Raise your voice,
raise your visibility,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.140
and find your X. And find
your team, and let's network

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.290
and make it happen.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.328
So thank you.

00:26:21.328 --> 00:26:28.426
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:28.426 --> 00:26:30.050
MEGAN SMITH: So these
guys said that we

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.633
were going to do one
or two questions.

00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:34.075
And then, [INAUDIBLE]
do you want to do that?

00:26:34.075 --> 00:26:35.200
Anybody have any questions?

00:26:40.535 --> 00:26:41.850
AUDIENCE: Can I say thank you.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.824
That was awesome
and so inspiring.

00:26:43.824 --> 00:26:45.240
And really made
this day worth it.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.073
MEGAN SMITH: Thanks.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:51.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.056
Along those lines.

00:26:53.056 --> 00:26:54.930
One of my strategies,
when Natalie and we all

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.680
were brainstorming
about Women Techmakers,

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:02.000
was, "We Are the Ones
We've Been Waiting For"

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.550
is that Alice Walker book.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:05.300
And just own it.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.060
And sometimes I
call it, bring it.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.870
Instead of yet another
panel about why there's not

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.470
enough women and minorities
in tech, it is so boring.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.970
Right?

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.210
And it doesn't engage anyone.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.110
It doesn't capture
their imagination.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:22.850
And so instead, if they can see
you, and what you are doing,

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.840
it will change the
way they think.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.770
And then we can also
add in the problem

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.480
and start to debug
them and work on them.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.510
But bring it.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.070
And so as we do
this stuff, that's

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.010
one of my thoughts on that.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.245
Any other quick questions?

00:27:34.245 --> 00:27:35.120
It's been a long day.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.106
There's one over here.

00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:38.730
AUDIENCE: How do you
see the challenges

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.000
that women face in tech as
unique from the challenges

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.530
women might face
in other industries

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:47.220
where they are also minorities,
or we are also minorities?

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.595
MEGAN SMITH: I think it's a
challenge and an opportunity.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.540
Everybody is facing unconscious
bias, the guys and we,

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.385
the women, none of us
created it, as I said.

00:27:59.385 --> 00:28:01.010
The Doodle Team is
such a good example.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.324
Because Ryan and the team
would have never done-- just

00:28:03.324 --> 00:28:04.240
wouldn't have done it.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.270
But when they wake
up, it changes things.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.959
So I think you have
to bring the data.

00:28:08.959 --> 00:28:11.000
Because I really think
our industry doesn't think

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.110
we have a problem.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.270
We are such a data
driven industry

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.860
that we think we're
such a meritocracy.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.170
And we are in a lot of ways.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.870
It's one of the greatest
things about tech.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.956
In fact, I ran an internet
company called Plan It Out

00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:26.830
in the gay community.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.485
And Tom Riley, who
founded Plan It Out.

00:28:29.485 --> 00:28:31.360
There was a guy named
Michelangelo Signorile,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.735
and he was talking about the
gay community in the closet.

00:28:33.735 --> 00:28:37.350
And he wrote a book
about media industry

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.280
in New York and the
intense closet there.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.240
This was sort of in the '80s
and '90s and as the AIDS crisis

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:43.970
was happening.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.880
The intense closet of
the government and DC,

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.960
and the intense closet and the
oppression in Hollywood in LA.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.590
And he added a chapter
called the Silicon Solution.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:57.340
And it was really about how
we are a meritocracy in tech

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.710
and how we think that way.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:02.160
So I do think that we actually
have the greatest opportunity

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.930
because of that to
change the fastest.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.512
But I think there
are two issues.

00:29:08.512 --> 00:29:09.970
We notice one issue
in our company.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.520
People really aren't convinced
that we have a problem.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.059
And so they need
to understand that.

00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:15.850
They need the Chuck
Vests and other people.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:18.380
Larry gave us a
company wide OKR to try

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.680
to become the best company
for women and minorities.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.090
So now everybody has to think
about what does that mean?

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.250
What do I need to do?

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.930
It opens innovation space.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.295
Get people convinced, use
data, use whatever it takes.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.280
People outsource it
to the diversity team.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.170
Every company has
a diversity team,

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.989
who are incredible people.

00:29:38.989 --> 00:29:40.280
But how many of them are there?

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.717
Maybe 30 maximum at any company.

00:29:42.717 --> 00:29:44.300
And so you can't
outsource it to them.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.470
You have to use them.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.370
You have to do it
yourself, as a manager,

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.500
and use them as
your awesome experts

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.647
to help you do it better.

00:29:51.647 --> 00:29:53.980
And so we need to get the
companies to start doing that.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.540
We need to have those
conversations with the HR folks

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.630
and really get innovative.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.850
We do not know how to
solve this problem.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:05.730
So we should recognize that
and go at it as an industry.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.597
And really back
the way Elon Musk

00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:09.930
thinks which is what's the
fundamental physics for doing

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:10.430
this.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.144
So it could be possible.

00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:14.560
And so what is the fundamental
fix, the physics, the data,

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.570
that is preventing us.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.100
What's this very complex stuff?

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.602
So that's, I think how,
the overarching strategy

00:30:20.602 --> 00:30:21.810
of how we should approach it.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.830
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:29.440
I also want to say thank
you so, so, so much.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.500
And I brought my
daughter here today.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.870
She's 12.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.330
And we live in
Emeryville, Oakland border

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.480
and the statistics
and experiences

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.920
for black and brown
girls in Oakland,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.510
South Africa, Los Angeles,
New York, are pretty terrible.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:53.810
And so I wanted to know if
you had one piece of advice

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.800
that you would get to a black
an brown girls about getting

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.630
into tech, and using tech
as a tool for liberation,

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.070
empowerment.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:06.120
What would you say
to them, or her?

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.830
MEGAN SMITH: Yeah
so a couple things.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.752
One of things that I want you
to know is about the women

00:31:11.752 --> 00:31:14.210
that I was talking about, like
Katherine Johnson, the women

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.559
who calculated the
trajectories for the Apollo

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:17.350
missions and stuff.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.700
That African American
women have been

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.660
part of fundamental
inventions for the whole time.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.035
But for some weird
reason, people

00:31:25.035 --> 00:31:27.243
have written them out of
history, or down in history.

00:31:27.243 --> 00:31:29.000
So let's bring that back.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.250
So that the kids can see that.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.550
That's important for the
boys and the girls to see.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.050
It's important for
everybody to see.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:37.280
She has one of the 300 flags
from the Apollo mission.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.710
She is in the elite Apollo team.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.350
We need to know
that she was there.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.620
Same thing actually,
just in general.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.180
It's this sort of
weight of history,

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.454
let's bring the true history
forward and know it and own it.

00:31:50.454 --> 00:31:52.370
Even if they weren't the
majority of the team,

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.328
they are in the team,
and they are contributing

00:31:54.328 --> 00:31:56.910
at elite levels,
sometimes founders.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.400
I think the second
thing is that, we've

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.130
been doing some studies
about women, and just kids

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.210
getting into tech.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.590
And one of the key
ones is encouragement.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.940
So just being here
is going to help you.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.630
It's going to help people.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.265
All of you, anything you can do.

00:32:12.265 --> 00:32:13.890
It turns out that
encouragement doesn't

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:18.280
have to come from a technical
person, it just has to come.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.960
One of the sad statistics
that we've come across with

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.290
and we're working on is
that 70% of the computer

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.280
science high school teachers
think that the boys are better

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.830
than the girls, despite
overwhelming evidence.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.070
And so you know the
stereotypes that they've had,

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:36.339
and the boring way that
we teach are playing out,

00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:38.630
that the programmer video
game kids are getting through

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.290
and the other kids who wouldn't.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.980
And Harvey Mudd has
done an astonishing job

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.600
of changing their curriculum
in order to attract everybody.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.377
And they are at
50:50 men and women.

00:32:48.377 --> 00:32:49.710
They have a lot more minorities.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:50.668
Have a lot more people.

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:51.950
They have grown the field.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.435
Because they changed it to
creative problem solving.

00:32:55.435 --> 00:32:57.560
Who doesn't want to be
creative and solve problems?

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.970
And they don't walk in and
start with math, they walk in

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:03.340
and they start with
problems and impact.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.570
Because it turned out
that a whole set of people

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.370
just want to change the world.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.980
And they don't love
science and math

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.280
because it hasn't been taught
in a way that is accessible.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.660
So they do things
like go to Congress.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.690
They do things like
start nonprofits.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:17.900
They do amazing things.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.390
But they don't include tech.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.790
And so those are some of the
weakest tech areas, sectors.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.646
Look at what happened
with the health website.

00:33:25.646 --> 00:33:27.520
Look at what happens in
development and NGOs.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.061
They're not technical because
people are afraid of technology

00:33:30.061 --> 00:33:31.580
because we taught it wrong.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.860
So I think wherever you
can, touch the field.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.400
Do science fair so you see
that science and the history

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.691
in the way they're teaching
but it's actually doing it.

00:33:40.691 --> 00:33:41.560
It's what we do.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.050
That's awesome.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.550
The other break through that
the University of Maryland has,

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.422
which is-- Actually
the university

00:33:47.422 --> 00:33:49.380
that we find the most
African American software

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.880
engineers for Google
is how fast can you

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.560
have a student be in the field.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.360
Because they have
so many stereotypes.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.395
I mean you watch "The
Big Bang Theory,"

00:33:58.395 --> 00:34:00.270
do you really want to
work with those people?

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.060
Probably not.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.870
And so they think it's
not they get it is.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.830
And people think it's lonely.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.150
And they think it's solitary.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.590
And it's not in any way.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.730
And so we need to kind of
have Hollywood help us.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.460
And get the information
through and get the kids

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.793
to our field to do those things.

00:34:14.793 --> 00:34:18.540
So there are a couple
things I'd recommend.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:23.690
So we want to get you
guys to reception.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.030
A small group of
us had this idea.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:29.150
And it's so exciting to see what
Natalie and Kyle and everybody

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.449
have done to take it to level.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.690
And we want to give it to
you guys, women techmakers.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.560
And, you know,
let's go bring it.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.019
So thank you for being here.
