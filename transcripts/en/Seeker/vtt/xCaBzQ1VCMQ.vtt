00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.310
I was really poor in college.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.690
It was a struggle to find money for my insanely
low rent five person house.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.730
So inevitably, I looked up how to donate sperm…

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.869
// They'll pay you for this?!

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.029
Sup guys, Trace here for DNews to talk about
the awkwardly fascinating topic of sperm banks.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.409
We've had a lot of conversation about genetically
modifying human embryos and gametes to create

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.279
superbabies, but what about the vintage version
of that: sperm selection.

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.010
In 1952, doctors in Iowa learned to freeze
and re-animate sperm cells; something which

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.150
could help families conceive -- a year later,
three babies were born from thawed sperm.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.120
Sperm banks is a general name for the place
men go to donate this sperm, and then have

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.700
it frozen and used for in-vitro fertilization
later.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.510
IVF is a 60 billion dollar-a-year industry,
and according to the American Society for

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.830
Reproductive Medicine, in 2012, in-vitro fertilization
accounted for 1.5% of ALL births in the U.S.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.840
or about 3.95 million wee babes -- that includes
partner donation as well as sperm banks.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.939
But because IVF can pull from the banks, some
donors end up fathering many offspring -- though

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:23.320
it's not like the movies, the upper mathematical
limit is about 30 pregnancies per year.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.020
80-percent of the donors are doing it for
the cash according to TIME magazine -- some

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.590
are paid as much as $100 per… um, donation.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.009
The thing is, it's not really easy to become
a donor!

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.479
It's not just any geek off the street, you
gotta be handy with the steel, know what I

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.479
mean?

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.479
Earn your keep!

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.430
There are over 500 different banks in the
U.S., and they have different rules in each

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.490
bank and in different states, but in general
the screening can be intense.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.450
In California, only 5 to 10 percent of men
qualify for donation.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.619
Banks want to make sure the sperm are quality,
so they an initial sample for motility, morphology,

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.560
cell count, and so on.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.929
They also test to ensure they can reanimate
after the freezing process.

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.220
If volunteers pass that, they check a family
medical history, test donor's blood and urine

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.430
to look for intravenous drug use, HIV, syphilis,
gonorrhea, chlamydia, and Hepatitis B and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.590
C. The FDA also tests for some genetic disorders,
like cystic fibrosis,.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.470
But the FDA doesn't require screening for
genetic disorders, or regulate sperm banks

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.470
in any way, so there's no consistency.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.280
Some banks will do a full genetic workup,
whereas others only test cystic fibrosis,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.640
sickle-cell disease, or blood-related problems.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.720
But even if you're the perfect donor, medically,
you can still be denied for the most shallow

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.940
reasons ever…

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.530
The NIH found most rejections were for low
sperm motility but you may be rejected if

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.340
you're under 5 foot 7 (1.7M) -- some require
5-eleven (1.8M!), or if you have dark skin

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.060
-- because most IVF families are white.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.940
If you're a homosexual man (or have had sex
with other men in general) you're not able

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.530
to donate.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.760
Sperm banks pay more for PhD students or Ivy
Leaguers.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760
Why?

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.960
Because potential recipients are paying a
lot of money to pick their ideal IVF candidate,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.180
and even if it's anonymous (which it isn't
always) they'll still be given the donors

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.090
height, hair color, eye color, education level,
and even told if they're a celebrity look-alike.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.060
Some sperm banks also ask about salary, familial
baldness, taste in clothing, even hobbies.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.180
Even with all the screening, the lack of regulation
means donor information can be, and HAS been,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.830
misrepresented to recipients.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.480
One couple in Atlanta is suing a sperm bank
saying they've discovered the donor who was

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.990
described as having a master's in Neuroscience,
an IQ of 160, and an impressive health history;

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.510
was really a schizophrenic, college dropout
with a burglary arrest record.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.140
The Journal of Pediatrics published a case
in 2006 detailing how one sperm donor passed

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.290
on a rare genetic disorder called congenital
neutropenia, or Kostmann Syndrome, and another

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.480
from in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in 2009 wrote about a 23-year-old

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.170
donor who passed on a potentially fatal congenital
heart condition to 9 children including one

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.510
who died; all because genetic testing wasn't
done.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.960
For people who donate to sperm banks, it would
seem the incentive is clear, they're paid

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.500
for their ejaculate, but since there's no
regulation it's sort of like the wild, wild,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.500
west in there!

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.500
Have you ever been a donor?

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.370
Did you know someone who was?

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.620
Tell us about the experience, I'm super curious!

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.500
It's such a crazy process.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.310
I've been searching through your science questions
and saving some of them to make videos!

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.750
There are some AWESOME ones, but there are
also ones we've already done!

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.070
We do have almost 2000 videos, so check there
too -- you're not being ignored.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.190
Check out our backlog, and thanks for watching
DNews.
