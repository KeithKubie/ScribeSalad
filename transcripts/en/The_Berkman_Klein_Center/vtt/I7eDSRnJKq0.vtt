00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.210
 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.180
The topic for today is the
cultural theory of copyright.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.180
In the previous segment
of the lecture, I

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.750
outlined the premises of one
variant of that approach.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.040
We now turn to some implications
for copyright law of that variant.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.050
The question I'll try to answer
is, if for our aspiration

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.150
were to foster A, opportunities
for the good life,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.610
and B, the cultural conditions
that sustain such opportunities,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.230
how might we adjust the law?

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.880
Listed on the screen are 13
zones of possible legal reform.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.180
Items 1 through 8 involve
copyright law proper.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.480
Items 9 through 11 involve alternatives
or supplements to copyright.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.160
Items 12 and 13 involve other
intellectual property regimes.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.230
In this segment of the lecture,
I'll consider the first eight

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.830
which, as I say, concern
copyright law itself.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.370
In the third and last
segment of the lecture,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.580
I'll consider, among other things,
the supplementary implications

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.270
alluded to in items 9, 10, and 11.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.590
The remainder I'll leave
to another time and place.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.320
 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.590
This list of possible
zones of reform is meant

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.460
to be illustrative, not exhaustive.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.570
It's designed to suggest how
the theory might be applied,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.730
not to provide a comprehensive
recipe for rebuilding copyright.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.240
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.870
The first doctrinal implication
is probably the most obvious.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.650
Copyright law affects
education in countless ways.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.670
We should adjust and apply
the law so as to enable, not

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.370
interfere with, the kind of
education I sketched and advocated

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.130
before the break.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.240
For example, in lecture
number eight in this series,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.140
I discussed the provision
of the US copyright statute

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.540
that attempts to facilitate
distance learning.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.650
We saw that that provision,
popularly known as the TEACH Act,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.730
is almost completely
ineffective in practice.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.140
Its limitations are so severe that
almost no distance learning venture

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.650
relies on it.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.210
Certainly I'm not relying
on it for this course.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.960
Right now, meaning the winter of
2013, the World Intellectual Property

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.360
Organization is discussing
a possible model provision

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.920
that countries might employ in the
future to enable distance education.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.550
When addressing this issue on
the national or the global level,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.050
our goal should be to capitalize
on the extraordinary opportunities

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.410
for distance learning
enabled by new technologies

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.930
without, of course, corroding
crucial incentives to create

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.420
educational materials
in the first instance.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.450
A useful exercise in
this regard might be

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.610
to ask what legal reforms would be
necessary to make possible an edX

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.940
course analogous to the one supported
by this lecture series but in a field

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.700
where the thicket of
copyrights is more dense.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.360
Constructing an edX course that focuses
on law, and in particular on US law,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.570
is relatively easy, because the
primary source of materials--

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.810
statutes, judicial
opinions, and so forth--

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.300
are in the public domain
in the United States.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.890
Developing a similar course that deals
with contemporary art, for example,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.259
or a modern social science
would be much harder,

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.050
because a much smaller percentage
of the pertinent source materials

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.340
are publicly available.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.690
It's worth asking yourself
which of the rules

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.450
we have examined thus far
in this course would I

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.810
amend in order to make
such a course feasible.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.530
In particular, how would I
qualify copyright owners' existing

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.950
rights to control the
reproduction, distribution,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.800
and public performance of their works?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.730
 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.200
Here's another dimension
of the same general theme.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.700
As we will see next
week, most countries now

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.230
have statutes penalizing the
distribution and use of technologies

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.540
that circumvent technological protection
measures-- in other words, technologies

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.579
that neutralize the forms of encryption
commonly used by copyright owners

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.899
and others to prevent
unauthorized access to

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:25.440
or use of copies of their creations.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.380
Sometimes, those statutes
inhibit education-- for example,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.760
by frustrating the work of teachers
and students in film studies courses.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.730
As we will see, some exceptions
to the anti-circumvention rules

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.310
have already been carved out
so as to facilitate education.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.015
We can and should create
more such exceptions.

00:04:46.015 --> 00:04:48.800
 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.010
Both of the possible reforms
I've discussed thus far

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.810
would curtail the entitlements
of copyright owners,

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.400
but enabling education does not
always point in that direction.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.740
Sometimes, it might be
achieved by strengthening

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.730
the rights of copyright owners.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.590
For instance, as we saw
in lecture number eight,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.970
software firms frequently
strive to separate

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.770
the set of potential
purchasers of their products

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.820
into at least two groups, commercial
users and educational users,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.050
and then to charge much higher prices
to the former than to the latter.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.850
Here are two examples
you've seen before.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.910
Of course, the reason that firms do
this is to increase their profits.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.890
They're not altruistic.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.370
Differential pricing of this sort,
they have discovered, is lucrative,

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.240
but it also redounds the
benefit of education.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.050
Many more students and faculty are able
to obtain and use application programs

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.490
if the firms are able to maintain
these practices than if they are not.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.230
Viewed through the lens of the
cultural theory I've outlined,

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.870
that's something we should
applaud and preserve.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.120
How?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.150
By adjusting legal doctrines to help the
software firms engage in this behavior.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.690
More specifically, by
defending the rules

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.750
that inhibit arbitrage which corrodes
such differential pricing systems.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.530
One such rule we saw
is the interpretation

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.120
of the first sale doctrine adopted
recently by the Court of Appeals

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.940
for the Ninth Circuit
in the Autodesk case.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.970
That interpretation
enables software firms,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.730
by characterizing their
transactions with their customers

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.480
as leases of copies of the
programs rather than as sales

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.970
of copies of the programs, to suppress
secondary markets in the copies they

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.540
provide to students and
teachers, and that in turn

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.480
will enable the firms to keep the
prices of those educational copies low.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.444
And that's what we want.

00:06:46.444 --> 00:06:48.610
I hasten to add that there
may be other implications

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.360
or applications of the Autodesk ruling
that we should be less happy about,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.860
but this one seems commendable.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.770
 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.640
A less obvious, more general
application of cultural theory

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.490
concerns the
idea/fact/expression distinction

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.180
that, as we saw in lecture number
one, underlies the copyright

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.510
systems of every country in the world.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.260
Copyright law, as you now know, does
not protect either ideas or facts.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:21.060
It only protects original ways of
expressing those ideas and facts.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.760
Many applications to this
principle are straightforward.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.070
To take an immediate example,
the somewhat heretical claim

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.610
I made a few minutes ago, namely
that the Autodesk decision may

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.340
be consistent with a sociocultural
theory of copyright, is an idea.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.620
You are thus free to describe that
idea to anyone else in any medium

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.040
provided that you use your
own words to express it,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.730
but you may not without my
permission use the sequence of words

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.400
that I employed to express the idea.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.780
Now in reality, as you
know, I have already

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.727
given permission for many
uses of my exact words

00:07:55.727 --> 00:07:58.560
through the Creative Commons licenses
under which these lectures are

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.204
distributed, but ignore that fact
for the purposes of this illustrative

00:08:02.204 --> 00:08:02.745
hypothetical.

00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:05.370
 

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.540
Even though the general
principle is clear enough,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.260
applying it in borderline
cases is sometimes difficult.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.120
For example, what if the
particular way in which I've

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.850
expressed the defensibility
of Autodesk is

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.750
the only efficient way
of expressing that idea?

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.470
Then may you use my exact words?

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.610
Yes, under the merger doctrine.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.170
What if my language is
not the only efficient way

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.650
of expressing the idea but one
of a small set of efficient ways?

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.159
May you use my formulation?

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.500
Not so clear.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.590
Here's another edge case.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.840
In the previous lecture, I described
the facts of the Harper &amp; Row decision

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.980
in which Victor Navasky
took some 300 words

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.370
from President Ford's autobiography.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.390
Among the most distinctive
phrases lifted by Navasky

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.610
where those in which President Ford
described his deliberations concerning

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.830
whether to pardon his
predecessor, Richard Nixon.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:08.770
An illustrative excerpt from Navasky's
article is set forth on your screen.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.905
"In justifying the pardon, Ford goes out
of this way to assure the reader that,

00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:17.270
quote, 'compassion for Nixon as an
individual hadn't prompted my decision

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.470
at all.' Close quote.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.970
Rather, he did it
because he had to, quote,

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:28.460
'get the monkey off my back one
way or the other.'" Close quote.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.580
The language that appears in
bold and in quotation marks

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.640
was taken from Ford's book.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.130
The remaining language was Navasky's.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.980
Justice Brennan,
dissenting in this case,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.330
contended that two aspects
of the copyright system

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.590
should have been construed so as
to afford Navasky some latitude.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.370
First, says Brennan, some leeway must
be given to subsequent authors seeking

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.300
to convey facts, because those
wishing to express the ideas contained

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:01.460
in factual works often can choose from
only a narrow range of expression.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.820
Second, Brennan contended that when
evaluating the fair use defense weight

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.240
should have been given both to the
factual character of the plaintiff's

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.830
work and to its public importance.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:18.470
But even Brennan did not challenge the
claim that quoting 300 of Ford's words

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.670
in this way constituted
a prima facie violation

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.060
of section 106(1) of the statute.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:31.110
Justice O'Connor, writing for the
majority, was even less forgiving.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.270
Here's her language.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.560
Quote, "The Nation has admitted to
lifting verbatim quotes of the author's

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.790
original language totaling
between 300 and 400 words

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.510
and constituting some 13%
of the Nation article.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.440
In using generous verbatim excerpts
of Mr. Ford's unpublished manuscript

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.180
to lend authenticity to its
account of the forthcoming memoirs,

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.430
the Nation effectively
arrogated to itself

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:03.495
the right of first publication, an
important marketable subsidiary right."

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:06.120
Viewed through the lens of the
cultural theory I have outlined,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.890
this is troubling.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.990
Participatory political
democracy, as we've seen,

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.690
is one of the fundamental features of
an attractive and stimulating society.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.530
Political democracy is only possible
if the citizenry is informed.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.690
It's hard to imagine an issue
more central to political debate

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:28.030
and engagement than the precise
reasons why one president decided

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.580
to pardon another president for a crime.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.370
 

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.280
Copyright law already
contains a device that

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.560
would have enabled the Supreme
Court to respect this consideration.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.180
Language of the sort lifted
from the manuscript by Navasky

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.890
could quite plausibly have
been described as a fact.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.650
Generalizing the point,
we or the Supreme Court

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.310
could have declared that
any language or material

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.940
essential to political
deliberation and civic engagement

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:04.560
is either a fact or an idea and thus
up for grabs in the political arena.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.260
That would have left
Navasky off the hook

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.390
without needing to reach
the fair use doctrine,

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.300
and the result would've been to
encourage journalists in the future

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.865
to make more widely available analogous
utterances by major public figures.

00:12:18.865 --> 00:12:21.480
 

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.280
Here's another example
of the same point.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.730
You'll recall, I hope, our
discussion in lecture number six

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.420
of the case that considered
whether Martin Luther King complied

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.370
with the statutory formalities
established by the 1909 copyright

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:40.840
statute when delivering his "I Have a
Dream" speech on the Washington Mall.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.000
Held, King had complied
with those formalities,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.340
and thus his estate could continue
to assert a copyright in the speech.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.530
Again, viewed through lens of cultural
theory, that outcome is problematic.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.370
Broad public access to the
extraordinarily powerful language

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.930
in which King expressed
his vision of civil rights

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.840
would foster democracy
and civic engagement.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.560
Rephrasing this consideration in
the language of copyright law,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.580
shouldn't the text of the
speech now be considered a fact?

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.120
This principle need not threaten
the core of copyright law.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.860
What type of candy Kramer dropped
into the body of a patient

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.830
during one episode of the Seinfeld
show does not constitute a fact,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.950
but statements by public figures
essential to deliberation

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.040
and civic engagement should be.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.320
A more radical extension of
the same general approach

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.220
would entail denying
copyright protection

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.460
to materials to which subsequent
authors must have access

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.830
in order to express
themselves effectively.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:50.450
That principle arguably already
underlies not only the merger doctrine

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.230
but also the scenes a faire
doctrine, which as we've seen

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:59.900
denies copyright protection to images
or scenes that are as a practical matter

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.040
essential to work within
a particular genre.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.220
The merger and scenes a faire
doctrines have cousins elsewhere

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.460
in intellectual property
law, for example,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.870
in the rule that trademarks lose
protection when they become generic

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:19.760
and in the nominative use
defense also in trademark law.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.470
If we interpreted or supplemented
merger and scenes a faire this way,

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.820
we would deny copyright protection
to works or aspects of works

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.290
that subsequent speakers need
to be able to speak effectively.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.730
For example, we would permit
historians and appropriation artists

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.490
to use news photos that they
could not have taken themselves.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:47.670
By contrast, if we were persuaded by
the logic of the Bridgeport Music case,

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.000
we would not permit rap artists
to sample sound recordings

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.210
without permission
because, as you now know,

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.270
the law, at least in the United
States, permits rap artists

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.950
and others to recreate those
recordings in the studios,

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:08.140
and thus they do not need access to the
originals in order to work effectively.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.810
Next topic.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.490
As you know by now, there
are two general regulators

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.370
of the scope of copyright
in the United States.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.920
The first is the
idea/fact/expression distinction

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.410
which we have just reconsidered from
the vantage point of cultural theory.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.160
The second is fair use.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.040
How might cultural theory
illuminate fair use?

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.380
You will recall, I hope,
that when we were discussing

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.820
welfare theory in lecture
number four I suggested

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.480
that each of the various entitlements
that might be assigned to copyright

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.740
owners could be evaluated on the basis
of a ratio, the numerator of which

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:49.230
is the economic benefits that
entitlement would provide to creators

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.340
and thus the incentive
it offered to creativity

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.690
and the denominator of which is the
social losses that entitlement would

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.580
cause.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.760
Generally speaking, we would like to
assign to copyright owners entitlements

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.950
to carry with them high ratios, ie
that, to use Louis Kaplow's words,

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.990
"give us a big bang for our buck."

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.410
And we would like to
deny to copyright owners

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.890
entitlements that carry with them
low ratios-- in other words, that

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.410
cause social welfare
losses that are large

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:25.080
compared to the economic benefits
they confer on copyright owners.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.580
The fair use doctrine offers one device
we might employ for this purpose.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:35.200
We could declare to be fair unauthorized
uses that encroach on entitlements that

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.650
have low ratios and declare to
be unfair unauthorized uses that

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.670
encroach on entitlements
that have high ratios.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.120
A modified version of
this methodology might

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:51.840
be employed if our beacon were cultural
theory rather than welfare theory.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.880
Specifically, we could declare
to be fair unauthorized uses that

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.750
encroach on entitlements that provide
copyright owners modest benefits

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.532
but erect substantial impediments
to the pursuit of a just

00:17:03.532 --> 00:17:05.760
and attractive society.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.700
On the other hand, we could declare
to be unfair unauthorized uses that

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.829
encroach on entitlements that impede
the good society in ways that are modest

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:21.079
compared to the benefits they
provide to copyright owners.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:24.260
Here's an easy example.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.569
Commentary and criticism are
culturally beneficial for many reasons.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:32.070
They help consumers determine
which books they wish to read

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.720
or which films they wish to watch
before they waste time sampling them.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.780
Equally important, engagement
in commentary and criticism

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:46.080
is enlightening, and we should look
for opportunities to facilitate it.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.160
That in turn suggests that
copying copyrighted materials

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.160
for the purposes of
commentary and criticism

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.490
should be privileged under
the fair use doctrine.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:59.140
Copying for parody would be
an especially clear-cut case.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.240
As you know, parody is,
as a practical matter,

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.880
privileged in the large majority
of cases in the United States.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.495
But not all countries are
as lenient in this respect.

00:18:09.495 --> 00:18:10.120
They should be.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.820
 

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.750
Here's a harder example.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.510
You'll recall from the preceding lecture
that the meaning of the crucial term

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:24.920
"transformative" in US fair use
doctrine is currently unclear.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.170
An interpretation of that
term that associates it

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.690
with physical modifications
has fallen out of favor.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.900
But two other interpretations in
which "transformative" is translated

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.030
as socially beneficial and
in which it is associated

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.940
with cases where the purpose
of the defendant's work

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:48.210
is different from the purpose of the
plaintiff's work currently contend.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.920
Some scholars and judges favor neither.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.300
When I summarized this
debate, I suggested

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.100
that there is a fourth possibility.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:02.580
The term "transformative" could
be translated as creative.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.100
This was the interpretation I offered
many years ago in an essay on fair use,

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.100
and I continue to think
it's the best one.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.440
A defendant's work should be treated
as transformative if and only

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.740
if it's creative--
somewhat more specifically,

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.990
if it either constitutes or
facilitates creative engagement

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.970
with intellectual products.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.330
All of the cases that fall within
the green ellipse on your screen

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.280
involved uses that fit this definition.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.510
All consequently should've been deemed
transformative, which would likely

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.580
have led to findings that
they constituted fair uses.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.260
To be sure, this proposed
interpretation of transformativeness

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.420
would not be a panacea.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.520
Although it would increase
the coherence and thus

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.990
the predictability of the doctrine,
it would still call upon courts

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.860
to make difficult decisions
concerning degrees of creativity.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.920
This would be especially problematic
in the context of motion picture

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.040
adaptations of novels or stories.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:05.970
How creative would they have to be
to escape liability if unauthorized?

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.380
A guideline that might help
when addressing such questions

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.170
would be that movies that
retell in a different medium

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.410
the same story told
in the original novel

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.090
would be insufficiently creative
to constitute fair uses,

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.630
whereas movies that told different
stories would be deemed fair.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.940
So, for example, the Harry Potter
movies would require licenses,

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.450
while Apocalypse Now would not, on
the assumption that Heart of Darkness

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.530
was still in copyright.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.690
But one can readily imagine
intermediate and thus harder cases.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.970
In some, construing
transformative as creative

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:48.070
would help to reorient
fair use but, concedingly,

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.320
would leave many issues unresolved.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.450
 

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.036
Acceptance of this
suggestion would increase

00:20:56.036 --> 00:20:58.660
the set of circumstances in which
defendants could successfully

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.100
invoke the fair use doctrine,
but the theory I've outlined

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.730
is not always pushed in that direction.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.840
In particular, viewed
from the perspective

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.190
of the theory I have sketched,
consumptive as opposed

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.220
to transformative uses
of copyrighted materials

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:19.110
do not merit as much solicitude as
the courts have sometimes given them.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.370
Recall Justice Blackmun's
comment in the Betamax case.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.460
"The situations in which fair
use is most commonly recognized

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.110
are listed in section 107 itself.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:34.262
Fair use may be found when the work is
used 'for purposes such as criticism,

00:21:34.262 --> 00:21:36.220
comment, news reporting,
teaching, scholarship,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.080
or research.' Each of these
uses reflects a common theme.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.320
Each is a productive use resulting
in some added benefit to the public

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.560
beyond that produced by
the first author's work.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.070
The fair use doctrine, in other
words, permits works to be used

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:56.560
for 'socially laudable purposes.'
I'm aware of no case in which

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.510
the reproduction of a copyrighted work
for the sole benefit of the user has

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:04.120
been held to be fair use."

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.830
I am much of his mind.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.650
While the productive-- in
other words, creative-- uses

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.560
of copyrighted materials
deserve lots of scope,

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.880
consumptive uses-- in other words,
uses for the sole benefit of the user--

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.680
do not.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:24.300
Adoption of Blackmun's position would
lead to another heretical result.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.570
The declaration in the Betamax case
that time shifting broadcast TV shows

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.740
and films is a fair use
might well have been wrong.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.420
But hold on.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.710
Wouldn't adoption of Blackmun's
position have doomed VCRs?

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:39.880
No.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.410
It probably instead would have
resulted in a voluntary royalty system.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:48.099
Purchasers of VCRs would
have paid a premium, which

00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:51.140
in turn would have been paid to the
owners of the copyrights in the taped

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.510
shows and films.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.940
This would have caused an
increase in the cost of VCRs,

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.330
and that cost might well have
reduced somewhat the pace

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:06.560
at which this technology spread, first
in the US population and then globally.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.650
But from the standpoint of the
cultural theory offered here,

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.340
that would not have been so terrible.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.710
A final comment about fair use.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.030
At the end of the preceding
lecture, I suggested

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.930
that the US version of
the fair use doctrine

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.720
suffers from a fundamental defect.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.870
It sets forth a set of four
factors that judges must consider

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:31.840
but does not indicate
why those factors matter.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.920
The judges called upon
to apply the doctrine

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.070
thus must decide for themselves what
the goal of the copyright system

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:42.850
is and then construe the
factors to advance that goal.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:48.240
Application of the doctrine is thus
very hard to predict in advance.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.040
Adoption of the approach outlined in
this lecture could address that defect.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.530
If lawmakers were willing to articulate
a vision of the sort offered here

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.740
and tie fair use to
it, the result would be

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.400
to reduce considerably
the notorious uncertainty

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.930
of this dimension of copyright law.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.660
 

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.570
Let's now move on to the
sensitive subject of moral rights.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.190
When set against the
backdrop of cultural theory,

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:21.430
one aspect of moral rights is
suspect-- the right of integrity.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.450
As you know, the right of
integrity, when fully implemented,

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.900
protects artists and authors from
the destruction or mutilation

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.530
of their works.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.810
The result inevitably
is to curb the interests

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:38.700
of the people we used to call
consumers to remix their creations.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.680
Artists' interest in
self expression of course

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.330
deserves considerable
respect and protection

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.980
but perhaps not as much
as some jurisdictions,

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.990
particularly in continental
Europe, currently afford them.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.710
In some contexts, the
artists' interests may

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.980
have to be tempered by legal recognition
of the equally important interests

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.954
of consumers in self expression
and the overall cultural importance

00:25:03.954 --> 00:25:04.870
of semiotic democracy.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.380
 

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.030
With respect to unique
or limited edition works,

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.960
perhaps preservation of the current
regime is, on balance, sensible.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.660
No one should be permitted
to melt down or desecrate

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.820
one of the few castings
of Rodin's Thinker.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.640
But when copies of a
work are not scarce,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.280
modification and
remixing should be freer.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.920
An example would be colorization
of black and white movies.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.360
So long as copies of the
original film remain available,

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.124
we should tolerate, even encourage,
the creation and dissemination

00:25:40.124 --> 00:25:41.040
of colorized versions.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.960
 

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.950
Other dimensions of
moral rights, however,

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:50.100
stand up much better to scrutiny from
the standpoint of cultural theory.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.010
The right of attribution, for
example, seems closely tied

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.530
to the fundamental human need
for self expression, the ability

00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:02.540
to project one's identity into the
world and to be recognized by others.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.890
Requiring recognition of that sort would
not materially impair the opportunities

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.800
for remixing and secondary creativity.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.670
One doctrinal adjustment
that could accommodate

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:17.420
this insight would be to
add to the US fair use

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.620
calculus a requirement like that
currently in the United Kingdom's

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:26.230
fair dealing system, namely a duty
to give credit where credit is due.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:30.290
 

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:35.790
Libraries contribute importantly to
public education, defined expansively,

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.000
as was suggested in the previous
segment of this lecture.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.510
Thus, we should be skeptical of aspects
or applications of copyright law

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:48.100
that make it harder for
libraries to operate.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.120
An example would be
public lending rights

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.520
which exist in Europe
but as yet nowhere else.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.400
Such rights give copyright owners the
ability to collect fees from libraries.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.610
If the libraries are able easily to
pass along the cost of those fees

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:06.070
to governments, which in turn pay
for them out of general tax revenues,

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.650
then the net result may not be bad.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.410
Indeed, it may give rise
indirectly and inadvertently

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.879
to a form of governmental
funding for education.

00:27:15.879 --> 00:27:18.170
But in most developing
countries, governments would not

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.460
be able to absorb these costs, and thus
the adoption of public lending rights

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.620
would seriously burden libraries
and likely force some of them

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.460
to curtail their operations.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.777
That would be plainly inconsistent
with the cultural theory

00:27:31.777 --> 00:27:32.735
and should be resisted.

00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:35.580
 

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.580
The functions traditionally
assumed by libraries

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.110
are increasingly being assumed
by other organizations.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:45.520
An example is Google, which sought
in its ill-fated Google Print Library

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.010
Project to make all books published
in the world widely available

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.310
in digital form.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.250
This was a highly commendable ambition.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.730
To be sure, there were opposing
considerations, most obviously

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.380
the interests of the
authors and publishers being

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.650
appropriately compensated.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.110
The best way of reconciling
these goals was far from obvious,

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.840
but one maneuver was promising.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.920
Oren Bracha proposed that we
accept in this particular setting

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.350
an opt-out rather than an opt-in rule.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.230
In other words, Google
or other organizations

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:26.710
should be permitted to digitize books
and make the digital versions publicly

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:32.130
available unless and until
the copyright owners object.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.070
Shifting the burden to the copyright
owners would have huge social benefits.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.160
Most importantly, it would enable
widespread distribution of so-called

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.250
orphan works, works that may still be
in copyright but whose owners cannot be

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.860
readily identified.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.410
Opening up all such works for public
use unless and until the owners

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.890
made themselves known
and objected would do

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:57.700
much to facilitate the dissemination of
knowledge critical to a good society,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:02.680
and the burden on copyright
owners would be slight.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.070
This brings us to formalities.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.860
In lecture number six, I
suggested that many scholars now

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.100
believe that the modern trend
of abolishing formalities

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.110
as preconditions to the acquisition
or enforcement of copyrights

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.170
is regrettable.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:22.100
The cultural theory sketched here
suggests some of the reasons why.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.100
By granting copyrights
automatically to creative works,

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.700
we needlessly limit the
scope of the public domain.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.880
And by failing to require compliance
with a comprehensive registration

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.970
system, we needlessly frustrate
many potential licensing deals

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.220
that would enable socially
beneficial activities.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.690
 

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.610
Cultural theory can
also lend some support

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:47.770
to the shaky arguments I discussed
at the end of lecture number eight

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.910
in favor of compulsory licenses.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.730
Specifically, two kinds
of compulsory licenses

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.140
look somewhat better when
viewed from this angle--

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.720
those that enable modifications
of copyrighted works

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.920
provided that the modifiers pay a
governmentally-set fee, and those

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.560
that give a break to
educational activities,

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.175
such as public broadcasting.

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:14.100
The former, such as the
cover license in section 115,

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.790
had the effect of increasing the
diversity of cultural products

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.770
available to the public.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.320
Think of the richness of
the menu of renditions

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:26.160
of classic musical compositions
that the cover license has enabled.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.760
The latter, of course, facilitate
education broadly conceived

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.940
and an informed citizenry.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.670
 

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:39.350
A few minutes ago, I mentioned an
example of differential pricing,

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:43.530
specifically in the context of
educational discounts for software.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:48.520
I now want to return to this
issue and address it more broadly.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.220
Differential pricing of
copies of copyrighted works

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.740
is a very complicated subject
when viewed from any angle.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.200
Assessed from the standpoint
of cultural theory,

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:04.120
it offers some intriguing possibilities
but also poses some dangers.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.270
The principal opportunity
is that differential pricing

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.730
can have the beneficial
effect of equalizing access

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.720
to entertainment and informational
products across income classes

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.005
and countries and thus promotes
the kind of distributive justice

00:31:17.005 --> 00:31:21.020
that figures importantly
in cultural theory.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.700
This possibility is suggested by
the facts of the Kirtsaeng case,

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:29.460
which as you know is currently before
the United States Supreme Court.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:34.670
Supap Kirtsaeng is a student who
financed his education in large part

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.430
by persuading his relatives
living in his native Thailand

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.760
to purchase inexpensive copies of
textbooks that had been manufactured

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.620
and sold in Thailand and ship them to
Mr. Kirtsaeng, who was then studying

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.044
at Cornell University
in upstate New York.

00:31:51.044 --> 00:31:53.710
The large differential between
the price at which the books were

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:57.390
being sold in Thailand and the
retail price in the United States

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.350
enabled Mr. Kirtsaeng
to make a healthy profit

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:06.007
selling the books on eBay for
somewhat less than the US list price.

00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:07.840
The issue currently
before the Supreme Court

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.399
is whether John Wiley, the owner
of the copyrights in the books,

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:13.940
should be able to stop this practice.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.580
 

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:21.607
Admiration for Mr. Kirtsaeng's
entrepreneurial spirit and unease

00:32:21.607 --> 00:32:23.940
concerning the magnitude of
the damage award to which he

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:29.400
is exposed if he loses suggests
the answer should be no.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.800
But consider what will
happen if Kirtsaeng prevails.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.086
Publishers, feeling
generalizations of his conduct,

00:32:37.086 --> 00:32:39.210
will almost certainly reduce
the price differential

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.960
between the US and
poorer countries, thus

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:48.350
rendering arbitrage of the sort
he engaged in less attractive.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.780
The publishers could achieve this
by lowering the US retail price,

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.320
but for obvious reasons that's unlikely.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.350
Instead, they will probably raise
prices in Thailand and other developing

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.910
countries.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.400
The result is that the
residents of those countries

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.170
will face higher financial
hurdles when seeking educations.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:11.130
Assuming that we wish to apply our
cultural theory on a global scale

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.760
this is an unattractive outcome.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.300
 

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.870
For similar reasons, we
may wish to acquiesce

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.740
in the technological protection
measures that help film studios engage

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:27.820
in so-called region coding of
DVDs and now Blu-ray discs.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:32.640
The effect of those systems is that
the disks sold in one region cannot be

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.530
played on players that are
sold in a different region.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:40.160
One of the goals of such systems is
to enable the studios to sell discs

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.150
at lower prices in poorer regions
than in richer regions without fearing

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:49.420
importation of the cheap versions
into the wealthier regions.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.060
From the standpoint of
distributive justice,

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.310
it seems a good thing, not a bad one.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:59.710
But differential pricing
is not an unalloyed good.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.200
Viewed from the standpoint
of cultural theory

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.820
it has at least four
potential drawbacks.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:10.850
First, it sometimes results in
a constriction, not expansion,

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:14.209
of the set of people to whom
the good at issue is provided.

00:34:14.209 --> 00:34:16.000
This all depends on
the shape of the demand

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.449
curves in the subdivided markets.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.719
Second, as Wendy Gordon
observes, differential pricing

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:25.100
can increase what she
calls the granularity

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:31.630
of social life, the sense that all
of our conduct triggers microcharges.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:35.480
Third, as Yochai Benkler
and Eric von Hippel contend,

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.000
differential pricing can corrode
a culturally beneficial practice

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.929
and spirit of altruistic
sharing-- in other words,

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:46.219
giving away your stuff for free.

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:49.130
Last but not least, the
dream that currently

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:54.909
bedazzles many copyright owners of
slicing their markets ever more finely

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:58.290
creates a powerful incentive to
collect extremely detailed information

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:02.880
concerning the habits, incomes,
and wealth of those customers.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.930
The result is a serious risk to
privacy, one of the conditions

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:12.950
that, as you know, figures in
our vision of the good life.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:16.190
How can we balance these
competing considerations?

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.150
No blanket solution is readily apparent.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:23.720
The set of rules governing differential
pricing that, all things considered,

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.125
is most conducive to the good society
unfortunately varies by context.

00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:31.230
 

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.387
This concludes our examination
of the possible implications

00:35:34.387 --> 00:35:36.220
of the particular variant
of cultural theory

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:41.250
that I have outlined here for the
reform of copyright law proper.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:45.020
After the break, I'll consider a few
ways in which the same theory might

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.680
be applied outside
copyright law and then

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.210
consider some overall objections
to this whole approach.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:52.726
