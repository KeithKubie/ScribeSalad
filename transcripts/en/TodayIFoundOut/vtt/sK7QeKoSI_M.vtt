00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.570
Heinz Didn't Just Have 57 Products When it
was Named

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.109
By 1892, H.J. Heinz Company had grown from
a small company selling horseradish in clear

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.849
glass jars, to having over 60 products. Despite
having more than 57 products, at the behest

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:18.070
of the founder of H.J. Heinz Company, the
business instituted their now famous “57

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.970
Varieties of Heinz” slogan.
Henry Heinz had come up with the slogan while

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.080
riding on a train in New York City in 1892.
While on the train, he spotted a shoe store

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.519
advertisement that was promoting their “21
styles of shoes”. He thought his company

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.890
should have a similar slogan, promoting the
fact that they produced many different products.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.060
Rather than go with the exact number of products
they made at the time (which would continue

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.870
to grow to nearly 6,000 today), he instead
chose “57”. According to H.J. Heinz Company,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.780
he chose this number simply because he thought
it was a lucky number and liked the sound

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.290
of “57 Varieties of Heinz”. It was also
reasonably close to the number of products

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.960
that they actually produced, so they went
with it.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.930
Henry Heinz got his start selling food products
all the way back at the tender age of eight

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.469
years old. At the time, he helped his mother
in her garden and would take the vegetables

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:08.670
around his neighborhood, selling them door
to door. One year later, using a recipe his

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.969
mother had taught him, he started making and
selling his own horseradish sauce, which later

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:16.499
would be the same sauce he would found his
first major company selling.

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.990
His parents soon gave him around 3/4 of an
acre to support his entrepreneurial endeavors

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.130
and while just ten years old, he was now selling
large quantities of vegetables and horseradish

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.810
sauce around his neighborhood. Two years later,
he expanded his operation to nearly four acres

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.579
and was even selling to local grocery stores.
He continued growing in this way and, at his

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.659
peak before going to college, grossed around
$2400 per year, which would be around $55,000

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.350
today. Now all grown up, rather than continue
expanding at this point, he instead chose

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.030
to go to college and earned a degree in business.
Heinz’ first business that he founded after

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.319
college actually went bankrupt after just
six years in operation. The company was called

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.880
“Heinz Noble &amp; Company”, co-founded by
Heinz and L. Clarence Noble. They started

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.259
out selling more or less the same horseradish
that he sold as a child. Unfortunately for

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.060
him, the “Great Depression” hit starting
in 1873 with the “Panic of 1873″ and continuing

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.880
until 1879.
Of course, this “Great Depression” eventually

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.460
got its named usurped a little under 60 years
later and instead is now commonly known as

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.270
the “Long Depression”. The Long Depression
ultimately affected much of Europe and the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.270
United States. While there were many events
that led up to the eventual trigger, that

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.270
trigger in the U.S. ended up being the failure
of the Jay Cooke &amp; Company bank, which had

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.650
overextended itself in putting way to much
capital into the railroad bubble of the day.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.090
After the Jay Cooke bank fell, other banks
soon followed, as did over 89 of the nation’s

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.240
364 rail road companies. This had the net
effect of nearly 14% of the U.S.’s workforce

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.320
being out of work (compared to about 5.5%
today and as high as around 20%-23% during

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.230
the Great Depression). This all also saw real
estate values plummet, further intensifying

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.570
the problem. The New York stock market even
had to be closed for over a week during this

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.140
crisis (more on the Long Depression in a bit).
Amidst all this, Heinz Noble &amp; Company soon

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.760
found themselves overextended as the Long
Depression continued on. They ultimately went

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.180
bankrupt in 1875.
After the business went belly-up, Heinz didn’t

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.530
take long to rebound, founding the H.J. Heinz
Company just a year later in the midst of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.130
the Long Depression. His new company pretty
much did the same exact thing his old bankrupted

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.570
company did. This one worked out a bit better
than the first. Fast-forward about 137 years

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.350
and H. J. Heinz Company grosses around $10
billion per year with around 6000 products

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.170
and close to 33,000 employees.
Bonus Facts:

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.610
• Heinz was known for his eccentric advertising
campaigns, including: creating a six story

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.550
high electrically lit (which was a big deal
at the time) pickle in New York City at 23rd

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.360
and 5th Avenue. He later built a 70 foot tall
pickle at the end of a pier in Atlantic City.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.530
He even bought part of Lookout Mountain in
Tennessee with the idea of having an enormous

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.120
pickle carved into the mountain. In this case,
though, his attempt was thwarted due to public

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.970
outrage at him potentially desecrating a spot
which was, among other things, the sight of

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.480
a famous Civil War battle not too many years
before.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.859
• The actual Heinz 57 sauce was originally
named Beefsteak sauce and was first sold in

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.800
1911. Two years after its creation, they renamed
it Heinz 57 Beefsteak sauce. Fast-forward

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.300
27 years and they decide to rename it again,
this time to Heinz 57 sauce as it is today.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.569
However, in between then and now, they once
again decided to rename it in 1969 to Heinz

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.289
57 steak sauce. In 1987, they decided to drop
the “steak” and it has remained Heinz

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.520
57 Sauce since then.
• Heinz’ ketchup was introduce the same

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.860
year his new company was established, 1876.
At the time, fresh, ripe tomatoes were thought

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.139
by many to be bad for your health and even
poisonous (much like what happened when potatoes

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.340
were first introduced in Europe). Ketchup,
however, did not suffer as much from this

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.689
stigma due to being processed with spices
and vinegar. However, because ripe tomatoes

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.150
were still considered bad for you, often ketchups
of the day were extremely watery from lack

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.919
of pectin, due to the makers using unripe
tomatoes. Just 30 years after its launch,

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.129
Heinz was selling over 12 million bottles
of ketchup per year. Today, Heinz sells over

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:23.010
650 million bottles of ketchup annually, along
with 11 billion small packets of their ketchup.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:29.319
These ketchup sales earn them a gross of $1.5
billion per year.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.749
• Heinz recommends hitting the “57”
on the neck of Heinz 57 ketchup to get it

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:38.780
to poor faster. They claim they actually put
the 57 in that specific spot so you’ll know

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.340
exactly where to hit. In addition to that,
the exact speed the ketchup should flow out

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:50.310
of the bottle is 0.028 mph (.045 km/h), according
to Heinz. Heinz actually regulates this and

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.129
if they find a batch of their ketchup flows
such that the viscosity is greater than the

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.520
speed, the batch is thrown out. The reason
ketchup flows so unevenly (one minute not

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.569
at all, the next minute gobs coming out),
is that it is a pseudoplastic aka “shear

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.169
thinning substance”. Tapping the “57”
on the neck with two fingers will often do

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.110
a better job than shaking because the ketchup’s
resistance to flow (viscosity) decreases as

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.090
the shear rate increases. So by tapping it
at the blockage point, you increase the shear

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.069
rate, thereby, decreasing the viscosity, hence,
it flows. Shaking can have the same effect,

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:25.361
but according to Heinz won’t typically work
as well as the tapping the logo method. Other

00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:30.120
substances which exhibit this same shear thinning
effect include: lava; blood; nail polish;

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.199
and whipped cream. Today’s paints also are
designed to take advantage of this, so that

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.490
they can be easily rolled on, but once on
the wall with the shearing force removed,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.289
they resist dripping.
• It has been proposed that pizza be considered

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.029
a vegetable in the U.S. due to its tomato
sauce content (obviously this was heavily

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:51.759
lobbied by certain food companies that would
benefit from their product being considered

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:57.020
a vegetable). In 1982, a similar type proposal
also almost saw making ketchup count as a

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.520
vegetable. Ronald Reagan proposed to cut $1
billion from school lunch programs, while

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.059
still maintaining the necessary nutritional
elements of the school meals. In true political

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:09.849
fashion, rather than actually solving the
nutritional problem, it was suggested that

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:14.710
they simply reclassify ketchup and relish
as vegetables. This way, on paper, it would

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.210
look like they were serving a vegetable and
so they could cut out serving a real vegetable,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.870
without actually having to add any nutritional
item that the schools didn’t already serve.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.319
Needless to say, this didn’t go over too
well and the idea was eventually thrown out.

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.620
The school lunches cut proposal also didn’t
fare well in the minds of the public because,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.509
on the same day cuts were proposed by Reagan,
he had the White House curators buy over $200,000

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:44.869
(about $450,000 today) worth of new china
embossed with gold.

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:49.419
• Ketchup is actually graded into three
categories: Fancy, Extra Standard, and Standard.

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:53.349
In order to receive the classification of
“Fancy” ketchup, it must have a specific

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:59.759
gravity of at least 1.15 and a total amount
of solids equaling at or above 33%. What this

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:04.029
means in layman’s terms is the thicker the
ketchup (more tomato solids), the higher the

00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:08.919
quality rating is.
• Despite his first company going bankrupt

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:13.119
and Heinz not being obligated to pay many
of the debts the company held, he voluntarily

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:19.340
chose to do so anyways, as he felt morally
obligated, though this took some time.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.020
• The Long Depression started innocently
enough when Germany decided to get rid of

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.050
silver as the backing material for their money
in 1871. This decreased the value of silver

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.709
and particularly hurt certain U.S. businesses
who mined a significant amount of the world’s

00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:37.269
silver. The U.S. then decided to follow suit
and stop backing its money with gold and silver

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:42.390
and decided to just go with gold (as a part
of the Coinage Act of 1873). This even more

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:47.110
drastically killed the price of silver and
subsequently raised interest rates significantly.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.370
Businesses and farmers, who typically kept
a fair amount of debt at times, were caught

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.209
off guard by this sudden shift and rise of
interest rates. Investors then got in on the

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:59.519
panic and stopped wanting to invest in endeavors
that would tie up funds for long periods of

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:03.509
time, preferring to keep a lot of money on
hand. In modern times, the housing bubble

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:07.740
contributed to our “little depression”;
back then it was a giant railroading bubble

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.370
that burst around this same time as the silver
fiasco. This had a drastic effect on the nation

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.290
because railroad companies of the day were
(combined) the second largest employer in

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.500
the U.S. after agriculture. Finally, one of
the larger banks in the country, Jay Cooke

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.600
&amp; Company, went under in 1873 largely due
to being too heavily invested in railroads

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.910
and it was all downhill from there with bank
after bank suffering the same fate as Jay

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:44.779
Cooke &amp; Company. This first “Great Depression”
also hit most of Europe just as hard as the

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:49.129
U.S.
