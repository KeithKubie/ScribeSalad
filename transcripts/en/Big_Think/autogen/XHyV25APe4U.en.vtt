open up the animal at all you watch its
 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.479
open up the animal at all you watch its
behavior and you develop theoretical

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489
behavior and you develop theoretical
 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.020

from your theoretical models and then
 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.550

do experiments to see whether they're
true and that's a sort of classic

use some simple algebra to deduce
predictions from the model and then did

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
predictions from the model and then did
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.610
predictions from the model and then did

pretty much drinks it puts his bill into
into the water and then it kind of

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050
into the water and then it kind of
 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.840
into the water and then it kind of
scoops the water up in the bill and the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850
scoops the water up in the bill and the
 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.210

that's a very stereotyped movement we

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580
that's a very stereotyped movement we
 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.920
that's a very stereotyped movement we
filmed it

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930

we filmed chick chicks doing this and

we filmed chick chicks doing this and
 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.330
we filmed chick chicks doing this and
then we analyzed the the movement

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340
then we analyzed the the movement
 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.810
then we analyzed the the movement

frame by frame analysis so if you looked

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340
frame by frame analysis so if you looked
 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.430
frame by frame analysis so if you looked
at the frames of film you could actually

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440
at the frames of film you could actually
 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.200
at the frames of film you could actually
measure and we did this the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210
measure and we did this the
 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.710
measure and we did this the
predictability of each frame as a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720
predictability of each frame as a
