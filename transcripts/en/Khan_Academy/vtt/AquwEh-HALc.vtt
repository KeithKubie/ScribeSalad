00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.690
I'm Yuki, and I work as the
science content manager.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.840
I work on the videos,
exercises, and articles

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.320
in our sciences, so, biology,
chemistry, and physics.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.320
Failure is growth, I think is
a motto I've seen upstairs,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.500
but yeah, for me, growth mindset is really

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.490
all about embracing failure, and embracing

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.800
just trying things, even when you know

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.870
it's not gonna work the first time,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.500
and it might not even
work the second time,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.081
but you just keep
trying, and you might try

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:32.460
adapt a little bit until you feel like

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.062
you've really got it,
because you can do anything.

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:39.420
I, an example I might
give is in chemistry.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.760
So, that's where my background is,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.560
and that's arguably, my expertise.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.570
It is my expertise.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.420
But I wouldn't say that's something

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.540
that necessarily came that easily to me.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.010
I think it took me a really long time

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.530
to develop good study
habits, and one thing

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.380
that was really hard for
me, from the beginning,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.440
was like, speaking up when I needed help.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.210
And so I learned pretty late in college,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.250
that if I didn't get something,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.560
really, like, even though I might

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.710
feel like I was gonna look dumb,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.750
getting, letting a teacher or a T.A. know

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.117
right away that, "Hey, I don't get this.

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:14.650
"Can you explain this to me again?"

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.140
Very quickly, was important.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.560
So, going to office hours, really being

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.510
super vocal about when
I don't know something,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.300
so I could get help as soon as possible.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.560
And then, also, the other
thing I figured out was

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.670
the more practice I do on something,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.090
the better I'll get at it.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.980
So, even if I think I know something,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.720
if I can't actually show that on paper,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.640
that doesn't mean anything.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.240
So, trying to like, also,
get lots of repetition in

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.483
on things that I'm not
that confident about,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.350
to really highlight when
I don't know things,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.780
was something I learned
very late in college,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.330
but was super helpful to
me once I figured that out,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.230
not just in chemistry, but in general.
