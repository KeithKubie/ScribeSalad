00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.902
So, we've got the target and the bridge and the water command comes off the,

00:00:03.902 --> 00:00:11.866
the target command by just moving the target into the water. I can also ask

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:17.112
Callie to go target at a distance from me, that's something I call a remote

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:25.334
target. And it works just like my hand target does. Callie. Target. Hold. Where

00:00:25.334 --> 00:00:30.305
Callie will touch her nose to that spot. And part of the shaping of that

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:35.487
behavior, good. Is that we extend the target behavior out for longer and longer

00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:41.924
durations of time as Callie has had a chance to master the behavior. Good. Now,

00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:47.336
we can add, to create more complicated behaviors, we can add more target points

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:53.114
onto the animal's body. So, this is the flipper target, and I can use this

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:57.470
flipper target to examine Callie's flippers and her under surface to make sure

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.628
that there's no cuts or abrasions, or anything developing that we wouldn't

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:08.405
want to see. Good. We can create a target on any place of the animal's body

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:16.738
that we want. Good. And we have created even more complicated targets. Callie

00:01:16.738 --> 00:01:18.675
has a head target. Head.

00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:19.445
[LAUGH]

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:23.852
Good. That I've used to create other behaviors such as this one for example,

00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:29.852
which is called flexible. Good. So, this is the head target that I use and I

00:01:29.852 --> 00:01:35.700
moved closer and closer back. Good! To create this behavior which is now on

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.037
cue. Okay, this is a new behavior for Callie, she's just learning this

00:01:41.037 --> 00:01:48.628
behavior, and because of that, the target pole prop is still in there. Some of

00:01:48.628 --> 00:01:51.702
these other behaviors no longer has the target that used to create the

00:01:51.702 --> 00:02:00.587
behavior. So, just like my hand target, the target pole. The end of the target

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:05.134
pole is where Callie is going to put her nose. Wherever I put my target, Callie

00:02:05.134 --> 00:02:10.380
will put her nose. And with some practice and practicing the antecedent of the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.604
cue, or the command, prior to the behavioral sequence that I'm forming through

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:20.378
operand conditioning. I can eventually take the target pullout and she will do

00:02:20.378 --> 00:02:26.333
the behavior just on command because of the rehearsal history. In this case,

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:30.176
the behavior is not ready for the target pull to be removed yet .This is the

00:02:30.176 --> 00:02:37.337
back flip behavior for, which my program is famous. That is our logo. And this

00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:40.871
behavior is initially formed in the lower portions of the water, where the

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:46.369
animal has full control. And they learn to first do the back flip here. Good.

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:51.577
Then I use the target pole to lift the back flip up and hold it in position out

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:59.961
of the air like so after being preceded by the antecedent cue. Flip, good,

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:13.430
flip! Flip, good! And that's how you get a back flip. Good job. Way to go you!

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.959
Yeah! Good job!

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:17.743
[NOISE]

00:03:17.743 --> 00:03:27.081
Good. The benefits of animal training and husbandry, demonstrated live and in

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:32.928
person by Callie the sea lion.
