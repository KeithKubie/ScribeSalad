00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.520
These attacks can have serious negative effects,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.240
including theft of confidential information, unauthorized use

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.660
of network bandwidth or computing resources, the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.910
spread of false information, and the disruption of

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.850
legitimate services. All these types of attack

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.810
are related. They are all very dangerous

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.400
and sometimes they come hand in hand.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.450
For example, all these attacks are, in some

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.940
sense, related to one another. And, they can

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.390
come hand in hand with one another as well.
