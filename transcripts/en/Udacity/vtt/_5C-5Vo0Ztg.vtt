00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's go try them out.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This "put your finger on the state method" is actually pretty much how you do it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You start here in the start state, and then we see an a,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
so we move over here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We see a 1. We move over here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We're out of input in an accepting state. This totally works!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
How about 'aa'?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We start in state 1. We see an a. Great! We move to state 2.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We see the next a--oh! We fall off the finite state machine and die. No such luck.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
'2b'--we start here in state 1. We see a 2. We immediately fall off and die. Not very good.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The empty string--we start in state 1. We don't go anywhere because we're out of input.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But state 1 is not an accepting state, so we don't accept this string.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
'cc3'--start here in state 1. We see a c. We go to state 2. We see another c. We fall off.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
'44d'--we start here in state 1. We see a 4. We fall off immediately.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.481
In fact, only 'a1' matched out of all of these.
