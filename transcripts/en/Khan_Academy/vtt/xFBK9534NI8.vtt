00:00:00.598 --> 00:00:04.622
- [Voiceover] As we exit
1917 and enter into 1918,

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:08.848
we're getting into the
final stages of World War I.

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:10.859
And let's just give ourselves
a little bit of review,

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.809
a little bit of background,
a little bit of context.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.123
The war started off as

00:00:14.123 --> 00:00:15.967
a two-front war for the Central Powers.

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:17.811
You have the Western Front,

00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:20.739
you have the Western
Front right over here,

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.283
and you had the huge,

00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:26.254
you had the huge Eastern
Front right over here.

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:29.991
By 1917, the major conflict
on the Eastern Front,

00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:33.159
especially with Russia, which
was the major power there,

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:34.637
had come to an end.

00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:36.910
You had a February Revolution in Russia.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.383
The czar had to abdicate the throne.

00:00:39.383 --> 00:00:41.453
You had a provisional government.

00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:43.889
Then in November of 1917,

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:46.689
the Bolsheviks have a
coup, they take over.

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:48.958
They have no interest in
prosecuting World War I,

00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.480
because they have their own
civil war to worry about,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.726
so they sign an armistice
with the Central Powers,

00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:57.309
by the end of 1917.

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:00.863
And then we get into 1918,

00:01:00.863 --> 00:01:02.289
just let me write all this down,

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.530
so by the time we get into 1918,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.542
they're ready to sign a treaty in March,

00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:11.046
in March, the Russians sign

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:13.931
the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,

00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:14.764
Litovsk,

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.728
which cedes over all of this
territory to the Germans

00:01:18.728 --> 00:01:21.615
and takes the Russians out of World War I.

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:23.650
So I'm not gonna, I've gone
into detail in other videos,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.235
but a huge amount of territory,

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:27.549
and I'm gonna do it very
informally right over here.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.869
I'll give a rough sense of
where that territory was.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.691
And the treaty itself,
its main significance,

00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:35.323
'cause the treaty didn't last,

00:01:35.323 --> 00:01:36.867
as you might already know,

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:38.940
the Central Powers lost World War I,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.054
so that treaty was later nullified.

00:01:41.054 --> 00:01:43.904
But the key importance of that treaty,

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:45.926
is one, it took Russia out of the war,

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:48.069
it allowed the Central
Powers, especially Germany,

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.897
to focus on the Western Front.

00:01:49.897 --> 00:01:51.052
But the other element of it is,

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:53.694
by giving so much
territory to the Germans,

00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:56.982
the Germans couldn't just
leave that territory as is.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:58.494
If they wanted any claims to it,

00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:01.206
they had to devote some
of their troops to occupy,

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:04.087
or at least attempt to occupy some of it.

00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:05.958
So even though it was a huge opportunity,

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.235
and the Germans were able
to, after the treaty,

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:10.963
or even before the treaty,
after the armistice,

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:13.891
they were able to start bringing many more

00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:17.178
of the Eastern-Front troops
over to the Western Front.

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.246
They didn't bring over as
many as they could have,

00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:22.130
because they left some
to attempt to occupy

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.933
some of the territory that had been gained

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:26.920
on the Eastern Front.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.150
But if you view things
from a German perspective,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.305
at this point, March 1918,

00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:33.256
you're gonna be feeling pretty good.

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:36.546
You are holding your own
in a two-front war now,

00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:39.004
and at one point you thought Russia

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:40.889
was the major threat there.

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.554
That threat is gone, you can
now focus on a one-front war,

00:02:43.554 --> 00:02:45.980
maybe you should be able to kind of

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.968
put the decisive blow
against the allies now.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.004
And that is how the Germans felt.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.558
But they were worried
about a couple of things.

00:02:53.558 --> 00:02:57.091
They were worried about the
British industrial capacity,

00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:58.884
and the Allied industrial capacity,

00:02:58.884 --> 00:03:02.670
that was stronger than the Central Powers,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.358
and so the British
could produce more tanks

00:03:05.358 --> 00:03:06.906
and more guns and more weapons,

00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:08.367
so it was a race against that,

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:09.749
and there was also a race against

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.412
significant American entry.

00:03:11.412 --> 00:03:13.486
Remember, April 1917,

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:16.125
Woodrow Wilson gives a speech to Congress,

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:19.423
they declare war on the Central Powers,

00:03:19.423 --> 00:03:22.761
and so the Germans wanna
get this thing over with

00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:24.630
before the Americans have a chance

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.762
to send in significant
number of fresh troops.

00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:30.441
So in March 1918, not only do you have

00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:32.026
the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:35.309
you also have the beginning
of Germany's attempt

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:38.765
to deal that decisive blow to the Allies,

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:41.405
and it's known as the Spring Offensive.

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:45.155
So you have the Spring,
the Spring Offensive.

00:03:46.848 --> 00:03:49.572
And the goal of the Spring Offensive

00:03:49.572 --> 00:03:53.312
was to essentially try to
end the war for the Germans.

00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:55.741
And the goal was to separate

00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:57.943
the British from the French forces.

00:03:57.943 --> 00:03:59.854
The British, for the most
part, were in control

00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:02.822
of the line right over here,
north of the Salm River,

00:04:02.822 --> 00:04:05.182
while the French were
in control south of it.

00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:07.253
So the Spring Offensive,
especially the first phases

00:04:07.253 --> 00:04:09.613
of the Spring Offensive, in March 1918,

00:04:09.613 --> 00:04:13.272
focused on this area, right over here.

00:04:13.272 --> 00:04:14.979
And at first it was
actually very successful.

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.781
They were able to make
huge territorial gains,

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:19.406
drive through the lines,

00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:21.969
drive the Allied Powers back.

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.922
Now, the problem was is that it wasn't

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:25.588
a real big strategic gain.

00:04:25.588 --> 00:04:28.353
The Germans were just hoping
it would be such a demoralizer,

00:04:28.353 --> 00:04:29.667
that it would throw at least,

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:31.317
maybe the French out of the war,

00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:32.840
and then maybe they could
take care of the British

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.361
or whatever else, but that didn't happen,

00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:36.905
and all of a sudden they found themselves

00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:38.897
with these huge territorial gains,

00:04:38.897 --> 00:04:40.649
in very short amount of time,

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:42.316
they had to supply themselves,

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:44.183
and they didn't really quite,

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:46.294
and they had spread their troops thin,

00:04:46.294 --> 00:04:49.668
and so it frankly just
let the opportunity arise

00:04:49.668 --> 00:04:51.990
for the Allies, in August,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.984
to lead a counteroffensive.

00:04:53.984 --> 00:04:56.873
And this counteroffensive by the Allies,

00:04:56.873 --> 00:04:58.825
is referred to as the 100 Days Offensive.

00:04:58.825 --> 00:05:01.149
It began in August, went
roughly into November,

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:03.816
so 100 Days, 100 Days Offensive,

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:09.203
during which the Allies,
between August and November,

00:05:09.203 --> 00:05:11.687
were able to push the
Germans, not only back

00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:14.167
beyond what they had captured
during the Spring Offensive,

00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:17.826
but all the way well back of the front

00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:19.979
that was kind of the stalemate line

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.720
for most of World War I.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.751
And it was during this 100 Days Offensive,

00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:25.336
that to most objective observers,

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:29.002
it was clear that the
Allies would win this war.

00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:31.520
And it was clear to several
of the Central Powers,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.881
or those Allied with the Central Powers.

00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:36.606
As we go into September,

00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:40.071
as we go into September of 1918,

00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:43.158
Bulgaria drops itself out of the war,

00:05:43.158 --> 00:05:46.127
just to remind ourselves where,
what we're talking about.

00:05:46.127 --> 00:05:49.537
So you have Bulgaria right over here.

00:05:49.537 --> 00:05:51.859
It, Bulgaria, right over here.

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:54.826
It signs an armistice with the Allies,

00:05:54.826 --> 00:05:58.158
so, let me just, you have armistice,

00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:00.353
I'll use a little peace
symbol for armistice,

00:06:00.353 --> 00:06:02.716
that's a, armistice is just
the fighting has stopped,

00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:05.312
you still, in theory,
could be at a state of war,

00:06:05.312 --> 00:06:07.472
so maybe I shouldn't do the peace symbol,

00:06:07.472 --> 00:06:09.623
I'll just write armistice.

00:06:09.623 --> 00:06:12.623
Armistice, Armistice, with Bulgaria.

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:17.431
And this is really starting
to tighten the noose

00:06:17.431 --> 00:06:19.702
around the remaining Central Powers,

00:06:19.702 --> 00:06:23.681
because this allowed the
Allies to gain control

00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:26.491
of Serbia and of Greece,

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:30.559
which essentially tied,
removed the last source of food

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:33.366
for Austria, Hungary
and the German Empire.

00:06:33.366 --> 00:06:35.239
There was already a blockade,

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:37.069
the kind of the harsh, British blockade

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:39.388
that we've already talked
about, up in the North Sea,

00:06:39.388 --> 00:06:41.374
and so their last source
of food was from the south,

00:06:41.374 --> 00:06:44.262
but now with Bulgaria
signing an armistice,

00:06:44.262 --> 00:06:46.253
and ceding over territory,

00:06:46.253 --> 00:06:49.137
now the strangle hold was really,

00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:52.014
was really, really coming into effect.

00:06:52.014 --> 00:06:53.926
Now, by October, and remember,

00:06:53.926 --> 00:06:56.366
at this point it was reasonably clear,

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:59.373
and even by this point, even
clear to the German people

00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:01.241
that the war is pretty much done for,

00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:03.242
and they're just waiting for their leaders

00:07:03.242 --> 00:07:04.909
to make it official.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:09.496
So several of the leaders
of the German Navy

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:11.362
wanted to do this last-ditch,

00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:13.474
what could easily be considered suicidal,

00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:16.107
offensive against the British Navy,

00:07:16.107 --> 00:07:19.165
and as they're planning it and
the sailors catch wind of it,

00:07:19.165 --> 00:07:20.791
they mutiny, they revolt.

00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:22.175
They say hey, look, the war is over.

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:25.660
We're not gonna die in a futile attempt

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.522
to just kind of, for
pride or whatever else,

00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:31.114
and so you have a naval mutiny begins.

00:07:31.114 --> 00:07:35.423
Naval mutiny, and eventually
this spreads to the mainland

00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:38.067
and leads to revolts and revolutions,

00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:41.150
so revolution in Germany, in Germany.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.254
And this culminates in
November, in November,

00:07:47.254 --> 00:07:49.247
November 9th, famous date in history,

00:07:49.247 --> 00:07:50.830
November 9th, 1918.

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:55.310
You essentially, Kaiser Wilhelm II,

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.197
right over here, let me make
sure you see his picture,

00:07:58.197 --> 00:08:02.342
this is him right over
here, Kaiser Wilhelm II,

00:08:02.342 --> 00:08:04.947
is forced to abdicate, give up his throne.

00:08:04.947 --> 00:08:07.103
He flees to the Netherlands,

00:08:07.103 --> 00:08:09.555
and on November 9th, 1918,

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:11.587
Germany is declared a republic.

00:08:11.587 --> 00:08:15.754
So Germany no longer has a
king or emperor in charge.

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:20.548
Germany becomes a republic.

00:08:22.157 --> 00:08:24.434
And a little bit before
this, November 3rd,

00:08:24.434 --> 00:08:27.766
the writing was already
clear to the Austrians,

00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:29.754
in fact, they even, in 1917,

00:08:29.754 --> 00:08:31.911
attempted to make some peace overtures,

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:33.982
thinking that they were
pretty much done for,

00:08:33.982 --> 00:08:36.748
but by November 3rd, 1918,

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:39.634
the Austrians also signed an armistice,

00:08:39.634 --> 00:08:41.384
armistice, armistice,

00:08:43.245 --> 00:08:46.495
with the Austrians, with the Austrians,

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:52.631
and with the Kaiser Wilhelm
II fleeing to the Netherlands,

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:54.540
Germany becoming a republic,

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.159
this sets up the armistice,
finally, with Germany

00:08:58.159 --> 00:08:59.576
on November 11th,

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:03.804
and this is one of the most
famous dates in history,

00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:06.799
known for a long time in
the US as Armistice Day,

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:10.378
and so it was November 11th, 1918,

00:09:10.378 --> 00:09:13.103
and it was actually 11am, 11am,

00:09:13.103 --> 00:09:14.687
so you might remember the famous,

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:18.432
the 11th hour of the 11th
day of the 11th month,

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:22.863
war, or World War I, or the
fighting in World War I,

00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:25.593
was over with the Allies victorious,

00:09:25.593 --> 00:09:27.423
and the Central Powers losing it,

00:09:27.423 --> 00:09:30.630
and the terms of what would
happen for those that lost

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.071
and those that won would be dictated

00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:34.941
by the Treaty of Versailles.

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:37.748
The Treaty of Versailles in 1919.

00:09:37.748 --> 00:09:39.654
The terms of which were finally finalized

00:09:39.654 --> 00:09:41.603
about six months later.

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:44.813
So this is June, you have the treaty,

00:09:44.813 --> 00:09:48.396
Treaty of, Treaty of,
Treaty of Versailles.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.927
Which, incidentally,
this is like one of those

00:09:51.927 --> 00:09:53.148
little footnotes in history,

00:09:53.148 --> 00:09:55.338
the Americans did not actually ratify it,

00:09:55.338 --> 00:09:57.736
mainly because it had the
League of Nations in it,

00:09:57.736 --> 00:10:00.787
which was this project of Woodrow Wilson,

00:10:00.787 --> 00:10:03.150
but the American people
and the American Congress

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.276
was not a fan of this whole
trans-national government,

00:10:06.276 --> 00:10:07.742
League of Nations thing,

00:10:07.742 --> 00:10:10.952
so the United States did not
ratify the Treaty of Versailles

00:10:10.952 --> 00:10:14.766
but in effect, on Armistice
Day, November 11th, 11am,

00:10:14.766 --> 00:10:17.817
the war was over, Treaty of
Versailles dictated the terms,

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:20.948
many would argue, overly-harsh terms,

00:10:20.948 --> 00:10:22.530
of the Treaty of Versailles,

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.728
and we're done with World War I.
