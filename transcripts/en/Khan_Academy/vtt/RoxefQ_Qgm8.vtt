00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:02.694
- [Voiceover] Let G of X equal
one fourth X to the fourth,

00:00:02.694 --> 00:00:05.991
minus four X to the third
power, plus 24 X squared.

00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:09.589
For what values of X does the graph of G

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.013
have an inflection point?

00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:13.776
Or have a point of inflection?

00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:15.275
So let's just remind ourselves

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:17.451
what a point of inflection is.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:21.718
A point of inflection is
where we go from being con,

00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:23.284
where we change our concavity.

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.549
Or you can say where our second derivative

00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:28.279
G prime of X switches signs.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.362
Switches, switches signs.

00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:33.722
So let's study our second derivative.

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:35.143
In order to study or
secondary, let's find it.

00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:38.893
So we know that G of X
is equal to one fourth

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:45.332
X to the fourth, minus
four X to the third power,

00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:46.832
plus 24 X squared.

00:00:47.758 --> 00:00:51.638
So given that, let's
now find G prime of X.

00:00:51.638 --> 00:00:53.869
G prime of X is going to be equal to,

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.908
I'm just going to apply the
power rule multiple times.

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:57.920
Four times one fourth is just one.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.206
I'm not going to write that one down,

00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:04.154
it's going to be one times X
to the four minus one power.

00:01:04.154 --> 00:01:06.379
So four to the third power,

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:08.796
minus three times four is 12,

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:12.704
X to three minus one power,

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:16.454
X to the second power,
plus two times 24, 48.

00:01:19.624 --> 00:01:22.239
X to the two minus one,
or X to the first power,

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:24.259
I can just write that as X.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.216
So there you have it.

00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:26.133
I have our first derivative,

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.485
now we want to find our second derivative.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:29.584
G prime prime of X is just the derivative

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:31.330
of the first derivative
of the first derivative

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.392
with respect to X, and some
more of the power rule,

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.559
three X squared minus 24 X

00:01:41.717 --> 00:01:45.258
to the first, or just 24 X, plus 48.

00:01:45.258 --> 00:01:49.544
So let's think about where
this switch is signed.

00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:51.529
And this is, this is
a continuous function,

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:53.577
is going to be defined for all Xs,

00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:55.226
so the only potential candidates

00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:57.113
of where it could switch signs

00:01:57.113 --> 00:01:59.586
are when this thing equals zero.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:02.193
So let's see where it equals zero.

00:02:02.193 --> 00:02:04.303
So let's set that equal to zero.

00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:07.136
Three X squared minus 24 X plus 48

00:02:08.113 --> 00:02:10.945
is equal to zero, let's see,

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:12.259
everything is divisible by three

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:13.659
so let's divide everything by three.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.655
So you get X squared minus eight X,

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:19.488
plus 16, plus 16 is equal to zero.

00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:26.343
And let's see, can I factor this?

00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:28.838
Yeah, this would be X minus
four X times X minus 4.

00:02:28.838 --> 00:02:32.780
Or just you do this as
X minus four squared

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.496
is equal to zero, or X
minus four is equal to zero.

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:39.746
So, or where X equals four.

00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:44.456
So G prime prime of four is equal to zero.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:47.227
So let's see what's happening
on either side of that.

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:49.175
Let's see if G, if we're actually,

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.648
if we're actually switching signs or not.

00:02:51.648 --> 00:02:53.772
So let me draw a number line here.

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:56.939
And so this is, so this is two, three,

00:02:59.724 --> 00:03:02.641
four, five, and I could keep going.

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.422
And so we know that something interesting

00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:08.097
is happening right over here,

00:03:08.097 --> 00:03:10.090
G prime prime of four is equal to zero,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.096
G prime prime of four is equal to zero.

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:15.901
So let's think about what
the second derivative is

00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:17.672
when we are less than four.

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:21.612
And so, actually let me just
try G prime prime of zero,

00:03:21.612 --> 00:03:23.407
since that will be easy to evaluate.

00:03:23.407 --> 00:03:25.202
G prime prime of zero,

00:03:25.202 --> 00:03:27.750
well it's just going to be equal to 48.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.291
So when we are less than four,

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:33.568
our second derivative, G
prime, the second derivative,

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:35.318
is greater than zero.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.131
So we're actually going
to be concave upwards

00:03:40.131 --> 00:03:44.061
over this interval to the left of four.

00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:46.717
Now let's think about
to the right of four.

00:03:46.717 --> 00:03:49.572
Two, use a different color.

00:03:49.572 --> 00:03:52.496
So what about to the right of four?

00:03:52.496 --> 00:03:54.604
And so let me just evaluate,

00:03:54.604 --> 00:03:56.123
what would be the easy thing to evaluate?

00:03:56.123 --> 00:03:59.240
Well I could evaluate G prime,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.573
why not do, or of the second derivative,

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:05.783
G prime prime, I should say, of 10?

00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:08.924
So, G, I'll do it right over here,

00:04:08.924 --> 00:04:10.242
Let me do it, well,

00:04:10.242 --> 00:04:12.767
I'm running a little bit of
space, so I'll just scroll down.

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:16.955
So G prime prime of 10 is going
to be equal to three times

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:20.455
10 squared, so it's 300 minus 24 times 10.

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:24.238
So minus 240, plus 48.

00:04:24.238 --> 00:04:26.579
So let's see, this is 60.

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:29.912
This is, so 300 minus 240 is 60 plus 48,

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:33.824
so this is equal to 108.

00:04:33.824 --> 00:04:35.655
So it still positive.

00:04:35.655 --> 00:04:40.135
So on either side of
four, G prime prime of X

00:04:40.135 --> 00:04:42.453
is greater than zero.

00:04:42.453 --> 00:04:44.591
So even though even though
the second derivative

00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:48.130
at X equals four is equal to zero,

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.331
on either side we are concave upwards.

00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:53.667
On either side, the second
derivative is positive.

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:57.153
And so, and that was the
only potential candidate.

00:04:57.153 --> 00:05:00.502
So there are no, there are no values of X

00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:04.121
for which G has a point of inflection.

00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:05.987
X equals four would have been a value of X

00:05:05.987 --> 00:05:07.449
at which G had a point of inflection,

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.396
if we switch, if the secondary derivative

00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:11.919
switched signs here, if it
went from positive to negative,

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:12.957
or negative to positive,

00:05:12.957 --> 00:05:16.107
but it's just staying
from positive to positive.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.869
So this second derivative was positive,

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:19.122
it just touches zero right here,

00:05:19.122 --> 00:05:20.587
and then it goes positive again.

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:22.342
So we're going back to the question,

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:24.505
for what X values does the graph of G

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:25.798
have a point of inflection?

00:05:25.798 --> 00:05:26.798
No X values.

00:05:28.698 --> 00:05:32.865
I'll put an exclamation
mark there just more drama.
