00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.509
Here are 5 cool experiments, you can try at
home, part 1.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.040
Look what you can do with a bit of water,
and an empty glass bottle. If we put this

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.240
in the microwave on high power for 1 minute
and 30 seconds, the water starts vaporizing

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.289
into steam. And of course that means the bottle’s
going to get really really hot. So before

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.180
we touch it, we’ll need some insulated oven
mitts. Now what do you think will happen if

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.500
we turn the bottle upside, down and dip it
in a bath of cold water? The water gets sucked

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.670
up with a tremendous amount of force. Which,
apparently can fill the bottle in less than

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.680
a second. This works because steam takes up
a lot more space than water, so when it rapidly

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.360
contracts inside the bottle, the outside air
pressure forces the water in to fill the void,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.420
until the pressures equalize. Did you know
you can turn a stack of pennies into a battery,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.030
that will light LEDs and power a calculator?
If we use sand paper to shave off one side

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.260
of the pennies, we end up with bi-metallic
discs that are copper on one side, and zinc

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.629
on the other. Try stacking the pennies 10
high so they’re all facing the same direction,

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.079
then place pieces of cardboard, soaked in
vinegar, between each coin. This makes an

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.860
improvised 6 volt battery with just enough
power to light a couple of LEDs. The copper

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.810
top is the positive, the zinc is the negative,
and surprisingly, 3 pennies is all it takes

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.860
to power a small calculator like this. That’s
the power in your pocket change. This slick

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.780
little trick is good to know, if “urine”
trouble. It might sound weird, but there is

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.170
a way you can start a fire with your pee.
Pour some of the yellow liquid into a clear

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.720
plastic bag or plastic wrap, then collect
the corners together and twist it around until

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.400
it bulges out to form a liquid sphere. Now
you can focus the sunlight, and start burning

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.909
dark paper or fine tinder just like you would
with a magnifying glass. Nurse the embers

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.100
into a flame with the help of some kindling,
and you’ve just started a fire with your

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.420
pee. Did you know you can turn a hunk of butter,
into a candle? Start by cutting a block of

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.810
butter in half, then roll up a bit of tissue
paper to make an improvised wick. Push the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.390
wick into the butter and light it, and incredibly,
the butter burns just like a candle. Each

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.040
half gives up to 4 hours of light, so try
it for yourself and see if anyone else finds

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.030
your experiment, enlightening. If you promise
to be careful, you can make a mini pyrotechnic

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.709
display with some cheap disposable lighters.
By hacking into the valve tensioner, and adjusting

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.480
it counter-clockwise 2-3 times, we can get
it to shoot a flame up to 12 inches long!

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.999
It’s a micro handheld flamethrower that
shoots clean-burning gas. Just don’t run

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.599
it very long or it might catch the casing
on fire and blow up. You can also try wrapping

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.090
the spring around the flint to make a tiny
flint bomb. Hold it in an open flame until

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.659
it starts glowing red-hot, then throw it on
the concrete, far away from anything that

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.159
could catch on fire.  Well there are 5 cool

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.989
experiments you can try at home. Just make
sure to use common sense and try not to get

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.370
anyone hurt in the process. That’s it for
now. If you liked these experiments, perhaps

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.699
you’ll like some of my others. Check them

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:53.129
I saved the best project for last. Hey guys.
One of the best projects you can invest in,

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.629
is yourself. And you’ll get the best results
by using the best tools. This week I’ve

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.709
been reading this book called the success
principles by Jack Canfield, and it’s basically

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.930
an instruction book that will show you step

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.709
to where you want to be, and show you how
to make it happen. And because you’re supporting
