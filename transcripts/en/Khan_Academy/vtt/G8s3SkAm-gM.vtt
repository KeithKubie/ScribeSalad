00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.310
We're on problem 12.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.140
0.1 plus 0.1 squared plus
0.1 to the third.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.340
So that's the same
thing as 0.1.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.129
What's 0.1 squared?

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.070
It's 1 times 1 with 2 numbers
to the right of the decimal,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.440
so it's 0.01.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.920
And then to the third power.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.000
You're just going to end
up 1/10 of that, right?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.790
0.01 times 0.1.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.510
Well that's 1 with 3 numbers
to the right

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.270
of the decimal point.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.580
If I'm going to add them
all up, I get 1, 1, 1.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.380
And that is answer B.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
They're making sure you can
multiply your decimals.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.980
Problem 13.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.380
If you have trouble with
decimals, you might want to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.540
get on the Kahn Academy-- the
actual application, it's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.890
free-- and just work through the
basic arithmetic, because

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.400
we have actually a bunch of
things on multiplying

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.930
decimals and stuff.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.620
You have to start at 1 plus 1,
but it makes sure you don't

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.890
have any holes in
your knowledge.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160
It eventually gets to algebra
and trigonometry and calculus.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.470
You might find that useful.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.220
Anyway, question 13.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.020
A carpenter constructed a
rectangular sandbox with a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.790
capacity of 10 cubic feet.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.590
If the carpenter were to make a
similar box twice as long--

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.090
2 times length-- twice as wide--
2 times width-- and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.290
twice as high as the first
sandbox, what would be the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.320
capacity in cubic feet of
the second sandbox?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.080
So you might want to visualize
it, right?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.990
The best way to visualize it
is probably how many of the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.940
old ones could fit?

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.830
So if this was one of the old
ones, and now I'm going to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.300
make a new one that's
2 times the size in

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.610
every dimension, right?

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.600
That's 2 times the height.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.410
So essentially, I could increase
the width by 2.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.580
Increase the depth by 2, or
whatever you want to call it.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.830
Right?

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.330
And then I'm going to increase
the height by 2.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.680
And I'm going to have
trouble drawing.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.990
So how many of the original
sandboxes-- that's what they

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.900
want to know-- how many of the
original sandboxes essentially

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.390
could fit into the new one?

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.490
Well, 2 in 1 direction
times 2 times 2.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.160
So 2 times 2 times
2 is equal to 8.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.650
So another way to think of it,
you could view the old sandbox

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.030
as almost a unit, like one
cubic unit sandbox.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.500
And now we're going to go
2 in every direction.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.330
So we could fit 8 of the old
sandboxes into the new one.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.030
And the old one had
a capacity of 10.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.120
So 8 times that is equal to 80
cubic feet, which is choice D.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.010
Question 14.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.530
And these, at least so far,
I think these are

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.500
on the easier end.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.980
They'll probably get harder,
but so far they're a lot

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.040
faster than the data
sufficiency ones.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.610
Which of the following cannot
be a value of 1

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.570
over x minus 1?

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.730
And I think this is one of the
ones where we have to look at

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.700
the choices.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.910
1.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.630
Negative 1.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.060
So can we pick x so this
is negative 1?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.570
Well sure, if x is equal to 0,
1 divided by negative 1 is

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.220
negative 1.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.830
So it's not negative 1 because
that can be a value for that.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.170
0.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.390
Well, this is interesting.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.510
How can we ever make
this equal to 0?

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.010
The only way we can get this
close to 0 is if the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.700
denominator becomes a really
huge number, right?

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.290
But it'll never be equal to 0.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.000
It'll just be a really, really,
really small fraction.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.800
This approaches 0 as x
approaches infinity.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.440
But this will never equal 0.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.335
So the answer is B.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.650
All of the other things are
completely possible.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.706
You just have to realize, you
should just see choice B, and

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:49.770
is like, how could this
ever equal 0?

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.170
Because the numerator
is never equaling 0.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.530
This can only approach 0 if the
denominator gets really,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.260
really, really big.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.590
It will just become a really
small fraction.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.160
But it'll never, ever equal 0.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.970
And you could even try.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.490
1 over x minus 1
is equal to 0.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.470
You can try to solve it.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.450
If you multiply both sides
by x minus 1, you get

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.390
1 is equal to 0.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.130
It's impossible.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.920
Undefined.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.529
15.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.660
A bakery opened yesterday
with a daily

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.820
supply of 40 dozen rolls.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.040
Half of the rolls were
sold by noon.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.020
1/2 by noon.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.630
And 80% of the remaining rolls
were sold between noon and

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.880
closing time.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.370
80% remaining, noon
and closing.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.840
How many dozen rolls had not
been sold when the bakery

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.050
closed yesterday?

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.090
OK, half sold by noon.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.420
So 20 sold by noon.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.370
And 20 left.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.960
Right?

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.470
And they said 80% of the
remaining rolls were sold

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.070
between noon and closing time.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.690
So we could view it two ways.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.320
If you wanted to do it really
fast, you're like, OK, 20% of

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.860
the remaining rolls
will not be sold.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.470
Right?

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.340
So you could say 20% of the
remaining rolls-- so times

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.500
20-- don't get sold, right?

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.770
If 80% get sold, 20%
don't get sold.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.010
And that equals what?

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.360
We could say 20 times
20 is 400.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.150
Two spaces behind the
decimal point.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.580
And that makes sense.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.585
20% is 1/5.

00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:36.140
So 1/5 of 20 is 4.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.670
So 4 rolls don't get sold
when it closed.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.770
You could do it the
other way around.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.360
You could say, OK, how many sold
between, at this time,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.290
80% of 20 is 16 more sell.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.970
16 sell.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.900
And then you can say, OK, how
many total were sold?

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.830
Well, 20 plus 16, 36.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.910
And then 40 minus
36 is also 4.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.240
It takes a little bit more
time, but it gets

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.080
you the same answer.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.490
Eventually time is what you'll
have to focus on.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.740
Once you are confident
that you can get

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.240
every problem right.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.710
What is the combined area in
square inches of the front and

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:16.330
back of a rectangular sheet of
paper measuring 8.5 by 11?

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.910
So it's essentially going to
be 2 times 8.5 times 11.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.440
If you just multiplied 8.5 times
11, that would give you

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.720
the area of one side.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.880
So we want the area
of both sides.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.390
It's going to be 2 times that.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.680
And I want to do this first,
just so I can get rid of this

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.400
mixed number.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.180
So 8.5 times 2.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.180
That's 17, times 11, which
is going to be what?

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.550
17 times 11 is 170.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.080
Because that's 17 times
10, plus 17.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.850
So that's 187.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.100
That's choice E.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.520
Let's do problem 17.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.280
150 is what percent of 30?

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:05.860
So 150 is equal to x percent
of 30 times 30.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.360
Or another way we could write
that is-- well, let me just

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.330
write it as a variable.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.700
Let's figure it out
as a decimal.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.450
And then once you know
a decmial, it's

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.630
easy to convert that.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:20.150
So 150 is equal to
x of 36 or 36x.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.490
This is some number times 36.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.820
Divide both sides by 36.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.200
You get x is equal to 150/36.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.390
Let's see, I think we can divide
the top and the bottom.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.830
Definitely we can divide
them by 6.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.640
6 goes into 150 25 times.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.810
And it goes into 36 6 times.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.170
Right?

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.490
Oh wait, what am I doing?

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.900
It's 30.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.390
My own handwriting
got me caught up.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.540
This is a much easier problem
than what I was doing.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.080
They're saying 150 is what
percent of 30, right?

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.910
So it's x times 30.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:01.510
This is easy.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.940
You divide both sides by 30.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.750
I mistakenly wrote 36 there.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.540
Divide both sides by 30, you
get 5 is equal to x, right?

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.440
If you wanted to write 5 as a
percentage, you just multiply

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.810
both sides by 100.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.440
So you could say x
is equal to 500%.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.520
And that makes sense.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.990
150 is 5 times 30.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.450
100% of 30 is 30.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.370
200% of 30 is 60.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:24.960
And so forth.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.390
So 500% of 30 is 150.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.280
That took me too long I think.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.640
E.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.730
Got to make sure your
handwriting is good.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.490
Next question.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.570
18.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:45.890
The ratio 2:1/3 is equal to--
Well, 2 divided by 1/3 is

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.570
equal to 2 times 3/1, which
is equal to 6/1.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.700
So 2:1/3 is the same thing
as the ratio of 6:1,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.490
which is choice A.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:08:59.840
Right?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.880
2:1/3 is equal to 6:1.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.750
Another way to think about
it is 2 is 6 times 1/3.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.760
And 6 is 6 times 1.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.380
Same thing.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.000
So 18 is A.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.620
Next question.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.990
19.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:21.830
Running at the same constant
rate, 6 identical machines can

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.173
produce a total of 270
bottles per minute.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.400
At this rate, how many bottles
could 10 such machines produce

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.230
in 4 minutes?

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.500
OK, so how much does each
produce per minute?

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:49.200
So 1 machine will produce
270 divided by

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.330
6 bottles per minute.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.310
Right?

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.500
That's one machine.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.070
I just divided both
sides by 6.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.800
6 machines produce that.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.060
So 10 machines would produce 10
times as many per minute.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.990
So 10 times this is
2,700 divided by

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.360
6 bottles per minute.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.180
And if they want to know how
much 10 machines are going to

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.420
produce in 4 minutes, you just
multiply this times 4.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.800
So this is how much they produce
in 1 minute, so the

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:27.870
answer's going to be 2,700
times 4 divided by 6.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.240
So let me see if I can do
this math fast. So 6 is

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.130
equal to 2 times 3.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:40.610
If you divide 2,700
by 3, that's 900.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.990
And 3 divided by 3 is 1.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.450
And then 4 divided by 2 is 2.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.360
So 900 times 2 is
equal to 1,800.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.730
And that is choice B.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.820
And I'm all out of time.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.580
See you in the next video.
