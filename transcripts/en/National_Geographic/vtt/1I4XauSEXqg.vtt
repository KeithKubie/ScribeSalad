00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:04.371
( intro music )

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:16.416
Man 1:
Come explore with us!

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.391
Man 2: I am like
trembling right now!

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.559
Voiceover: I have the
coolest job in the world.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.831
Now we're building
things to understand more

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.433
about the world around us.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.141
Woman 1: I love this!

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.015
Man 3: That was insane.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.116
( cry of joy )

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.087
Voiceover: We found eight
new species of fish.

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.289
Man 4: Look.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.825
Man 5: This is what we lost.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:01.660
Woman 2: It turns out

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.363
people really don't believe
we can do this.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.610
Voiceover: That's awesome,
that's why I do what I do.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:28.854
( applause )

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:32.024 line:0%
Boyd: And why don't we begin

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.726 line:0%
with our Explorer-in-Residence.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.829
We'll begin with Enric.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:36.729
Enric: Great!

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.666
I'm going to tell you
a little story now.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:43.169 line:0%
When I was a kid growing up on
the Mediterranean coast of Spain

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.871 line:0%
I was completely
fascinated by the documentaries

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.207 line:0%
that Jacques Cousteau
showed us on TV.

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:49.943
Now, that was in the 70s
and he showed us

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:54.246
these amazing coral reefs
lots of sharks, whales,

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.149
sea lions, it was so fantastic.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.688
But when I was
swimming in the ocean,

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.456
when I was diving, when
I was later the professor

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:06.626
at the University of California,

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.061
this what I saw.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.497
Those coral reefs that
he showed us were gone.

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:14.934
Places that I loved were less
and less alive over time.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.436
So I was studying human
impacts in the ocean.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:21.107
And I saw those dead
reefs covered by algae

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:23.576
and slime and the big fishes
were gone.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:24.844
These fish that you can see

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:27.046
are smaller
than my diving masks.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.649
I quit my job as a professor

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:34.621
and I just started going
to these remote places.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:38.424
And I started this project
that we call Pristine Seas.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:41.227
The goal of this project
is to go to the most remote,

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.462
uninhabited, untouched places
in the ocean,

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:45.498
the wildest places in the ocean.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.834
A coral reef that
looks like this,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:51.437
where the corals are alive
and predators dominate.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.607
And we combine exploration,
scientific research,

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:57.977
compelling media
and then we inspire

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.013
the leaders of the countries
that own these places

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.582
to protect them in
very large reserves.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.951
In the last five years,
we've been to nine places.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.152
And we got five protected.

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:10.756
Covering a total of almost half
a million square kilometers.

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:13.258
And in the next few years
we are going to

00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:14.994
a few more of these
places to try to protect

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:18.597
the last places that
still look like the ocean

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:21.334
that was thousands of years ago.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.668
Thank you.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:24.570
( applause )

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.139
Boyd: Now Tristram Stuart

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.341
is gonna give us a little
overview of his work quickly.

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:31.977 line:0%
Tristram: We're chopping
down rainforest

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:33.712 line:0%
to grow more food
but at the same time,

00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:35.581 line:0%
a billion people are hungry.

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:37.149 line:0%
And yet we're wasting one third

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:38.584
of the world's food supply.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.219
That is something of a tragedy

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.254
but I've made it
my life's mission

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:45.258
to show that this is
a colossal opportunity.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:47.626
If we need to cut down
our environmental impact

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.430
and increase food availability
where it's needed most,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.332
cutting food waste
is a really good place to start.

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:56.836
These green beans show
you just how simple

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:59.905
some of the solutions
to food waste can be.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:02.274
I draw your attention
to the word trimmed.

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.343
These beans have been
trimmed to size

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.511
to fit into these
plastic containers.

00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:08.548
That means that Kenyan farmers

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:11.150
growing these beans for export
to European markets, are cutting

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.353
sometimes 30, 40 percent
of the beans they've grown

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:16.589
in a country were the land
and the water

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.224
that they're using
to grow these beans

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.591
are scarce resources.

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:22.361
20 tons a day of waste
coming out of

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.030
this single depot,
just outside Nairobi,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.933
and contractors collecting
this waste

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.668
have to sign a contract saying
they won't feed

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:32.271
any of this good food
to hungry people.

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.340
It will all be treated as waste.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.043
We're paying for that
crime in our supply chains.

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:39.846
What we did is four things.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.213
First of all,

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:44.250
raise awareness
through public campaigns

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.751
on ugly fruit and vegetables

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:48.254
and why these standards
are unnecessary.

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:51.056
Number two, pass a law
within the United Kingdom

00:04:51.056 --> 00:04:54.360
saying that when
supermarkets cause their
suppliers to waste food,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.229
they should share
the cost of it.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.198
Number three, help
farmers in those countries

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:00.699
develop secondary markets

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.935
to get some of that food
to markets.

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:05.638
And number four, work
with the supermarkets

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.306
to change those standards.

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:09.441
We got Tescos to
change the way they ask

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:10.842
for the beans to be trimmed.

00:05:10.842 --> 00:05:13.112
They now trim only on
one side of the bean

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.548
rather than two,
it's not far enough.

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.650
They've gone half way
but Kenyan farmers...

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.984
( laughter )

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:21.354
...are producing five
percent more bean

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.889
per unit of production
than they were before.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.825
We did that in a few months.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.893
Similar story with
bananas in Ecuador.

00:05:27.893 --> 00:05:29.862
That's the waste of
one banana plantation

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.197
after one day of harvest.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:33.432
Bananas in Costa Rica.

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:34.700
These are carrots
being wasted

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.968
because they are too long

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:38.870
to fit into these
supermarket plastic crates.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.841
It's crazy and it's
happening everywhere.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.777
We have led a global revolution
against food waste

00:05:45.777 --> 00:05:47.512
by doing positive campaigning

00:05:47.512 --> 00:05:48.981
and feeding the five thousand,

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:51.050
which is the name
of our organization,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.753
at an event that we used
to launch our campaigns

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:55.821
where we feed five thousand
people, all on food

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:57.389
that would otherwise be wasted,

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.092
"Filling bellies, not bins".

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:02.161
We also set up the
Gleaning Network in Britain

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:04.329
and now across Europe
were we take volunteers

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:07.266
to fields to harvest
some of this unused crop

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:08.801
and get it people
who are hungry

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:11.470
and also communicate
about those basic,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.272
original sources of food waste

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:14.874
and what we can do about it.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.810
My next mission is
to come to America.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.379
I'm here now and
I'm making friends.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:21.446
( applause )

00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:24.450
And I will show you
why it's most important.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.919
What this shows is
that America has

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.355
twice as much food
in its shops and restaurants

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.822
than is actually required

00:06:30.822 --> 00:06:32.858
to keep the population alive.

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:35.894
That is a huge
opportunity to save money,

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:38.630
save resources, save
impact on the environment.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.266
We're gonna start
with portion sizes

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.735
and we're gonna move
up to the farms.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.604
We're gonna cause
a food waste revolution

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:45.704
here in America,

00:06:45.704 --> 00:06:46.906
we're coming soon.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.040
Thank you very much.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.208
( applause )

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:51.077
Boyd: Excellent.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.614
And now Shivani Bhalla from our
Big Cats initiative in Kenya.

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:59.652 line:0%
Shivani: In under a century
we have lost

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:02.989 line:0%
over 90 percent of
our planet's lions.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.625
Where I'm from in Kenya

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.061
the situation
is just as serious.

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:13.865
We have only two thousand
lions left in our country.

00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:16.602
We work to try and understand

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.670
why this is happening.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.939
Lions are running out of space.

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:23.842
They also come in to
contact with people.

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:25.845
The local people,
whose livelihoods

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:29.615
depend on their livestock,
are often targeted by lions.

00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:34.754
In Samburu, in northern
Kenya where I live,

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:37.890
our population has
grown from 11 lions

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.594
to over 50 now as a result
of conservation efforts.

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:45.097
I work with a team
and our mission is

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:46.832
to promote the co-existence

00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:50.102
between lions and people
in northern Kenya.

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.671
We do this through a number
of community programs.

00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:55.140
One of which is
our warrior program

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.776
known as Warrior Watch.

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:57.743
Here in this picture

00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:00.279
you see three of the warriors
I work with.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.449
Previously neglected when
it came to conservation,

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:06.184
these warriors are now
wildlife ambassadors.

00:08:06.184 --> 00:08:08.320
They're engaged in conservation.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.191
We have 16 warriors now
working in the region.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.592
When we started the program,

00:08:13.592 --> 00:08:15.661
we asked the warriors
what would you like

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.797
in exchange for all
this great wildlife information

00:08:18.797 --> 00:08:20.165
that you give us?

00:08:20.165 --> 00:08:22.934
And they said,
we would like education.

00:08:22.934 --> 00:08:24.770
We have never been to school.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.840
These are young men
aged between 15 to 25,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.275
who've never had that
opportunity to go

00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:32.544
and learn how to read and write.

00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:34.079
We've now changed this.

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:35.781
And over the last five years

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:38.550
all 17 of our warriors
can read and write,

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.721
both in English and the
national language, Kiswahili.

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:46.124
This picture was taken
a couple of weeks ago

00:08:46.124 --> 00:08:48.828
at our annual lion kids camp.

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:50.462
They've never seen a lion.

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:53.365
They've only heard negative
experiences with lions.

00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:55.167
They'd seen
the remains of a camel

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:57.336
after a lion
had preyed on them.

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:58.504
But we changed that,

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:01.573
we took these kids
to see their first ever lion.

00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:03.575
And their faces say it all.

00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:05.511
As they saw their first lion

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:07.579
they whispered to me,
Simba Simba.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:09.348
( laughter )

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:12.551
And this is what gives
me hope for the future.

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:13.585
Thank you.

00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:15.588
( applause )

00:09:17.222 --> 00:09:19.992
Boyd: And now Jack
Andraka, our inventor.

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:24.162 line:0%
Jack: So I suppose
my story really began

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:27.766 line:0%
when I was 13,
when a close family friend,

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:29.401 line:0%
who was like an uncle to me,

00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:32.771 line:0%
actually passed away
from pancreatic cancer.

00:09:32.771 --> 00:09:34.706
And when the disease
hit so close to home,

00:09:34.706 --> 00:09:36.641
I knew I needed to learn more.

00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:38.711
So I went online to find answers

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:41.680
and what I had found
really shocked me.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.216
You see 85 percent of
all pancreatic cancers

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:46.818
are diagnosed late,
when someone has

00:09:46.818 --> 00:09:49.521
less than a two percent
chance of survival.

00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:51.022
And as I looked deeper,

00:09:51.022 --> 00:09:53.492
I found an even
more shocking statistic.

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:55.894
You see there is
currently no standard way

00:09:55.894 --> 00:09:57.863
for detecting pancreatic cancer.

00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:00.899
Our conventional method
is the 60 year old technique.

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:02.834
I mean first off that's
older than my dad...

00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:04.002
( laughter )

00:10:04.002 --> 00:10:07.072
...but also it costs
$800 per test

00:10:07.072 --> 00:10:10.409
and it's grossly inaccurate,
missing 30 percent
of all cancers

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:12.144
and thus is rarely ever used

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:14.480
for screening
of pancreatic cancer.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.715
So armed with eighth
grade biology,

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:18.717
I decided to set out
to change the field

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.085
of cancer diagnostics.

00:10:20.085 --> 00:10:21.320
( laughter )

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.190
Bit lofty of a goal
but I was going to do it.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.858
And so essentially
what I did is

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:28.193
I stumbled across
how we are currently diagnosing

00:10:28.193 --> 00:10:30.262
these cancers and what
we're doing is

00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:31.664
we're looking
at your blood stream

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:34.299
particularly for these
variations in protein levels

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:36.702
and while it sounds
extremely straightforward,

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:39.838
it's anything but because you
have liters and liters of blood

00:10:39.838 --> 00:10:43.175
which is about an innumerable
numbers of these proteins.

00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:45.210
So it's like trying to
find a needle in a stack

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.479
of nearly identical needles.

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:50.115
However, undeterred due
to my teenage optimism

00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:51.751
or how some people label it,

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.986
complete and utter ignorance
of the entire field,

00:10:54.986 --> 00:10:57.289
I continued on
and I essentially found

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.759
a database of 8000 proteins

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.126
that are found in
your bloodstream

00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:02.428
when you have these cancers.

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:04.196
Essentially I found
this one protein

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:06.331
that I could use
called mesothelin

00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:09.001
and it's just your ordinary
run of the mill type protein,

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.235
unless of course you have

00:11:10.235 --> 00:11:12.638
pancreatic, ovarian
or lung cancer.

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:14.306
In which case it's found
in these very high levels

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:15.841
in your blood stream.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.843
But also the key is,
is that it's found

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.678
in earlier stages
of the disease.

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:22.014
When someone has close to
100 percent chance of survival

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:24.717
and essentially what
I did is I combined

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:26.585
something called
carbon nanotubes,

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:28.053
essentially the
superheros of material,

00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:30.389
these long thin tubes
of carbon.

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:31.957
They have these
amazing properties.

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:32.991
And all you do is

00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:34.426
it's like making
chocolate chip cookies.

00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:36.228
You put them in this
giant thing of water.

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:37.796
You pour in some nanotubes,

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:39.664
add some antibodies,
which are molecules

00:11:39.664 --> 00:11:42.768
that only react with one cancer
biomarker, mix it up,

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.803
take some paper,
dip it, dry it

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:46.806
and you can detect cancer.

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:48.840
And then I sent out
my procedure

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.976
to 200 labs at Johns
Hopkins University,

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:53.011
got a 199 "No's".

00:11:53.011 --> 00:11:56.515
Seven months later after
getting accepted into a lab,

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:59.518
I stumble out with
one small paper sensor

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:02.354
that cost three cents
and takes five minutes to run,

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:04.756
making it 168 times faster,

00:12:04.756 --> 00:12:07.259
over 26,000 times less expensive

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:09.161
and over 400 times
more sensitive

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:12.264
than our conventional
methods of detection.

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:14.232
But also so far
it can detect the cancer

00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:16.068
in the earliest stage
when someone has

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:18.403
close to 100 percent
chance of survival

00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:21.373
and so far has over
90 percent accuracy.

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:24.310
It can be broadly applied
to pretty much any disease,

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.511
ranging from Alzheimer's,

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:26.979
other forms of cancer,
even HIV,

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:28.213
AIDS and heart disease.

00:12:28.213 --> 00:12:29.681
So that's my research.

00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:32.351
( applause )

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.860
Boyd: So Enric one
thing you have found which,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.062
this is a really great news,

00:12:44.062 --> 00:12:46.498
is if you can set aside
a marine area

00:12:46.498 --> 00:12:49.100
and keep... and just
make it a reserve

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.335
for a brief period of
time and we've been

00:12:50.335 --> 00:12:51.936
able to do that, you
were talking about some

00:12:51.936 --> 00:12:54.006
of the successes in your talk,

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.474
because it was once
a desert doesn't

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:57.576
mean it will always
stay a desert.

00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:59.377
It comes back.

00:12:59.377 --> 00:13:01.579
Enric: Exactly, the ocean
and nature has this

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:03.549
incredible capacity to rebound.

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:05.050
This photograph was taken

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.153
on the Medes Islands
Marine Reserve,

00:13:08.153 --> 00:13:10.689
on the Costa Brava
in northern Spain.

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.925
And this guy
is Pierre-Yves Cousteau,

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:14.893
Jacques Cousteau's
youngest son.

00:13:14.893 --> 00:13:19.364
And next to him is a 25
kilo grouper,<i> la cernia</i> ,

00:13:19.364 --> 00:13:21.300
which are gone from most
of the Mediterranean,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.101
except in Marine reserves.

00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:25.804
Think about most of the ocean
like a debit account

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:29.074
where everybody withdraws
and nobody makes a deposit.

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.275
You don't need to
be an economist

00:13:30.275 --> 00:13:31.509
to know what's going to happen.

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:33.144
But this reserve where
there is no fishing

00:13:33.144 --> 00:13:34.379
is like a savings account where

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:36.882
principal set aside
that produces interest.

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.984
So the abundance of fish,

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:42.554
there are tons of fish
per square mile in the reserves,

00:13:42.554 --> 00:13:45.057
increases 450 percent

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:46.525
in less than 10 years.

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:48.794
Boyd: And how hard is it to
people to set aside an area,

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:51.463
to say if you only stop fishing
for 10 years,

00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:53.498
you'll be so amply rewarded?

00:13:53.498 --> 00:13:57.135
Enric: The benefits to
fishing are happen earlier.

00:13:57.135 --> 00:13:59.204
In some places in actually
the last three years

00:13:59.204 --> 00:14:01.272
after creation of the reserves

00:14:01.272 --> 00:14:02.941
there are so many fish
inside the reserve,

00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:05.844
they reproduce so much, that
some of these fish spill over

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:07.746
the boundaries of these reserves

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:09.114
so the fishermen
are catching more outside,

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.516
that's the interest.

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:16.355
Boyd: Tristram, let's just
put it out on the line.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:17.889
You're a dumpster diver.

00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:18.924
( laughter )

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.526
You go around and you
spy on people's trash.

00:14:21.526 --> 00:14:22.661
But what have you found?

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:25.497
Is that where you first got
the clue how much

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:27.499
was being thrown out of
restaurants and grocery stores?

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:30.302
Tristram: Yeah, it is.
Actually I was 15 also

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:31.537
when my mission started.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.840
I was collecting food waste for
my pigs from my school canteen,

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.475
the local baker,
and the green grocer

00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:38.543
but I realized that
most of the food

00:14:38.543 --> 00:14:39.611
I was giving to my pigs

00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:41.913
was actually perfectly good
for human consumption.

00:14:41.913 --> 00:14:43.882
And I remember the day,

00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:45.651
I sat down for breakfast
with my pigs

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:47.819
and ate one of this perfectly
good loaves of bread

00:14:47.819 --> 00:14:49.722
that the baker
had chucked away

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.723
and that was the first act
of what you could call

00:14:51.723 --> 00:14:53.726
dumpster diving or freeganism.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:54.860
This photograph,

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.928
you see, I moved to London
a few years ago,

00:14:56.928 --> 00:14:58.997
and I stopped
being able to keep pigs.

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:00.999
So I decided to launch campaign

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:03.268
on feeding food waste to pigs,

00:15:03.268 --> 00:15:05.838
which is the next best
thing after you've exhausted

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.107
all possibilities for
feeding it to humans.

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:10.342
Processed pig food
which has been grown

00:15:10.342 --> 00:15:12.377
by deforesting the Amazon
to grow soy.

00:15:12.377 --> 00:15:15.213
Europe imports
40 million tons every year.

00:15:15.213 --> 00:15:16.815
This is the worst
thing that is going on

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:18.516
on the planet at the moment.

00:15:18.516 --> 00:15:20.786
We're chopping down
forest to grow more food

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:23.322
and we can cancel out
a lot of demand for that

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:24.589
by changing the way,

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:26.391
first of all we eat
and waste food,

00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:28.560
and secondly the way
we produce meat

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.231
by using waste products
rather than using virgin crops.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:36.135
Boyd: Shivani, all of
us have had neighbors

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:37.936
we didn't exactly
get along with.

00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:39.370
In this case for the Samburu,

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.772
the lions are their neighbors.

00:15:40.772 --> 00:15:42.574
If you wanna make peace,

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:44.376
you invite them over for dinner.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:46.244
So how do you make friends

00:15:46.244 --> 00:15:47.713
if your neighbors are lions?

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:51.383
What do you do to make that
relationship harmonious?

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:53.418
Shivani: The big problem
in this area is conflict.

00:15:53.418 --> 00:15:56.254
So when lions come along and
they attack people's livestock,

00:15:56.254 --> 00:15:58.223
this is when
people don't like lions.

00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:00.192
They don't want
lions in their area.

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:02.727
So we work with the
communities to reduce conflict.

00:16:02.727 --> 00:16:05.564
We try to encourage them
to look after livestock better.

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:07.299
One of the big issues
is livestock

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:09.367
is always often lost.

00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:11.403
So lions come across
sleeping camels at night

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:14.106
far from the village
and they will attack them.

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:16.541
So we encourage them look
after your livestock better.

00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:19.277
Don't send young children
out to look after your livestock

00:16:19.277 --> 00:16:20.879
because of course a little boy

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:22.380
is scared of lions,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.316
yet warriors
are not scared of lions.

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:26.551
Also a night livestock
are kept in

00:16:26.551 --> 00:16:29.555
what are known as<i> bomas</i> ,
livestock enclosures.

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:31.689
We work with them
to reinforce their<i> bomas</i> .

00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:33.758
So at least they can
be more predator-proof.

00:16:33.758 --> 00:16:36.995
Predators can't get in easily
and livestock can't get out.

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:38.764
So there are lots
of ways we can work

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.398
with the local
people to reduce

00:16:40.398 --> 00:16:42.601
conflict from happening
in the first place.

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:46.304
And then they're much more
willing to live with lions.

00:16:46.304 --> 00:16:48.107
Boyd: Good fences do
make good neighbors

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:48.940
in this case.

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:50.408
Shivani: Good fences
do make good neighbors.

00:16:50.408 --> 00:16:53.078
Boyd: Now Jack, you
came up with this idea.

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:55.581
How do know that it works?

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.182
Are you in testing?

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.617
Did the head of the lab--

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:01.119
How did he react when you said,
look what I found

00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:02.921
and how long were you there,
just over your summer vacation?

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:04.056
Jack: No for seven months.

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:05.791
Boyd: So he's been working there
his entire career.

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.025
Jack: Yes

00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:08.326
Boyd: You come in
seven months later

00:17:08.326 --> 00:17:09.528
and what does he say?

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.330
Jack: I mean to even
like get anything

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.432
was like really exciting for
him, he was in disbelief.

00:17:14.432 --> 00:17:17.936
But essentially what
really tipped us off

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.505
that was working,
is its sensitivity. You see,

00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:22.941
it could detect down to
like femtogram levels

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:25.577
which was really incredible
for these types of sensors,

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:28.446
especially given its cost
and how rapid it was.

00:17:28.446 --> 00:17:30.182
And so we, once we saw
that then we started

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.917
working with mouse
blood samples

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:34.086
and we saw that was
effective there

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:37.856
so we instantly submitted
a patent and we're right now

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:39.925
in talks with several different
bio-tech companies

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:42.394
about getting it on the market
as soon as possible

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:45.297
just because I, unfortunately
can't run clinical trials.

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:46.464
As a high school student

00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:48.299
I have SATs and
prom to worry about.

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:50.235
( laughter )

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.804 line:0%
Now when we go
to the Pristine Seas,

00:17:52.804 --> 00:17:55.207 line:0%
we talk a lot about things
that we put in the ocean.

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:56.608 line:0%
One thing
that we put in the ocean

00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:58.110
are oil platforms.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.578
Turns out

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:02.380
they actually create
artificial reefs

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.917
so this is actually a
life source,

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:05.717
these platforms.

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.185
What have you discovered there?

00:18:07.185 --> 00:18:09.587
Is it spreading
beyond the platforms?

00:18:09.587 --> 00:18:11.023
When we think of the oil wells,

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:13.158
we think of
the possibility of spills

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.993
but why are they
so popular for fish?

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:17.595 line:0%
Enric: So we did a Pristine
Seas expedition to Gabon.

00:18:17.595 --> 00:18:21.433 line:0%
And the coast of
Gabon is mostly sandy.

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:24.503 line:0%
And there are dozens
of oil platforms.

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:27.505
And these platforms
are the only hard substrate

00:18:27.505 --> 00:18:29.774
in hundreds of kilometers
of coast.

00:18:29.774 --> 00:18:31.976
We were told by the people
at the oil companies

00:18:31.976 --> 00:18:33.044
about the safety.

00:18:33.044 --> 00:18:35.080
It was like we're going to dive

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.848
into the Chernobyl
reactor or something.

00:18:36.848 --> 00:18:37.716
( laughter )

00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:42.054
It was-- They painted
such a dire picture

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:45.957
and we jumped in the water
and we could not believe it.

00:18:45.957 --> 00:18:47.826
There were so many fish!

00:18:47.826 --> 00:18:51.596
Rainbow runners like
these ones, tuna, sharks.

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:55.467
In the first 20 meters,
the first 60 feet of
these platforms,

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.169
there is more than one ton,

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:59.338
a thousand kilos of fish.

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:01.773
Boyd: Is that because coral
grows on the hard surface

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:03.341
that it wouldn't
have on the sandy bottom?

00:19:03.341 --> 00:19:04.977
The hard surface
of the oil well.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:07.145
Enric: Exactly, all the
animals that live on reefs

00:19:07.145 --> 00:19:10.482
produce eggs and they
turn into larvae that float.

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:14.019
And if they don't find
a hard substrate to settle,

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:14.986
they die.

00:19:14.986 --> 00:19:17.222
So now there is
this plan to work--

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:20.325
The government of Gabon is
working with the oil companies,

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:23.629
so the oil companies
will enforce

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.330
the area around
the oil companies

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.999
so there will be no fishing
and there's going to be

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:31.602
a haven for replenishing
the rest of the coast of Gabon.

00:19:31.602 --> 00:19:33.138
Boyd: Who would
have thought

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:37.042
we're holding a beauty contest
for our fruits and vegetables?

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:39.645
Can you stop the
beauty contest?

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:42.980
Does that begin with
the market or the consumer?

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.048 line:0%
Tristram: That's what the basis

00:19:44.048 --> 00:19:45.483 line:0%
of our campaigns are all about.

00:19:45.483 --> 00:19:48.620 line:0%
It's about instigating
popular revolt.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.357 line:0%
Literally it is revolting--
against food waste.

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:54.692
This is why
the big supermarkets

00:19:54.692 --> 00:19:56.428
and why governments
are now listening to us.

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:57.762
Not because we're right

00:19:57.762 --> 00:20:00.131
but because we have
a popular movement behind us.

00:20:00.131 --> 00:20:02.868
And it's gonna sound funny
but ugly fruit and vegetables

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:04.235
since the launch of
our campaign

00:20:04.235 --> 00:20:06.338
have become the fastest
growing sector

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:08.807
of the fresh produce market
in the United Kingdom.

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.741
Boyd: Do they offer it
at a different price?

00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:12.510
Tristram: Different
prices in some places

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.711
or you just tell the story.

00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:15.614
If you're a high end
demographic super market

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:16.747
or farmer's market,

00:20:16.747 --> 00:20:18.750
you just say
well the skin on these apples

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.819
are blemished because
it hailed during the autumn.

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:22.921
And people like to hear
that kind of story

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:24.355
and will respond to that.

00:20:24.355 --> 00:20:25.490
( laughter )

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.759
I mean, we're doing
the same thing with fish also.

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.527
Fish are being
chucked overboard

00:20:29.527 --> 00:20:31.897
that are perfectly good
for consumption

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.665
by a process
called high grading.

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:36.701
Basically only bring in
the best specimens ashore.

00:20:36.701 --> 00:20:38.503
Because you got a finite hold

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:40.372
and fishermen are
chucking them away.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:43.575
In Europe that's being
exacerbated by quota systems

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:46.277
that make people chuck
over quota fish aboard.

00:20:46.277 --> 00:20:48.146
And we're just changing
the legislation in Europe now

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:51.283
to make discarding
valuable fish at sea--

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:54.052
40 to 60 percent of fish
caught in European waters

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:55.653
is being chucked overboard.

00:20:55.653 --> 00:20:58.156
Boyd: Now if you're going
to get the local people involved

00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:01.826
in taking on the conservation
as being important to them,

00:21:01.826 --> 00:21:03.962
they have to see some benefit

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:06.698
beyond just the fact
that they're lions.

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:08.433
One you have to show
them that tourist

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.068
are not going to show up
if they don't have elephants

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:11.703
and lions, if they're
all poached out.

00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:13.104
'Cause that's what
they're coming to see.

00:21:13.104 --> 00:21:14.172
So there's that dollar bit.

00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:15.640
But do those dollars
from the tourist

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.108
in any way get to them

00:21:17.108 --> 00:21:19.143
so that they
see a direct benefit.

00:21:19.143 --> 00:21:21.479 line:0%
Shivani: Absolutely. So tourist
that come to visit Samburu,

00:21:21.479 --> 00:21:22.514 line:0%
there's a huge percentage

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:24.583 line:0%
that goes directly
back to the community.

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:26.417 line:0%
The community then
use these funds

00:21:26.417 --> 00:21:29.788 line:0%
for health projects,
for school bursaries,

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:31.189
for water projects,

00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:33.057
because water is
a big issue in our area.

00:21:33.057 --> 00:21:35.193
We're in a semiarid desert,
there is no water.

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:36.594
You literally have
to dig for water

00:21:36.594 --> 00:21:38.129
in the dry river beds.

00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:40.598
So through the funds
that they get from tourism

00:21:40.598 --> 00:21:42.934
they're able to do such things

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:44.669
and have more access to water.

00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:46.170
Education is key.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.940
Sending their children to school
is a big thing for them.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.241
Now they are able to do that

00:21:50.241 --> 00:21:52.577
through the benefits
they get from tourism.

00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:53.845
Boyd: And they make
that connection

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.446
between the lions programs
you're doing the Ewaso...

00:21:55.446 --> 00:21:56.280
Shivani: They do.

00:21:56.714 --> 00:21:58.984
Boyd: and the education they're
getting is because of the lions?

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.118
Shivani: Absolutely, yeah.
So we've got

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.786
a great relationship
with the tourism,

00:22:01.786 --> 00:22:04.122
managements and lodges
within our area.

00:22:04.122 --> 00:22:05.690
We work closely
together so people

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.093
can really understand
the relationship between

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:11.496
tourist and conservation and
working with communities.

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:12.931
And they have seen that.

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:14.766
Boyd: And you've got
the Samburu Warriors

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:16.100
who are walking around
to see

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.702
where the lions are,
warning the people,

00:22:17.702 --> 00:22:19.704
if it's getting close
to their cattle,

00:22:19.704 --> 00:22:21.239
but they're such great trackers.

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:23.975
Do they also look for
human tracks of poachers?

00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:25.877
Do you have 'em
on the watch for that?

00:22:25.877 --> 00:22:28.013
Shivani: They do, our warriors
are basically out there

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:30.749
looking out for anything
so not just predators

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:32.584
but people as well.

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:35.353
Poaching is a big problem
in our area, northern Kenya.

00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:37.455
So our warriors do
notify the wardens,

00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:41.226
the rangers if they
see any kind of tracks

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:43.195
that look a little
bit suspicious.

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.896
They're very good
at aging the tracks.

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:46.064
They know exactly
when that track

00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:47.565
has been through that area.

00:22:47.565 --> 00:22:50.135
They can tell from
the type of shoes who it is.

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:52.303
They are fantastic trackers
and so they can really

00:22:52.303 --> 00:22:54.872
give information
back to the authorities

00:22:54.872 --> 00:22:56.541
if there's anything that looks

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.443
a little bit suspicious
in that area.

00:22:58.443 --> 00:22:59.511
Boyd: And let's just
repeat the number.

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:02.881
When you started this program
you had 11 lions in your area

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:04.248
and that
was how many years ago?

00:23:04.248 --> 00:23:06.251
Shivani: That was back in 2006.

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:08.420
We had about 11 lions
we were monitoring

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.755
and now we're up
to over 50 lions.

00:23:10.755 --> 00:23:12.023
Boyd: 50. So it's working,

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:13.691
whatever you're doing
it's working,

00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:14.826
keep it up.

00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:15.860
( applause )

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.629
Now Jack, tell us
how it all started.

00:23:18.629 --> 00:23:21.032
Did you start like
those of us

00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:22.867
who had chemistry sets
when you were a kid,

00:23:22.867 --> 00:23:24.102
blowing up stuff?

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:25.270
( laughter )

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.738 line:0%
Jack: I started out with
a lot of environmental work

00:23:27.738 --> 00:23:30.374 line:0%
so working with
bioluminescent bacteria

00:23:30.374 --> 00:23:32.110 line:0%
to detect water contaminants.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.612 line:0%
Then I moved on to
like nano ecotoxicity

00:23:34.612 --> 00:23:36.981
so investigate-- I did
one of the first studies

00:23:36.981 --> 00:23:39.417
of its kind on the
impacts of nano particles,

00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:41.553
versus bulk particles
and their impacts

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:43.487
on the aquatic ecosystems.

00:23:43.487 --> 00:23:45.056
Boyd: I know you have
something that will

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:46.724
test water quality, what's that?

00:23:46.724 --> 00:23:48.326
Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
so it's essentially

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:49.727
something the size
of a credit card

00:23:49.727 --> 00:23:52.196
that detects six different
environmental contaminants

00:23:52.196 --> 00:23:54.499
and it's 200,000 times

00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:56.901
less expensive than our
conventional methods.

00:23:56.901 --> 00:23:58.737
And so it cost a dollar
and then also

00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:00.705
one of the very cool things
about it,

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:03.274
is that it can actually
only take 20 minutes,

00:24:03.274 --> 00:24:04.910
25 minutes to run

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.778
and one of the coolest
parts about that project--

00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:08.880
That was kinda like the
minor part of that project.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.250
The major part of that
was developing a water filter

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.051
out of recycled
plastic water bottles.

00:24:14.051 --> 00:24:15.553
So essentially you can take
water bottles

00:24:15.553 --> 00:24:17.522
and turn them into filters
that filter out

00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:19.990
95 percent of all heavy
metals and pesticides

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.394
in five minutes for 70 cents
and then also

00:24:23.394 --> 00:24:24.895
you can actually put
them in boiling water

00:24:24.895 --> 00:24:26.831
for just one minute
and they will actually

00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:29.267
reclaim up to 90 percent
of those contaminants

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:30.835
of which you can then
sell back

00:24:30.835 --> 00:24:32.803
and actually profit
from filtering your water.

00:24:32.803 --> 00:24:36.041
So we are currently
still testing with that

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:38.409
so we do use it for like
heavy metals, pesticides.

00:24:38.409 --> 00:24:40.645
It can also be used for
like fracking contaminants,

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:43.415
oil spill cleanup and has
a wide variety of usage

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:45.883
and now I'm moving on
to indoor air quality.

00:24:45.883 --> 00:24:48.519
( laughter )

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:50.221
Boyd: And there
actually seven stages

00:24:50.221 --> 00:24:51.923
that successful people
and all others have them

00:24:51.923 --> 00:24:54.024
but maybe not as much
as some explorers.

00:24:54.024 --> 00:24:55.760
They all start with curiosity.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.562
You want to see can
I find an answer.

00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:59.497
There must be a better test.

00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:02.400
They have hope which
is not blind optimism.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.602
Hope is based on
some knowledge

00:25:04.602 --> 00:25:06.337
that I can find an answer,

00:25:06.337 --> 00:25:08.239
that the information
is out there.

00:25:08.239 --> 00:25:09.841
They have passion.

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:11.876
Do they all have passion?
Yeah. Courage,

00:25:11.876 --> 00:25:14.345
independence, self-discipline

00:25:14.345 --> 00:25:17.181
but none of it would succeed
without perseverance,

00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:20.718
sticking with it,
and then one person can
make a difference.

00:25:20.718 --> 00:25:22.086
This is just a sample

00:25:22.086 --> 00:25:23.721
of the explorers
at National Geographic.

00:25:23.721 --> 00:25:25.523
Thank you for participating
in our opening!

00:25:25.523 --> 00:25:29.628
( applause )

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:32.731
( outro music )
