00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:05.472
AT THOSE POLICE OFFICERS.

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:07.174
THIS OUGHT TO GET
THEIR BLOOD BOILING.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.610
NOW, THE IDEA OF COMMITTING
AN ACT AGAINST THE POLICE

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.712
IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.713
[gunshot]

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.281
OOH!
[all screaming]

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:15.883
- ALL RIGHT, ANYBODY MOVE
AND THIS COP DIES!

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.684
- NO!
- LET'S GO.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:18.986
- ELIZA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.187
GET IN THE CAR.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.722
- GET IN THE CAR!
- WHAT HAPPENED?

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.824
- GET IN THE CAR!
- WHERE ARE WE TAKING THIS MAN?

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.125
- WE'RE KIDNAPPING THIS GUY!

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.227
- NO!
I WAS JUST GONNA THROW A BRICK!

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.462
[sirens approaching]
- GET IN THERE!

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:29.663
- ALL RIGHT.
- GET IN THE CAR!

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:30.664
- OKAY.
- I SWEAR TO [bleep] GOD,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.065
I WANT TO KILL YOU!

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.134
I WOULD LOVE TO KILL YOU!

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:35.335
GET IN, GET IN!
- OH, GOD.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.870
WHAT DO I DO WITH THE BRICK?

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:37.871
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
THE BRICK--OH!

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:39.173
- GO!

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.174
DRIVE! DRIVE!
- WE HAD A PLAN!

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.042
WE HAD A REALLY GOOD PLAN!

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.510
- NOBODY'S GONNA CHASE US IF YOU
THROW A BRICK THROUGH A WINDOW.

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.179
- OH, GOD.
DON'T SHOOT US!

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.047
OH, GOD, OH, GOD, OH, GOD.
- STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.917
- SO FAR, BEING ON THE RUN IS
A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.886
DON'T DO IT!
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.755
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.356
ALTHOUGH I WAS
AT FIRST CONCERNED

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.891
WITH HER ZEALOUSNESS...

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.826
SWITCHING CARS.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.563
ELIZA'S HELP IN EXECUTING THIS
REVIEW WAS PROVING INVALUABLE.

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.598
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- SETTING THIS CAR ON FIRE!

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.066
- THAT'S JUST SELTZER WATER.
HEY, HEY, HEY!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.501
- THEN HELP ME...
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.669
HE'S RUNNING AWAY!
- DESTROY THE EVIDENCE.

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:09.736
- WHERE DID YOU GO?
HEY!

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.737
WHERE DID YOU GO?

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:11.738
I DON'T KNOW.

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:12.739
DID YOU SEE WHERE HE WENT?

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:14.241
HEY, HEY, HEY!

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.776
- WHERE IS HE?
- HE'S HERE, HE'S HERE.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.077
HE'S HERE. HEY, STOP IT!
- [shouting]

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.078
- GET BACK HERE!
- I SWEAR TO GOD,

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.746
I WILL KILL YOU.
- HEY, STOP IT!

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.448
- I SWEAR TO GOD, I'LL KILL YOU!
- STOP, STOP, JUST STOP.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.083
CAN YOU PUT THE GUN DOWN PLEASE?
- OKAY, YOU THINK THIS IS

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.852
THE FIRST TIME I'VE KIDNAPPED
A COP BEFORE?

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.620
- OKAY, NOPE--WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M MRS. FORREST MACNEIL!

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.755
NOW GET IN THE CAR!
[bleep] AMATEURS!

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.791
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST GO.
[engine revs]

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.826
YOU'RE IN NEUTRAL.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.929
- OKAY.
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS,

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:38.699
SENDING THIS TAPE TO THE POLICE
AND ASKING FOR A RANSOM?

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.935
- WHAT?
WE DON'T WANT MONEY.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.437
WE JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.105
TO BE ON THE RUN FROM THE COPS.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.140
- LIKE A BONNIE AND CLYDE
KIND OF THING?

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.943
- YOU THINK THIS IS A MOVIE?
THIS IS REAL LIFE.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.111
- BONNIE AND CLYDE WERE
REAL PEOPLE, ACTUALLY.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.780
- YES, BUT IT'S A MOVIE FIRST.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:56.750
- NO, IT WAS REAL PEOPLE FIRST.
- SHUT UP!

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.119
- FEELINGS OF INTENSE FEAR
AND PARANOIA

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.121
SEEMED TO BE CLOUDING
OUR JUDGMENT.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.590
[water running]

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:05.893
- OKAY.
- [sighs]

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:08.562
- OKAY, GREAT.
NOW CHANGE CLOTHES.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.731
- I--WHY--I-I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
ANY OF THIS,

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:12.132
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
- SWEETIE,

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:13.600
THE COPS ARE GONNA BE LOOKING
FOR A GUY

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:14.968
THAT LOOKS LIKE IGOR DID
THIS MORNING.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.837
- RIGHT.
IGOR?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.838
- THAT'S HIS NAME.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.072
- OKAY.
- HELLO.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.073
- AND PUT THE MOUSTACHE ON.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.408
I'LL SEE YOU OUTSIDE.
