00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.360
When an 8 – 20 solar mass star ends its
life, it does so with a bang: a supernova.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.990
And when it’s all over, there’s a couple
of octillion tons of superheated plasma expanding

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.990
away from the explosion site at a fraction
of the speed of light, a whole mess of energy

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.030
released in the form of light and neutrinos,
and a bizarre little ball of quantum nastiness

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.320
in the center composed almost entirely of
neutrons.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.960
The properties of this neutron star are almost
as bizarre as things get in the Universe.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.200
And if it all seems rather alien to you, well,
that’s OK. For a little while, astronomers

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000
wondered if aliens really were behind what
they were seeing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940
Now I’m not sayin’ aliens.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.000
When we last left the core of a high mass
star, it was in a bad way: Milliseconds ago

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.640
it was fusing silicon into iron, but now it’s collapsing
under its own immensely powerful gravity.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.260
The collapse takes a fraction of a second,
but a lot happens in that fraction of a second.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.380
In lower mass stars, the core supports itself
via electron degeneracy pressure, the result

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.160
of a rule in quantum mechanics that says electrons
vehemently resist being squeezed together.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.820
But even electron degeneracy fails to stop
the collapse if the core has a mass more than

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.960
about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. That’s just
too much of a load to bear, and the collapse continues.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.900
Under these huge pressures, a funny thing
happens: Protons, electrons, and other subatomic

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.979
particles get smashed together, and they merge
to form neutrons. And this happens to almost

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.540
ALL of them. When the core collapses down
to about 20 km in diameter, it’s essentially

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.979
a ball of neutrons with some protons and electrons
here and there that survived, and a crust

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.540
of normal but highly compressed matter on
top.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.680
When this happens yet another effect comes
into play: neutron degeneracy. Like electrons,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.799
neutrons resist being squeezed too tightly
together, but this time the strength of the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.600
pressure is far, far stronger than for electrons.
If the core is less than about 2.8 times the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.879
Sun’s mass, the collapse runs into a wall.
It stops.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.709
This generates a huge shock wave, which, along
with a flood of energetic subatomic particles

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.560
called neutrinos, blasts outwards, blowing
up the star.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.380
What’s left of the core after the metaphorical
smoke clears is a neutron star, one of the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.120
most bizarre objects in the Universe.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.790
Such a star would be extremely weird. Or really,
just EXTREME. Its mass would be more than

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.070
that of the entire Sun, all packed into a
sphere maybe 20 km across.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.250
Now let’s just stop there for a sec and
let that sink in. The Sun has a mass 300,000

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.740
times the Earth. Imagine packing that all
into a ball THE SIZE OF A SMALL CITY.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.590
Too mind boggling? OK, think of it this way:
You are mostly empty space. Every atom in

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.370
your body has a nucleus made of tightly packed
neutrons and protons, and electrons whizzing

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.540
around outside them. If you could magnify
an atom to be 100 meters across, the nucleus

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.280
would be roughly the size of a marble. Imagine
all that empty space between the nucleus and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.500
the electrons. That’s a normal atom.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.110
But in a neutron star, ALL OF THAT SPACE would
be filled with neutrons. All of it. Every

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.819
nook and cranny inside the neutron star has
matter in it, all the way down to the scale

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.190
of an atomic nucleus. This is what gives a
neutron star its mind-crushing properties.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.040
I’m now going to barrage you with very large numbers.
So, take a deep breath, and you might wanna sit down.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.200
Neutron stars are ridiculously dense. A single
cubic centimeter of neutronium, as neutron

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.140
star stuff is usually called, has a mass of
about 400 MILLION tons. Want some perspective

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.019
on that number? Well, very roughly, that’s
the total mass of every single car and truck

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.220
in the United States. Imagine a couple of
hundred million vehicles, crushed down until

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.849
they could all fit inside this six-sided die.
That’s neutronium.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:05.010
It’s so dense that, as far as it’s concerned,
normal matter is a slightly polluted vacuum.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.909
If you set it on the ground it would fall
right through the Earth.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.120
Now, anything that dense has a HUGE gravitational
pull. If you were on the surface of a neutron

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.970
star… well, you’d be very dead, obviously
-- like immediately, flattened down to a thickness

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.379
of just a few atoms. And that’s because
a typical neutron star has a surface gravity

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:28.139
100 BILLION times stronger than Earth’s.
I have a mass of about 77 kilos, and here

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.479
on Earth I weigh about 170 pounds. On a neutron
star, I’d weigh 17 trillion pounds. That’s

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.160
23,000 times the weight of the Empire State
Building.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.680
But wait! There’s more!

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.540
In our introduction to the solar system I
mentioned that when you take a spinning object

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.020
and shrink it the spin will increase—the
usual example is an ice skater drawing in

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.990
his arms, increasing his rotation until he’s
a blur.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.050
The same is true for the star’s core when
it collapses into a neutron star. It may have

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.349
had a very slow spin before the supernova,
maybe even taking weeks to spin once. But

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.080
when it shrinks down to just 20 km across
and becomes a neutron star, that rotation

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.780
will increase by a HUGE factor. A freshly minted
neutron star might spin several times per SECOND.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.400
The magnetic field increases as well. A star
like the Sun has an overall magnetic strength

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.609
not too different from the Earth’s. But when
that core collapses, the strength of the field

00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:27.759
skyrockets, and a neutron star can easily
have a magnetic field several trillion times

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.759
stronger than the Sun’s. That’s strong
enough to erase your credit card from a hundred

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.460
thousand kilometers away.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.960
See? Ridiculous.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.340
All of these properties are brain-melting. But are
they real? Could an object like this really exist?

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.680
Oh my, yes. The first neutron star was detected
in 1965, though not recognized for what it

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.389
was at the time. A couple of years later another
one was found, and this time was correctly

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.169
identified as a neutron star.

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.479
But then things got...weird.

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.189
In 1967, Jocelyn Bell was a graduate student
helping build a radio telescope. There was

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:06.309
a persistent noise in their data they couldn’t
seem to fix. Bell studied it night after night,

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:10.319
finally figuring out that the pattern wasn’t
a problem with their data, it was from an

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:16.839
actual astronomical object. She had discovered
the first known pulsar. What’s a pulsar, you ask?

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.339
Pulsars are neutron stars. In a nutshell,
their rapid rotation coupled with their incredibly

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:27.020
strong magnetic fields launch twin beams of
energy away from the star, like the beams

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.419
from a lighthouse. The beams sweeps around
as the star rotates, and from Earth we see

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.619
this as a pulse, a blip, of increased brightness.
This pulse can be detected in visible light,

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:38.859
radio waves, and even X-rays!

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.240
The spin of a neutron star is amazingly stable,
making these pulses act like a very accurately

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:50.409
timed cosmic clock. In 1967, no one could
believe a natural object could do this, and

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:56.289
this object was half-jokingly given the name
LGM-1. Little Green Men 1.

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:01.149
Now we know of over a thousand pulsars in
just our galaxy alone, and we know they are

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:05.819
the leftover cores of massive stars that exploded.
Some spin with periods many seconds or even

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:10.849
minutes long. Some are in binary systems;
another normal star orbits them. If they’re

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:15.339
close enough together the neutron star can
rip material off the other star and feed on

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:19.569
it. This increases the pulsar’s spin, and
we know of a few that have incredibly rapid

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:25.139
rotation rates; some spin hundreds of times
per second! These are called millisecond pulsars,

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:30.599
and if they spun much faster the centrifugal force
would rip them apart despite their tremendous gravity!

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.679
Even after a thousand years, a pulsar can
still be a force to reckon with. There’s

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:38.959
a pulsar in the center of the Crab Nebula,
the remains of a star that exploded to create

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:43.729
that supernova remnant. A substantial fraction
of the light emitted from the nebula is powered

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:49.639
by the pulsar itself; its fierce output energizes
the nebula, causing it to glow brightly even

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:50.789
after a millennium.

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:54.739
I’m telling ya, thinking about neutrons
stars makes the hair on the back of my neck

00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:55.599
stand up.

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:57.830
And I haven’t even mentioned magnetars yet.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.929
Neutron stars are more than just weird little
balls of neutrons. They have a crust, probably

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:08.050
a few centimeters thick, made of highly compressed
but more or less normal matter, squeezed into

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.569
a kind of highly stiffened crystal state.
The magnetic field of the star penetrates

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:15.729
this crystalline crust and stretches out for
quite a distance.

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:20.959
In some neutron stars the magnetic field is
even stronger than usual, and can be — get

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:26.419
this — a QUADRILLION times stronger than
the Sun’s. These über-powerful neutron

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:31.971
stars are given the name magnetars. They’re
relatively rare; maybe 10% of all neutron

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.560
stars are born as magnetars. And they have
short lifetimes; the magnetic field is so

00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:41.789
strong it acts like the brakes on a car, slowing
the neutron star’s spin. That spin helps

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:45.629
power the magnetic field, so the field weakens
as the star slows.

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:50.780
But while they're around, magnetars are the
most magnetic objects in the Universe. And

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.750
with great power comes great responsibility…
if your responsibility is to be one of the

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.620
scariest objects in the Universe.
Why?

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.000
In a neutron star, the crust and magnetic
field are locked together, so a change in

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:07.459
one affects the other. The crust of the star
is under incredible strain due to the intense

00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:13.040
gravity and rapid rotation. If the structure
slips, it can snap, creating a star quake

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.839
— like an earthquake, but just a WEE bit
stronger. In an earthquake, huge amounts of

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:22.410
energy are released when the Earth’s crust
shifts and snaps, enough to destroy buildings

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.390
and quite literally move mountains.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:30.550
But in a neutron star this effect is multiplied.
Hugely. Remember, the crust is phenomenally

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:36.480
dense, and the gravity is enormous. If the
crust strains and snaps, dropping just a single

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.800
centimeter, the resulting release of energy
is vast beyond imagining.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.540
This energy is released as a tremendous explosion
in the crust, shaking it. This also shakes

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.680
the magnetic field, which reacts…poorly.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.500
When the Sun’s magnetic field throws a tantrum,
we get a solar flare, which can be as powerful

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:59.540
as billions of nuclear bombs. A magnetar flare
dwarfs that into insignificance. It can be

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.519
trillions of times stronger than a solar flare
— in a fraction of a second, a magnetar

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:09.759
can release as much energy as the Sun gives
of in a quarter of a million years.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:16.250
In 2004, astronomers were stunned when a huge
blast of X-rays slammed into orbiting satellites.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.300
One of these satellites, named Swift, actually
had its detectors saturated with X-rays, even

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.720
though it wasn’t even pointing at the source
at the time! The X-rays literally came right

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.040
through the side of the satellite with such
intensity that Swift — which was designed

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.389
to detect powerful X-ray sources — was momentarily
blinded by them.

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:40.490
The source of this X-ray burst was quickly
determined to be a magnetar called SGR-1806-20,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.930
and the effects were incredible: It actually
compressed the Earth’s magnetic field, and

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.590
partially ionized the Earth’s upper atmosphere.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:53.540
Oh, did I mention that this magnetar is 50,000
light years away? That’s halfway across

00:10:53.550 --> 00:11:00.120
the galaxy. That’s INCREDIBLE. At a distance
of 500 quadrillion km its effects were felt

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.480
more strongly than a powerful flare from the
Sun!

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.329
The good news is that there are very few magnetars
like this in the galaxy, probably fewer than

00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:14.230
a dozen. Also, catastrophic explosions like
the one in 2004 are rare; if one had had happened

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.389
any other time in the past 40 or so years
we would’ve detected it. And frankly, it’s

00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:23.609
really cool that we had astronomical satellites
orbiting the Earth which could study it!

00:11:23.609 --> 00:11:28.040
We’ve come a long way in understanding neutron
stars since they were first discovered, but

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:33.210
there’s much about them we don’t understand.
Every time we find out more we find out they’re

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.060
even weirder than we first thought.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:41.480
And yet, for all that, they’re not the weirdest
things in the sky. Not by a long shot. That

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.010
place is held pretty securely by the other
type of object created in a supernova:

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.270
a black hole.
Stay tuned.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.300
Today you learned that when a star between
8 and 20 times the Sun’s mass explodes,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.290
the core collapses to form a neutron star.
Neutrons stars are incredibly dense, spin

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:02.120
rapidly, and have very strong magnetic fields.
Some of them we see as pulsars, flashing in

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.999
brightness as they spin. Neutrons stars with
the strongest magnetic fields are called magnetars,

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:12.059
and are capable of colossal bursts of energy
that can be detected over vast distances.
