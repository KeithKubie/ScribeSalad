00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] I wrote this version of the function,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and as soon as I wrote it, as I was recording this video I set it running.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And you know what? It's still running. It hasn't completed yet.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've got to admit I've done this before, so I have an idea of how long it's going to take.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But we're in a race with it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's see if before it completes--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we know it's going to take on the order of an hour or so--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
can we write a program that's better and faster

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and maybe even though that program's got a head start,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we can catch up with it and finish first?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The problem with this program is it goes through all this work

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to try all the 5 factorial to the 5th combinations

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then they get ruled out really early.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And some of the combinations, it seems silly that we're bothering with them.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So if the Englishman is not red, we should know that

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
by the time we've got through the second set of assignments here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here we've assigned red to some house and Englishman to some house.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If we didn't assign them to the same house,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
why are we bothering to go through all the possibilities for the other properties?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And so what we could do is move this constraint up to the earliest time

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in which both Englishman and red are defined, so there.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now I've moved it up, and now if Englishman is red is false,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
then we don't even have to bother to go through all 3 of these loops.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So we're going to eliminate a lot of work in just that 1 clause.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Now let's consider another of the constraints.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Let's look at immediate right of green and ivory.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Can we move that up? And where can we move it up to?

00:01:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Can we move imright(green, ivory) up to here, here, here, or here?
