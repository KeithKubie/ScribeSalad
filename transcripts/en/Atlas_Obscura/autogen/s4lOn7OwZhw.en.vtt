the fact that we get to see a bubble
 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.560
the fact that we get to see a bubble
here perfectly still is crazy we know

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570
here perfectly still is crazy we know
 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.539
here perfectly still is crazy we know
it's a perfect sphere because if any

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549
it's a perfect sphere because if any
 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.459
it's a perfect sphere because if any
point was more weighted or less it would

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469
point was more weighted or less it would
 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.050
point was more weighted or less it would
tip and it would pop and it would break

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060
tip and it would pop and it would break
 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.609

so this is at 6 times let's go to 10

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619
so this is at 6 times let's go to 10
 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.400
so this is at 6 times let's go to 10
like

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410
 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.810
all this stuff in the background that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
all this stuff in the background that
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.700
all this stuff in the background that
looks blurry as you roll through the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
looks blurry as you roll through the
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170
looks blurry as you roll through the
focus you get the different points that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
focus you get the different points that
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.170
focus you get the different points that
come out when we stack that it'll create

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
come out when we stack that it'll create
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030
come out when we stack that it'll create
these little stars and it's gonna look

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
these little stars and it's gonna look
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.420
these little stars and it's gonna look
like space like Celeste you and you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
like space like Celeste you and you
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.090
like space like Celeste you and you
can't see it now but you will once you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
can't see it now but you will once you
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.190
can't see it now but you will once you
put everything together I want the final

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
put everything together I want the final
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740
put everything together I want the final
thing to give you the same feeling it

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
thing to give you the same feeling it
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.940
thing to give you the same feeling it
gives me when I see it for the first

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
gives me when I see it for the first
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.130
gives me when I see it for the first
time like this is the edge of onion skin

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140
time like this is the edge of onion skin
 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.300
time like this is the edge of onion skin
look at that there's so much texture

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310
look at that there's so much texture
 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.950
look at that there's so much texture
there's just there's an entire worlds in

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960
there's just there's an entire worlds in
 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.500
there's just there's an entire worlds in
this stuff everything's from this point

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
this stuff everything's from this point
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.280
this stuff everything's from this point
on it's untitled

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
on it's untitled
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.560
on it's untitled
because if I tell you what it is you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570
because if I tell you what it is you
 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.380
because if I tell you what it is you
then go in thinking you know what's up

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390
then go in thinking you know what's up
 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.390
then go in thinking you know what's up
and you stop staying up and you actually

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400
and you stop staying up and you actually
 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.640
and you stop staying up and you actually
close off so if I don't tell you what it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
close off so if I don't tell you what it
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.330
close off so if I don't tell you what it
is you get to imagine and if I can keep

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
is you get to imagine and if I can keep
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.610
is you get to imagine and if I can keep
you in wonder for a minute I might open

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
you in wonder for a minute I might open
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.440
you in wonder for a minute I might open
you up a tiny bit it's not about what I

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
you up a tiny bit it's not about what I
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.760
you up a tiny bit it's not about what I
think it's about what you think and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
think it's about what you think and
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.199
think it's about what you think and
that's where real connection actually

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
that's where real connection actually
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.060
that's where real connection actually
happens not just between associations

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070
happens not just between associations
 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.010
happens not just between associations
and ideas but between people so if

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
and ideas but between people so if
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.900
and ideas but between people so if
you're looking for common ground start

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910
you're looking for common ground start
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.870
you're looking for common ground start
with food because everybody eats and it

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880
with food because everybody eats and it
 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.000
with food because everybody eats and it
all comes from the same place
