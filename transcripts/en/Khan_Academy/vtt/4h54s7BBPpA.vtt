00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.200
Find the domain
of f of x is equal

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.920
to the principal square
root of 2x minus 8.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.620
So the domain of
a function is just

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.000
the set of all of the possible
valid inputs into the function,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.380
or all of the possible
values for which

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.700
the function is defined.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.340
And when we look at how the
function is defined, right

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.070
over here, as the square root,
the principal square root of 2x

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.790
minus 8, it's only
going to be defined

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.620
when it's taking the
principal square root

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.770
of a non-negative number.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.940
And so 2x minus
8, it's only going

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.030
to be defined when 2x minus 8
is greater than or equal to 0.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.530
It can be 0, because then you
just take the square root of 0

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.420
is 0.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.682
It can be positive.

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:43.640
But if this was negative,
then all of a sudden,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.130
this principle square root
function, which we're assuming

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.950
is just the plain vanilla
one for real numbers,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.510
it would not be defined.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.260
So this function definition is
only defined when 2x minus 8

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.250
is greater than or equal to 0.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.500
And then we could
say if 2x minus 8

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.220
has to be greater
than or equal to 0,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.990
we can solve this
inequality to see

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.630
what it's saying about
what x has to be.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.650
So if we add 8 to both
sides of this inequality,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.620
you get-- so let me just
add 8 to both sides.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.710
These 8's cancel out.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.451
You get 2x is greater
than or equal to 8.

00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.000
0 plus 8 is 8.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.010
And then you divide
both sides by 2.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.710
Since 2 is a
positive number, you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.610
don't have to swap
the inequality.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.680
So you divide both sides by 2.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.450
And you get x needs to be
greater than or equal to 4.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.070
So the domain here is the
set of all real numbers that

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.879
are greater than
or equal to 4. x

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.420
has to be greater
than or equal to 4.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.253
Or another way of saying
it is this function

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:44.410
is defined when x is
greater than or equal to 4.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.730
And we're done.
