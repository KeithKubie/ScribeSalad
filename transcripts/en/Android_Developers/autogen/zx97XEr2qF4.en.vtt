00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040
inside of one of your classes that will
 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.009
inside of one of your classes that will
certainly work as well by the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019
certainly work as well by the
 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.780
certainly work as well by the
application context is a reasonable way

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
application context is a reasonable way
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.479
application context is a reasonable way
of doing it and so you know I you know

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489
of doing it and so you know I you know
 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.670
of doing it and so you know I you know
again it's not any more secure than

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680
again it's not any more secure than
 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.309
again it's not any more secure than
anything else you know but I think it's

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319
anything else you know but I think it's
 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.530
anything else you know but I think it's
a certainly a reasonable place to store

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540
a certainly a reasonable place to store
 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.789
a certainly a reasonable place to store
that kind of data if it's going to be

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799
that kind of data if it's going to be
 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.160
that kind of data if it's going to be
used within the session so that the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
used within the session so that the
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.620
used within the session so that the
depth at W guys any yeah any other

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630
depth at W guys any yeah any other
 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.750
depth at W guys any yeah any other
comments on right I personally lean

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760
comments on right I personally lean
 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.880
comments on right I personally lean
toward using the singleton just because

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890
toward using the singleton just because
 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.880
toward using the singleton just because
ya feel like writing the application

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890
ya feel like writing the application
 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.930
ya feel like writing the application
kinda like creating your own application

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
kinda like creating your own application
 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.420
kinda like creating your own application
class yeah is something that tends to

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430
class yeah is something that tends to
 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.780
class yeah is something that tends to
get tends to get done incorrectly often

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790
get tends to get done incorrectly often
 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.330
get tends to get done incorrectly often
and we'd all sorts of difficult to track

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
and we'd all sorts of difficult to track
 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.580
and we'd all sorts of difficult to track
down bugs so i'd personally lean toward

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590
down bugs so i'd personally lean toward
 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.690
down bugs so i'd personally lean toward
singleton if you're comfortable actually

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700
singleton if you're comfortable actually
 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.690
singleton if you're comfortable actually
writing the application context and

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700
writing the application context and
 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.250
writing the application context and
doing it that way then yeah go ahead

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260
doing it that way then yeah go ahead
 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.659
doing it that way then yeah go ahead
yeah I mean that's kind of that's kinda

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669
yeah I mean that's kind of that's kinda
 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.310
yeah I mean that's kind of that's kinda
what the application context is for you

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320
what the application context is for you
 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.140
what the application context is for you
know so it kind of it's kind of it's

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150
know so it kind of it's kind of it's
 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.610
know so it kind of it's kind of it's
kind of a few but you have multiple ways

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620
kind of a few but you have multiple ways
 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.170
kind of a few but you have multiple ways
of attacking this problem and I think

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180
of attacking this problem and I think
 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.820
of attacking this problem and I think
they're all they all have valid valid

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830
they're all they all have valid valid
 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.510
they're all they all have valid valid
good reasons for doing them that way ok

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520
good reasons for doing them that way ok
 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.090
good reasons for doing them that way ok
thank you um do we have a question from

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100
thank you um do we have a question from
 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.600
thank you um do we have a question from
someone in the Hangout No okay um during

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610
someone in the Hangout No okay um during
 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.480
someone in the Hangout No okay um during
the 2011 go we were told that we'd hear

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490
the 2011 go we were told that we'd hear
 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.610
the 2011 go we were told that we'd hear
more about Android at home in the coming

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620
more about Android at home in the coming
 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.890
more about Android at home in the coming
months and that the first light bulbs

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900
months and that the first light bulbs
 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.710
months and that the first light bulbs
would be sold by the end of 2011 the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720
would be sold by the end of 2011 the
 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.750
would be sold by the end of 2011 the
Android developer website still has no

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760
Android developer website still has no
 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.120
Android developer website still has no
reference to it what happened well there

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130
reference to it what happened well there
 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.290
reference to it what happened well there
are a lot of light bulbs on sale right

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300
are a lot of light bulbs on sale right
 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.270
are a lot of light bulbs on sale right
now so i think i think that you know in

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280
now so i think i think that you know in
 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.980
now so i think i think that you know in
general you know i went to the store in

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990
general you know i went to the store in
 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.140
general you know i went to the store in
boston just the other day so I think the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150
boston just the other day so I think the
 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.730
boston just the other day so I think the
comet the first light bulbs would be on

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740
comet the first light bulbs would be on
 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.990
comet the first light bulbs would be on
sale before the end of two thousand

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000
sale before the end of two thousand
 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.700
sale before the end of two thousand
certainly has happened because because

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710
certainly has happened because because
 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.190
certainly has happened because because
I've managed to do that multiple times

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200
I've managed to do that multiple times
 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.170
I've managed to do that multiple times
you know the truth is that the coming

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180
you know the truth is that the coming
 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.700
you know the truth is that the coming
months are still there's still plenty

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710
months are still there's still plenty
 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.040
months are still there's still plenty
more months and and that we can't

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050
more months and and that we can't
 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.510
more months and and that we can't
comment about things that have not been

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520
comment about things that have not been
 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.260
comment about things that have not been
released it's good point it is a

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270
released it's good point it is a
 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.850
released it's good point it is a
variation on the time machine in

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860
variation on the time machine in
 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.820
variation on the time machine in
question is it is that's true actually

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830
question is it is that's true actually
 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.530
question is it is that's true actually
we do have it we did the time we had the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540
we do have it we did the time we had the
 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.760
we do have it we did the time we had the
time machine on my baby was raised so

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770
time machine on my baby was raised so
 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.140
time machine on my baby was raised so
it's not the sound quite like a time

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150
it's not the sound quite like a time
 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.360
it's not the sound quite like a time
machine question right still a what's

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370
machine question right still a what's
 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.860
machine question right still a what's
going on with this thing that I like but

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870
going on with this thing that I like but
 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.260
going on with this thing that I like but
at least we can't talk about right right

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270
at least we can't talk about right right
 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.420
at least we can't talk about right right
exactly I think there I think we're

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430
exactly I think there I think we're
 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.029
exactly I think there I think we're
being baited I think they let they want

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039
being baited I think they let they want
 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.560
being baited I think they let they want
this we were kind of creative answers we

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570
this we were kind of creative answers we
 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.850
this we were kind of creative answers we
could come up with the we can't talk

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860
could come up with the we can't talk
 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.420
could come up with the we can't talk
about that and later and yeah I so I

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430
about that and later and yeah I so I
 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.810
about that and later and yeah I so I
wait to be a better feeling better today

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820
wait to be a better feeling better today
 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.330
wait to be a better feeling better today
okay let's move on um what is the best

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340
okay let's move on um what is the best
 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.550
okay let's move on um what is the best
way to implement a quick action like

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560
way to implement a quick action like
 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.210
way to implement a quick action like
widget in an ICS context I mean this is

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220
widget in an ICS context I mean this is
 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.670
widget in an ICS context I mean this is
not an official way to do it and Android

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680
not an official way to do it and Android
 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.150
not an official way to do it and Android
what could replace it so i think i think

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160
what could replace it so i think i think
 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.040
what could replace it so i think i think
i think i'd love to eventually defer to

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050
i think i'd love to eventually defer to
 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.879
i think i'd love to eventually defer to
Roman on this one but the answer is

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889
Roman on this one but the answer is
 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.770
Roman on this one but the answer is
you know in terms of Android we've moved

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780
you know in terms of Android we've moved
 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.950
you know in terms of Android we've moved
away from that quick actions metaphor as

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960
away from that quick actions metaphor as
 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.749
away from that quick actions metaphor as
a general rule if you look at what we've

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759
a general rule if you look at what we've
 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.809
a general rule if you look at what we've
done in ICS in terms of contacts we now

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:36.819
done in ICS in terms of contacts we now
 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.339
done in ICS in terms of contacts we now
actually display something that's more

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349
actually display something that's more
 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.129
actually display something that's more
akin to a dialogue it's actually a view

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139
akin to a dialogue it's actually a view
 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.950
akin to a dialogue it's actually a view
that that that pops up on top of the

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960
that that that pops up on top of the
 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.649
that that that pops up on top of the
existing view for contacts and gives you

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:46.659
existing view for contacts and gives you
 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:47.909
existing view for contacts and gives you
a whole bunch of different options that

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919
a whole bunch of different options that
 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:49.709
a whole bunch of different options that
being said if you really do like that

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719
being said if you really do like that
 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.989
being said if you really do like that
paradigm green droid has a pretty good

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:51.999
paradigm green droid has a pretty good
 

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:54.510
paradigm green droid has a pretty good
implementation of it and and you know

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520
implementation of it and and you know
 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.640
implementation of it and and you know
that's certainly one place to look but

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650
that's certainly one place to look but
 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.899
that's certainly one place to look but
there really isn't some place in the

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909
there really isn't some place in the
 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:59.459
there really isn't some place in the
framework I would look in terms of ICS

00:06:59.459 --> 00:06:59.469
framework I would look in terms of ICS
 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:00.480
framework I would look in terms of ICS
because that's something that we've

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490
because that's something that we've
 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.700
because that's something that we've

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.779
think and giving a user a little bit
more detail and those actions simplifies

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789
more detail and those actions simplifies
 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:15.839
more detail and those actions simplifies
the experience and so I think I really

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:15.849
the experience and so I think I really
 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:17.580
the experience and so I think I really
like the change we made the contacts in

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590
like the change we made the contacts in
 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.950
like the change we made the contacts in
that but certainly if you're enamored

call out to the anchor view we've kind
of moved away from that and for quick

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:42.819
of moved away from that and for quick
 

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:45.089

towards this kind of this transient

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:47.860
towards this kind of this transient
 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.189
towards this kind of this transient
pop-up that you can interact with but

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:50.199
pop-up that you can interact with but
 

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.990
pop-up that you can interact with but
for quick actions which basically let

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000
for quick actions which basically let
 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.719
for quick actions which basically let
you just for those who aren't aware of

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:54.729
you just for those who aren't aware of
 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:57.269
you just for those who aren't aware of
the pattern it basically what you take

00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:57.279
the pattern it basically what you take
 

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:00.209
the pattern it basically what you take
contextual actions like for example

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:00.219
contextual actions like for example
 

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:04.409
contextual actions like for example
reply or star or worth delete or edit

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:04.419
reply or star or worth delete or edit
 

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:06.540
reply or star or worth delete or edit
okay good good point those go in the

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:06.550
okay good good point those go in the
 

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.519
okay good good point those go in the
action bar brunette all right so

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:08.529
action bar brunette all right so
 

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.469
action bar brunette all right so
basically for contextual actions on

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479
basically for contextual actions on
 

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:13.050
basically for contextual actions on
items we've moved more towards something

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:13.060
items we've moved more towards something
 

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.179
items we've moved more towards something
called a contextual action bar and so

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:15.189
called a contextual action bar and so
 

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:17.040
called a contextual action bar and so
what happens is if you're in a list of

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.050
what happens is if you're in a list of
 

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.869
what happens is if you're in a list of
items and you want to allow the user to

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879
items and you want to allow the user to
 

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:22.050
items and you want to allow the user to
to edit or delete one of those items you

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.060
to edit or delete one of those items you
 

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.059
to edit or delete one of those items you
basically trigger the contextual action

00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:24.069
basically trigger the contextual action
 

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:27.809
basically trigger the contextual action
bar by long pressing on one of the items

00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:27.819
bar by long pressing on one of the items
 

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:29.790
bar by long pressing on one of the items
and the nice thing about the contextual

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800
and the nice thing about the contextual
 

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.320
and the nice thing about the contextual
action bar is that it can be used for

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.330
action bar is that it can be used for
 

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.689
action bar is that it can be used for
both single and multiple selection not

00:08:33.689 --> 00:08:33.699
both single and multiple selection not
 

00:08:33.699 --> 00:08:35.430
both single and multiple selection not
on a mobile device I mean oftentimes

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440
on a mobile device I mean oftentimes
 

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.610
on a mobile device I mean oftentimes
you're doing stuff on single items but I

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:38.620
you're doing stuff on single items but I
 

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.839
you're doing stuff on single items but I
mean there are definitely cases where

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:39.849
mean there are definitely cases where
 

00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:40.420
mean there are definitely cases where
you

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:40.430
you
 

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.700
you
want to just batch process three things

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:42.710
want to just batch process three things
 

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.760
want to just batch process three things
for things like batch archive emails for

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:45.770
for things like batch archive emails for
 

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.100
for things like batch archive emails for
example and so to do that the contextual

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:48.110
example and so to do that the contextual
 

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.350
example and so to do that the contextual
action bar allows you to basically long

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360
action bar allows you to basically long
 

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.269
action bar allows you to basically long
press on the first and then single press

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279
press on the first and then single press
 

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:54.070
press on the first and then single press
on the other items you want to operate

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080
on the other items you want to operate
 

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.190
on the other items you want to operate
on and then trigger an action now so so

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200
on and then trigger an action now so so
 

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.320
on and then trigger an action now so so
that's that's one of the reasons why

00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.330
that's that's one of the reasons why
 

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.570
that's that's one of the reasons why
we've moved away from quick chek quick

Friday review there are some apps that
 

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.250
Friday review there are some apps that
use checkboxes for different things like

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:42.260
use checkboxes for different things like
 

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.710
use checkboxes for different things like
for example task lists these checkboxes

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720
for example task lists these checkboxes
 

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.210
for example task lists these checkboxes
tend to get uh something's completed

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:46.220

the reasons they use checkbox is that

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.240
the reasons they use checkbox is that
 

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.180
the reasons they use checkbox is that

it's really kind of a legacy item from
 

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.160
it's really kind of a legacy item from
the from the desktop era I'll not the

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:09.170
the from the desktop era I'll not the
 

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.769
the from the desktop era I'll not the

gmail com it kind of makes a lot of
 

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.030
gmail com it kind of makes a lot of
sense in that case but I don't think

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.040
sense in that case but I don't think
 

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.850
sense in that case but I don't think
it's something that generally applies

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:23.860
it's something that generally applies
 

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.069
it's something that generally applies
right that's a good point yeah that's

00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079
right that's a good point yeah that's
 

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:28.480
right that's a good point yeah that's

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680
application i say well this is how to
 

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.500
application i say well this is how to
implement quick actions and i think that

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:32.510
implement quick actions and i think that
 

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.329
implement quick actions and i think that
you know yeah i think it's a general

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:34.339
you know yeah i think it's a general
 

00:10:34.339 --> 00:10:36.460
you know yeah i think it's a general
rule that's sort of how not to implement

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:36.470
rule that's sort of how not to implement
 

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.050
rule that's sort of how not to implement
quick action i think if we were if we

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.060
quick action i think if we were if we
 

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.710
quick action i think if we were if we
were building gmail from scratch with no

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720
were building gmail from scratch with no
 

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.350
were building gmail from scratch with no
no weapon app this is just my opinion we

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360
no weapon app this is just my opinion we
 

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.300
no weapon app this is just my opinion we
were building it from scratch and we had

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:46.310
were building it from scratch and we had
 

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.730
were building it from scratch and we had
started from the ICS version of gmail

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:48.740
started from the ICS version of gmail
 

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.829
started from the ICS version of gmail
and not had kind of legacy support for

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839
and not had kind of legacy support for
 

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:52.600
and not had kind of legacy support for
brilliant render me like that we

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:52.610
brilliant render me like that we
 

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.720
brilliant render me like that we
probably would not object

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:53.730
probably would not object
 

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.069
probably would not object
right okay we've actually got another

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079
right okay we've actually got another
 

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.379
right okay we've actually got another
question from the from the Hangout from

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:00.389
question from the from the Hangout from
 

00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:01.910
question from the from the Hangout from
Elizabeth if you want to cross over

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920
Elizabeth if you want to cross over
 

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.139
Elizabeth if you want to cross over
there yeah hi I had a couple of things

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:06.149
there yeah hi I had a couple of things
 

00:11:06.149 --> 00:11:07.879
there yeah hi I had a couple of things
that I wanted to talk about actually the

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:07.889
that I wanted to talk about actually the
 

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:10.699
that I wanted to talk about actually the
first one is some grid layout I'm having

00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:10.709
first one is some grid layout I'm having
 

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:14.329
first one is some grid layout I'm having
some trouble understanding it I posted a

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339
some trouble understanding it I posted a
 

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:17.000
some trouble understanding it I posted a
question to stack overflow and got a

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.010
question to stack overflow and got a
 

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.960
question to stack overflow and got a
quick answer um basically trying to make

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:20.970
quick answer um basically trying to make
 

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.960
quick answer um basically trying to make
like a weighted layout and so I've got

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:23.970
like a weighted layout and so I've got
 

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.319
like a weighted layout and so I've got
four items i divided the grid into nine

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:27.329
four items i divided the grid into nine
 

00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:30.949
four items i divided the grid into nine
rows and nine columns and then my first

00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959
rows and nine columns and then my first
 

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:35.000
rows and nine columns and then my first
item is at 11 my next item is at 15 but

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.010
item is at 11 my next item is at 15 but
 

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.389
item is at 11 my next item is at 15 but
I'm finding that row 0 isn't there

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399
I'm finding that row 0 isn't there
 

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.790
I'm finding that row 0 isn't there
there's no margins when I actually

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800
there's no margins when I actually
 

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.180
there's no margins when I actually
display it there's no Rosie row in the

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:44.190
display it there's no Rosie row in the
 

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.600
display it there's no Rosie row in the
middle row well it's a lot larger it's

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:47.610
middle row well it's a lot larger it's
 

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.210
middle row well it's a lot larger it's
that's not behaving as I expect so I'm

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220
that's not behaving as I expect so I'm
 

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.840
that's not behaving as I expect so I'm
wondering if you have some more examples

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:53.850
wondering if you have some more examples
 

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.530
wondering if you have some more examples
or documentation and you know why if I'm

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540
or documentation and you know why if I'm
 

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.189
or documentation and you know why if I'm
using explicit notation about spanning

00:12:01.189 --> 00:12:01.199
using explicit notation about spanning
 

00:12:01.199 --> 00:12:03.949
using explicit notation about spanning
rows and columns it's not really doing

00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959
rows and columns it's not really doing
 

00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:06.259
rows and columns it's not really doing
anything I tried to throw a space in

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:06.269
anything I tried to throw a space in
 

00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:08.840
anything I tried to throw a space in
there and row 0 and that had no effect

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:08.850
there and row 0 and that had no effect
 

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.129
there and row 0 and that had no effect
at all so how does space work and is

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:13.139
at all so how does space work and is
 

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.050
at all so how does space work and is
there are there some more examples of

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060
there are there some more examples of
 

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.639
there are there some more examples of
grid layout so I i think that the grid

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:19.649
grid layout so I i think that the grid
 

00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:23.769
grid layout so I i think that the grid
layout is one of those things I liken to

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:23.779
layout is one of those things I liken to
 

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:26.300
layout is one of those things I liken to
I kind of I kind of I kind of look at it

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:26.310
I kind of I kind of I kind of look at it
 

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.490
I kind of I kind of I kind of look at it
almost like I'd be pearl in the sense

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500
almost like I'd be pearl in the sense
 

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.230
almost like I'd be pearl in the sense
that it's something that's that well

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240
that it's something that's that well
 

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.610
that it's something that's that well
actually kind of the opposite problem um

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620
actually kind of the opposite problem um
 

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.379
actually kind of the opposite problem um
it's something that I think it's bet

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:33.389
it's something that I think it's bet
 

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:35.569
it's something that I think it's bet
it's best to have machines right and not

00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:35.579
it's best to have machines right and not
 

00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:37.639
it's best to have machines right and not
people right you know it's pretty

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:37.649
people right you know it's pretty
 

00:12:37.649 --> 00:12:39.829
people right you know it's pretty
complicated it's tricky to get all of

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839
complicated it's tricky to get all of
 

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:42.470
complicated it's tricky to get all of
its nuances right it's incredibly

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480
its nuances right it's incredibly
 

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.410
its nuances right it's incredibly
powerful but in even internally it's one

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420
powerful but in even internally it's one
 

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.240
powerful but in even internally it's one
of those things where you know if when

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.250
of those things where you know if when
 

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.769
of those things where you know if when
we're when we're hand hand Creek

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779
we're when we're hand hand Creek
 

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:51.110
we're when we're hand hand Creek
crafting layouts we usually avoid using

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120
crafting layouts we usually avoid using
 

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.750
crafting layouts we usually avoid using
it and obviously that it's one of those

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760
it and obviously that it's one of those
 

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.480
it and obviously that it's one of those
things that just begs to have a tool to

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:56.490
things that just begs to have a tool to
 

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.879
things that just begs to have a tool to
really work with well you know I think I

00:12:58.879 --> 00:12:58.889
really work with well you know I think I
 

00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:00.050
really work with well you know I think I
think that's kind of been our own

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060
think that's kind of been our own
 

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.199
think that's kind of been our own
internal look at is that it's it's this

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:02.209
internal look at is that it's it's this
 

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:05.480
internal look at is that it's it's this
incredibly powerful system that

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:05.490
incredibly powerful system that
 

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.660
incredibly powerful system that
that that is that if you use machines to

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:08.670
that that is that if you use machines to
 

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.160
that that is that if you use machines to
build stuff it actually it actually

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:10.170
build stuff it actually it actually
 

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.360
build stuff it actually it actually
makes a lot of sense i think it's i

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:11.370
makes a lot of sense i think it's i
 

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.820
makes a lot of sense i think it's i
think it's tricky to handcraft them and

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:13.830
think it's tricky to handcraft them and
 

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.769
think it's tricky to handcraft them and
that's probably part of it probably part

00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779
that's probably part of it probably part
 

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:16.730
that's probably part of it probably part
of the reason why you're not seeing a

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740
of the reason why you're not seeing a
 

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.620
of the reason why you're not seeing a
lot of stuff from us i'm hoping you know

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:18.630
lot of stuff from us i'm hoping you know
 

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.180
lot of stuff from us i'm hoping you know
at some point of the future you know

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:20.190
at some point of the future you know
 

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.220
at some point of the future you know
someone will write a tool to do that but

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:22.230
someone will write a tool to do that but
 

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.650
someone will write a tool to do that but
that's that's i think i think that's

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660
that's that's i think i think that's
 

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.970
that's that's i think i think that's
that's kind of the issue with it it's a

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:25.980
that's kind of the issue with it it's a
 

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.310
that's kind of the issue with it it's a
very it's kind of a future thinking kind

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320
very it's kind of a future thinking kind
 

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.260
very it's kind of a future thinking kind
of way out I don't know there's a if

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:30.270
of way out I don't know there's a if
 

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.880
of way out I don't know there's a if
anyone has any specific comments on her

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:31.890
anyone has any specific comments on her
 

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.970
anyone has any specific comments on her
on her question Roman yeah I could I

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:34.980
on her question Roman yeah I could I
 

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.910
on her question Roman yeah I could I
could add a couple of things they're so

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920
could add a couple of things they're so
 

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.110
could add a couple of things they're so
so using the space that was actually one

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120
so using the space that was actually one
 

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.010
so using the space that was actually one
thing I was going to mention is if

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:40.020
thing I was going to mention is if
 

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.420
thing I was going to mention is if
you're not using a space then you know

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:41.430
you're not using a space then you know
 

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.300
you're not using a space then you know
any any row or a column that has no

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:44.310
any any row or a column that has no
 

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.940
any any row or a column that has no
items in it is is not gonna take up any

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:46.950
items in it is is not gonna take up any
 

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.570
items in it is is not gonna take up any
space um so you just put a space in and

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:50.580
space um so you just put a space in and
 

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.470
space um so you just put a space in and
I had it span the whole all nine columns

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480
I had it span the whole all nine columns
 

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.030
I had it span the whole all nine columns
but it didn't change the appearance at

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040
but it didn't change the appearance at
 

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.449
but it didn't change the appearance at
all so and also i'm using the version 7

00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459
all so and also i'm using the version 7
 

00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:01.010
all so and also i'm using the version 7
you know the backward compatible because

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:01.020
you know the backward compatible because
 

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.639
you know the backward compatible because
i'm trying to bridge enjoy to an android

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:04.649
i'm trying to bridge enjoy to an android
 

00:14:04.649 --> 00:14:06.949
i'm trying to bridge enjoy to an android
core yeah yeah yeah so one thing you

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959
core yeah yeah yeah so one thing you
 

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.540
core yeah yeah yeah so one thing you
should make sure is that the spaces have

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:08.550
should make sure is that the spaces have
 

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.780
should make sure is that the spaces have
like a fixed height or a minimum light

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:10.790
like a fixed height or a minimum light
 

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.400

question was around layout or weights

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800

like kind of a percentage-based layout

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:34.649
like kind of a percentage-based layout
 

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:36.860
like kind of a percentage-based layout
and and one of the points on the

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:36.870
and and one of the points on the
 

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.810
and and one of the points on the
documentation is that you can definitely

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:38.820
documentation is that you can definitely
 

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.610
documentation is that you can definitely
combine grid layout and linear layout

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.620

percentages good layout not so much so

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:47.670
percentages good layout not so much so
 

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.250
percentages good layout not so much so
so feel free to combine the two don't

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260
so feel free to combine the two don't
 

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.840
so feel free to combine the two don't
feel like you have to constrain yourself

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:50.850

the documentation in a particular layout
 

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.639
the documentation in a particular layout
only has four items so I probably will

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:04.649
only has four items so I probably will
 

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:07.220

um I have the four buttons and I want
them centered on the screen they're

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120
them centered on the screen they're
 

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.230
them centered on the screen they're
equal size and you know I don't want

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240
equal size and you know I don't want
 

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.439
equal size and you know I don't want
them top left I want them to show up in

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:00.449
them top left I want them to show up in
 

00:16:00.449 --> 00:16:02.210
them top left I want them to show up in
the middle yeah you usually the way I

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220
the middle yeah you usually the way I

usually the way I solve that problem is

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:04.470
usually the way I solve that problem is
 

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.740
usually the way I solve that problem is
by is by using wave layouts and linear

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:06.750

labs and I put I put in is my point I

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:09.389
labs and I put I put in is my point I
 

00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:12.379
labs and I put I put in is my point I
want to learn great yeah exactly I want

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:12.389
want to learn great yeah exactly I want
 

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.119
want to learn great yeah exactly I want
to figure out how it works and it's not

00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:14.129
to figure out how it works and it's not
 

00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:16.519
to figure out how it works and it's not
working as i expect yeah okay absolutely

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:16.529
working as i expect yeah okay absolutely
 

00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:17.900
working as i expect yeah okay absolutely
and that's I think I possibly working

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:17.910
and that's I think I possibly working
 

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.280
and that's I think I possibly working
and I think from our perspective by

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.290
and I think from our perspective by
 

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.439
and I think from our perspective by
putting it into the v7 support library

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:21.449
putting it into the v7 support library
 

00:16:21.449 --> 00:16:23.300
putting it into the v7 support library
you know we were really committed to it

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:23.310
you know we were really committed to it
 

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.740
you know we were really committed to it
we want people to start being able to

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:24.750
we want people to start being able to
 

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.150
we want people to start being able to
use it i think it's just a question of

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160
use it i think it's just a question of
 

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.129
use it i think it's just a question of
getting the point where you know again

00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139
getting the point where you know again
 

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:29.329
getting the point where you know again
we have that we have the tools and

00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339
we have that we have the tools and
 

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:31.370
we have that we have the tools and
documentation to really support it but i

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380
documentation to really support it but i
 

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.470
documentation to really support it but i
think i can't quite find attacks right

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480
think i can't quite find attacks right
 

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.050

additional pointers or sites that I
 

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.780
additional pointers or sites that I
should check yeah I think I think would

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:47.790
should check yeah I think I think would
 

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.280

perspective once we've gone and put it

00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839
perspective once we've gone and put it
 

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:53.240
perspective once we've gone and put it
in the support library I think that it's

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:53.250
in the support library I think that it's
 

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.920
in the support library I think that it's
our intention to support it so I'm

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:54.930
our intention to support it so I'm
 

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.290

that we need to have more written up
 

00:17:09.659 --> 00:17:11.510
that we need to have more written up
about grid layout we definitely support

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520
about grid layout we definitely support
 

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.819
about grid layout we definitely support
it and it's hard for people to use so

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:13.829
it and it's hard for people to use so
 

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.770
it and it's hard for people to use so
we'll have to look at it some more go

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780
we'll have to look at it some more go
 

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.669
we'll have to look at it some more go

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:44.960
view and you know I'm setting it up to a
lips eyes now I want to let the user be

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:44.970
lips eyes now I want to let the user be
 

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.169
lips eyes now I want to let the user be
able to maybe touch it if the text is

00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179
able to maybe touch it if the text is
 

00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:51.260
able to maybe touch it if the text is
truncated and somehow or other view the

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:51.270
truncated and somehow or other view the
 

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:56.029
truncated and somehow or other view the
full content in the smaller screen sizes

00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039
full content in the smaller screen sizes
 

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:57.860
full content in the smaller screen sizes
where the text view is getting truncated

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:57.870
where the text view is getting truncated
 

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.250
where the text view is getting truncated
but do you have a good strategy for that

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260
but do you have a good strategy for that
 

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.760
but do you have a good strategy for that
like handling a lips eyes textin and you

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:04.770
like handling a lips eyes textin and you
 

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.440
like handling a lips eyes textin and you
know being able to display the full

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.450
know being able to display the full
 

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.870
know being able to display the full
content in some way or another is there

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880
content in some way or another is there
 

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.430
content in some way or another is there
a good pattern for that Roman in terms

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440
a good pattern for that Roman in terms
 

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.140
a good pattern for that Roman in terms
of you know something that we've exposed

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:12.150
of you know something that we've exposed
 

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.020
of you know something that we've exposed
we've talked about um not that I'm not

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:15.030
we've talked about um not that I'm not
 

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.029
we've talked about um not that I'm not
that I'm aware of the only and this is

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039
that I'm aware of the only and this is
 

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:18.649
that I'm aware of the only and this is
kind of a stretch but the only thing

00:18:18.649 --> 00:18:18.659
kind of a stretch but the only thing
 

00:18:18.659 --> 00:18:20.840
kind of a stretch but the only thing
that i have seen that's even relevant to

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:20.850
that i have seen that's even relevant to
 

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.020
that i have seen that's even relevant to
this I think is in terms of interaction

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.030
this I think is in terms of interaction
 

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:28.220
this I think is in terms of interaction
if you have a text view that let's say

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:28.230
if you have a text view that let's say
 

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.049
if you have a text view that let's say
is three lines or three lines of text

00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:30.059
is three lines or three lines of text
 

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:32.930
is three lines or three lines of text
and you only see two lines of text if

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940
and you only see two lines of text if
 

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.810
and you only see two lines of text if
you mark the text view as text is

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820
you mark the text view as text is
 

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.779
you mark the text view as text is
selectable if you give it that attribute

00:18:38.779 --> 00:18:38.789
selectable if you give it that attribute
 

00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:40.190
selectable if you give it that attribute
and now this is this is obviously going

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200
and now this is this is obviously going
 

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.990
and now this is this is obviously going
to make text selectable so you'll have a

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000
to make text selectable so you'll have a
 

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.880
to make text selectable so you'll have a
contextual action bar to copy and paste

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:43.890
contextual action bar to copy and paste
 

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.310
contextual action bar to copy and paste
if you if you do that if you have an

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320
if you if you do that if you have an
 

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.960
if you if you do that if you have an
attribute not only is it sex selectable

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:47.970
attribute not only is it sex selectable
 

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.450
attribute not only is it sex selectable
but the text is also scroll down right

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460
but the text is also scroll down right
 

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.580
but the text is also scroll down right
so you can actually just you know scroll

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:52.590
so you can actually just you know scroll
 

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.580
so you can actually just you know scroll
it up and down now that that maybe you

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:55.590
it up and down now that that maybe you
 

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.620
it up and down now that that maybe you
may be able to get this behavior through

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:57.630
may be able to get this behavior through
 

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.350
may be able to get this behavior through
another attribute I'm not sure if that

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360
another attribute I'm not sure if that
 

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.250
another attribute I'm not sure if that
exists I mean I know that obviously you

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260
exists I mean I know that obviously you
 

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.870
exists I mean I know that obviously you
can put a textview in a scrollview and

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880
can put a textview in a scrollview and
 

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.700
can put a textview in a scrollview and
that works but I'm not actually sure if

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:07.710
that works but I'm not actually sure if
 

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.770
that works but I'm not actually sure if
you can do that without using text is

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780
you can do that without using text is
 

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.230
you can do that without using text is
selectable but if anything you'd

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240
selectable but if anything you'd
 

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.490
selectable but if anything you'd
probably the interaction that you

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500
probably the interaction that you
 

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.100
probably the interaction that you
probably be going for is upon touching

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:16.110
probably be going for is upon touching
 

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.039
probably be going for is upon touching
you kind of enable scroll but I don't

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:19.049
you kind of enable scroll but I don't
 

00:19:19.049 --> 00:19:21.289
you kind of enable scroll but I don't
think we have any cases and I'm even in

00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299
think we have any cases and I'm even in
 

00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:24.470
think we have any cases and I'm even in
like the Google Play client which does a

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480
like the Google Play client which does a
 

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.810
like the Google Play client which does a
lot of marque scrolling or limb sizing I

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820
lot of marque scrolling or limb sizing I
 

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.580
lot of marque scrolling or limb sizing I
don't think we have many cases where we

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:28.590
don't think we have many cases where we
 

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.710
don't think we have many cases where we
allow that yeah I was an actor there's

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720
allow that yeah I was an actor there's
 

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.270
allow that yeah I was an actor there's
few times where I really wanted that so

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280
few times where I really wanted that so
 

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.130
few times where I really wanted that so
you know that's that's that's why I was

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140
you know that's that's that's why I was
 

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.720
you know that's that's that's why I was
curious if you know what what our

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:35.730
curious if you know what what our
 

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:36.919
curious if you know what what our
current view and that uh not as a

00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:36.929
current view and that uh not as a
 

00:19:36.929 --> 00:19:38.570
current view and that uh not as a
pattern was concerned I mean it was

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580
pattern was concerned I mean it was
 

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.060
pattern was concerned I mean it was
really really important you could always

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.070
really really important you could always
 

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.210
really really important you could always
you know you could always allow the user

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220
you know you could always allow the user
 

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:44.960
you know you could always allow the user
to click on it

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:44.970
to click on it
 

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.490
to click on it
pop something up to that would be that

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500
pop something up to that would be that
 

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.440
pop something up to that would be that
would be the other acceptable pattern as

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:48.450
would be the other acceptable pattern as
 

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.580
would be the other acceptable pattern as
long as you make it clear that it's a

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:49.590
long as you make it clear that it's a
 

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.200
long as you make it clear that it's a
click target you know that might that

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.210
click target you know that might that
 

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.330
click target you know that might that
might also be might also be reasonable

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340
might also be might also be reasonable
 

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.799
might also be might also be reasonable
but yeah I think I think the I think

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:54.809
but yeah I think I think the I think
 

00:19:54.809 --> 00:19:56.180
but yeah I think I think the I think
getting it the scroll would be the best

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:56.190
getting it the scroll would be the best
 

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.399
getting it the scroll would be the best
the best of the world and I like the

00:19:58.399 --> 00:19:58.409
the best of the world and I like the
 

00:19:58.409 --> 00:20:00.649
the best of the world and I like the
idea of making it selectable in general

00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:00.659
idea of making it selectable in general
 

00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:05.870
idea of making it selectable in general

the Hangout was suggesting like one

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:45.700
the Hangout was suggesting like one
 

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.120
the Hangout was suggesting like one
option that you have is to set up a

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:48.130
option that you have is to set up a
 

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.310
option that you have is to set up a
billing server as your own independent

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320
billing server as your own independent
 

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.140
billing server as your own independent
server and then set it up so that when

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.150
server and then set it up so that when
 

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.150
server and then set it up so that when
you do in up billing what that

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:54.160
you do in up billing what that
 

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.890
you do in up billing what that
essentially does is contact your billing

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:55.900
essentially does is contact your billing
 

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.750
essentially does is contact your billing
the server and say this user paid for

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760
the server and say this user paid for
 

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.610
the server and say this user paid for
this item and then what you can do is

00:22:59.610 --> 00:22:59.620
this item and then what you can do is
 

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.320
this item and then what you can do is
set up a coupon system within your app

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:01.330
set up a coupon system within your app
 

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.750
set up a coupon system within your app
so that the user enters a coupon that

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760
so that the user enters a coupon that
 

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.070
so that the user enters a coupon that
would also go to your building server

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080
would also go to your building server
 

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.860
would also go to your building server
and also say like the caesar has this

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:07.870
and also say like the caesar has this
 

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.070
and also say like the caesar has this
item so you would you would need a

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080
item so you would you would need a
 

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.850
item so you would you would need a
basically you'll be setting up an

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:11.860
basically you'll be setting up an
 

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.560
basically you'll be setting up an
external authority on which users have

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:13.570
external authority on which users have
 

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.410
external authority on which users have
access to which in-app purchases instead

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:16.420

that is not a vector you cannot use it

00:35:08.269 --> 00:35:08.279
that is not a vector you cannot use it
 

00:35:08.279 --> 00:35:10.760
that is not a vector you cannot use it
in fact if you try to use it you will

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:10.770
in fact if you try to use it you will
 

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:14.960
in fact if you try to use it you will
find that the system will actually have

will actually restrict you to the

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:17.609
will actually restrict you to the
 

00:35:17.609 --> 00:35:20.240
will actually restrict you to the
application to like the minimum ABI set

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.250
application to like the minimum ABI set
 

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.190

basically it does exactly the opposite

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200
basically it does exactly the opposite
 

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.930
basically it does exactly the opposite
of what you want it to do so so

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940
of what you want it to do so so
 

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.589
of what you want it to do so so
basically don't use it put that yet okay

00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599
basically don't use it put that yet okay
 

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:31.910
basically don't use it put that yet okay

we want our activity detect to detect

00:36:32.539 --> 00:36:32.549
we want our activity detect to detect
 

00:36:32.549 --> 00:36:34.819
we want our activity detect to detect
when the device is in landscape so we

00:36:34.819 --> 00:36:34.829
when the device is in landscape so we
 

00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:37.099
when the device is in landscape so we
can rotate some images but we want our

00:36:37.099 --> 00:36:37.109
can rotate some images but we want our
 

00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:41.539
can rotate some images but we want our
activity to stay in portrait so you can

00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:41.549
activity to stay in portrait so you can
 

00:36:41.549 --> 00:36:46.700
activity to stay in portrait so you can
definitely use the accelerometer ApS in

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:46.710
definitely use the accelerometer ApS in
 

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.599
definitely use the accelerometer ApS in
front of the get 0 is there an

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:47.609
front of the get 0 is there an
 

00:36:47.609 --> 00:36:49.410

try to remember if there's actually I

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:52.690
try to remember if there's actually I
 

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.120
try to remember if there's actually I
don't think we don't actually have any

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.130
don't think we don't actually have any
 

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.950
don't think we don't actually have any
accelerometer gesture supported so I

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960
accelerometer gesture supported so I
 

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.569
accelerometer gesture supported so I
think I think you'd be responsible for

00:36:57.569 --> 00:36:57.579
think I think you'd be responsible for
 

00:36:57.579 --> 00:37:00.440
think I think you'd be responsible for
that certainly applications do do that

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:00.450
that certainly applications do do that
 

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:06.950
that certainly applications do do that
you can also um very good question um I

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960
you can also um very good question um I
 

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.349
you can also um very good question um I
think yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure

00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359
think yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure
 

00:37:10.359 --> 00:37:12.359
think yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure
what the best practices to that so um I

00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:12.369
what the best practices to that so um I
 

00:37:12.369 --> 00:37:13.380
what the best practices to that so um I
don't think we have anything that will

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:13.390
don't think we have anything that will
 

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.849
don't think we have anything that will
say like you're in landscape out here in

00:37:14.849 --> 00:37:14.859
say like you're in landscape out here in
 

00:37:14.859 --> 00:37:16.980
say like you're in landscape out here in
portrait if your screen is locked yeah I

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:16.990
portrait if your screen is locked yeah I
 

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:18.539
portrait if your screen is locked yeah I
mean it will say I mean we do have the

00:37:18.539 --> 00:37:18.549
mean it will say I mean we do have the
 

00:37:18.549 --> 00:37:20.460
mean it will say I mean we do have the
one that sounds like you are tilted 45

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:20.470
one that sounds like you are tilted 45
 

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.870
one that sounds like you are tilted 45
degrees to the left or to the right from

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880
degrees to the left or to the right from
 

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.750
degrees to the left or to the right from
from whatever the native orientation of

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760
from whatever the native orientation of
 

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.940
from whatever the native orientation of
the devices yeah i mean so i guess i

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:26.950
the devices yeah i mean so i guess i
 

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.210
the devices yeah i mean so i guess i
guess the yes you can do that you could

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:30.220
guess the yes you can do that you could
 

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.710
guess the yes you can do that you could
you could just use that and and that's

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720
you could just use that and and that's
 

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.599
you could just use that and and that's
what developers do use is they use they

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:33.609
what developers do use is they use they
 

00:37:33.609 --> 00:37:36.120
what developers do use is they use they
use that they use that API to the two to

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:36.130
use that they use that API to the two to
 

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:37.740
use that they use that API to the two to
decide whether they're going to rotate

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:37.750
decide whether they're going to rotate
 

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.750
decide whether they're going to rotate
or do whatever with in there within

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760
or do whatever with in there within
 

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.809
or do whatever with in there within
their application but yeah there's no

00:37:41.809 --> 00:37:41.819
their application but yeah there's no
 

00:37:41.819 --> 00:37:44.730
their application but yeah there's no
not kind of built-ins way to say I'm at

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:44.740
not kind of built-ins way to say I'm at
 

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.620
not kind of built-ins way to say I'm at
this orientation but you can't look at

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:46.630
this orientation but you can't look at
 

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.329
this orientation but you can't look at
the tilt so it's it's pretty close yeah

00:37:48.329 --> 00:37:48.339
the tilt so it's it's pretty close yeah
 

00:37:48.339 --> 00:37:49.770
the tilt so it's it's pretty close yeah
if you're in the hangar I'm actually

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:49.780
if you're in the hangar I'm actually
 

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.450
if you're in the hangar I'm actually
curious what the use case for this is

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:51.460
curious what the use case for this is
 

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.819
curious what the use case for this is
like I outside of I don't outside of a

00:37:53.819 --> 00:37:53.829
like I outside of I don't outside of a
 

00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:56.130
like I outside of I don't outside of a
compass or something I don't I can't

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:56.140
compass or something I don't I can't
 

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.849

picture like how this is getting used um

00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859
picture like how this is getting used um
 

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:03.270
picture like how this is getting used um
but if you're not that's cool too okay

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280
but if you're not that's cool too okay
 

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.990
but if you're not that's cool too okay

ICS the answer i guess i guess the in

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:22.780
ICS the answer i guess i guess the in
 

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:27.420
ICS the answer i guess i guess the in
general the answer to this is is no i

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:27.430
general the answer to this is is no i
 

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.250
general the answer to this is is no i
think that i think that if you look at

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:29.260
think that i think that if you look at
 

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.349
think that i think that if you look at
the holo UI there's all sorts of places

00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359
the holo UI there's all sorts of places
 

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:34.890
the holo UI there's all sorts of places
where spacing has changed and and i

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:34.900
where spacing has changed and and i
 

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.640
where spacing has changed and and i
think that you know it's kind of you

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:38.650
think that you know it's kind of you
 

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.069
think that you know it's kind of you
know we've radically changed the the way

00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:41.079
know we've radically changed the the way
 

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:44.099
know we've radically changed the the way
android looks and you know hopefully if

00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:44.109
android looks and you know hopefully if
 

00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:45.660
android looks and you know hopefully if
you want to really support that the way

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:45.670
you want to really support that the way
 

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:47.280
you want to really support that the way
to do that is to is to create a layout

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:47.290
to do that is to is to create a layout
 

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.829
to do that is to is to create a layout
that looks really great in ICS and to

00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839
that looks really great in ICS and to
 

00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:51.270
that looks really great in ICS and to
make a slightly different layout that

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280
make a slightly different layout that
 

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.120
make a slightly different layout that
looks great in Gingerbread the other

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:54.130
looks great in Gingerbread the other
 

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.589

thing you can do however if you if

00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599
thing you can do however if you if

really i look at i look at the back end
is being very simple I look at making

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:48.460
is being very simple I look at making
 

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.310

sure that you actually have sync parity

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:50.320
sure that you actually have sync parity
 

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.260

date is a challenge so so yeah I it's

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160
date is a challenge so so yeah I it's
 

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.980
date is a challenge so so yeah I it's
definitely I think that's it's that's

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:01.990
definitely I think that's it's that's
 

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.270
definitely I think that's it's that's
the interesting if you're if you're

the interesting if you're if you're
 

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.070
the interesting if you're if you're
sinking a small amount of data you don't

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:05.080
sinking a small amount of data you don't
 

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.050
sinking a small amount of data you don't
really need true sync than just writing

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:07.060
really need true sync than just writing

of your app is pretty simple and

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:14.410
of your app is pretty simple and
 

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:15.420
of your app is pretty simple and
straightforward so it really kind of

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:15.430
straightforward so it really kind of
 

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:18.090
straightforward so it really kind of
depends on your use case yeah i'm i

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:18.100
depends on your use case yeah i'm i

would have that i'm not really sure

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:19.780
would have that i'm not really sure
 

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.550
would have that i'm not really sure
on what's being asked here I know that

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560
on what's being asked here I know that
 

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.890
on what's being asked here I know that
we include a sample application in the

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:25.900
we include a sample application in the
 

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.490
we include a sample application in the
SDK called sample sync adapter which is

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:29.500
SDK called sample sync adapter which is
 

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.480

included with the platform and that
 

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.260
included with the platform and that
gives you some idea of how to do

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:46.270
gives you some idea of how to do
 

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.380
gives you some idea of how to do
synchronization between data that's on a

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:48.390
synchronization between data that's on a
 

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:50.910
synchronization between data that's on a
client device and data that's in the

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920
client device and data that's in the
 

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.730
client device and data that's in the
cloud and it also shows you how to set

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:53.740
cloud and it also shows you how to set
 

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.190
cloud and it also shows you how to set
up on a sync adapter which you will

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200
up on a sync adapter which you will
 

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.130
up on a sync adapter which you will
definitely you definitely would want to

00:43:59.130 --> 00:43:59.140
definitely you definitely would want to
 

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.620
definitely you definitely would want to
try at least on if you're going to be

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:01.630
try at least on if you're going to be
 

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:04.080
try at least on if you're going to be
doing synchronization and the reason I

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:04.090
doing synchronization and the reason I
 

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:07.500
doing synchronization and the reason I
say that is because there's a as dan

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:07.510
say that is because there's a as dan
 

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:09.090
say that is because there's a as dan
pointed out first of all there's the

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:09.100
pointed out first of all there's the
 

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.770
pointed out first of all there's the
issue of well how do you deal with

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:10.780
issue of well how do you deal with
 

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.470
issue of well how do you deal with
differences between the device and the

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480
differences between the device and the
 

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.310
differences between the device and the
cloud on secondly is how do you make

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:17.320
cloud on secondly is how do you make
 

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.230
cloud on secondly is how do you make
sure that when you want to do a

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240
sure that when you want to do a
 

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.120
sure that when you want to do a
synchronization that you're doing it at

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.130
synchronization that you're doing it at
 

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:23.940
synchronization that you're doing it at
an appropriate time on the device that

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:23.950
an appropriate time on the device that
 

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:27.870
an appropriate time on the device that
you've got a network connection and all

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880
you've got a network connection and all
 

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.370
you've got a network connection and all
sorts of other things that you have to

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:29.380
sorts of other things that you have to
 

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.870
sorts of other things that you have to
worry about when you're doing this and

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880
worry about when you're doing this and
 

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.060
worry about when you're doing this and

chrome is not using an action bar
they're using a custom view I wish there

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900
they're using a custom view I wish there
 

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.270
they're using a custom view I wish there
was a way to do that in an action bar

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280
was a way to do that in an action bar
 

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.200
was a way to do that in an action bar
but but unfortunately if you look at you

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:36.210
but but unfortunately if you look at you
 

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.370
but but unfortunately if you look at you
look at what chrome is actually doing

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380
look at what chrome is actually doing
 

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.390
look at what chrome is actually doing
what you're thinking of as an action bar

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400
what you're thinking of as an action bar
 

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.860
what you're thinking of as an action bar
is really actually the car would then

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:39.870
is really actually the car would then
 

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.390
is really actually the car would then
grow chrome and that's just a custom

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400
grow chrome and that's just a custom

view it's a really nice pattern I think

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:43.620
view it's a really nice pattern I think
 

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.030
view it's a really nice pattern I think
it looks really good on ICS especially

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040
it looks really good on ICS especially
 

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.040
it looks really good on ICS especially
with the relay the new thin progress bar

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:49.050
with the relay the new thin progress bar

standard action bar control pattern that
we have so so you can do it by

00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140
we have so so you can do it by
 

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.650
we have so so you can do it by
explaining a custom view you can even do

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660
explaining a custom view you can even do
 

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.840
explaining a custom view you can even do
it right at the top of your of your view

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:02.850
it right at the top of your of your view
 

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:04.430
it right at the top of your of your view
that would look similar to what chrome

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440
that would look similar to what chrome
 

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.720
that would look similar to what chrome
is done but you know Chrome's actually

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:05.730
is done but you know Chrome's actually
 

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:07.730
is done but you know Chrome's actually
does overlap the bottom of that top view

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740
does overlap the bottom of that top view
 

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.920
does overlap the bottom of that top view
and the only real way to do that easily

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:09.930
and the only real way to do that easily
 

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:13.540
and the only real way to do that easily
is to do it inside of inside of your

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:13.550
is to do it inside of inside of your
 

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.890
is to do it inside of inside of your
inside of your code you could in theory

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900
inside of your code you could in theory
 

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.170
inside of your code you could in theory
actually do up a pop-up window and have

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180
actually do up a pop-up window and have
 

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:22.100
actually do up a pop-up window and have
it have it pop up on top of that space I

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:22.110
it have it pop up on top of that space I
 

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:24.470
it have it pop up on top of that space I
believe and that would actually work and

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480
believe and that would actually work and
 

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.570
believe and that would actually work and
you know so that there are ways you

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:26.580
you know so that there are ways you
 

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.250
you know so that there are ways you
might be able to overlay that on top of

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260
might be able to overlay that on top of
 

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.510
might be able to overlay that on top of
the action bar but there's certainly no

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520
the action bar but there's certainly no
 

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:33.730
the action bar but there's certainly no
built-in pattern that right thank you

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:33.740
built-in pattern that right thank you
 

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:38.390
built-in pattern that right thank you
then um moving on curious what the

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400
then um moving on curious what the
 

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.880
then um moving on curious what the
status is of reducing audio latency in

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:40.890
status is of reducing audio latency in
 

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.010
status is of reducing audio latency in
the Android media libraries this has

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020
the Android media libraries this has
 

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.920
the Android media libraries this has
been talked about at a number of i/o

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:45.930
been talked about at a number of i/o
 

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.050
been talked about at a number of i/o
conferences and is listed as the number

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060
conferences and is listed as the number

two bug under defects it's number 34 34

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:52.070
two bug under defects it's number 34 34
 

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.410
two bug under defects it's number 34 34
that's pretty it's good to know that

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:54.420
that's pretty it's good to know that
 

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.020
that's pretty it's good to know that
people are enthusiastic about audio I'm

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:57.030
people are enthusiastic about audio I'm
 

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:58.310
people are enthusiastic about audio I'm
you know I'm I work with a lot of game

00:46:58.310 --> 00:46:58.320
you know I'm I work with a lot of game
 

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.280
you know I'm I work with a lot of game
developers and and and you know there

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:01.290
developers and and and you know there
 

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:03.890
developers and and and you know there
well we're always trying to make Android

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900
well we're always trying to make Android
 

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.050
well we're always trying to make Android
feel as more as interactive as possible

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:06.060
feel as more as interactive as possible
 

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.670
feel as more as interactive as possible
and a lot of it has to do with

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680
and a lot of it has to do with
 

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.589
and a lot of it has to do with
with things like audio latency we have

00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:10.599
with things like audio latency we have
 

00:47:10.599 --> 00:47:14.400
with things like audio latency we have
nothing new to report on that but we do

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:14.410
nothing new to report on that but we do
 

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:18.329
nothing new to report on that but we do
see those bugs and and so I know that

00:47:18.329 --> 00:47:18.339
see those bugs and and so I know that
 

00:47:18.339 --> 00:47:19.260
see those bugs and and so I know that
there are people who are really

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:19.270
there are people who are really
 

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.779
there are people who are really
passionate about audio we would like to

00:47:21.779 --> 00:47:21.789
passionate about audio we would like to
 

00:47:21.789 --> 00:47:26.460
passionate about audio we would like to
see that address okay okay yeah let's so

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:26.470
see that address okay okay yeah let's so
 

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:27.569
see that address okay okay yeah let's so
let's give it another try for the

00:47:27.569 --> 00:47:27.579
let's give it another try for the
 

00:47:27.579 --> 00:47:31.289
let's give it another try for the
Hangout go hurry all right and I need to

00:47:31.289 --> 00:47:31.299
Hangout go hurry all right and I need to
 

00:47:31.299 --> 00:47:35.039
Hangout go hurry all right and I need to
do it two ways Lydell that you know you

00:47:35.039 --> 00:47:35.049
do it two ways Lydell that you know you
 

00:47:35.049 --> 00:47:37.770
do it two ways Lydell that you know you
moved it from you can move one from left

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:37.780
moved it from you can move one from left
 

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.319
moved it from you can move one from left
to right and one from right to left that

00:47:40.319 --> 00:47:40.329
to right and one from right to left that
 

00:47:40.329 --> 00:47:43.430
to right and one from right to left that
it'll be on the same place in this game

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440
it'll be on the same place in this game
 

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.490
it'll be on the same place in this game
so they're split um in half so that you

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:47.500
so they're split um in half so that you
 

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.319
so they're split um in half so that you
can move the top one to the right and

00:47:49.319 --> 00:47:49.329
can move the top one to the right and
 

00:47:49.329 --> 00:47:50.970
can move the top one to the right and
the bottom one to the left something

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:50.980
the bottom one to the left something
 

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.609
the bottom one to the left something
like that no it would be on the same

00:47:53.609 --> 00:47:53.619
like that no it would be on the same
 

00:47:53.619 --> 00:47:56.220
like that no it would be on the same
line not on below and what about like

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:56.230
line not on below and what about like
 

00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:01.170
line not on below and what about like
you've got one name you can move you can

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:01.180
you've got one name you can move you can
 

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.089
you've got one name you can move you can
move it to get just two options you know

00:48:03.089 --> 00:48:03.099
move it to get just two options you know
 

00:48:03.099 --> 00:48:05.549
move it to get just two options you know
to give it a set of limits if you want

00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559
to give it a set of limits if you want
 

00:48:05.559 --> 00:48:07.829
to give it a set of limits if you want
to take let's say some kind of amount of

00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839
to take let's say some kind of amount of
 

00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:10.799
to take let's say some kind of amount of
something and you said the top one and

00:48:10.799 --> 00:48:10.809
something and you said the top one and
 

00:48:10.809 --> 00:48:14.069
something and you said the top one and
the lowest one and it should be on the

00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079
the lowest one and it should be on the
 

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:16.849
the lowest one and it should be on the
same line right instead so you'd have

00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859
same line right instead so you'd have
 

00:48:16.859 --> 00:48:19.859
same line right instead so you'd have
basically two pucks that are sitting on

00:48:19.859 --> 00:48:19.869
basically two pucks that are sitting on
 

00:48:19.869 --> 00:48:27.930
basically two pucks that are sitting on
the same line yes okay hmm yeah I've got

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:27.940
the same line yes okay hmm yeah I've got
 

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:29.970
the same line yes okay hmm yeah I've got
that that's that that looks like a

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:29.980
that that's that that looks like a
 

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.549
that that's that that looks like a
really good case for a custom control

00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559
really good case for a custom control
 

00:48:32.559 --> 00:48:35.519
really good case for a custom control
right and it's pretty easy to actually

00:48:35.519 --> 00:48:35.529
right and it's pretty easy to actually
 

00:48:35.529 --> 00:48:39.809
right and it's pretty easy to actually
make to make a widget track users

00:48:39.809 --> 00:48:39.819
make to make a widget track users
 

00:48:39.819 --> 00:48:41.910
make to make a widget track users
movement and there's lots of really

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920
movement and there's lots of really
 

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.880
movement and there's lots of really
great examples you know in terms of when

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:44.890
great examples you know in terms of when
 

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:46.200
great examples you know in terms of when
I say widget or Mina I mean you know a

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:46.210
I say widget or Mina I mean you know a
 

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:48.269
I say widget or Mina I mean you know a
piece of widget track the user's motion

00:48:48.269 --> 00:48:48.279
piece of widget track the user's motion
 

00:48:48.279 --> 00:48:50.190
piece of widget track the user's motion
but it is something that you either

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200
but it is something that you either
 

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.329
but it is something that you either
gonna have to find some code out there

00:48:51.329 --> 00:48:51.339
gonna have to find some code out there
 

00:48:51.339 --> 00:48:52.650
gonna have to find some code out there
that does or that you're going to have

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:52.660
that does or that you're going to have
 

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:55.500
that does or that you're going to have
to do yourself any of it in but I love

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:55.510
to do yourself any of it in but I love
 

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.240
to do yourself any of it in but I love
the idea of a custom control kind of in

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:57.250
the idea of a custom control kind of in
 

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:58.760
the idea of a custom control kind of in
general it's really pretty

00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:58.770
general it's really pretty
 

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.950
general it's really pretty
straightforward to set up you can create

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960
straightforward to set up you can create
 

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.099
straightforward to set up you can create
you know properties and of your own even

00:49:05.099 --> 00:49:05.109
you know properties and of your own even
 

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:06.809
you know properties and of your own even
in XML so you can really easily dump the

00:49:06.809 --> 00:49:06.819
in XML so you can really easily dump the
 

00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:09.210
in XML so you can really easily dump the
control in two places and but yeah I

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:09.220
control in two places and but yeah I
 

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.470
control in two places and but yeah I
think that's pretty much what you're

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480
think that's pretty much what you're
 

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.120
think that's pretty much what you're
going to be stuck with doing other

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:12.130
going to be stuck with doing other
 

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:15.569
going to be stuck with doing other
specific aspects of doing that kind of

00:49:15.569 --> 00:49:15.579
specific aspects of doing that kind of
 

00:49:15.579 --> 00:49:16.120
specific aspects of doing that kind of
custom

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:16.130
custom
 

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:19.900
custom
widget that you're interested in or or

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:19.910
widget that you're interested in or or
 

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:21.610
widget that you're interested in or or
do you have other ideas in mind for how

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:21.620
do you have other ideas in mind for how
 

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.400
do you have other ideas in mind for how
you might implement this well it's a I

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:24.410
you might implement this well it's a I
 

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:28.750
you might implement this well it's a I
just get to that based on there and you

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.760
just get to that based on there and you
 

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.610
just get to that based on there and you
know a mission that i got from work to

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:30.620
know a mission that i got from work to
 

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:33.940
know a mission that i got from work to
do so i got a specific implementation

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:33.950
do so i got a specific implementation
 

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:36.790
do so i got a specific implementation
they want me to do right okay it

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800
they want me to do right okay it
 

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.140
they want me to do right okay it
definitely definitely take a look at

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:38.150
definitely definitely take a look at
 

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:40.330
definitely definitely take a look at
your employee also definitely look at

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:40.340
your employee also definitely look at
 

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:44.350
your employee also definitely look at
the Android design guidelines because

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:44.360
the Android design guidelines because
 

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.350
the Android design guidelines because
it'll give you ideas on spacing and and

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:47.360
it'll give you ideas on spacing and and
 

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.050
it'll give you ideas on spacing and and
and you got you can really make it feel

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:50.060
and you got you can really make it feel
 

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.580
and you got you can really make it feel
like it like like it's part of the

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:51.590
like it like like it's part of the
 

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:54.850
like it like like it's part of the
platform a lot with that so that's this

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:54.860
platform a lot with that so that's this
 

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.440
platform a lot with that so that's this
kind of a general especially whenever

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:56.450
kind of a general especially whenever
 

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:58.600
kind of a general especially whenever
you doing anything custom referring to

00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:58.610
you doing anything custom referring to
 

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.880
you doing anything custom referring to
kind of our our our general grid that we

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:00.890
kind of our our our general grid that we
 

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:03.330
kind of our our our general grid that we
use I think it's really designed as well

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:03.340
use I think it's really designed as well
 

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.030
use I think it's really designed as well
so I know that would be my suggestion

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040
so I know that would be my suggestion
 

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.640
so I know that would be my suggestion
but yeah it's definitely good use for a

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:09.650
but yeah it's definitely good use for a
 

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:15.070
but yeah it's definitely good use for a
custom kernel a lot okay thank you thank

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:15.080
custom kernel a lot okay thank you thank
 

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.260
custom kernel a lot okay thank you thank
you thank you very much and we have one

you thank you very much and we have one
 

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.930
you thank you very much and we have one
more question from Andrew who's also on

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:19.940
more question from Andrew who's also on
 

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.580
more question from Andrew who's also on
the Hangout who has to follow up on a

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:21.590
the Hangout who has to follow up on a
 

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.350
the Hangout who has to follow up on a
question you asked in moderator go ahead

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:23.360
question you asked in moderator go ahead
 

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:29.830
question you asked in moderator go ahead
I am can you hear me I asked a few

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:29.840
I am can you hear me I asked a few
 

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.780
I am can you hear me I asked a few
questions in moderator including the one

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:31.790
questions in moderator including the one
 

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:35.500
questions in moderator including the one
about orientation I'm change right I

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:35.510
about orientation I'm change right I
 

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.690
about orientation I'm change right I
just wanted to follow up on that as you

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:37.700
just wanted to follow up on that as you
 

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.290
just wanted to follow up on that as you
asked what the purpose was and we have

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:41.300
asked what the purpose was and we have
 

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.870
asked what the purpose was and we have
any lock screen replacement application

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:43.880
any lock screen replacement application
 

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:49.300
any lock screen replacement application
and so when you turn the phone sideways

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:49.310
and so when you turn the phone sideways
 

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.210
and so when you turn the phone sideways
we want the icons on the sliders to

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:52.220
we want the icons on the sliders to
 

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.650
we want the icons on the sliders to
rotate but we want to keep the

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:53.660
rotate but we want to keep the
 

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.280
rotate but we want to keep the
application in portrait and not change

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:57.290
application in portrait and not change
 

00:50:57.290 --> 00:51:00.070
application in portrait and not change
the layout that makes sense Joshua haha

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:00.080
the layout that makes sense Joshua haha
 

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.070
the layout that makes sense Joshua haha
so we want to be able to detect that

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:03.080
so we want to be able to detect that
 

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.690
so we want to be able to detect that
orientation change without having I

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:04.700
orientation change without having I
 

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.280
orientation change without having I
figured we could probably do something

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:06.290
figured we could probably do something
 

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:09.250
figured we could probably do something
with the accelerometer but I don't want

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:09.260
with the accelerometer but I don't want
 

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.440
with the accelerometer but I don't want
to have to be polling especially if it's

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:11.450
to have to be polling especially if it's
 

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:14.080
to have to be polling especially if it's
a lock screen application I want to be

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:14.090
a lock screen application I want to be
 

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.720
a lock screen application I want to be
notified in some way the orientation is

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:16.730
notified in some way the orientation is
 

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:18.730
notified in some way the orientation is
to change well if the you know if the

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:18.740
to change well if the you know if the
 

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.870
to change well if the you know if the
lock screen is actually active yeah you

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880
lock screen is actually active yeah you
 

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.730
lock screen is actually active yeah you
know you for you can you can definitely

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:24.740
know you for you can you can definitely
 

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.430
know you for you can you can definitely
turn on the sensor and your little give

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440
turn on the sensor and your little give
 

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.170
turn on the sensor and your little give
it will give you the

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:28.180
it will give you the
 

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.849
it will give you the
it's not really a question of polling at

00:51:29.849 --> 00:51:29.859
it's not really a question of polling at
 

00:51:29.859 --> 00:51:32.130
it's not really a question of polling at
that at that point you know you're

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:32.140
that at that point you know you're
 

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.569
that at that point you know you're
you're not concerned usually about

00:51:33.569 --> 00:51:33.579
you're not concerned usually about
 

00:51:33.579 --> 00:51:36.030
you're not concerned usually about
battery while the lock screen is active

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040
battery while the lock screen is active
 

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.680
battery while the lock screen is active
and the device and the screen is powered

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:37.690
and the device and the screen is powered
 

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.530
and the device and the screen is powered
on you know it's obviously a lock screen

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:40.540
on you know it's obviously a lock screen
 

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:41.700
on you know it's obviously a lock screen
replacement is not something that's

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:41.710
replacement is not something that's
 

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:45.329
replacement is not something that's
really supported by the free at all so

00:51:45.329 --> 00:51:45.339
really supported by the free at all so
 

00:51:45.339 --> 00:51:47.609
really supported by the free at all so
you're kind of in your kind of in just

00:51:47.609 --> 00:51:47.619
you're kind of in your kind of in just
 

00:51:47.619 --> 00:51:49.380
you're kind of in your kind of in just
kind of crazy territory there anyways

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:49.390
kind of crazy territory there anyways
 

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:51.079
kind of crazy territory there anyways
you've got to be really really careful

00:51:51.079 --> 00:51:51.089
you've got to be really really careful
 

00:51:51.089 --> 00:51:53.460
you've got to be really really careful
but yeah that I don't think there's any

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:53.470
but yeah that I don't think there's any
 

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:55.710
but yeah that I don't think there's any
particular reason not to turn the

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:55.720
particular reason not to turn the
 

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.200
particular reason not to turn the
accelerometer accelerometer on if your

00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:58.210
accelerometer accelerometer on if your
 

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:00.870
accelerometer accelerometer on if your
if your window is currently active and

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880
if your window is currently active and
 

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.270
if your window is currently active and
the device is powered on so I wouldn't

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280
the device is powered on so I wouldn't
 

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.650
the device is powered on so I wouldn't
worry too much about that just you just

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:04.660
worry too much about that just you just
 

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:05.910
worry too much about that just you just
have to make sure that when it's not

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920
have to make sure that when it's not
 

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.920
have to make sure that when it's not
powered on its tiny when your screen is

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:07.930
powered on its tiny when your screen is
 

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:11.030
powered on its tiny when your screen is
not longer actively turn it off right

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040
not longer actively turn it off right
 

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:18.480
not longer actively turn it off right
okay okay yeah thanks thank you moving

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:18.490
okay okay yeah thanks thank you moving
 

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:21.059
okay okay yeah thanks thank you moving
back to the moderator how can

00:52:21.059 --> 00:52:21.069
back to the moderator how can
 

00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:23.280
back to the moderator how can
actionbarcompat be extended to allow

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:23.290
actionbarcompat be extended to allow
 

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:25.530
actionbarcompat be extended to allow
changing the visibility of menu items at

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:25.540
changing the visibility of menu items at
 

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:29.490
changing the visibility of menu items at
runtime on pre ICS devices on says their

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:29.500
runtime on pre ICS devices on says their
 

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.870
runtime on pre ICS devices on says their
stack overflow a action and action bar

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880
stack overflow a action and action bar
 

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.520
stack overflow a action and action bar
compat how to change visibility of

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:35.530
compat how to change visibility of
 

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:40.589
compat how to change visibility of
actions at runtime on p 0 it should be

00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599
actions at runtime on p 0 it should be
 

00:52:40.599 --> 00:52:42.059
actions at runtime on p 0 it should be
pretty straightforward I mean I think

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:42.069
pretty straightforward I mean I think
 

00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:44.309
pretty straightforward I mean I think
that so you're talking about the the

00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319
that so you're talking about the the
 

00:52:44.319 --> 00:52:45.870
that so you're talking about the the
actions that are actually part of the

00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880
actions that are actually part of the
 

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.280
actions that are actually part of the
bar because these because everything in

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:47.290
bar because these because everything in
 

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:49.890
bar because these because everything in
the actionbarcompat overflow gets shoved

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:49.900
the actionbarcompat overflow gets shoved
 

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.349
the actionbarcompat overflow gets shoved
into the standard menu and that's really

00:52:52.349 --> 00:52:52.359
into the standard menu and that's really
 

00:52:52.359 --> 00:52:54.859
into the standard menu and that's really
just and that just gets updated

00:52:54.859 --> 00:52:54.869
just and that just gets updated
 

00:52:54.869 --> 00:52:57.150
just and that just gets updated
basically I so if it's not getting

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160
basically I so if it's not getting
 

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.829
basically I so if it's not getting
updated already basically the way it

00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839
updated already basically the way it
 

00:52:58.839 --> 00:53:01.950
updated already basically the way it
should work is that your application you

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960
should work is that your application you
 

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.359
should work is that your application you
know get you gets asked for which menu

00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:03.369
know get you gets asked for which menu
 

00:53:03.369 --> 00:53:06.809
know get you gets asked for which menu
items are currently present and and you

00:53:06.809 --> 00:53:06.819
items are currently present and and you
 

00:53:06.819 --> 00:53:08.549
items are currently present and and you
and you and you give that list back and

00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559
and you and you give that list back and
 

00:53:08.559 --> 00:53:10.470
and you and you give that list back and
the ones that are flagged as being in

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480
the ones that are flagged as being in
 

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.349
the ones that are flagged as being in
the action bar actually show up up there

00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359
the action bar actually show up up there
 

00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:15.390
the action bar actually show up up there
and the ones that get better not show up

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400
and the ones that get better not show up
 

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.039
and the ones that get better not show up
in the overflow menu which is a standard

00:53:17.039 --> 00:53:17.049
in the overflow menu which is a standard
 

00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:22.020
in the overflow menu which is a standard
menu in actionbarcompat so that that

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:22.030
menu in actionbarcompat so that that
 

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:25.710
menu in actionbarcompat so that that
should actually work it is there

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:25.720
should actually work it is there
 

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.539
should actually work it is there
actually a bug where is as is he

00:53:27.539 --> 00:53:27.549
actually a bug where is as is he
 

00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:29.720
actually a bug where is as is he
referring to a bug where this is

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:29.730
referring to a bug where this is
 

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:32.310
referring to a bug where this is
actually not not working

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:32.320
actually not not working
 

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.260
actually not not working
when the menu options change that its

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:34.270
when the menu options change that its
 

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:35.850
when the menu options change that its
analog that it's still showing up in the

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:35.860
analog that it's still showing up in the
 

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:38.160
analog that it's still showing up in the
action bar I'm not really sure I'd have

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:38.170
action bar I'm not really sure I'd have
 

00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:39.900
action bar I'm not really sure I'd have
to go take a look at this i think i

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:39.910
to go take a look at this i think i
 

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:41.640
to go take a look at this i think i
think the way actionbarcompat works is

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:41.650
think the way actionbarcompat works is
 

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.770
think the way actionbarcompat works is
it's actually just a big layout and what

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:43.780
it's actually just a big layout and what
 

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.780
it's actually just a big layout and what
we do is as menu items are added it

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:45.790
we do is as menu items are added it
 

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:47.280
we do is as menu items are added it
actually goes and adds them to that

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:47.290
actually goes and adds them to that
 

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:50.190
actually goes and adds them to that
layout so my theory is you'd after is it

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200
layout so my theory is you'd after is it
 

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.230
layout so my theory is you'd after is it
if you made a change to the which menu

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240
if you made a change to the which menu
 

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.970
if you made a change to the which menu
items were visible that you just have to

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:53.980
items were visible that you just have to
 

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.530
items were visible that you just have to
remove all the children from that and

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:55.540
remove all the children from that and
 

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.570
remove all the children from that and
clear that out and then and then

00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:57.580
clear that out and then and then
 

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.280
clear that out and then and then
recreate it I don't I don't think

00:53:59.280 --> 00:53:59.290
recreate it I don't I don't think
 

00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:01.110
recreate it I don't I don't think
there's anything to prevent you from

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:01.120
there's anything to prevent you from
 

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.790
there's anything to prevent you from
doing that but I have to go look at the

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800
doing that but I have to go look at the
 

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.530
doing that but I have to go look at the
source code for actionbarcompat that's

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:04.540
source code for actionbarcompat that's
 

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:08.010
source code for actionbarcompat that's
what I vaguely remember it's doing so

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:08.020
what I vaguely remember it's doing so
 

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:11.160
what I vaguely remember it's doing so
Roman would know exactly what does but

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:11.170
Roman would know exactly what does but
 

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:13.170
Roman would know exactly what does but
but that's what so I think that's that

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:13.180
but that's what so I think that's that
 

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.130
but that's what so I think that's that
what's what you'd have to do is just

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:14.140
what's what you'd have to do is just
 

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.810
what's what you'd have to do is just
clear out those children and have it

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:15.820
clear out those children and have it
 

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.940
clear out those children and have it
recreate itself when those menu items

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:17.950
recreate itself when those menu items
 

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:19.500
recreate itself when those menu items
change what I would probably do is just

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:19.510
change what I would probably do is just
 

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.960
change what I would probably do is just
have something in the code that detects

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:21.970
have something in the code that detects
 

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:24.120
have something in the code that detects
that those menu items has changed so it

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:24.130
that those menu items has changed so it
 

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.670
that those menu items has changed so it
knows when it has to rebuild just just

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:26.680
knows when it has to rebuild just just
 

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.930
knows when it has to rebuild just just

to prevent you from doing that all the
 

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.030
to prevent you from doing that all the

are of using ICS as a target SDK on a
 

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:18.270
are of using ICS as a target SDK on a
honeycomb min SDK app so probably the

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280
honeycomb min SDK app so probably the
 

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:23.880
honeycomb min SDK app so probably the
biggest it on a honeycomb min SDK using

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:23.890
biggest it on a honeycomb min SDK using
 

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:27.410
biggest it on a honeycomb min SDK using
ICS is the target well as a general rule

00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420

it's best to always use the most recent

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:30.490
it's best to always use the most recent

between honeycomb and ICS there gets rid

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:42.850
between honeycomb and ICS there gets rid
 

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.570
between honeycomb and ICS there gets rid
of the legacy Lacey yeah it gets right

00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:45.580
of the legacy Lacey yeah it gets right
 

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.730
of the legacy Lacey yeah it gets right
gets rid of the legacy manual on ICS

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:47.740
gets rid of the legacy manual on ICS
 

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.890

you're gonna you're going to end up with
the best running application on ICS

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:54.170
the best running application on ICS
 

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.440
the best running application on ICS
and really if you're testing already on

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:56.450
and really if you're testing already on
 

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:59.260
and really if you're testing already on
ICS are fairly limited reason to not

00:57:59.260 --> 00:57:59.270
ICS are fairly limited reason to not
 

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:03.460
ICS are fairly limited reason to not
target it so i think that's that's

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:03.470
target it so i think that's that's
 

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:04.810
target it so i think that's that's
probably the best answer but i'd love to

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:04.820
probably the best answer but i'd love to
 

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.310
probably the best answer but i'd love to
have so i'd love to get more specifics

00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:06.320
have so i'd love to get more specifics
 

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:11.680
have so i'd love to get more specifics

so I had a question a few weeks ago

00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:49.190
so I had a question a few weeks ago
 

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:52.840
so I had a question a few weeks ago
about the status bar at the bottom on

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:52.850
about the status bar at the bottom on
 

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:56.800
about the status bar at the bottom on
tablet devices and how the the back

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:56.810
tablet devices and how the the back
 

00:58:56.810 --> 00:58:58.720
tablet devices and how the the back
button and the home button and on the

00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:58.730
button and the home button and on the
 

00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:01.180
button and the home button and on the
left side and the time on the right side

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:01.190
left side and the time on the right side
 

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:03.930

is interfering so in this particular app

00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:03.940
is interfering so in this particular app
 

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.270
is interfering so in this particular app
situation i'm talking about it's a

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280
situation i'm talking about it's a
 

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.010
situation i'm talking about it's a
handwriting note-taking app so you're

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:09.020
handwriting note-taking app so you're
 

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.380
handwriting note-taking app so you're
actually writing on the screen so your

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:11.390
actually writing on the screen so your
 

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:14.380
actually writing on the screen so your
arm if you're right-handed rests on the

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:14.390
arm if you're right-handed rests on the
 

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:15.970
arm if you're right-handed rests on the
bottom right side of the screen and then

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:15.980
bottom right side of the screen and then
 

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.970
bottom right side of the screen and then
causes the users to open up the status

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:18.980
causes the users to open up the status
 

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.310
causes the users to open up the status
of a notification part and left-handed

00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:21.320
of a notification part and left-handed
 

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.980
of a notification part and left-handed
users often hit the back button so I'm

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:23.990
users often hit the back button so I'm
 

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:27.370
users often hit the back button so I'm
wondering if there's a way I asked a few

00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:27.380
wondering if there's a way I asked a few
 

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.040
wondering if there's a way I asked a few
weeks ago if there's a way to make that

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:30.050
weeks ago if there's a way to make that
 

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:32.290
weeks ago if there's a way to make that
go wet make the status bar hidden and

00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:32.300
go wet make the status bar hidden and
 

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.210
go wet make the status bar hidden and
bring it back some other way and the

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:34.220
bring it back some other way and the
 

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:36.130
bring it back some other way and the
response was an ice cream sandwich there

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:36.140
response was an ice cream sandwich there
 

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.810
response was an ice cream sandwich there
is that capability but as soon as you

00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:37.820
is that capability but as soon as you
 

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.240
is that capability but as soon as you
interact with the screen it comes back

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:40.250
interact with the screen it comes back
 

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:42.490
interact with the screen it comes back
yeah and actually in actually the in Ice

Cream Sandwich on tablets they won't

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:44.690
Cream Sandwich on tablets they won't
 

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:46.570
Cream Sandwich on tablets they won't
actually make it go away but it will

00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:46.580
actually make it go away but it will
 

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.570
actually make it go away but it will
very nicely make it stop interacting her

00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:49.580
very nicely make it stop interacting her
 

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.820
very nicely make it stop interacting her
one click you know honestly if this is a

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:51.830
one click you know honestly if this is a
 

00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:53.890
one click you know honestly if this is a
really important feature to your app um

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:53.900
really important feature to your app um
 

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.980
really important feature to your app um
I would do something a little crazy and

00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:56.990
I would do something a little crazy and
 

00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:00.130
I would do something a little crazy and
I would actually well okay it all

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:00.140
I would actually well okay it all
 

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.270
I would actually well okay it all
depends if you're using the framework

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280
depends if you're using the framework
 

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.670
depends if you're using the framework
this is tricky you could render your app

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680
this is tricky you could render your app
 

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.480
this is tricky you could render your app
upside down and force it and

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:05.490
upside down and force it and
 

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:07.450
upside down and force it and
that's one that's one way of doing it

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:07.460
that's one that's one way of doing it
 

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.190
that's one that's one way of doing it
and you know fix the orientation but

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200
and you know fix the orientation but
 

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.420
and you know fix the orientation but
actually render the app upside down

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:11.430
actually render the app upside down
 

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:13.450
actually render the app upside down
which will put the action bar on the top

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:13.460
which will put the action bar on the top
 

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.680
which will put the action bar on the top
if handwriting is really really

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:15.690
if handwriting is really really
 

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.510
if handwriting is really really
important that's that's one way of doing

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520
important that's that's one way of doing
 

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.740
important that's that's one way of doing
it obviously there's not a lot of

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:18.750
it obviously there's not a lot of
 

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:23.530
it obviously there's not a lot of
support for that you can definitely use

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:23.540
support for that you can definitely use
 

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.609
support for that you can definitely use
so it since your target if you're

01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:25.619
so it since your target if you're
 

01:00:25.619 --> 01:00:27.770
so it since your target if you're
targeting you know Isis and honeycomb

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780
targeting you know Isis and honeycomb
 

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.060
targeting you know Isis and honeycomb
you can actually use with the properties

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:29.070
you can actually use with the properties
 

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:30.530
you can actually use with the properties
to rotate everything to make sure you

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540
to rotate everything to make sure you
 

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.540
to rotate everything to make sure you
know diet everything's actually turned

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:32.550
know diet everything's actually turned
 

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:34.520
know diet everything's actually turned
upside down when it's when it's being

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:34.530
upside down when it's when it's being
 

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.960
upside down when it's when it's being
laid out so that actually that's that's

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:35.970
laid out so that actually that's that's
 

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.790
laid out so that actually that's that's
one way of doing it you know honestly

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:37.800
one way of doing it you know honestly
 

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.670
one way of doing it you know honestly
that's a lot of work I don't think

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680
that's a lot of work I don't think
 

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.170
that's a lot of work I don't think
there's a good way to just rotate the

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180
there's a good way to just rotate the
 

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.330
there's a good way to just rotate the
display you know for a game if you're as

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:44.340
display you know for a game if you're as
 

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.680
display you know for a game if you're as
a game developer and you were actually

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:45.690
a game developer and you were actually
 

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:47.500
a game developer and you were actually
just using OpenGL it's really trivial

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:47.510
just using OpenGL it's really trivial
 

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.280
just using OpenGL it's really trivial
it's a little harder when you're

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:49.290
it's a little harder when you're
 

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:51.109
it's a little harder when you're
actually writing writing an app but if

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119
actually writing writing an app but if
 

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:53.090
actually writing writing an app but if
you're doing a custom view for a lot of

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:53.100
you're doing a custom view for a lot of
 

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.070
you're doing a custom view for a lot of
it you know that then it might it might

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:55.080
it you know that then it might it might
 

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.020
it you know that then it might it might
be easy but at least gets that on the

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:57.030
be easy but at least gets that on the
 

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:58.310
be easy but at least gets that on the
top the other option of course would be

01:00:58.310 --> 01:00:58.320
top the other option of course would be
 

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.290
top the other option of course would be
to use portrait mode and put it on to

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:00.300
to use portrait mode and put it on to
 

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.780
to use portrait mode and put it on to
the side you know and you know cuz

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:02.790
the side you know and you know cuz
 

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:05.450

obviously your app isn't technically

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460
obviously your app isn't technically
 

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.570
obviously your app isn't technically
required to render itself matching and

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:08.580
required to render itself matching and
 

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.700
required to render itself matching and
your case is one of those weird random

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:10.710
your case is one of those weird random
 

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:12.650
your case is one of those weird random
cases and where it might actually make

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660
cases and where it might actually make
 

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.400
cases and where it might actually make
more sense to not to not actually use

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:16.410
more sense to not to not actually use
 

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:17.780
more sense to not to not actually use
the default orientation you know

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:17.790
the default orientation you know
 

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:19.580
the default orientation you know
obviously not every device in the world

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:19.590
obviously not every device in the world
 

01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:22.550
obviously not every device in the world

is something that's that that's you know
definitely on the side of hacky but if

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:29.490
definitely on the side of hacky but if
 

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:30.980
definitely on the side of hacky but if
it's really required to you know to

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:30.990
it's really required to you know to
 

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:32.840
it's really required to you know to
prevent people from from from touching

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:32.850
prevent people from from from touching
 

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:34.520
prevent people from from from touching
that bar during handwriting it might

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:34.530
that bar during handwriting it might
 

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:35.960
that bar during handwriting it might
actually make sense for your app is

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:35.970
actually make sense for your app is
 

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:39.800
actually make sense for your app is
there a way to flip an activity to just

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:39.810
there a way to flip an activity to just
 

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:42.530
there a way to flip an activity to just
a right make this activity draw upside

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.540
a right make this activity draw upside
 

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.450
a right make this activity draw upside
down no that's the thing is if there's a

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460
down no that's the thing is if there's a
 

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.920
down no that's the thing is if there's a
lot of work involved with this that's I

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:45.930
lot of work involved with this that's I
 

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:48.109
lot of work involved with this that's I
mean I I you click know there are ways

01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119
mean I I you click know there are ways
 

01:01:48.119 --> 01:01:50.660
mean I I you click know there are ways
to flip a canvas around and you could

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:50.670
to flip a canvas around and you could
 

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:55.520
to flip a canvas around and you could
actually basically in ondraw when you

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:55.530
actually basically in ondraw when you
 

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:57.170
actually basically in ondraw when you
first get the canvas you could you could

01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180
first get the canvas you could you could
 

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.670
first get the canvas you could you could
provide you could you could refer to

01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680
provide you could you could refer to
 

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.140
provide you could you could refer to
transform on it that would probably do

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:00.150
transform on it that would probably do
 

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.270
transform on it that would probably do
most of what you wanted it to do you

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280
most of what you wanted it to do you
 

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.380
most of what you wanted it to do you
could certainly play with that but then

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:03.390
could certainly play with that but then
 

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:04.520
could certainly play with that but then
your touches are all going to be off

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:04.530
your touches are all going to be off
 

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:07.310
your touches are all going to be off
like it's it's it's not either it's you

01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:07.320
like it's it's it's not either it's you
 

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.020
like it's it's it's not either it's you
got you have to make sure you're also

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:09.030
got you have to make sure you're also
 

01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:10.609
got you have to make sure you're also
transforming all of that it would be

01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619
transforming all of that it would be
 

01:02:10.619 --> 01:02:13.480
transforming all of that it would be
tricky and it's kind of hacky

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:13.490
tricky and it's kind of hacky
 

01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:16.330
tricky and it's kind of hacky
but you know that's that's the only way

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:16.340
but you know that's that's the only way
 

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.120
but you know that's that's the only way
i can think of doing it up doing it in

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:19.130
i can think of doing it up doing it in
 

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:22.600
i can think of doing it up doing it in
it in a compatible way you know in and

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:22.610
it in a compatible way you know in and
 

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:25.750
it in a compatible way you know in and
and you know that's at least it gets it

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760
and you know that's at least it gets it
 

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.280
and you know that's at least it gets it
off out of the out of the out of the

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:27.290
off out of the out of the out of the
 

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:29.140
off out of the out of the out of the
users way but that is that is the one

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:29.150
users way but that is that is the one
 

01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:32.410
users way but that is that is the one
issue with having that there is it is if

01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:32.420
issue with having that there is it is if
 

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.090
issue with having that there is it is if
you are resting your hands on it you

01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:34.100
you are resting your hands on it you
 

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.430
you are resting your hands on it you
could actually touch it if I could make

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440
could actually touch it if I could make
 

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.350
could actually touch it if I could make
a suggestion one of the things that I

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:38.360
a suggestion one of the things that I
 

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.200
a suggestion one of the things that I
thought of just for future development

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:41.210
thought of just for future development
 

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:43.900
thought of just for future development
is if there could be a late actually I

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:43.910
is if there could be a late actually I
 

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:45.580
is if there could be a late actually I
know part of the problem of making it

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:45.590
know part of the problem of making it
 

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:48.609
know part of the problem of making it
having a nap be allowed to tell that to

01:02:48.609 --> 01:02:48.619
having a nap be allowed to tell that to
 

01:02:48.619 --> 01:02:51.250
having a nap be allowed to tell that to
disappear is that then the user on

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:51.260
disappear is that then the user on
 

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.920
disappear is that then the user on
devices they don't have buttons has no

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:53.930
devices they don't have buttons has no
 

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:56.560
devices they don't have buttons has no
way of doing anything anyway they have

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:56.570
way of doing anything anyway they have
 

01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:58.540
way of doing anything anyway they have
to trust that app but if there would be

01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:58.550
to trust that app but if there would be
 

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:02.650
to trust that app but if there would be
I think every device has to have a power

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:02.660
I think every device has to have a power
 

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.609
I think every device has to have a power
button so just an idea I've had is to

01:03:05.609 --> 01:03:05.619
button so just an idea I've had is to
 

01:03:05.619 --> 01:03:08.500
button so just an idea I've had is to
allow the app to make the status bar go

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:08.510
allow the app to make the status bar go
 

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:10.570
allow the app to make the status bar go
away the navigation bar go away and have

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:10.580
away the navigation bar go away and have
 

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.340
away the navigation bar go away and have
the power button press to the power

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:12.350
the power button press to the power
 

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:14.410
the power button press to the power
button bring it back or some variation

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:14.420
button bring it back or some variation
 

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.870
button bring it back or some variation
on that yeah I you know I think I think

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880
on that yeah I you know I think I think
 

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.000
on that yeah I you know I think I think
that um you know I think either a lot of

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:19.010
that um you know I think either a lot of
 

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:20.410
that um you know I think either a lot of
ways in which this could solve you could

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:20.420
ways in which this could solve you could
 

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.810
ways in which this could solve you could
allow the user to lock the bar you could

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:22.820
allow the user to lock the bar you could
 

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.210
allow the user to lock the bar you could
allow the user to move the bar to the

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:25.220
allow the user to move the bar to the
 

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.220
allow the user to move the bar to the
top of the screen themselves you know

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:27.230
top of the screen themselves you know
 

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:29.200
top of the screen themselves you know
configure the device you know I think

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:29.210
configure the device you know I think
 

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:30.970
configure the device you know I think
they I think that those are all things

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:30.980
they I think that those are all things
 

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.070
they I think that those are all things
that you know have advantages and

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:33.080
that you know have advantages and
 

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.660
that you know have advantages and
disadvantages the power thing that you

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:34.670
disadvantages the power thing that you
 

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:36.880
disadvantages the power thing that you
know it certainly has been has been

know it certainly has been has been
 

01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:38.650
know it certainly has been has been
discussed and I would love to see

01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:38.660
discussed and I would love to see
 

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.790
discussed and I would love to see
something that God happened but you know

01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:39.800
something that God happened but you know
 

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.550
something that God happened but you know
that's you know I think that I think

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:42.560
that's you know I think that I think
 

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.590
that's you know I think that I think
that for the for the vast majority of

01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:44.600
that for the for the vast majority of
 

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.120
that for the for the vast majority of
applications the advantage of always

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:46.130
applications the advantage of always
 

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:47.980
applications the advantage of always
having consistent way to get out of it

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:47.990
having consistent way to get out of it
 

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:51.700
having consistent way to get out of it
over over is more important than than

the cases in which it doesn't help and

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:53.770
the cases in which it doesn't help and
 

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:55.630
the cases in which it doesn't help and
you know I think I think the key thing

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:55.640
you know I think I think the key thing
 

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.370
you know I think I think the key thing
is just to try to make sure we service

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:57.380
is just to try to make sure we service
 

01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:01.359
is just to try to make sure we service
those cases better and going forward but

01:04:01.359 --> 01:04:01.369
those cases better and going forward but
 

01:04:01.369 --> 01:04:03.070
those cases better and going forward but
yeah I definitely I definitely I

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:03.080
yeah I definitely I definitely I
 

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.510
yeah I definitely I definitely I
definitely see both sides of this issue

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520
definitely see both sides of this issue
 

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.710
definitely see both sides of this issue
and they've been you know certainly

01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720
and they've been you know certainly
 

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.220
and they've been you know certainly
hotly discussed internally yeah this

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:09.230
hotly discussed internally yeah this
 

01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:10.960
hotly discussed internally yeah this
theory we're not we're not unaware of

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:10.970
theory we're not we're not unaware of
 

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:13.030
theory we're not we're not unaware of
that but I think that right now the

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:13.040
that but I think that right now the
 

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.710
that but I think that right now the
general feeling is that you know giving

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720
general feeling is that you know giving
 

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.910
general feeling is that you know giving
the users that confidence that they

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920
the users that confidence that they
 

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.320
the users that confidence that they
always have the ability to back out and

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:17.330
always have the ability to back out and
 

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:18.640
always have the ability to back out and
always have the ability to go home

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:18.650
always have the ability to go home
 

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:22.040
always have the ability to go home
switch apps is is you know outweighs the

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:22.050
switch apps is is you know outweighs the
 

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:23.840
switch apps is is you know outweighs the
benefit of being able to to the round

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:23.850

well so you have the current card the

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:28.560
well so you have the current card the
 

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.230
well so you have the current card the
best trick I thing to do best thing I

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240
best trick I thing to do best thing I
 

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.330
best trick I thing to do best thing I
can come up with now is to use the trek

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:32.340
can come up with now is to use the trek
 

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.310
can come up with now is to use the trek
that you can lay out your app that in a

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:34.320
that you can lay out your app that in a
 

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.660
that you can lay out your app that in a
way that doesn't actually match the

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:35.670
way that doesn't actually match the
 

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:37.970
way that doesn't actually match the
screen orientation but it's not it's not

01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980
screen orientation but it's not it's not
 

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.970
screen orientation but it's not it's not
a perfect solution I agree thank you

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980
a perfect solution I agree thank you
 

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.400
a perfect solution I agree thank you
thank you again Andrew um looks like

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:43.410
thank you again Andrew um looks like
 

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:45.080
thank you again Andrew um looks like
we've run over for today we've been

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:45.090
we've run over for today we've been
 

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.960
