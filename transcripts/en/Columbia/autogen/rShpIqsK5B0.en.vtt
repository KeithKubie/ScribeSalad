Amanda is here to see me today because
she is almost five years old and she

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:51.730
she is almost five years old and she
 

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.640
she is almost five years old and she
still doesn't really seem to believe

that I'm a teacher the first time I told

that I'm a teacher the first time I told
her I was a teacher she said dad and you

her I was a teacher she said dad and you
 

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.599

I think I think I successfully convinced
 

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.140
I think I think I successfully convinced
her that boys can be teachers although

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:07.150
her that boys can be teachers although
 

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.990

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:19.069
but I think the real reason that Amanda
 

00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:20.529
but I think the real reason that Amanda
doesn't think I'm a teacher is because

00:37:20.529 --> 00:37:20.539
doesn't think I'm a teacher is because
 

00:37:20.539 --> 00:37:22.960
