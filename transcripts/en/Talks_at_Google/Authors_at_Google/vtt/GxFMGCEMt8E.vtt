[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:07.690
SPEAKER 1: I'm very,
very pleased, excited,

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.660
and honored to
bring to you today

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.400
Dr. Robert Thurman on his
third visit to Google,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.260
where he will be talking
about his new graphic novel

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.880
about the Dalai Lama,
"The Man of Peace."

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.270
Dr. Thurman was
the first American

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.650
to don Buddhist garb in
1962, the first Buddhist

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.256
monk from the US.

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:32.290
He eventually became a professor
at American University.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.600
And now is the Jey
Tsong Khapa Professor

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.900
of Indo-Tibetan studies at
Columbia University in New

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.670
York.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.170
He's a close personal friend
of His Holiness the Dalai Lama,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.030
which is the subject
of today's talk,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.610
and also the father of
Uma Thurman, who you

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.485
may have seen in the movies.

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:49.180
He's a prolific author.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.180
He also hosts a weekly
podcast that you

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.200
can find from bobthurman.com.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.424
And as I said, this is
his third visit to Google.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.590
We're happy to welcome him
back and hope that he can

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.970
come on many future occasions.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.448
Without any further ado,
I'd like to introduce you

00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:04.239
to Dr. Bob Thurman.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.530
ROBERT THURMAN: Thank you, Tom.

00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:08.595
Thank you.

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:10.540
Thank you, Tom.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.230
Thank you, Tom.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.320
That's really very kind.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.620
And I love being at Google.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.580
And I actually love Google.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.020
I always did.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.690
I like the way the letters--

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.650
the colors of the letters.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530
They're like the
colors of the five--

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.080
what we call the five
archetype Buddhas,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.720
I call them-- the
dhanyi Buddhas,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.380
or meditational Buddhas
in the mandalas, blue red,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.200
yellow, green, and the white
is in the spaces in between.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.780
So I do-- I love Google.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.780
It's good.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.300
And I'm sure you all are
daily reminding yourself

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.540
how you should be
doing no evil, which

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.362
was one of the founding things.

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:55.820
So anyway, I'm
very-- and thank you

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.520
for inviting me to come and
talk to you all about our latest

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.100
production of the life of the
Dalai Lama in the graphic novel

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.930
form.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.490
And it's actually a
graphic biography, in fact.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.840
But we call it a graphic novel
because we don't want-- in case

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.560
we were a little
undiplomatic in any element

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.160
or whatever it was, we
wanted His Holiness to have

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.620
deniability that it was our
mistake or something if we make

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.384
a mistake.

00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:28.550
But I have showed it to him.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.216
And he liked it.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:31.760
Actually, I gave it to
him during the kalachakra

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.400
initiation, the last
one that he did--

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.400
which will not be the last
one he will do-- but last one

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.730
he did in Bodhgaya
in January in India.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.720
And my wife called me
excitedly later that day.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.250
He was live streaming it.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.620
And he would say it was the
preparatory rituals, what's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.360
called the self-initiation
rituals where they build up

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.410
the cosmic mandala, in which
then the ceremony takes place

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.050
in the following days.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.310
And he was doing the--

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.190
he was in the ritual.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.760
The monks were chanting and
they were making the mandala

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.870
and the whole thing.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.857
And he called me over to him
in the middle of the thing.

00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:10.690
It's only a few people
in there because it's

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.020
the preparatory thing.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.820
He called me over to greet him.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.510
And so I did.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.167
And then, I gave him a copy
the book and put it down.

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:18.000
And he looked at it.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.370
And he went back to the ritual.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.180
And it was there on the table
nearby his ritual implements.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.610
And so, my wife
called me said, oh, he

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.460
was doing the ritual
chanting and meditating,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.490
and then he looked over
and he saw [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.670
And it was afterwards,
and then he picked it up

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.670
and he was like looking.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.660
And the, he remembered
it was live streamed.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.860
And he put it down,
back into the ritual.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.790
She was so thrilled.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.460
And I was happy.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.360
I was a little
worried and nervous

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.780
because it was not a
thing where precisely--

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.260
I did it-- because he
wouldn't show himself.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.950
You see, in the book he's
shown in a heroic way

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.255
because he is a hero.

00:04:00.255 --> 00:04:02.204
He is one of our
world heroes, really.

00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:03.620
And even if we
ware not Buddhists,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.550
and we don't think of him as
our Dalai Lama [INAUDIBLE] Dalai

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.710
Lama.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.480
And Dalai means ocean or vast.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.760
And there was a name
given to the third Dalai

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.600
Lama by a Mongolian emperor.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.660
Although, the Mongolians
had never seen the ocean,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.180
that particular one.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.900
But the steppe, the great steppe
is like an ocean of grass.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.620
So Dalai means huge.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.520
And the idea is the ocean
of wisdom and compassion.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.260
That's the idea of Dalai Lama.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.630
Lama just means guru in Tibetan.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.930
But in a way, Tibetan
translation of guru into Lama

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.170
shows how Tibetans
refined the Buddhist

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.690
side of ancient Indian
culture, in a sense.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.940
It's very instructive
in the sense

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.610
that guru comes from the
Indian word, Sanskrit word,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.140
for heavy, which reflects
the patriarchal nature

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.430
of Indian society, the
heavy on top of your head

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.860
like weighing you down.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.730
Whereas Lama means someone
you can't get past.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.950
It means you can't get beyond.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.520
So I always like to say instead
of some sort of heavy weight

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.670
on top of your head, he's like
a real-- a good guru is really

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.975
like Tar Baby.

00:05:14.975 --> 00:05:16.780
You know in the old--
what comic was that?

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.900
Was that "Pogo" or something?

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.710
It was some ancient thing.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.750
AUDIENCE: Brer Rabbit.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.375
ROBERT THURMAN: Brer
Rabbit, that's it.

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:23.021
And Tar Baby is
like-- you try to--

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:23.770
Tar Baby is there.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.830
And you want to get rid of him.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.645
You don't want guru bugging
you and following you

00:05:26.645 --> 00:05:28.270
around the whole time
and making you do

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.870
whatever you're supposed to do.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.435
And so, you want
to get rid of him.

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:32.810
But then Tar Baby
was-- you would

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.592
grab Tar Baby to get rid of him
and then you'd be stuck to him.

00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:37.550
You couldn't like-- you
couldn't eliminate him.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.470
So you couldn't get past him.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.690
So the key point in
the Tibetan thing

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.270
is they realized that
the teacher is not just

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.310
a weight on top of your head.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.130
And the whole thing is not
just to revere the teacher--

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.540
although, they do.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.630
But it is to
execute the teaching

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.160
that the teacher gives you
and become a teacher yourself.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.630
So that's what the guru
wants you to do that.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.750
And in Buddhism in
Indian civilization,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.840
the guru role was somewhat
undermined by the exoteric idea

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.990
of the teacher as
[INAUDIBLE] what they call,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.710
which means a virtuous friend.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.240
So the idea of a teacher is
like a friend who inspires you

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.270
rather than an authority who
sits on top of you, which

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.770
might have been the norm
in ordinary Indian culture

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.230
before Buddha's time.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.900
He was a bit of a
rebel, the Buddha.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.330
He didn't do what
his dad told him.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.320
He should be a King.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.150
He went off to become
enlightened, whatever that is.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.970
And his dad did what dads do
when young men, or women, don't

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.200
do what they say.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.120
Locked him up.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.430
And sent in some Brahman
priest psychiatrists

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.220
to try to get him to
shape up to be a King.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.240
And so, what he did-- what
rugged individuals do--

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.070
he escaped.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.910
And ran off into the jungle.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.270
Anyway, so Dalai Lama,
that's Dalai Lama means.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.500
And then, nowadays, we're in
a time in the world, which

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.370
you all know very, very well.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.010
And actually, your company
is very, very important

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.730
in this time in the world toward
a successful outcome, which

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.080
we are going to have.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:21.090
We have to have because we owe
that to the future generations.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.240
And also, we'll be
back in future lives.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.550
And we don't want to
live in a slag heap,

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.460
or have to migrate to
a different planet.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.210
And I guarantee you,
though, that is the case.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.790
I know that many of you are
scientifically oriented.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.380
Computer science is a big
thing around here and so forth.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.230
I know that.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.140
And you may have fallen for
the modern materialist legend

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.640
that you only live this
once, this one life.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.740
But that's one thing that is
at the base of materialism

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.580
is a philosophical view, which
underlies modern science.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.000
But actually, it is the one
thing that has no evidence.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.820
It is nothing but a
blind faith belief

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.560
if you actually think about it.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.350
And you know that right
away from your common sense.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.780
What is one thing that no
one will ever discover?

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.280
No scientist will ever discover?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.030
What is one thing that we
know for sure will never

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.065
be discovered?

00:08:15.465 --> 00:08:15.965
Nothing?

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.370
How about nothing?

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.410
Who is going to ever
discover nothing?

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.980
And is anybody going to give
them a Nobel Prize for that?

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.690
No way.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.420
So the idea that someone is
going to become nothing just

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.350
by the wetware--

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.429
what John Perry Barlow
calls meatspace.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.650
It's because the meat level--

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.179
the brain, the body--

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.890
will cease at some time.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.900
But the subtle energy
of consciousness,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.600
that that then suddenly
becomes nothing.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.680
It's the one thing
in the universe that

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.340
doesn't have continuity like
the law of thermodynamics,

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.260
the non-destruction of energy.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.510
It's the one energy that
just becomes nothing.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.680
And the idea to become nothing
when nothing is nothing.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.020
Can you do that?

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.540
Right?

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.810
No one can ever do that.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.520
So therefore, the
foundation of materialism,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.810
which is supposed to be
rational and evidence based,

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.290
is blind faith.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.960
It can't be anything other
than blind faith cooked up

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.280
by people who were scared by
preachers that if they did this

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.480
and that they might end up in
hell, which is very unpleasant.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.230
It's the most unpleasant
thing you can imagine.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.160
But once the future is
open-ended, and perhaps

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.080
endless, anything is possible.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.930
So then naturally,
it's a little scary.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.460
Meanwhile, those materialists
have convinced you--

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.440
and we can always debate
this in the question period--

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.490
that nothingness is real
and discovery and science

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.900
knows that.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.470
Because why?

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.970
Science went and
put some electrodes

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.080
on some piece of meat,
brain, like a dead body,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.480
and they didn't find any
action going on in there.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.200
So?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.310
Nobody ever said the mind
was still in the body.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.840
The person is dead.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.610
So that's not a discovery.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.610
The nothing can't be discovered.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.410
So it's only
asserted out of faith

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.780
that you won't have a
worry about your future.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.930
The reason I mention
that is primal.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.830
That's the foundation
of the Buddhist biology.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.380
The foundation of
Buddhist biology--

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.170
not Buddhist religion
or Buddhist faith,

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.770
Buddhist biology--

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.710
is that life is endless.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.080
And therefore, it
is our duty always

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.490
to make it better for
ourselves and others.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.870
For example, enemy, Wyatt
Earp walks into town.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.830
Draws his pistol.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.480
And blows away somebody.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.270
But from Buddhist point of
view, from the Buddhist science

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.400
point of view, that
person is not gone.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.581
They just are
deprived of a body.

00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:48.330
And then, they are
really annoyed with you

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.920
because you just shot them.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.200
So they're going to find a
womb in a neighboring town.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.158
They're going to grow up
and practice shooting.

00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:56.050
And they're going
to come get you.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.650
So therefore, there must
be another way of dealing

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.110
with them, like having a chat.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.954
Getting to know
them on Facebook.

00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:06.120
Or maybe I shouldn't mention
that, whatever Google--

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.980
Google Chat.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.280
Sorry, having a
Google chat with them.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.540
Because we're all entangled.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.570
In other words, entanglement of
life is endless and infinite.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.610
And therefore, we never
get out of the way

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.310
from the consequences
of how we treat people.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.260
And therefore, we should
always treat them better.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.330
It's all-- it flows right
out of their biological view.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.950
And the biological view is--

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.620
and also, Buddha's
time, and actually

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.730
most of the Asian people, they
were not like the creationists

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.180
nowadays in supposedly
advanced modern society

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.580
who are terrified of the
idea that they somehow might

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.620
be connected to a chimpanzee.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.120
And so therefore-- genetically--

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.890
And so therefore,
they have these--

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.900
they have these
dioramas in San Diego

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.180
and places where they show Adam.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.340
And Adam is, of course,
blonde and blue-eyed,

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.740
or slightly reddish tinged
with a little bit of a beard.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.770
He's lying on the
ground like this.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.730
And he has like a
wound in his rib

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.540
where they popped
out the lady who was

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.410
supposed to wash the dishes.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.140
I mean, come on.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.780
It's too silly.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.190
Anybody in Buddhist science,
or Buddhist biology,

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.040
they're perfectly
cool with chimpanzee.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.790
And not only do they not mind
being connected to chimpanzee,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.820
but everybody realizes
that at some previous time

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.870
in the beginningless
sequence of lives

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.380
they personally
were chimpanzees.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.880
We've all been chimpanzees.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.700
And then, if we behave
like a chimpanzee now,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.230
there's a danger we might
gravitate toward the chimpanzee

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.627
again in the future.

00:12:34.627 --> 00:12:35.710
And that wouldn't be cool.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.140
You could not definitely do a
Google Chat as a chimpanzee.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.640
You would just break--

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:48.660
you'd break your Android
when you try to eat it maybe.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.580
So this is by way
of introduction

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.180
of "The Man of Peace,"
the Dalai Lama, who is--

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.230
the main thing about this book--

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.150
and why do I like
the Dalai Lama?

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.550
I've known him for 53 years.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.260
I met him in '64.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.530
And over these 53 years, what
I can give him credit for--

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.894
I can't say that by
studying with him

00:13:08.894 --> 00:13:11.560
and knowing and being his friend
and studying with his teachers,

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.530
too, which I did,
that I'm enlightened.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.450
Because I still--

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.640
I have to check with my
wife how enlightened I am.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.600
And I don't quite
get a full pedigree.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.980
i don't have the PhD
enlightenment from my wife

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.860
quite yet.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.440
But with my children,
oh wow, not at all.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.310
I'm a carpenter.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.030
And I built a house in--

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.490
I'm building my own house.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.920
It started in 1972.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.810
And is still not quite finished.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.560
And my son made a motto for me,
which fits me as a teacher too,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.240
so don't expect too much.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.994
And he said my dad's
motto is why do it right

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:48.160
when you can do it yourself?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.170
And I'm very proud of that.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.970
When I tell that to people,
they don't-- some people in more

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.864
authoritarian societies,
they don't laugh.

00:13:59.864 --> 00:14:01.280
They're like, oh,
a son is talking

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.480
like that about his dad.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.140
That's terrible.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.320
What's the matter with that
dad that he's proud of it?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.025
So anyway, but what he has
done for me over these years--

00:14:12.025 --> 00:14:14.580
the Dalai Lama--
is he's helped me--

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.230
I mean, he hasn't
done it single-handed.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.120
I have a really wise
and wonderful wife.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.920
And I've got really great kids.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.570
And I had some
other older teachers

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.290
than him, who were also
really good teachers.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.130
But he's cheered me up.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.510
I am less depressed.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.080
And although when you
look at the world,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.040
or you watch CNN for a few
minutes, you have really

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.550
take a nose dive about
what's actually going on

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.850
as far as being unpractical
and unrealistic and asinine

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.650
on this planet.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.900
Reverting to things
like racisms and things

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.440
like that that supposedly
were over a long time ago,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.390
completely into it.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.490
And it's leaders.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.960
But I think the people are not.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.330
I think the mass of our
people are still good.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.170
I find that.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.240
The Dalai Lama
helps me see that.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.150
He himself-- people are
always surprised about him

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.860
because the Tibetan
people have suffered

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.940
a great deal, a kind of
neocolonial situation

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.700
with their big neighbor, which
is really not their fault.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.420
It's just the way the
world system works,

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:24.300
the system of militarism and
consumerism, industrializing.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.510
We think of industrialization
as an automatic good thing.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.140
Like Google, do no evil,
industrial, information,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.326
and search and
interconnection of people.

00:15:34.326 --> 00:15:36.200
And I think it is actually
a very good thing.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.530
But any good thing
can be messed up.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.890
And the problem
always still remains,

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.700
if you industrialize
negative mental states--

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:51.820
and the Buddhists would say
ignorant delusion, greed based

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.970
on that ignorant delusion,
and hatred or anger based

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.450
on that delusion, and
then jealousy and pride,

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.050
and they have a whole long list.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.550
But those are the main ones.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.340
So if you take the two
most important ones

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.505
after the basic delusion,
you have greed and anger,

00:16:07.505 --> 00:16:09.580
or greed and hatred.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.842
And greed magnifies into
industrial consumerism.

00:16:12.842 --> 00:16:14.050
And we see what that's doing.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.480
It's destroying
the planet climate.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.780
Climate change, which luckily
the governor of Florida

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.530
assures us is not
happening right after Irma.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.240
It's not happening.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.760
Rick Scott, luckily
thank goodness.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.440
And it is happening.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.790
And it's very dangerous.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.000
And as we're continuing
to add to it very badly.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.500
And then hatred magnifies
industrially into militarism.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.260
And look at this whole
thing with the two--

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:50.350
I call it the two hairdos,
two hairdo confrontation.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.380
Kim Jong-Un with his
dark, little whatever

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.230
that is, little mountain,
and then the guy

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.209
with the fox who bit him
on the head, the wild fox.

00:17:00.209 --> 00:17:01.000
That's not my joke.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.660
Somebody made that joke.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.990
And they're like going
to do each other in.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:10.450
Meanwhile, they both
need decent hairdressers

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.410
or be content to be a bit bald.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.640
So that's militarism.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.460
And huge budget to
militarism, enormous.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.359
And it really could destroy us
all in the flick of a switch.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.619
But as one of my Tibetan
teachers used to say,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.870
if you want to take a
scientific description

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:33.130
of a nuclear or hydrogen
bomb, or a nuclear holocaust,

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.920
you would have all these things
with uranium and plutonium

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.960
and this and that,
trigger mechanisms,

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.010
and then all of the e equals
Mc squared, and whatever,

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.650
the instability of the
atoms, of impermanence

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.640
of the actual instability, and
the fact that life is something

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.320
that you have to serve.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.680
You can't control
and hold it rigidly.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.380
You have to learn
to flow with it.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.810
And he said,
however, people don't

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.340
put in the primary
ingredient of such a thing

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.750
is hatred in the human mind.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.000
It is hatred that
builds up that has

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.060
to have a war, that builds
up the idea of an enemy that

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.730
has to be
exterminated, that then

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.820
goes into the brilliant
mathematics and chemistry

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.450
and whatever involved to end
up with a destructive weapon,

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.230
like a nuclear weapon.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.510
So hatred is the key
original component.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.110
And I don't know what the
chemical formula for hatred is,

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.610
but it connects the bile in
meat space in the human body

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.510
as Tibetan medicine will say.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.080
And it's very, very
dangerous, obviously.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.510
So that's really the cause of
the total disaster of Tibet

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.560
over the last 65 years.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.480
But the good side
of that disaster

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.480
is that the Dalai Lama has
become well known to the world.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.440
And the world has a chance of
being cheered up, including--

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.650
the world including China
has a chance of being cheery

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.890
and cheered up.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.200
And so, that's the
virtue of this book.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.320
And I did write a
book before this--

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.140
before the last time
I visited here called

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.680
"Why the Dalai Lama Matters,"
in which just in words

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.070
I depicted the process of
how the Dalai Lama, who--

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.710
it isn't a question of whether
he really is that or not.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.079
Non-Buddhist people--
non-Tibetan people even--

00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:19.120
they may be Buddhists,
but they don't necessarily

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.060
believe the way the Tibetans
believe about the Dalai Lama.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:27.250
But still, the fact that there
is a form of world belief

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.880
system that they believe that
the equivalent of their Jesus--

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.580
to use the Christian thing--

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.510
is still here.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.050
The Christians with the
rapture thing and they're

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.337
waiting for him to come back.

00:19:40.337 --> 00:19:42.670
And meanwhile, they're playing
golf and they have this--

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.760
they have a Baptist church
and then a Catholic church.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.330
They're trying to make the
best of a difficult situation.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.250
And often, the
institutions actually

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.890
add to the difficult
situation by forgetting

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.890
what their job really is, which
is to serve their followers not

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:57.970
to own them.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.830
And then, they
become competitive,

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.630
the religious institutions do.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:06.850
But point is that the Jesus
figure in the Buddhist thing

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.240
is [INAUDIBLE],,
the Savior figure.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.200
And he's always there.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.130
So that's irritating.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.640
You have those books,
"What Would Jesus Do."

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.250
What would Buddha do?

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.290
Well, they write a book like
that and you think, well,

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.039
I should be nice.

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:22.330
But I don't feel like it today.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.470
So luckily, Jesus is not here.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.030
And later I can make peace
and I can confess and repent,

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.950
and same with Buddha,
the Buddhist thing.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.180
But if Jesus was right
there, well, you'd

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.880
be a little more under
pressure, wouldn't you?

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.456
So you would have
to try to be better.

00:20:37.456 --> 00:20:38.830
Because the person
is right here.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.870
So it's a culture like that.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.070
And in a way-- therefore,
Dalai Lama reminds us,

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.590
being a worldwide
celebrity that he is--

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:56.380
in those Reuters,
International Times,

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.280
Gallup poll, or whatever they
are, polls, worldwide polls,

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.890
Dalai Lama always
is up in the top 10.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.800
Sometimes he's neck and
neck with Angelina Jolie.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.290
Sometimes he's neck
and neck with the Pope.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.432
Sometimes he's--
the particular Pope.

00:21:11.432 --> 00:21:13.390
Some of the popes were
not so high on the list,

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.640
but the present one
is very, very high.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.120
And he always wins
that, which is amazing.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.300
Did any of you see the
John Oliver little thing

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.110
on "Last Week Tonight," or
yesterday or whatever it is.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.070
It's some time thing.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.290
He went and interviewed
the Dalai Lama.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.524
And there at one point
early in the introduction

00:21:31.524 --> 00:21:33.190
to the actual interview
in India that he

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.939
did-- which it's on YouTube.

00:21:34.939 --> 00:21:35.980
You'd love it if you see.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.960
It's very funny and very nice.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.780
And shows the personality
of the Dalai Lama.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.420
And they asked some
people in Times Square

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.570
or something, what do you
think about the Dalai Lama?

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.010
And they said, oh, he's great.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:48.820
He's nice.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.970
They would go like that.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.720
And then they said,
well, what does he do?

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.290
Or where is he?

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.760
I don't know.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.320
They had no idea.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.840
But somehow they just like him.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:04.520
But the reason they like him is
that he is this super celebrity

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.800
authority.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.360
And yet, he says
peace is possible.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.380
And we are going to
have it, actually.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.940
And yet, he's been
in a situation

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.580
where his people
have been ethnocided,

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.100
and are still being
ethnically cleansed,

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.810
you could say, trying to
cynicize, assimilated, which

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.200
won't work, actually, ever.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.670
It hasn't worked in 55 years.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.960
And it's not going to work.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.726
But anyway, they're still at
it, some old-fashioned people.

00:22:28.726 --> 00:22:30.850
Just like in our country,
some old-fashioned people

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.590
think the Pentagon
is going to save

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.709
us and another $100
billion, $200 billion

00:22:35.709 --> 00:22:37.625
bunch of aircraft carriers
or something, which

00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:39.220
is completely silly.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.830
As you guys know, you can
hack an aircraft carrier.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.690
And it'll take its own
gun and shoot itself

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.940
in the foot, which would
make it sink, as you know.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.489
you guys know better than
I do that sort of thing.

00:22:51.489 --> 00:22:53.530
So it's silly why we are
spending all that money.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.670
It's completely asinine.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.350
Instead of hiring
some good hackers

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.390
and going out and finding
anonymous and having

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.120
them work for the good guys.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.690
It's ridiculous.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.060
But anyway, they are still
in charge of this scene,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.830
even though the people are
not really wanting that.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.890
And it takes the Dalai
Lama-- like, in my case,

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.400
when I'm so upset about Iraq
invasion or something like

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.150
that--

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.700
which I really was.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.910
Not to mention the coup
d'etat that kicked out

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.621
Al Gore, who was Mr. Cute,
earth in the balance, let's

00:23:21.621 --> 00:23:22.120
save the--

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.120
"Inconvenient Truth," who
should have been our president.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.920
Remember he was our
president in exile

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.685
for eight years while we--

00:23:28.685 --> 00:23:31.660
while Darth Cheney
wrecked the whole place

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.930
and wrecked the
Middle East totally

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.430
into the mess that it is now.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.030
And when I was upset like that,
Dalai Lama pointed out to me,

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.370
well, it's too bad
it went like that.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:43.830
But was it a big mistake?

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.890
Sure.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.980
But will it have
a real bad effect?

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.830
Sure.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:52.270
But 100 years ago,
all of the people,

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.900
in the beginning of the
1900s, the 20th century,

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.720
the world's people
more or less expected

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.510
that some warriors would
win something, somewhere,

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.710
and that would decide
how the world worked.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.920
So the war was look at as
the ultimate arbiter of how

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.430
the structure of things.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.330
And British colonial,
the British empire

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.670
was just coming to an
end, Victoria, just

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.770
the end of the 19th century.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.950
And the people all
agreed that they

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.700
had to have that because
that's how things

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.235
are decided in the world.

00:24:23.235 --> 00:24:24.860
Whereas at the end
of the 20th century,

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.700
even though there's still
all this ridiculous arms

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.380
trade that is a really
huge economic thing--

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.620
and we hear about
terrible things in Africa,

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.190
Liberia, and the
children soldiers

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:41.120
shooting everybody and
horrible atrocities and things.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.040
But we don't really
hear about the arms

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.050
dealers who flew
in seven helicopter

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.390
loads of the Kalashnikovs
and machine guns,

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.880
et cetera to create
a horrible disaster,

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.310
so they could run in and grab
a lot of diamonds and things

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.810
like that.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.550
We don't hear what the
real reasoning of that.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.110
Otherwise, people
might be having

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.730
fistfights in the street,
some uncontrolled people.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.960
But they wouldn't be doing
these blood baths that they do.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.000
So I'm saying he pointed out to
me that the people in the world

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.940
don't agree.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.450
Everybody knows subliminally--

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.760
I think really in
1945 we learned it

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.160
at the misdeed of Truman.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.120
I can't forgive Truman, not only
because when I meet sometimes

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.010
some Japanese people
and they hear Thurman

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.270
they think it maybe is Truman.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.400
And they give me a certain look.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.190
Not only that, but
also that OK, he

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.320
wanted to show there was
an atom bomb existed.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.480
But he could have dropped--
it would have been bad

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.950
for the fish--

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.240
in Tokyo Bay.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.660
But he could have dropped
the first couple in the bay.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.820
I just never can
forgive our country

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.370
for dropping it on all these
little ladies in kimonos

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.820
who really could care less about
evil [INAUDIBLE] and so on.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.490
It wasn't their fault.
They were completely

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.890
subjugated by a
fascist government.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.690
And why drop it on those people?

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:57.190
I think that really was
something sad, personally.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:58.670
I don't know how you feel.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.400
But the point is
the minute happened,

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.752
what was the subliminal
message around the world?

00:26:02.752 --> 00:26:04.210
Subliminal message
around the world

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.780
was that your own
atoms are filled

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.859
with limitless energy that
could completely pulverize you

00:26:11.859 --> 00:26:13.400
in a split second
if they were caught

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.580
in a certain kind
of chain reaction.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.910
So suddenly, people's
sense of I'm so solid

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.160
and my possessions are solid,
and my land, and my nation,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.680
and everything is
nothing is solid.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.900
Everything is fluid.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.170
It's like surfing in
California, life is.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.350
You can't pin it down or
you'll be trashed by a wave.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.900
And I think subtle impermanence
entered unconscious

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.219
of the entire planet,
I really think so.

00:26:38.219 --> 00:26:39.760
A lot of people in
denial, of course,

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.343
of what has entered
their unconscious.

00:26:41.343 --> 00:26:43.780
But I'm not saying everybody
is aware of that like that.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.930
But from that point on, who
has won any war anywhere?

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.150
Has anybody?

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.460
People always say about
the Dalai Lama, well,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.570
he's so cute and nice.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.680
That's why I have written the
recent several books about him,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.100
including this one.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.260
He's so nice and sweet.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.020
I love to see him.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:26:59.936
Hear about the Dharma.

00:26:59.936 --> 00:27:01.270
It's really great.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.340
But his political
thing, it's impractical.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.120
Nonviolence?

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.370
How can that work
internationally?

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.620
And how can you get
free and save people

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.320
from being pushed around by
authoritarian governments

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.100
by nonviolence?

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.960
That's really silly.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.140
Even nowadays, we have
the wonderful resistance

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.780
that went to Washington
at inauguration.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.980
The pussy hat march, I love it.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.590
It's so great.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.870
The women showing
determination and getting out

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.420
there, but happily.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.470
That march was happy.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.116
People were cheerful and joyful.

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:32.490
And then, yet some
of them, there

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.720
are some people on quote
"the left," who are antifa.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.170
They wanted to break some
windows and throw some rocks.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.390
And they want to counter
violence with violence.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.050
That's really stupid.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:46.570
In fact, the FBI used to send
people, in '68 in the riots--

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.330
Herbert Hoover used to
send agent provocateur,

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:53.620
the oppressive force, will
send a violent protester

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.050
in a nonviolent
situation to discredit

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.820
the protesters and
the resistance,

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.940
the democratic resistance.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.850
So for the resisting people
who want sanity in the country

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:08.020
and in the government
and lack of overcoming

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.240
the injustices and
the inequality,

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.660
for them to do violence, is
just going to get discredited.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.380
So the point is now
the people in the world

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.190
realize that war is useless.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:20.140
They don't want it.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.970
They want daycare centers.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.840
They want education.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.480
They don't want
mass incarceration.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.340
They want education.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:33.340
In South Carolina, they don't
have many schools and colleges

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:33.980
and so forth.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.760
And they have bad schools
for the black population.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.590
And they have tons of prisons.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.180
And they rush into
high school classes

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.630
and try to plant some pot
or something on somebody,

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.700
or some crack, and then
haul them into prison,

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.300
so they won't be able to vote.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.270
It's just an attempt
to re-establish

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.020
racist, Jim Crow and so forth.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.500
And they have done it
successfully, seemingly.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.820
But nobody really wants this.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.440
The mass of the
people don't want it.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.780
But the minorities
are hyperactive

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.500
because they're not happy.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.070
And they're blaming
their unhappiness

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.934
on the wrong causes.

00:29:07.934 --> 00:29:10.350
And of course, the people who
are causing the unhappiness,

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.140
certain oligarch
types, purposely

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.940
do that to divide the people
who they are oppressing.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.440
That's a standard strategy.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.250
So then I get really upset--

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.830
to get back on message--

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.210
I get really upset.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.496
Oh no, he's invading Iraq.

00:29:26.496 --> 00:29:27.370
It's all going wrong.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:27.880
It's terrible.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.671
We're not going to have
a century of peace.

00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:31.540
And the Dalai Lama
reminds me that, yes,

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:37.260
the leadership is all
crazed still, Putin, Trump,

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.180
whatever, whoever you have.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.230
But the people don't want it.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.810
It's just they don't do
what the people want.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.180
And we now are like that
in supposedly the bastion

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.730
of democracy.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.000
70% of the people
want Medicare for all.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.440
But they, oh, that's impossible.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.270
Oh no, we can't do that.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.672
The owners and their
contributors say no.

00:29:58.672 --> 00:30:00.880
They're not going to do what
their constituents want.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.840
That's a definition of
non-democracy, right?

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.280
But the masses of
people are there.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.650
And we will prevail the
Dalai Lama reminds me.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.030
So he cheers me up.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.830
So I don't get despaired.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.290
If you think that it will
never work, you'll despaired.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.410
And that also is one of
the causes of the problem.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.450
How many people voted
in the last election?

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.170
This one that has
gone so badly awry.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.850
How many people voted?

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:26.960
Less than 70, right?

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.730
I think 62 or something, was it?

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.190
Is it 460?

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.410
And of those,
hundreds of thousands

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.710
were disqualified by
interstate crosscheck,

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.490
by various mechanisms within
the 30 Republican states where

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.400
you have Republican secretaries
of state who count the votes.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.550
As Stalin famously said, it
isn't just a matter of how many

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:50.720
and who votes and what they
vote for, it's who counts them.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.850
He was quite aware of that
because he was counting them.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.860
And he somehow kept
winning in spite

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.920
of sending half the intelligent
people to the Gulag.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.760
So he cheers you up.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.110
So this book is to cheer you up.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.540
I'm sorry, if I've made
you gloomy by talking

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.967
about the mess, I Apologize
because the whole point

00:31:07.967 --> 00:31:08.800
is to be cheered up.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.633
You have to face it.

00:31:09.633 --> 00:31:12.070
You have to resist it joyfully.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.190
You joyfully resist.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.590
You will succeed.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.470
You happily resist.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:16.950
You will succeed.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.580
I gave talks at
Occupy Wall Street.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.810
I gave a couple of talks.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:21.560
And they liked it.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.810
And they were going like this.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.650
And I was explaining
to them that actually

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.596
down there with their
drum circle and this

00:31:26.596 --> 00:31:28.970
and that-- well, they weren't
very well-fed and so forth.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.636
And they were a little
bit cold at night

00:31:30.636 --> 00:31:32.940
and they were sleeping in
garbage bags and things.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.880
But that's like camping out.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.880
But the people upstairs
in the comfortable rooms

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.180
in the leather chairs
who were scared of them,

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.210
and also scared of the
market going this way,

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.410
and lose a billion
dollars in three minutes

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.410
and whatever, those people
were just as stressed out,

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.270
if not more so.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.185
And they shouldn't hate them.

00:31:52.185 --> 00:31:54.560
The people they were protesting
against, they shouldn't--

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.059
we've had--

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.790
18th, 19th century,
early 20th century, we

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.810
had a lot of violent revolution.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.280
And always the
violent revolution

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.340
turns out that the people who
get to the top by violence

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.310
are then more oppressive than
the previous ones who maybe

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.980
were born into being on the top
and learned a little noblesse

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.830
oblige, maybe, some,
not all of them.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.970
I'm not saying that.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.650
But it gets worse and worse,
in other words, by violence,

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:24.380
as Buddha, Jesus, [INAUDIBLE],,
Confucius, everybody has said

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.510
that for thousands of years.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.920
And Socrates said so.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.850
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.690
And we're still not listening.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.380
But the people ought to listen.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.330
Nobody here wants
a war with anybody.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.120
Nobody at Google, I'm
sure, wants a war.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.400
And we are a majority of people.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.780
We don't want a war.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.030
They can get in and
they can do fake news

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:49.759
and they can get
some Russian hacker

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:51.300
to put some news
about this and that,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.580
Hillary Clinton is
eating human flesh,

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.890
or god knows what
they wrote out there.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.530
But ultimately,
we'll clean that up.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.510
That won't happen.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.300
And we'll have this thing.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.180
So here what we see
is this young boy,

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:11.640
who was a peasant's
son, right in the border

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:16.560
between Mongolians, Tibetans,
and Chinese, with some Turks

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.780
also, some Muslim
Turks in there too,

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:23.370
a really pluralistic fringe
area of northeast Tibet,

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.640
or northwest China, how
China would call it.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.700
And he's born right
there, which was perfect

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.520
because his predecessor, in
previous incarnation, the 13th

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:37.740
Dalai Lama, had visited
Mongolia and Beijing when

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.750
the British invaded between
1904 and 1908 and 1909.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:46.230
And he realized that's a
frontier, Tibet's frontier

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.120
with the other Asian people.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.030
And that's the first Dalai Lama
who met a lot of foreigners

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.540
and began to realize about
the modern nations system.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.750
And also, the industrial
militarism being

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.490
a great danger to his country.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.850
And also, the fact that Buddhism
was not everybody's world view.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:06.030
And so, he began the process
that then this present Dalai

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.310
Lama has done, where
he has become--

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.020
he's made this
teaching of world peace

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.929
through inner peace,
which is his slogan.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.630
And his common human
religion of kindness

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.580
is another one of his slogans.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.520
And those are ancient
Buddhist views.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.639
Some Western
religion scholars say

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.489
Buddhism was the first
missionary religion

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:30.210
because Buddhism spread in many,
many cultures and countries.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:31.900
India itself was many countries.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.360
It was never one country.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.533
It was subcontinent with
many languages and things.

00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:37.949
And then, it spread
all over Asia.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.830
And it went and leaked
to the west Asia

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.929
also through Iran and so on.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:46.510
Manichaeism, which was a
version of Christianity,

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.860
they considered Buddha
one of their ancestors

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.449
not just Jesus--

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.190
Buddha Zoroaster and Jesus
with him, and Manichaeins.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.550
And that had an influence
even on Christianity.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.392
So it had-- it spread a lot.

00:34:58.392 --> 00:34:59.850
So they say it's
missionary, but it

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.270
wasn't missionary in
the sense that it never

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:07.800
had a crusade forcing people
to become Buddhists by force.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.040
It never did that.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:09.869
They've had wars.

00:35:09.869 --> 00:35:11.160
And they've been bad Buddhists.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.720
But they never did
it for Buddhism.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.980
They just did it for--

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.700
people did it not
being Buddhist,

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.710
which is a difference,
which is a little bit

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.210
of on the plus side.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:24.330
And basically, Buddhism
always moved with commerce,

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.950
with merchants.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.960
Because it wasn't into
the military thing.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.380
It was into trade
and people engaging.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.590
Buddha himself was a traitor
to the military class,

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.620
which he should have
been a conqueror in.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.750
And he favored the
merchant class, actually.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.600
His main supporters
were merchants

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.370
because shifting the
acquisition of wealth

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.040
from military conquest
to merchant trade

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.100
is a huge step
forward in history.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.280
Because the great thing about
the preference for merchants

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.080
is you have your customer there.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.507
You try to make a good deal.

00:35:56.507 --> 00:35:58.590
Then you come back the
next time and they bring up

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.390
something else
you can trade for.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.000
And wealth is generally
being created at both ends.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.215
And then there's a little
negotiating that goes on.

00:36:05.215 --> 00:36:06.720
The problem with
the military one

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.330
is you kill your customer
right away and take everything.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.590
And then, there's nothing
to trade with the next time

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.010
just whatever you can do.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.450
And that's short term.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:20.700
It's a bit too short term, the
piratical version of commerce.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.140
So Buddha did that.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.756
And tremendous wealth arose in
Asia in those days, therefore.

00:36:24.756 --> 00:36:26.130
And that's why
the Europeans were

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.830
so bent on conquering
Asia, actually,

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.410
if you know the history.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:30.990
And that's why also
they succeeded.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.480
Chinese invented
gunpowder, but they did not

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.900
use it in warfare until they
were invaded by people who did.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.100
But they invented it.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.190
They invented the compass.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:41.310
They had ships that
were 10 times bigger

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.300
than Columbus' ships.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.670
And they went to the
New World and to Africa.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.830
And they brought
elephants and things back.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.350
And those were
trans-people actually

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.930
who did that, interestingly.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.140
The ones who made those
ships were eunuchs.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.015
They were kind of
trans, but there

00:36:57.015 --> 00:36:58.140
were a large bunch of them.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.931
And they were more
creative and intelligent

00:36:59.931 --> 00:37:01.730
than the regular Mandarins.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:04.600
And then, their
program was scrapped.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.260
But the point is they didn't
try to settle down or expand,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.420
like the Europeans,
and commit genocide

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.360
on the native people, et cetera,
or enslave the African people.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.230
They didn't do that.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.790
So therefore, the
people who were

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.360
conquered in centuries
of colonialism

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.070
were the more civilized people.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:24.090
Some day people will
write history like that.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:25.470
That's what I think.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:26.495
They don't now.

00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:28.620
They think that European
were superior because they

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.300
were the better bullies.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.880
But that's really-- we don't
think that on the street.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.220
If there's a mafia who comes
down and protection racket,

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.840
we don't think they're superior.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.120
But we might be scared
of them and pay.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.580
But we don't think they're
superior or more civilized,

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.440
not at all.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.350
So point is we've reached
a point in history

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.560
where we've
outsmarted ourselves.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.600
We can't win wars.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.040
What we get is endless
terrorism because we

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.460
obliterate whole countries if
we really fight them like Iraq.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.890
And then all you get
is chaos and terrorism.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:03.120
You don't get Iraq--

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.830
Cheney lied to us all.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.300
And said we would get oil.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.840
It would pay for the war.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.090
It would pay for the invasion.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:09.870
Remember?

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:14.130
But then once Iraq had
a new Shiite government,

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.020
they wouldn't give us
a decent oil contract.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.384
The French, the
Russians, the Chinese

00:38:18.384 --> 00:38:19.800
got all the good--
and the British

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.020
and so forth, the Italians--
got all the good oil contracts,

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:22.520
not us.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.450
Because they were angry
with us, naturally.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:29.670
We wrecked their entire
place, their whole country.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.470
So that's why war is
no longer possible.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.120
And Dalai Lama
reminds us of that.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.120
And therefore, it cheers us up.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.900
And it shows his
whole adventure.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:44.180
Nixon and Kissinger,
I don't shy away from.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.300
There they are.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.290
Oh, it's 45 minutes?

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:50.912
OK, so anyway, it ends now.

00:38:50.912 --> 00:38:53.220
And one of the things I
wanted to show everyone,

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.360
which I like to
show, is on page 265

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.620
I have the story of Xi Jinping.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.074
One of the roots of the
Dalai Lama-- my optimism--

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:05.490
Dalai Lama doesn't really put
so many eggs in this basket,

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.030
but I do.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.240
Xi Jinping, you see him there.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.130
And here he is here.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:14.880
And this picture is the
19-year-old Dalai Lama

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.170
in 1954--

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.960
or rather this is the present
Dalai Lama remembering being

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:23.040
the 19-year-old Dalai Lama,
when he was a good friend--

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.330
one of his good friends
in the Chinese government

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.830
elite at that time, Communist
elite, in the beginning

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:33.430
of the Communist
PRC, was a man called

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:39.170
Xi Zhongxun, who just happened
to be the father Xi Jinping.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:43.200
And Xi Jinping himself
was born in 1953.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.631
So he was one-year-old
at that time.

00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:48.630
And Xi Jinping's father
worked with Hu Yaobang--

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.360
for those who know anything
about Chinese history--

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.000
who is distinguished
in the Tibetan mind

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.370
by having decided that
from 1951, or '50 when

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:04.800
the first invasion began
by the Red Army, to 1980

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.550
they had made a
terrible mess in Tibet,

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:11.240
the thought reform,
class struggle,

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.835
attempt to occupy, cutting all
the trees in the eastern part,

00:40:14.835 --> 00:40:15.370
and so on.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.290
Never mind.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:17.280
I won't go into detail.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.529
But they made a terrible mess.

00:40:18.529 --> 00:40:19.920
And destroying
6,000 monasteries,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.990
killing lots of people.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.720
And so, Xi Zhongxun, and Hu
Yaobang, and Jiao Xiyang,

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.110
who people have more
heard of, those three

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.945
were trying to
make a nice policy.

00:40:29.945 --> 00:40:32.070
And that was a period of
relaxation of four or five

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.232
years in the early
'80s in Tibet when

00:40:34.232 --> 00:40:36.690
they started rebuilding those
monasteries that tourists now

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:37.290
visit.

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:40.200
Because otherwise they were all
flattened before the Cultural

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.070
Revolution.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.700
But then more so during
the Cultural Revolution.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.290
And then, he was
busted by Deng when

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:51.505
Deng got older and
hardened about it

00:40:51.505 --> 00:40:53.610
and decided he
had to crush them.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.430
And he didn't want to--

00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:00.030
especially he was frightened by
the Soviet Union melting down

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.850
and losing because [INAUDIBLE]
in the Baltics and all this.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:07.440
So he said Tibet should
be like Lithuania--

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.841
Estonia, not like
Latvia and Lithuania.

00:41:09.841 --> 00:41:11.340
In other words, we
should be filled-

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.110
we should settle
totally colonial settle

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:15.630
Tibet, which has
not been possible

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:16.980
anyway because of the altitude.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.820
But he wanted to do that.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.360
And so, that's Xi
Jinping's father.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.110
And that's Xi Jinping,
one-year-old baby.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.000
And he's getting a
blessing from Dalai Lama,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.942
but not officially because
those are the early time

00:41:29.942 --> 00:41:30.900
of the Communist thing.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.510
You can't ask for a
blessing, except from Mao.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.300
That's the only guy who
can give you a blessing.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.354
But still, he's getting
a blessing, of course.

00:41:38.354 --> 00:41:40.020
And he really-- they
were great friends.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.630
And the Dalai Lama
gave him a gold watch

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.670
that somebody had
given Dalai Lama.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:49.440
And the family kept that
gold watch until today.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.770
So the Dalai Lama is
musing about that.

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:53.000
Isn't that interesting.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.880
And now, he had no contact.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.190
He doesn't know him at all.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:00.980
But he said now that guy is the
president of the country who

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:06.380
I want to talk to, now, him,
whose dad was my friend.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.150
And I want explain
to him that we really

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.730
do want to be in a union.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.960
And we really want to
be of help to China.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.330
And we want to help rekindle
the spirituality that

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.220
will make you happy.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.520
And please let us do that
and stop this nonsense.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.870
Those guys who are
doing the old crush

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.330
the natives type of routine.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:36.050
And then, here, when he first
gets in 2012, he authorizes--

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.410
well, I don't know that
for a fact, but I assume--

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:41.870
this lady, who is the
head of the leader--

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.440
one of the deans of the
leadership school in Beijing.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.220
And her specialty is
the minorities policies.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:55.310
But she's a dean of that
school, important school.

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:59.250
And she gets authorized to
say, this is silly, this thing.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:00.350
Dalai Lama is so bad.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.686
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:43:01.686 --> 00:43:02.810
He's the head of the snake.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.430
We have to destroy
him, blah, blah, blah.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.513
No one should talk to him.

00:43:05.513 --> 00:43:06.510
No one give him a visa.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.150
Oh, it's going to
ruin us if he goes

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:12.483
and has a cackle with
a weird president.

00:43:12.483 --> 00:43:14.070
Never mind.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.270
I won't get into that.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:18.690
And we should take
him at his word.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:20.080
Tibet wants to be of help.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.470
They want to contribute.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.150
But they want their
local autonomy

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.950
like it's promised in
our Chinese constitution.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:28.200
And they want to have
their Buddhism, which

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.890
should be allowed.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:31.806
And why not?

00:43:31.806 --> 00:43:32.930
And then, they'll be happy.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.280
We talked to their Dalai Lama.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.250
He's our friend.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.080
And he'll be our
goodwill ambassador,

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.090
which is my theory about them.

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:42.260
So she makes that statement
like a trial balloon.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.610
Then the old guard people in
the Politburo and other places,

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:47.480
oh, never are we going to--

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.520
they go back to the old thing.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.950
And this one, this a
guy called Xue Chin,

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:53.960
who used to be head of
the United Front Work

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.270
department at that time
dealing with minority.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.240
And he starts
shouting at the media.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.630
But she doesn't lose her job.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.410
She is not busted.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.140
She is not put in the
next cell to Liu Xiaobo.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.090
She still has her
job and she's fine.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.480
So that means she
had authorization.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.880
But then there's these two
question marks about him.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.200
So this is why this
is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.890
I don't want to saddle
Dalai Lama with this.

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:19.280
It's fantasy.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.650
But I expect it.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:21.740
And actually, I promise--

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:22.370
this is my last thing.

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:23.828
I know we're going
to do questions.

00:44:23.828 --> 00:44:26.407
But I promised Xi Jinping,
like I promised Hu Jintao,

00:44:26.407 --> 00:44:28.740
but he didn't-- when my earlier
book "Why the Dalai Lama

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.070
Matters"--

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:34.680
I promised, gave him 100%
guarantee, get his own Nobel

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.350
Peace Prize should
he change this policy

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.430
and start being nice not just
to the Tibetans, Tibetans,

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:44.100
Uighurs, Mongolians,
Manchus, and another 52

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.620
different types of people
who are actually not Han

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.950
Chinese people.

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:50.110
They are other kinds
of cultures and people.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:54.090
To have a truly multinational,
multi-ethnic, pluralistic,

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:58.710
wonderful, federal
Chinese union,

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.990
so I promised him the
Nobel Peace Prize.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.270
Like a EU of Asia, imagine that.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.010
What a power that would be.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.840
And then, Taiwan is solved.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.660
Hong Kong, they are all
happy to be in union.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.520
One country, many systems.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.120
No problem.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.800
What is this everybody has--

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.360
I don't know if
you guys know this.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.280
You don't know that
in Google probably

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.690
if you haven't been to Tibet.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:23.920
In Tibet, which is 1,500
miles west of Beijing,

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.814
they have to be on Beijing time.

00:45:25.814 --> 00:45:27.480
So at certain times
of the year, the sun

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.850
doesn't come up till 10:00 AM.

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:31.387
It's ridiculous.

00:45:31.387 --> 00:45:32.970
They won't allow
time zones because it

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.920
might be out of control.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.660
Everybody's not
on the same time.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.100
That's the guys in Beijing.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.780
That's really silly.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:40.857
Don't you think?

00:45:40.857 --> 00:45:42.690
It's like we'd have to
be in California here

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.330
you'd have to be on
Washington, DC time.

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.420
So it would be really weird.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.730
It wouldn't work out.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:53.460
So anyway, but it ends-- then
after that, it's a sad scene.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.500
Tibet is still in this
lockdown situation.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.530
So then we have
an epilogue where

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.990
it shows the Dalai Lama
fulfilling his life's

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:05.760
mission of promoting basic
kindness and human values

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.610
worldwide, of getting
the world religions--

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:11.010
and he includes secular
humanism and materialism.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.920
He's much more polite than
I am about materialists.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.560
Secular humanism consider
it like a world religion.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.860
Scientism we call it
in religious studies.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.110
And so, we have Carl Sagan
and David Bohm there.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:24.450
We should have had Einstein,
but we couldn't remember.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.310
He's not alive now.

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:30.280
Sagan isn't either, but
the Dalai Lama knew him.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.230
And they were all friends.

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:34.440
And we won't have
any religious wars,

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.759
like the one that people
think is happening.

00:46:36.759 --> 00:46:38.800
And actually, Buddhists
badly are doing in Burma.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.930
I'm so sorry.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:40.830
That's a disgrace.

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.350
And we don't defend it and
rationalize it in any way.

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:47.980
And this is Tibet as a garden
of the medicine Buddha.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.330
That blue Buddha,
he's blue because he's

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:55.950
looking out at human sickness
and it makes him blue.

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:57.600
And he wants to heal it all.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.090
And he has-- he's
holding a healing plant.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.670
And he knows that the
plant world has a healing--

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.570
plants want to heal us.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.752
They take all our
nasty carbon dioxide

00:47:06.752 --> 00:47:08.460
and they give us back
oxygen. They really

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.200
like us, the plants.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.720
They to talk to us and heal us.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.110
They're very important.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:16.040
And then here is
his vision of Tibet

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.800
when China wakes up to the
asset that Tibet really

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.020
is, the global asset
that it really is.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.300
Not just for some
uranium under the soil,

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.240
not just for bottling its water
or cutting down all its trees,

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.920
or making a desert
out of its steppe

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.230
by grazing the wrong
kind of animals on it.

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:34.530
Yaks will never make a desert.

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.080
That's why Tibetans
with their yaks

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.070
are the right people
to be out there.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:40.467
But they are now shut
up by the Chinese.

00:47:40.467 --> 00:47:42.050
They're not out there
with their yaks.

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:44.680
The wrong animals are
there making a desert.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.370
A yak never bites the grass.

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:50.600
The yak doesn't graze
in agricultural lingo,

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.170
terminology.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:54.510
A yak browses, like a bookstore.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:55.449
They browse.

00:47:55.449 --> 00:47:56.990
They lick the grass
and don't disturb

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:00.980
the root of delicate
high altitude steppe.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.350
So this is Switzerland
of Asia, in other words,

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:08.090
China's gem of a healing park.

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.590
And the top of--
roof of the world,

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:13.130
headwaters of all the rivers of
Asia, the water tower of Asia,

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:15.190
the great glacier of
Tibet, the third pole, all

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:16.490
this kind of thing.

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:18.530
And that's medicine
Buddha in the middle.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:22.190
And everybody's coming from
everywhere to have a vacation,

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:25.500
and to get healthy, and to go
to a hot spring, and to have

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:30.350
herbal medicine, and to
hang out with the yaks.

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:31.634
It's really a nice vision.

00:48:31.634 --> 00:48:33.050
And he's inviting
everybody there.

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:36.017
And this is-- of course,
if China was really smart

00:48:36.017 --> 00:48:37.850
and they wanted to have
some black accounts,

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:40.520
a few of the people, they
could have a Switzerland there.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.960
They could start
a banking system

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.122
and write some
good privacy laws.

00:48:44.122 --> 00:48:45.330
And they'd be in great shape.

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:46.910
But anyway, never mind.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:47.410
That's it.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:48.596
Any questions?

00:48:48.596 --> 00:48:49.970
Because we're
getting to the end.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:52.021
We have a few minutes
for questions.

00:48:52.021 --> 00:48:52.983
Thank you.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:01.980
SPEAKER 3: So one of the
terms used for the Dalai Lama

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.391
is kundun, or the presence--

00:49:03.391 --> 00:49:05.140
ROBERT THURMAN: Kundun
means the presence.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.050
Right, that's an honorific term.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.280
SPEAKER 3: I've always
found that mysterious.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.238
I was wondering if you
could unpack that a bit.

00:49:10.238 --> 00:49:12.866
ROBERT THURMAN: Well,
that's the nature of--

00:49:12.866 --> 00:49:14.490
well, this relates
to an enlightenment.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.380
What is enlightenment?

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.351
Westerners wrongly think
that enlightenment--

00:49:18.351 --> 00:49:19.350
but I stick to the term.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:22.380
I don't so much like awakening,
but it's not wrong either.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.006
But I like enlightenment.

00:49:24.006 --> 00:49:25.380
But the thing
enlightenment means

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:29.400
that some probably usually
male guy big light bulb

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.760
goes off in his head.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.760
And then he walks around
acting holy and lights flow out

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.260
of his head.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.780
And everybody goes, oh,
[INAUDIBLE],, yes, you

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.720
need a Cadillac.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.270
I got one for you,
a Rolls Royce even.

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:43.060
That's ridiculous
business, authority thing.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.650
Enlightenment
actually is defined

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:49.980
as someone who realizes
selflessness as a reality

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.080
check, out of a reality check.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.520
In other words, it doesn't
mean they don't exist.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.060
Selflessness means that you
are relational-- your self is

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.180
a relational construct,
which you are constantly

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.290
either improving or
it's deteriorating

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:06.190
if you watch too many
commercials and too much CNN.

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:09.480
CNN creates your fear
and anger and despair.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.126
And the commercials create
your greed and dissatisfaction.

00:50:12.126 --> 00:50:13.500
So if you watch
too much of that,

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.270
your self deteriorates
and becomes

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.460
more frustrated and discontent.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.640
If you watch the Dalai Lama,
if you study, if you meditate,

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.370
if you think about
peace and love,

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:26.310
and Google do no evil
looking through the two O's

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:30.220
of the Google, then you get
better and better all the time.

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:35.190
So selflessness means there's no
fixed, rigid identity in there.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:37.090
And when you realize
that, then you

00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:39.810
become interactively
more selfless,

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:41.430
meaning loving
and compassionate.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:43.860
That's how enlightenment
is defined.

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.540
So you might not be
glowing with light

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.956
because you might be out there
healing someone, or helping

00:50:47.956 --> 00:50:51.830
them, or making something
that helps them,

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.400
or even doing
business and really

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.230
making your customer
happy as business

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:57.769
is supposed to be doing,
not just grabbing stuff

00:50:57.769 --> 00:50:58.560
from your customer.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.675
But making them happy
by doing them a service.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.470
So the presence, therefore,
comes from the fact

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:11.040
that the Dalai Lama is
perceived by people who meet him

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.770
as having a presence
where when you meet

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:17.400
you feel enfolded in a
friendly, loving presence,

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:22.010
like a child feels when
they meet their mom.

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:25.820
Or a beloved feels when
they meet their beloved, who

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.170
hopefully loves them.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:31.590
Sometimes that
happens for a while.

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:35.130
Although, don't get me
wrong, 50th anniversary we

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:37.170
had this summer, me and my wife.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.210
So we've hung in there.

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:40.800
And she's a saint.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.310
I'm just lucky.

00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:45.570
And so point is the
presence means this is

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.340
a presence where you become--

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:51.600
you feel like you're in
a positive field, a field

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.440
of calm, a field of finding
your own inner well-being,

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.720
which is your inner
happiness-- not just pleasure,

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.160
but inner happiness.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.920
And you feel that the
world is not against you.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.500
And you feel someone
who is for you and who

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.180
is interested in you.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.900
My wife once-- one guy once
asked me at a luncheon--

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.619
wealthy guy who was
a guru collector--

00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:14.660
he said, you've known the
Dalai Lama a long time.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.940
Have you ever seen
him do a miracle?

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.180
He got all excited.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.249
And I didn't know
what to say because I

00:52:20.249 --> 00:52:22.540
have seen a few unusual
things, but you're not supposed

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.540
to really talk about it.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.010
So I'm hemming and hawing.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.202
And my wife says,
oh yeah, many times.

00:52:28.202 --> 00:52:29.110
And I go, what?

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:30.625
What is she going to say?

00:52:30.625 --> 00:52:32.783
I'm like, oh no.

00:52:32.783 --> 00:52:34.850
And so then, he's leaning
forward in his chair.

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:38.355
And she says, I've seen him
in many occasions, very busy,

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:41.190
a lot of people around,
everybody wants a piece of him.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.730
He's on a tour, or a
teaching, or whatever,

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:47.610
and I have never seen him
ever in any of those times

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:51.000
fail to give his total
concentration and attention

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.970
to whomever he was sitting with.

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:56.280
And that's a miracle, she says.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.280
And the guy goes, oh.

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:02.340
He didn't understand.

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.250
I was really pleased
and I was educated

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:08.850
by my final girl, who is she.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:11.460
And that's what-- that's why
the call the presence because

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:14.099
in their presence
you feel cheered up.

00:53:14.099 --> 00:53:15.390
And so what we've tried to do--

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:16.660
thank you for that question.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.260
So this book is the
presence of the Dalai Lama.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.110
And it makes it more real
that we show the difficulties

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:26.160
that he's had not just with the
Chinese, but people like Nixon,

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.110
with the Brits--

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:28.140
the Brexit people.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.140
We're going to simply
secede from the world.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.280
Give me a break.

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:39.030
Yet he has maintains himself
as our presence-- the presence.

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:41.237
And everybody feels
it, but they don't--

00:53:41.237 --> 00:53:42.570
even they don't know what it is.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:44.310
But here then, they'll
know what it is.

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:46.410
And they will also
realize, which

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:49.020
is really key for
our country now,

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.690
that despair is not an option.

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:56.070
And non-engagement, and not
voting, and not participating,

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:59.160
and not keeping informed,
and not calling them out

00:53:59.160 --> 00:53:59.910
is not an option.

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.300
Also, not doing violence
is not an option either.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.170
But being really
actively engaged

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:07.260
in making this wonderful
gift of democracy

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.510
that we have been given, that
has now crumbled and is really

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:11.760
finished actually temporarily.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.407
It's now money-ocracy.

00:54:13.407 --> 00:54:14.240
There's no question.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.720
It's plutocracy.

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.700
It's oligarchy.

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.810
We can still do it.

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:20.620
We have a system where
we can still do it.

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:25.320
If 80% or 85% engage
fully, as Michael Moore--

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.879
Michael Moore is
going to run for--

00:54:26.879 --> 00:54:27.420
I don't know.

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.310
Fashion consultant, I think.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.270
I'm not sure.

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:33.210
Dogcatcher or president
or senator, but everybody

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:36.420
has to run for everything
in a friendly, joyful way,

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:39.750
happily, not angrily
and not upset.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.734
And that's the
message we all need.

00:54:41.734 --> 00:54:42.900
And this book will help you.

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.110
So get the book.

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:44.830
You'll enjoy it.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:47.160
Thank you very much.
