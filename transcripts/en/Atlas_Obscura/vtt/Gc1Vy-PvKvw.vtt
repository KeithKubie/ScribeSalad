00:00:00.057 --> 00:00:01.224
- As a museum,

00:00:01.723 --> 00:00:06.224
we try to represent the entire
span of all life on Earth

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:08.374
and that's what a big
collection like ours is

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:10.152
basically there for.

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:14.610
My name is Jochen Gerber.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.637
I am the Field Museum's
Invertebrates Collection Manager.

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:22.804
And today we are unboxing
a deep sea giant isopod.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.442
A deep sea giant isopod
is basically a roly-poly

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.963
like the little things that
you find in your backyard

00:00:31.963 --> 00:00:34.604
under a board or something like that.

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:37.766
Just, it's much much bigger so it's giant,

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.557
and it lives in the marine
realms in depths between

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:45.307
about three hundred and
eight hundred meters.

00:00:46.465 --> 00:00:50.482
They are scavengers, so they eat mostly

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:53.865
dead stuff that they find.
Fish, dead crustaceans,

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:58.505
dead cephalopods, squid,
and so on, even dead whales.

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:00.941
This is about as big as this species gets,

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:02.760
about a foot long.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.109
They are not on the endangered
species list right now but,

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.567
we preserve them in alcohol
because that allows us,

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:14.728
even after hundreds of years,
to study their anatomy,

00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:18.614
where they came from,
what they are related to,

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:22.705
where they sit in the
tree of life so to speak.

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:26.305
This particular specimen has
not come out of the jar for

00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:29.209
at least twenty years I would say.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.386
The preserving is done mostly by the

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:35.146
by the collector because
you have to preserve them

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:36.442
right away basically.

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:40.151
You can't put them in your
suitcase and ship them through

00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:41.963
three airports for three days,

00:01:41.963 --> 00:01:44.954
then you have a very
badly preserved specimen.

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:48.375
So they should go into alcohol
pretty much right away.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.422
Often, when I show these to the public,

00:01:51.422 --> 00:01:54.615
they are reminded of the movie "Alien".

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:58.861
There is apparently a video,
where one of these guys

00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:02.283
was together with a kind
of shark in a trap and

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:05.666
in these confined circumstances,
this thing could actually

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:09.454
latch onto the face of the
shark and started eating it,

00:02:09.454 --> 00:02:14.214
so that's scary, but as I
said, there's really no reason

00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:16.047
to be afraid of these.

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:21.214
It has a bit of the
smell of a dried shrimp,

00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:26.047
or something like that, that
you would put in Korean soup.

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:31.544
I suppose it's an acquired taste.
