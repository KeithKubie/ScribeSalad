00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.400
Okay so this is a paper entitled

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:10.560
"A structure in the early universe at z~1.3 that exceeds the homogeneity scale of the R-W concordance cosmology"

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.160
I think that's quite a mouthful for a title

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.820
That is not a catchy title

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.920
It isn't really a catchy title, no

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.040
Um but, the physics and the astronomy behind it is rather interesting

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.920
Give me a better title

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.620
Um, "The discovery of an implausibly large structure in the universe"

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.380
Wow, that's better! You should have written the title.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:46.600
There's some big structure out there, a long way away from Earth, and it's- they're saying it's the biggest structure that there is in the universe

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.520
So this is basically a collaboration which are looking at quasars in the universe, or these very bright active nuclei in galaxies

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.760
Not to study the quasars themselves, but because where there's a quasar there's a galaxy

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.580
So they're a good way of figuring out where galaxies are in the universe, where the galaxies themselves are too faint to see

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.400
And they're mapping out these quasars in three dimensions to figure out whether they're randomly spread in space

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.280
Or whether they're clustered together, and if they are clustered together how they're clustered together

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.480
Such a large structure is incompatible with a universe which is homogeneous on very large scales

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.000
Homogeneous means you're in no special place

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.820
That what we see around us is representative of everywhere else in the universe

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.020
And so, um, you don't expect, that the argument goes, I'm not so sure I buy it yet

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.340
You don't expect to see such a big structure in a universe that is meant to be, on average, homogeneous

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.820
So a quasar is a very, very bright nucleus of a galaxy

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.300
It's so bright it actually outshines the whole galaxy around it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.220
The picture we have of these things is, we believe that pretty much every galaxy has one of these massive black holes in the middle

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.480
And probably what's happening where you see a quasar, it just means that that black hole is particularly active

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.520
Which means stuff is falling into it, which is making it light up

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.060
And so when these things were first discovered, they were called quasars

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.860
Because they were called "quasi-stellar objects"

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.920
Which means they look basically like stars because all you see is this bright nucleus of the galaxy

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.060
It's only when you look very carefully you see actually there's a whole galaxy around it

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.500
But they're very useful as sort of lighthouses

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.680
Because you can see a quasar at enormous distances all the way across the universe

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.260
Even if you couldn't see a normal galaxy

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.160
What is the scale above which you would say everything looks fairly uniform,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.420
And below which you expect there to be structures?

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.740
As you said, you know, we are, you and I are quite different (laughs)

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.920
In many ways, and then you can just go up

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.100
Planets are different

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.820
Stars and then galaxies, they're different from one another

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.420
And you keep going to bigger and bigger scales, and you think, "Well, there's nothing homogeneous here"

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.120
"When I look around, things are looking quite different"

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.480
But the idea is that if you go on to large enough scales

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.960
And by "large enough," we're really talking on scales of more than 100 megaparsec

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.900
A parsec is about 3 lightyears, so we're talking about 300 million lightyears

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.920
You have to go before you begin to sort of suggest that above that scale things should start looking very similar

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.380
So what these people have found is that looking at the distribution of quasars in space

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.380
They're not randomly distributed. That's not news

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.760
But what they've actually found is that they form these incredibly large structures

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.180
When you start kind of mapping out the quasars, you find they form these enormous filaments

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.720
The latest thing that they've found, which this paper is all about

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.960
is a structure where the largest dimension of it is fairly elongated

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.320
and the longest dimension of this collection of quasars is about 4 billion lightyears long

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.140
And bearing in mind that the entire universe is only about 13 billion lightyears across

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.180
So this is almost a third the size of the universe, this structure

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.240
So it's a huge collection of these things

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.660
That sounds like the ultimate elephant in the room!

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.160
That sounds like it's the dominant beast of the universe.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.720
And actually it causes a problem because the picture we have

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.060
is that when you go to large scales, the universe is supposed to be homogeneous

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.420
There's this thing called the Cosmological Principle, which says that

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.220
one bit of the universe is really very much like another bit of the universe

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.140
And of course if you've got a structure this big

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.740
it really means that one bit of the universe isn't really like another bit of the universe

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.340
because one bit's got this massive structure in it, and another bit hasn't got this massive structure in it

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.980
The big question is whether that is

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.180
A) Is it real? Is it a real feature? I can't really comment on that

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:37.640
I just find it mindblowing that the idea you can have 73 quasars linking across a distance of 4 billion lightyears

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.460
It just blows my mind

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.940
So how did they determine that they've got this structure? But let's assume it is, let's assume it's a real structure

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.800
The next question is: Is it compatible with an idea that the universe, on large scales, is homogeneous?

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.540
It could be that, we know there are fluctuations in a universe that's homogeneous

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.320
There has to be because without those fluctuations, we wouldn't form, you wouldn't form structures

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.240
So it could be that what we're seeing is just a rather extreme fluctuation, which is perfectly consistent

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.220
And in fact there is a slightly smaller structure that was observed a couple of years ago

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.700
called the Sloan Great Wall

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.800
This was also seen in the Sloan survey

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.020
This is a structure of 200-300 megaparsecs, so it's not quite as big as this one

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.880
And even then that was pushing the idea of homogeneity

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.440
So here's this structure that they've identified

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.480
Which, as I say, is about, as I say, from end to end here, is about 4 billion lightyears long

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.220
And so they've sort of played this game of join the dots

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.160
They've found where all the quasars are and found where all their nearest neighbors are

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.720
and used that to kind of span between them to say it looks like there's a structure here

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.200
You have to be very careful when you're playing this game because

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.820
If you just threw down a bunch of quasars at random, once in a while they'd start forming things that looked like structures

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.100
And so the exercise that you have to go through once you've found something that looks like a structure

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.620
is to say, "Is this consistent with just part of a random collection of things and I just happen to have seen them arranged in this way?"

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.920
And the statistics they've done in this paper show that what they've found

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.680
is very unlikely to be just a random distribution of things

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.560
It really looks like they've found a real structure in that sense

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.960
A collection of these quasars which have formed into this arrangement of quasars

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.840
which is not consistent with them just being randomly spattered around the place

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.740
The model that we're talking about, just to give this, trying to put some flesh to these bones

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.300
is the universe is very smooth on very large scales

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.740
so if I think of the matter distribution in the universe, if I think of it as a mill pond

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.820
And that matter distribution is perfectly flat, that mill pond is perfectly flat

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.720
that's your homogeneous bit

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.700
but on top of it there are these little ripples, right?

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.560
coming from fish, some of those are fish

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.020
And um, so these ripples are there, and those are the small fluctuations

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.500
So you've got the background, homogeneous. Everything's smooth.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.720
And then you've got the small fluctuations,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.880
And where you've got slight excess fluctuations, that means the gravitational pull

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.140
You've got slightly more matter, so from Newton's law

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:10.740
Where the force of attraction is proportional to the mass, you've got slightly more here, that will cause things to attract to it

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.180
And then it will leave regions where it's attracting matter from. They'll be devoid of matter.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.140
They actually will create voids.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.720
The force that we think shapes the large-scale structure of the universe is gravity

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.920
It forces things to collapse in certain dimensions

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.920
and actually you end up forming these sort of sheets of things and filaments and those kinds of things

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.740
which we've seen all the time when we look at galaxies in the nearby universe

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.720
We find that they're not randomly spread. There are some places where there are clusters of galaxies

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.260
Some places where there are none at all, some places where they form into these sort of sheet-like structures or filament-like structures

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.100
So presumably the physics is the same on these scales

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.280
When forming these very large structures, this gravity's forcing things to collapse in certain directions

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.540
The problem is that that's not what theory predicts, right?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.080
The picture we have of the universe is that gravity shouldn't have formed structures on these kind of scales.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.980
So that's why it's starting to kind of start to challenge our picture of cosmology

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.240
is that it seems to be there but we're struggling a bit to come up with an explanation as to how it might have formed

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.360
which of course, that's when science starts getting interesting

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.700
when you start finding things that you weren't expecting to find.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:20.340
In that analogy you made with the fish or whatever it was making little ripples on our mill pond

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:27.540
What's the reality? In the real universe, what's causing these fluctuations that allow large structures to form?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.040
Okay, so this is where it gets really fun

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.380
Now we're moving back to the very early universe

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.800
How early? About 10^-35 seconds into the universe

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:49.200
That's really...Point zero zero zero zero zero zero, 35, 34 zeroes and a one, okay? Seconds into the universe

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.860
And this is a period known as, where the universe expanded exponentially quickly

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.280
And so the space expanded exponentially rapidly

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.460
And in that universe was a thing called a scalar field, a bit like the Higgs field

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.300
permeating the whole of the universe, and it fluctuated because of quantum mechanics

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.780
just like the Higgs field fluctuates. (Randomly?) Randomly

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:19.860
And those fluctuations, the big difference that goes on here, is that those fluctuations don't just remain small

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.620
Because the universe is expanding so rapidly, they quickly get--they--get grabbed hold of

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.620
I'm getting too excited and I'm speaking too quick--slow down

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.900
They, they (Ed, I will never accuse you of speaking too quickly)

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:41.200
These fluctuations get grabbed hold of by the expansion of the universe, and stretched onto big, big scales

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.620
and those are the cosmological scales

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.280
and it's there that the initial seeds came from.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.180
So what we're seeing when we look at the large-scale structures in the universe

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.000
When we look at the microwave background fluctuations in the W map

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.060
and see these hot and cold spots

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.940
What you're actually seeing is an imprint of those very early moments,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.580
way before a microsecond, way before a nanosecond into the universe's history

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.840
when these fluctuations from the field emerged.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.480
(A big, blown-up projection of just a funny little wobble in a field) Wow
