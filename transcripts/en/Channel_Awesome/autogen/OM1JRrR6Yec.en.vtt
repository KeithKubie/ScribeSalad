of a he felt out of place in the world

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310
of a he felt out of place in the world
 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.620
of a he felt out of place in the world
because he doesn't know why he's

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630
because he doesn't know why he's
 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.160
because he doesn't know why he's
different

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170
different
 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.540
different
he knows he's different he doesn't know

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550
he knows he's different he doesn't know
 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.330
he knows he's different he doesn't know
why his parents are more afraid of

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340
why his parents are more afraid of
 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.260
why his parents are more afraid of
letting his his his powers out which

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270
letting his his his powers out which
 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.370
letting his his his powers out which
leads to him being a little more

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380
leads to him being a little more
 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.500
leads to him being a little more
reserved so I like that there's this

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510
reserved so I like that there's this
 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.810
reserved so I like that there's this

especially like the first half a Man of
 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.080
especially like the first half a Man of
Steel as he starts to realize that I

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090
Steel as he starts to realize that I
 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.850
Steel as he starts to realize that I
should be able to show these these

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860
should be able to show these these
 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.680
should be able to show these these
powers and I think that and lends to him

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690
powers and I think that and lends to him
 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.990
powers and I think that and lends to him
being conflicted and complicated but not

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
being conflicted and complicated but not
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.090
being conflicted and complicated but not
necessarily like I don't think he's dark

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100
necessarily like I don't think he's dark
 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.130
necessarily like I don't think he's dark
and like a depressed character like
