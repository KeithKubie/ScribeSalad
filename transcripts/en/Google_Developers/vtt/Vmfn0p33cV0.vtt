Hi, I'm Przemek.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.470
This is Agnieszka.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.240
We're from Migam, and we
try to make life easier

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.060
for our deaf community
around the world.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.700
We have two main products.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.880
One of those is already working
and have a lot of customers.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:34.360
It's a translation system when
we use video for interpreting.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.000
And second one, we
have a working beta.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.630
This is automatic
translation system,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.200
and we use kinetic camera
and neural networks,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.960
and we build system that
is able to translate sign

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.610
language automatically,
and the other side.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.150
Biggest challenge for us
is to get enough quality

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.860
data, because for
the last 40 years,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.650
different teams from
different countries

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.670
try to build system that will
be able to translate sign

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.550
language into spoken language.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.560
And it's possible
now, because now there

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.960
is camera such as
kinetic camera.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.230
There is devices like
[INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.750
These devices give
us information

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.340
about 3-D. Information
about the deaf.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.200
We use this data
to map, especially

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.640
at points about human body.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.210
And we can recognize the
fingers and the face,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.050
and recalibrate all
the data and this

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.480
is the input for
our internal brains.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.140
What is very important for us
is the fact that, to communicate

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.820
with deaf people,
the paper and the pen

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.260
is not enough, because
a lot of deaf people

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.270
have problem with
understanding the written text

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.100
because the native
language is sign language.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.490
They have totally
different grammar.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.130
This is just a
different language.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.220
For example, in Poland, Polish
language is very hard to learn.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.030
And for deaf people
who live in Poland,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.320
it's much easier to learn
English than Polish.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.730
That's why this
is a big challenge

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.440
to communicate with deaf
using only paper and the pen.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.990
Our system, we help them
to improve communication

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.890
in every day.
