00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.180
If you're wondering, this is how the most revolutionary course in biology of all time begins.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.380
Come today to learn about covalent and ionic and hydrogen bonds.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.680
What about electron orbitals, and the octet rule

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.020
and what does it all have to do with a madman named Gilbert Louis?

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.760
It's all contained within.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.580
[Intro theme plays]

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.060
Hello! I'm Hank. I assume you're here because you're interested in biology,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.460
and if you are, that makes sense because like any
good 50 Cent song-

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.100
biology is just about sex, and not dying.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.840
Everyone watching this should be interested in sex and not dying,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.040
being that you are, I assume, a human being.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.500
I'm going to be teaching this biology course differently than most courses you've ever taken in your life,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.550
for example, i'm not going to spend the first class talking about how I'm going to spend the rest of the class.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.900
I'm just going to start teaching you, like right about now...

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.280
I may say one more thing before I start
teaching. Yes, I am going to.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.100
It's that, um, if I'm going too fast for you-

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.250
great thing about YouTube is that you
can just rewind,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.720
watch stuff over and over again if it's confusing and
hopefully it will become less confusing.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.973
And you're even allowed to fast forward through the bits that you already know.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.700
Another tip, you can actually even use the number keys on your keyboard to move around in the video,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.920
and I promise, you can do this to me as much as you want and I'm totally not gonna mind.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.220
A great professor of mine once told me

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.629
that in order to really understand any topic you have to understand a little bit

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:36.280
of the level of complexity just below that topic.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.600
The level of complexity just below biology is chemistry.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.820
Unless you're a biochemist in which case you would argue that it's biochemistry.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.340
Either way, we're going to have to know a little bit of chemistry in order to get through biology.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.940
So that, my friends, is where we're gonna start.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.510
I am a collection of organic molecules
called Hank Green.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.450
Organic compounds are a class of compounds that contain carbon.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.580
And carbon is this sexy little minx in the periodic table (Oh lala)

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.420
that's, you know, disinterested in monogamy.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.470
Jezebel? Bit of a tramp. Hussy?

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.500
When I say carbon is small I mean that it's actually, you know, as an atom, it's a relatively small atom.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.280
It has 6 protons and 6 neutrons for a total atomic weight of 12.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.160
Because of that carbon doesn't take up a lot of space.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.580
And so carbon form itself into weird rings, and sheets, and spirals, and double, and even triple bonds.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.680
It can do all sorts of things that could never be accomplished by more bulky atoms.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.770
It's basically, you know, your atomic equivalent of an Olympic gymnast.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.220
It can only do all of those wonderful beautiful elegant things because it's kinda tiny.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.440
I also said that carbon is kind,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.360
and that's an interesting sort of thing to say about an atom.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.080
It's not like some other atoms that are desperately trying to do anything they can to fill up their electron orbitals.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.520
No, carbon knows what it's like to be alone

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.880
and so it's not all please-I'll-do-anything-for-your-electrons needy like fluorine, or chlorine, or sodium is.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.060
Elements like chlorine, if you breathe them in they like literally tear up your insides,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.740
And sodium, sodium is insane! If you like put it in water it explodes!

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.440
Carbon though, meh. It wants more electrons but it's not gonna like kill to get them.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.920
It makes and breaks bonds like a 13 year old mall rat and it doesn't even hold a grudge.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.000
Carbon is also, as I mentioned before, a bit of a tramp because it needs 4 extra electrons

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.880
and so it'll bond with pretty much whoever happens to be nearby.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.380
And also because it needs 4 electrons, it'll bond with 2, or 3, or even 4 of those things at the same time.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.720
And carbon is willing and interested to bond with lots of different molecules

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.820
like hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, nitrogen, or to other molecules of carbon.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.060
It can do this in infinite configurations

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.100
allowing it to be the core atom of complicated structures that make living things like ourselves.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.900
Because carbon is this perfect mix of small, kind, and a little bit trampy, life is entirely based on this element.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.780
Carbon is the foundation of biology.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.460
It's so fundamental that scientists have a pretty difficult time even conceiving of life that isn't based on carbon.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.140
Life is only possible on Earth because carbon is always floating around in our atmosphere

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.560
in the form of carbon dioxide.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.740
So it's important to note, when I talk about carbon bonding with other elements,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.940
I'm not actually talking about sex, it's just a useful analogy.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.660
Carbon on its own, is an atom with 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.800
Atoms have electron shells and they need to have these shells filled in order to be happy fulfilled atoms.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.720
So carbon has 6 total electrons- 2 for the first shell so it's totally happy,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.440
and 4 of the 8 it needs to fill the second shell.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.320
Carbon forms that have a bond that we call covalent

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.140
this is when atoms actually are sharing electrons with each other.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.620
So in the case of methane, which is pretty much the simplest carbon compound ever,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.800
carbon is sharing its 4 electrons in its outer electron shell with four atoms of hydrogen.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.840
Hydrogen atoms only have one electron so they want their first S orbital filled.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.880
Carbon shares its 4 electrons with
those 4 hydrogens,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.400
and those 4  hydrogens each share 1 electron with carbon so everybody's happy.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.520
In chemistry and biology this is often
represented by what we call Lewis Dot Structures.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.900
[theme music]

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.060
Good lord I'm in a chair. I'm in a chair and there's a book.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.180
Apparently I have something to tell you that's in this book,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.080
which is a book called Lewis: Acids and Bases by Hank Green.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.180
Gilbert Louis, the guy who thought up Lewis Dot Structures, was also the guy behind Lewis Acids and Bases.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.100
And he was nominated for the Nobel Prize 35 times.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.240
This is more nominations than anyone
else ever in history,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.000
and the number of times he won,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.639
was roughly the same number of times that everyone else in the world has won, which is 0.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.579
Lewis disliked this a great deal.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.520
It's kind of like a baseball player having more hits than any other player in history and no home runs.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.119
He may have been the most influential chemist of all time.

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:59.839
He coined the term photon,  he
revolutionized how we think about acids and bases,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.400
and he produced the first molecule of heavy water,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.499
and he was the first person to conceptualize the covalent bond that we're talking about right now.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.739
Gilbert lewis died alone in his laboratory while working on cyanide compounds

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.420
after having had lunch with a younger more charismatic colleague who had won the nobel prize

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.420
and who worked on the Manhattan Project.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.480
Many suspect that he killed himself, with the cyanide compounds that he was working on,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.980
but the medical examiner said heart attack without really looking into it.

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:34.379
I told you all that because, uh, the little Lewis Dot Structure that we use to represent how atoms bond to each other

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.420
is something that was created by a troubled, mad genius.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.740
It's not some abstract scientific thing that's always existed,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.560
it's a tool that was thought up by a guy and it was so useful that we've been using it ever since.

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:52.879
In biology, most compounds can be displayed in Lewis Dot Structure form, and here's how that works:

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.260
these structures basically show how atoms bond together to make up molecules

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.060
and one of the rules of thumb when making these diagrams

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.540
is that the elements that were working with here react with one another

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.220
in such a way that each atom ends up with eight electrons in its outermost shell.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.200
That is called the octet rule: because atoms want to complete their octets of electrons to be happy and satisfied.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.600
Oxygen has 6 electrons in an octet and needs 2 which is why we get H2O.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.420
It can also bond with carbon which needs 4 so you get 2 double bonds to 2 different oxygen atoms and you end up with CO2:

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.880
that pesky global warming gas, and also the stuff that makes all life on Earth possible.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.580
Nitrogen has five electrons in its outer shell. Here's how we count them:

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.419
there are 4 placeholders- each of them wants 2 atoms and like people getting on a bus,

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.210
they prefer to start out not sitting next to each other.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.080
I'm not kidding about this they really don't double up until they have to.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.100
So for maximum happiness, nitrogen bonds with 3 hydrogens, forming ammonia

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.160
or with 2 hydrogens sticking off another group of atoms which we call an amino group.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.680
And if that amino group is bonded to a carbon that is bonded to a carboxylic acid group

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.620
then you have an amino acid. You've heard of those right?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:06.080
Sometimes electrons are shared equally within a covalent bond like with O2. That's called a non-polar covalent bond.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.980
But often one of the participants is more greedy. In water, for example,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:15.160
the oxygen molecules sucks the electrons in and they spend more time with the oxygen than with the hydrogens.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.180
This creates a slight positive charge around the hydrogens and a slight negative charge around the oxygen.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:27.039
When something has a charge we say that it's polar. It has a positive and negative pole and so it's a polar covalent bond.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:31.519
Now let's talk for a moment about a completely different type of bond: which is an ionic bond.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.960
And that's when instead of sharing electrons,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:41.380
atoms just completely, wholeheartedly donate or accept an electron from another atom and then live happily as a charged atom.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.720
And there actually is no such thing as a charged atom- if an atom has a charge, its an ion.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.720
Atoms in general prefer to be neutral,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.200
But compared with having a full octet, it's not that big of a deal.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.380
Just like we often choose between being emotionally balanced and sexually satisfied,

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.860
atoms will sometimes make sacrifices for that octet.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:06.160
The most common ionic compound in our daily lives is salt. Sodium chloride, NaCl.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.180
This stuff despite its, deliciousness, as I mentioned previously,

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.080
is made up of two really nasty chemicals: sodium and chlorine.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.860
Chlorine is what we call a halogen which is an element that only needs 1 electron to fulfill its octet,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:23.280
and sodium is an alkaline metal which means that it only has 1 electron in its octet.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:32.240
So chlorine and sodium are so close to being satisfied that they will happily destroy anything in their path in order to fulfill their octet.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.540
And thus there's actually no better outcome

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.820
than just to get chlorine and sodium together and have them loving on each other.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.880
They immediately transfer their electrons so that sodium doesn't have its one extra and chlorine fills its octet.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.180
They become Na+ and Cl- and are so charged that they stick together

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.480
and we call that stickiness an ionic bond.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.600
And just like if you have to really crazy friends it might be good to get them together

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.040
so that they'll stop bothering you, same thing works with sodium and chlorine.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.720
You get those two together and they'll bother no one,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.930
and suddenly they don't want to destroy, they just want to be delicious.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.590
Chemical changes like this are a big
freaking deal

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:11.440
remember chlorine and sodium just a second ago were definitely killing you and now they're tasty.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.520
Now we are coming to the last bond that we are going to discuss in our intro to chemistry here

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.180
and that's the hydrogen bond.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.090
I imagine that you remember water, I hope that you didn't forget water.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:29.280
Since water is stuck together in a polar covalent bond, the hydrogen bit is positively charged and the oxygen bit is negatively charged.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.460
So when water molecules are moving around we generally think of them as a perfect fluid

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.960
but they actually stick together a little bit: hydrogen-side to oxygen-side.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.460
You can actually see this with your eyes if you fill up a glass of water too full

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.940
it will bubble at the top- the water will stick together at the top.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:52.380
That's the polar covalent bonds sticking the water molecules to each other so that they don't flow right over the top of the glass.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.980
These relatively weak hydrogen bonds happen in all sorts of chemical compounds

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.020
they don't just happen in water

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:04.020
and they can actually play an extremely important role in proteins which are the chemicals that pretty much make up our entire bodies.

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:08.729
A final thing to note here is that bonds, even covalent bonds, ionic bonds, even with their own class,

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:14.520
are often much different strengths and we you know tend to just write them with a little line

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.640
but that line can represent a very very strong covalent bond or a relatively weak covalent bond.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:27.920
Sometimes ionic bonds are stronger than covalent bonds though that's generally not the case and the strength of covalent bonds varies wildly.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:34.000
How these bonds are made and broken is intensely important to life and to our lives.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:43.280
Making and breaking bonds is in fact the key to life itself- and like also the key to death, for example if you were to ingest some sodium metal.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.280
Keep this in mind as we move forward through biology,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:52.120
even the sexiest person you have ever met in your life is just a collection of organic compounds

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.160
rambling around in a sack of water.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.980
Review Time! Now we have the Table of Contents which I know is supposed to come at the beginning of things

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.840
but we are revolutionary here we're doing it different.
