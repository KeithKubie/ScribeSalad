00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:07.290
My name is Federico Pistono.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.600
I am the founder
and CEO of Konoz.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.190
It's an online learning
website and platform

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.250
where you can learn
anything for free

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.420
and support your favorite
YouTube creators.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.650
We have a list of channels,
or creators from YouTube,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.760
and we extract using
the API, the channel ID.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.020
Now, every creator can
have multiple channel IDs,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.455
so they can create
courses based on playlists

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:31.370
that come from any of the
channels that are associated

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.880
with their account on Konoz.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.450
And that's just to prove that
you own the content that you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.190
have or that supposedly
you do, because if it's

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.960
a playlist coming from
your channel, then

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.260
you're stating that
that is your content.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.840
So we get the ID of
the creator on YouTube.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.260
We have the ID of the playlist.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.490
We match them together.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.900
Then from the playlist,
we make an API call

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.090
to retrieve a JSON
file that gives us

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.800
all the components,
the number of likes,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.270
comments, the video
itself, the thumbnails, so

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.740
every information that
we need to populate

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.630
the data to create the course.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.680
And now we have more
than 1,000 courses,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.680
so we are managing very
well the first users,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.110
and we are ready to
scale up to a lot more.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.910
Technically, we
use a MEAN stack,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.970
and we do asynchronous
calls for everything.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.520
We use Node.js pretty much
for everything, and Angular

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.800
on top of it, which
is also Google.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.000
And we like it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.810
So we're now testing
how well it scales.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.520
We use Agile ways
of development,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520
essentially develop new
features every other day

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.810
and push them
directly into master

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.180
as soon as they are
tested and they work.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.350
So we respond very quickly
to users' feedback.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.940
And that's very
important for us,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.770
especially in this early stage
so we can get the product up

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.830
to speed out of
this alpha phase,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.110
so we can get it
ready for prime time.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.080
At Konoz, we just
launched our private alpha

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.040
about two weeks
ago, and so far we

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.220
have 130 creators
from 25 countries.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.960
So our goal is to get to
about 2,500 creators, so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.170
25% of the top 10,000 creators
of educational content

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.250
on YouTube in about 10 languages
by the end of next year.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.700
And so we want to scale
up substantially and have

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.300
thousands of creators and
hundreds of thousands,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.110
if not millions, of users
following the courses on Konoz,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.640
so they can have a
better experience

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.380
than just by watching randomly
the videos on YouTube.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.360
We love learning.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.680
We think it's a lot of fun.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.620
So we also want to make
sure that it stays free,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.380
and that it's also fair.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.510
So we created a
crowdfunding platform

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.070
alongside with the learning
platform for creators,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.630
so they can offer
perks in exchange

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.670
for some contributions.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.070
That's our goal-- make
learning free, fair, and fun,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.400
and we are trying to do that.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.450
