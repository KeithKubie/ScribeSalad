00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:02.456
- [Instructor] What we have depicted here

00:00:02.456 --> 00:00:04.373
we could call vector w,

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:07.548
and you can see from this diagram

00:00:07.548 --> 00:00:09.967
that its initial point is right over here.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:13.956
It's the point negative
seven comma positive three,

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:18.383
and its terminal point is
this point right over here,

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:22.079
which is the point two comma negative one.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.040
What I want to do in
this video is think about

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.040
what is the magnitude of our vector?

00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:30.821
And if you're saying what
do I mean by magnitude,

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:32.321
well, one way to think about it is,

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.399
what is the length of this vector?

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.287
How long is it?

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:38.409
Pause this video, and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.265
based on the information that's given.

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:43.090
Well, one thing that
might jump out at you is

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.929
that the magnitude of this vector,

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.640
the length of this vector
is really just the distance

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.095
between these two points.

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:52.213
And so if you want the magnitude,

00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:54.371
you just have to apply essentially

00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:56.124
the distance formula here,

00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:58.980
which is essentially just
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.856
So what we could do is
construct a right triangle.

00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:06.333
I will do that like this.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:10.768
So this height in red, that
would be our change in y.

00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:12.459
That would be our change in y.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.979
And then what I am doing
in this light blue color,

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.479
this would be our change in x,

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:21.726
change in x.

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.010
And we know from the Pythagorean theorem

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.512
that the length of the hypotenuse,

00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:30.095
which would be the
magnitude of our vector,

00:01:30.095 --> 00:01:32.586
that that is going to be equal to,

00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:35.703
that's going to be equal
to the square root of

00:01:35.703 --> 00:01:38.126
our change in x squared,

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:40.043
change in x squared,

00:01:41.386 --> 00:01:43.875
plus change in y squared,

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:46.772
plus change in y squared.

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:48.616
And so, what will this be?

00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:50.727
Well, what is our change in x?

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:52.805
Our change in x,

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:53.888
our change in x,

00:01:53.888 --> 00:01:57.843
you could view it as your
x final minus x initial.

00:01:57.843 --> 00:02:01.302
So this would be two minus negative seven.

00:02:01.302 --> 00:02:04.113
So this is two minus negative seven,

00:02:04.113 --> 00:02:06.930
which is equal to positive nine.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.763
And so this would be nine squared.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:11.793
And then what is our change in y?

00:02:11.793 --> 00:02:13.126
Our change in y,

00:02:14.318 --> 00:02:18.210
you could view this as your y
final, which is negative one,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.689
minus your y initial, which is three,

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.590
minus three, which is
equal to negative four.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.365
And you did indeed go down by four,

00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:28.467
so this is going to be negative four.

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:32.140
And so our magnitude is going
to be equal to the square root

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.390
of nine squared

00:02:34.297 --> 00:02:35.130
is 81,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.250
plus negative four squared is 16.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.914
And so what is that going to be?

00:02:41.914 --> 00:02:45.893
Let's see, if you add six
to it, that's gets to 87,

00:02:45.893 --> 00:02:48.810
and you add another 10,
the square root of 97.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.926
So this is going to be equal
to the square root of 97,

00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:55.943
which I don't think can
be simplified anymore.

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:57.902
But if you wanted to
estimate what that is,

00:02:57.902 --> 00:03:00.005
that's almost the square root of 100.

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:03.921
So this number is going to
be a little bit less than 10

00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:07.380
is the magnitude of this vector.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.440
And in this case, we were able to do that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.549
from its initial points
and its ending point.

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.105
Now, another way that a
vector might be specified,

00:03:15.105 --> 00:03:18.886
they might just be given an
x-component and a y-component.

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:20.553
And so, for example,

00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:23.249
in this situation,

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.388
you could actually define our vector w

00:03:26.388 --> 00:03:28.555
by the sum of two vectors,

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:30.841
one of which is,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.847
let me do this in the blue color,

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:36.292
one of which is the x-component.

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:38.937
So you could view this
as the x-component of w,

00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:41.103
and then the other is the y-component.

00:03:41.103 --> 00:03:42.743
You could view this as,

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:47.116
you could view this as
the y-component of w.

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:48.475
And you could immediately see that

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:51.251
that y-component is the
same as our change in y,

00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:54.599
and the x-component is the
same thing as our change in x.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.194
And so sometimes you will
see something like this.

00:03:57.194 --> 00:03:58.111
The vector,

00:03:59.388 --> 00:04:00.388
the vector w

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:03.666
is equal to,

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:04.912
and it might look like coordinates,

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:07.581
but they're really giving
you the components.

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.887
So the x-component

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:11.304
is positive nine.

00:04:12.172 --> 00:04:14.800
The x-component is positive nine,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.861
and then the y-component is negative four.

00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:21.215
It is negative four.

00:04:21.215 --> 00:04:23.540
Now, you might say, hey, well,
with something like this,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.229
all I know is the x- and y-component,

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.771
I don't know where it
exactly starts and ends.

00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:30.767
And that's actually on
purpose because, a vector,

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:34.524
you only care about the
magnitude and the direction,

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.496
and this is actually specifying both.

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.196
If you wanted the magnitude here,

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:39.681
you'd just take the square root

00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:42.554
of the sum of the squares
of the magnitudes.

00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:44.794
So once again, the square
root of nine squared

00:04:44.794 --> 00:04:46.218
plus negative four squared

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:49.749
is going to be the square root of 97.

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:51.852
So you want the magnitude
and the direction,

00:04:51.852 --> 00:04:53.245
which this will specify,

00:04:53.245 --> 00:04:56.094
but you can shift it
around all that you want.

00:04:56.094 --> 00:04:58.958
This vector w, you could
also have it starting,

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.131
you could also have it
starting right over here

00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:04.307
and going nine in the positive x-direction

00:05:04.307 --> 00:05:07.965
and then negative four in
the positive y-direction

00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:10.693
and, or negative four down.

00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:12.841
And so it might look something like this.

00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:14.635
And so once again, you
can shift vectors around.

00:05:14.635 --> 00:05:16.531
You care about magnitude and direction,

00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:18.307
but hopefully this gives
you sense of how to

00:05:18.307 --> 00:05:20.018
find magnitude given the components

00:05:20.018 --> 00:05:22.591
or given the starting and ending points.
