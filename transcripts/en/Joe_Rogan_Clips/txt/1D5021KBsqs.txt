Speaker 1:          00:00          It is not what they'll cover that was on the show. They're not going to cover this, the meat. Okay. Cause this is not my opinion. This is the real research that I have heard that up that I have talked to army generals, commanding generals, major generals, general generals, CIA, everybody. And they're all 100%. Uh, and I thought it was a sigh out before and that I've researched it. I've talked to hundreds of people now, not on there, but I'm gonna make a film on this who've taken Iowasca and DMT. I've not taken it. And B for obvious reasons. And uh, and it's unbelievable because I mean, they 100% in San Francisco is the main project site literally have an alien base and they are literally communicating and they've got like astronaut level people taking super hardcore levels of drugs and going into meetings with these things and making intergalactic deals.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And that, and again, that's what the government believes and says they're doing who this isn't that when you say the government, that's a broad stroke. You're painting, you're using a broad brush. Like, what do you mean by the breakaway? Rogue intelligence agencies. So we you're saying is essentially that the using psychedelic drugs to communicate with interdimensional beings. Alright, that's spirit guides. Okay. Everyone, everyone who's done a high dose of psychedelic drugs has had this experience. So everyone is listening to you right now who's done DMT or done five grams of siliciden. They know that this is a, you have some kind of communication with something else. The question is, is that something else inside your psyche or is that something else? A chemical Herto crochet. Is there a chemical doorway inside the mind that opens up in the belief is that when you die, and this is what the afterlife is, that when you die, your brain redeemed, produces these chemicals, these chemicals open up this doorway and this is the portal to the next dimension. So you're saying, you're saying that the government is aware of this and they must be aware of this. They've heard enough people talk about it. They must have done experiments on it. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:07          to the universe for sure. And people that have the courage to experiment with these things. And try them themselves realize that this is such a profound experience that it is. It's so alien that if an alien landed right now in our parking lot and a little gray man with big black guys got out, it would be nothing compared to what I've seen on psychedelic trips. Well, let me just tell you that me getting under this Joe is just because she'll, people need to understand that. I don't know about this for a long time and I just don't think people are ready for it, but a lot of folks who have low oxygen and how who and I hope brains well, well who have sleep apnea, have the big next big hedge tongues go back like you and me. You go down to 62% oxygen. That's another time that the brain releases DMT show.

Speaker 1:          02:59          My whole life since I was about my first memories were every night was a DMT trip show. I basically, I don't want this to sound arrogant. It's not. I've seen everything. Well, I believe that when you are dreaming it's most likely the same chemicals that are being released as well. The key point when you go into the room sleep, it opens the gate. Which side is it proven? Your brain is working in the fourth, fifth, sixth dimension. And if you can work into those images, you can see beyond it. So just what I'm trying to tell you is this, I know you already know all this show for your audience. Here's what's happening.

Speaker 1:          03:37          I'm not saying you're bad. I never said you were in the CIA. I say the CIA is on record with Timothy leary and everybody promoting hallucinogens in the 60s. They admitted that it was a plan to try to, uh, she would do in the public to make them more suggestible, but there's a larger program and then they kind of backed off because he kind of got out of control and actually created some, some people that were actually fighting him. So, so he didn't have the effect they want it. So then they moved on the Iowasca and the DMT that they promoted, which good strong people that have got compass go and have problems with, but weak minded, stupid people and others. Here's an example. This guy is smart. Uh, Eric, uh, cal Mueller, syndicated radio host. I've known him like 15 years. You just lost me.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Well, I'm going to tell you the story you said. He's smart. He's a nice guy. I'm just kidding. He's a smart guy. Don't be man. I've been on his show before. I'm like, like she likes it. I like him to, I'm just asking around. He will everybody say everybody is on this quest. And I told you, I've talked to like a hundred people. I've talked to more. There's a lot of people are going and doing these, the DMT and Iowaska trips outside Austin, they're doing them all over the place. Yes. And I'm on a show and he's told me the same story everybody tells you about being in Peru or being, you know, Costa Rica. You went to two trips down there and he shed. Yeah. Um, we're sitting there and we take the Iowasca and then all these basically elves, aliens come out of the woods and we're all seeing the same aliens. We're all hearing the same thing and it's like 43 of us or whatever, seeing. And he goes, but it was the drugs effect on our brains. No, no, no. A drug. Everyone sees something different. When you open a gate and now interdimensionally your brain's already filtering out most stuff because you can't handle it. Your eyes are already seeing, I'm like a cat when it's like seeing something in or a dog will, you know when they.
