SHANNON DEEGAN: So first,
thanks for coming, everyone.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.740
Thanks to Jamie.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.800
We'll do a little intro,
Jamie, in a sec here.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.232
Also, thanks for anybody
watching on the live stream.

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:14.440
And we even have some people
in the Pittsburgh office

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.023
who've joined.

00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:16.210
So we'll--

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.635
[BOOING]

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:18.260
There they are.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.730
JAMIE BAKER: We're
not happy with you.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.354
We know you're good people, but
we're not happy with you today.

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:22.880
Trust me.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.046
SHANNON DEEGAN: So a little
gloating going on there,

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:26.800
but that's earned, well earned.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.224
So I want to thank
everyone again.

00:00:28.224 --> 00:00:29.640
Thanks, Jamie, for
taking time out

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.200
of, obviously, a busy schedule
at the busy time of year.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.050
You saw the video.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.730
The most famous goal
in Shark history,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.320
Jamie scored, which was
to knock out Detroit

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.210
in a big game a few years ago.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.650
Jamie played 10 years, NHL.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.500
Played for the Toronto Maple
Leafs, Ottawa Senators,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.340
Quebec Nordiques-- they
started his career-- and then,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.610
obviously, with the
Sharks a couple of times--

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.080
so a great career.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.520
Started at the University--
I almost said my school-- St.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.612
Lawrence University.

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:02.070
And that's where
I first met Jamie.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.380
We were--

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.490
JAMIE BAKER: He's getting
nervous right now.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.530
There's a reason why.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.321
SHANNON DEEGAN: There's
a reason why, yeah.

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.227
So Jamie and I met
playing against each other

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:08.810
in university.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.560
So I played at Vermont,
Jamie played at St. Lawrence.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.760
I think the worst defeat
my team ever suffered,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.054
my senior year, my last game,
we lost 9 to 1 in the playoffs.

00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:21.417
So that's my memory of
playing St. Lawrence.

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:22.500
I think I scored the goal.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.310
JAMIE BAKER: It didn't
go very well for you.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.110
SHANNON DEEGAN: It
didn't go very well.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.120
JAMIE BAKER: It's good.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.149
I have eternal bragging
rights against you

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.190
from a hockey standpoint.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.510
SHANNON DEEGAN: He does.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.710
He does.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.100
But you know--

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.030
JAMIE BAKER: But
you're doing OK now.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.760
SHANNON DEEGAN: You're OK.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.870
But when you're a
parent-- I think

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.453
one of the things
when you're a parent

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:37.140
is you want your children not to
make the same mistakes you did.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.890
And so I'm delighted
that Jamie's daughter

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.650
is a player who's going
into her senior year

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.720
at the University of Vermont.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.803
So she plays hockey there.

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:46.632
So she made the right call,
anyway, where to go to school.

00:01:46.632 --> 00:01:48.840
So Jamie had a terrific
career-- as I said, 10 years,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.535
played in 25 playoff games.

00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:52.160
So what we want to
do here is we really

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.420
want to get it into
just a kind of Q&amp;A

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.410
around-- I want to talk
first about the season,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.910
because it's been
an amazing season,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.070
I think, for the Sharks.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.910
And then we'll get into
this series in particular.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.900
But let's try and do it
as much as a dialogue,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.490
open it up for questions.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.734
I've got a few, if we
need to, to kick it off.

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:11.150
But I think I
really want everyone

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.590
to have an opportunity to talk
to Jamie about what he's seeing

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.780
and what's going on so far.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.280
So, I think, Jamie, the first
thing I'd love to understand

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.800
is, two years ago-- I think
it was two years ago, right

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.960
around now-- devastating
loss for the Sharks,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.210
going up three games
to nothing on the Kings

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.410
and then losing in seven.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.630
And then they, last year,
didn't make the playoffs.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.050
So you go down to, an
absolute bottom is last year.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.740
You've got the top
player having disputes

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.360
with the general manager.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.940
So it's just not going well.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.210
And then a year later, they have
the best results they've ever.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.925
So what do you think
took them-- what

00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:50.300
happened to go from the bottom
to get where they are now?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.420
JAMIE BAKER: Well,
first of all, if you

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.400
go back to when the Sharks
missed the playoffs,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.630
if you told me then
that they'd be here now,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.990
I'd be like, that's awesome.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.237
I can't wait to see this
unfold in front of my eyes,

00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:01.820
and I'm going to
have front-row seats.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.910
Because I would not have
predicted it whatsoever.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.510
I thought potentially, maybe,
Thornton-- one of them,

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.940
Thornton or Marleau-- might
get traded or something,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.440
and that there was a little
bit of a rebuild in place

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.720
as they're trying to
bring in new blood.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.710
Instead, after the-- not this
past season, the season before,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.110
it was a toxic environment
around the locker room.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.010
And there was some
friction between the head

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.850
coach and the general manager.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.485
But just the whole atmosphere,
you just knew it wasn't right.

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:29.240
And we didn't talk
about it on the air,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.000
because you don't
know how it's going

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.800
to-- they could fix things in
the second half of the year.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.564
But when everything
was said and done,

00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:37.980
they were not-- they didn't
have that chemistry as a team.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.580
There was no trust
throughout, at all the layers.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.777
And you can't succeed.

00:03:41.777 --> 00:03:43.360
There was bickering
behind the scenes.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.830
It goes within any organization.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.910
Pro sports is different.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.450
There's turnover and whatnot.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.230
There's the media
profile and all that.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.956
Everything is
played out publicly.

00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:57.330
You guys are in different
teams here within your company.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.360
Well everything,
you're not going

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.550
to read about it tomorrow.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.810
Maybe there's an internal
blog, might be something.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.200
But that's it, maximum, and
you can ultimately try and get

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.190
over the grievances.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.540
So what happened between then
and now-- well, one, people,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.740
like key people, general
manager, the key players,

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.302
the top players,
some of the leaders

00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:18.760
they checked their
ego at the door.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.800
They put their pride aside,
and they put the logo first.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.237
And at the end of the day,
you can learn from the past,

00:04:26.237 --> 00:04:27.570
but you can't dwell on the past.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.140
If you dwell on the
past, you're never

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.514
going to be able
to move forward.

00:04:30.514 --> 00:04:33.330
And I don't care what
vocation you're in.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.300
That's what they did.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.390
They put the stuff behind them.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.824
They say, forgive and forget.

00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:41.240
Just forget about it and move
on, because there were still

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.820
some really good pieces here.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.320
And then Doug Wilson,
who was under fire,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.640
he was the architect of this.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.340
And they hadn't succeeded.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.390
He was getting
called out publicly.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.000
He went out and
got Martin Jones,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.330
who's been absolutely
phenomenal, the goaltender,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.010
now, of the future,
a great trade.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.000
He's the one that
hired Peter DeBoer.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.870
And he went out
and got-- and I'm

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.630
going to talk about some other
guys, but he and his staff

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.800
got-- you on as
Joonas Donskoi, who

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.860
has been-- here's a guy
that's a top 6 forward

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.405
that they didn't draft.

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:14.280
They're tough to get.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.310
You look at Panarin in Chicago,
how he came over from Russia.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.790
And you're like,
Chicago picked up.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.490
Well, I think we got one of the
best free agent acquisitions

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.270
last year from someone coming
over from Europe in Donskoi.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.250
Great kid.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.350
True pro.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.550
Sticks his nose in there.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.250
Just loves to battle.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.010
Great hands.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.280
Great upside all across.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.200
So those three were
like home runs.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.540
And then, Pete DeBoer coming,
he was also instrumental.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.420
So Doug Wilson
makes the final call

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.690
on bringing in Joel
Ward and Paul Martin,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.790
but Peter DeBoer also
communicated with them.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.100
So he was instrumental
in those acquisitions.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.540
Great acquisitions all aboard.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.310
And then, the ones they
made at the trade deadline,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.180
you've got a coach who--
all the pieces were

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.632
in place from the fundamentals.

00:05:56.632 --> 00:05:59.090
The previous coaching regime
that was here did a great job,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.310
so the foundation and
structure was there.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.150
So it's like a new leader coming
in, a new VP of marketing,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.070
or sales, or biz dev coming in.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.830
And you've got the
structure of all your group.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.710
The cohesion's there.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.467
All the back-end
stuff's in place.

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:14.550
And now you've just got
to tweak a few things here

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.280
to go and, not necessarily
knock it out of the park,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.030
but go above and beyond.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.350
So that was there.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.660
And everybody came
in this past year.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.320
Everybody came in
with a new attitude.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.151
I call it-- it was a fresh
coat of paint, literally,

00:06:27.151 --> 00:06:29.400
a fresh coat of paint, because
they redid the practice

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.990
facility and the Sharks'
dressing room at SAP center

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.240
with new paint and everything.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.440
And so new attitude, dress rooms
were new, new coaching staff.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.710
You've got that goaltender, that
key piece that you can rely on.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.280
And then as the
season went on, you

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.830
could just see it
start to unfold.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.800
And resiliency and perseverance
have been their trademarks.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.340
And they are now
getting tested more

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.400
than they've been all year from
a resiliency and perseverance.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.350
And that might not
even be enough.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.760
Pittsburgh might be too good.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.800
We're going to find out.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.280
But Pittsburgh hasn't been
to the east coast-- or west

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.160
coast-- in a while.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.576
And they haven't played at the
Shark Tank in the playoffs.

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:10.890
And we'll see what happens on
Saturday, when the Sharks get

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.680
to play in front of
their home crowd,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.560
and see if they can try and take
everybody in Pittsburgh right

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.415
now, and they should be.

00:07:17.415 --> 00:07:20.040
And you're thinking four or five
games out, you, in Pittsburgh.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.910
I know you are.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.390
You're all nodding and agreeing.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.070
But you don't know what it's
like to play in the Shark Tank.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.050
I was listening to
Aaron Ward this morning.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.560
This guy's won
three Stanley Cups.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.100
This was on the NHL
Sirius XM channel.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.920
And he said, I don't think this
thing's over, because, he goes,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.430
I didn't get nervous or
intimidated in many buildings,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.780
but the Shark Tank
was one that I did.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.320
It was a distinct
home ice advantage.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.980
The crowd is so
loud, just the way

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.610
it just bounces off the roof
and comes down, because it's

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.990
the steep building.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.290
The seats don't go out.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.330
So we'll see how
things play out.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.610
If Sharks win on Saturday, we
got ourselves a series here.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.830
Because we already know,
as good as Murray's played

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.140
for Pittsburgh in nets, he
hasn't been tested much.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.875
We know how good
Martin Jones is.

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:07.560
SHANNON DEEGAN:
Yeah, that's great.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.665
One of the things
that surprised me-- I

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:11.623
guess I haven't seen
Pittsburgh play that much,

00:08:11.623 --> 00:08:13.498
and you hear about it--
but it was the speed.

00:08:13.498 --> 00:08:15.039
We like to think
the Sharks, I think,

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:16.890
certainly in the first
couple of series,

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.270
the first three rounds
there with the Sharks,

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.850
their speed was
the talk, how they

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.656
were dumping in and beating
the players to the-- beating

00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:23.820
the other team to the puck.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.380
And clearly, it's
flipped the other way.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.150
Pittsburgh just looks like
they're at a whole other speed

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:27.880
level.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.490
And how do the Sharks
adjust to that?

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.419
And what's been your
reaction to that watching it?

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:34.500
JAMIE BAKER: Disruptive.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.669
It's a good, popular word in the
technology world, disruptive.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.415
Speed, first to market,
all of that stuff,

00:08:41.415 --> 00:08:42.289
that's what they are.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.507
Their speed is
disrupting everything

00:08:46.507 --> 00:08:48.090
that San Jose is
trying to accomplish.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.350
Things that they
could do, now, they're

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.290
not being able to do it.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.830
And I knew their speed was good.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.020
What I didn't know
was their details,

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.575
like their stick position.

00:08:58.575 --> 00:09:00.200
They're winning more
battles right now.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.660
They've won more 50/50 battles.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.960
That's really surprised me.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.080
That was one area I thought
we would have the advantage.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.220
We out-battled LA.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.070
We out-battled St. Louis.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.240
That's as hard as it gets.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.380
So I'm like, well, we might
give them a little bit

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.796
here on the speed,
but we're going

00:09:15.796 --> 00:09:19.750
to get more if we can push
the game to the perimeter

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.550
outside the dots.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.510
And we can get some
more board battles.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.760
But that hasn't been the case.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.490
But sometimes, you
watch-- I'll give you

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.780
just some examples of what I've
been watching, what I look for.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.260
There's two things--
well, three kinds

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.509
of concepts how I watch,
and teach, and talk

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:36.550
about the game of hockey.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.260
One is time and space.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.760
Now, it's a cliche in
sports, but it's real.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.110
Football's the classic
example of time and space.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.750
Like, the line of scrimmage--
the quarterback comes back.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.150
And if he hands it off to
a running back, lineman,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.160
their job is to create space.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.727
That's it.

00:09:51.727 --> 00:09:52.560
That's what they do.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.550
They provide space
for the running

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.070
back to go, and get out,
and get some opening.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.910
And then he's got
to find more space.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.770
That's what they do.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.940
If it's a passing
play, the linemen

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.860
have to block to create
time for the receivers

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.500
to go out and find an open
space and for the quarterback

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.390
to have enough time
to be in good position

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.840
and to make the pass.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.870
Time and space-- very simple.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.160
It's there in basketball.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.430
It's soccer, all the
team sports, you know?

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.300
The other two things I
watch for are outnumbering

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.400
and controlling the lanes.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.930
So controlling the lanes--
if our net was back here,

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.830
I'd be between you and that net.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.570
So you want to control the lanes
with your body or your stick

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.640
position.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.191
So you're always trying to
establish an reestablish body

00:10:36.191 --> 00:10:36.690
position.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.010
If I'm in the offensive zone,
I want the guy from their team

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.120
to be behind me so I've got
an open lane to their net--

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.630
so controlling the lanes
using your body or your stick.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.370
The other one is outnumbering.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.310
If we got one guy in the
corner and they have two,

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.709
advantage them.

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:54.500
So if you watch-- if
you just were watching

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.830
the game at home on your DVR and
you pause it, you can just see.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.007
And you're like, well, yeah,
Pittsburgh's got three guys.

00:11:01.007 --> 00:11:01.840
The sharks have two.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.370
That's why they're
winning battles.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.620
And that's what they're doing.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.090
So they're controlling
the lanes and outnumbering

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.560
using their team speed
all over the ice.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.130
And it is absolutely
frustrating the Sharks,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.010
not allowing them to execute.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.255
So they're going into
some battle situations.

00:11:16.255 --> 00:11:17.880
They're not going in
to win the battle.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.400
Their first guy's going
in using a stick position

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.020
to influence the Sharks
one way or the other,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.604
push him up the boards or
take away a D-to-D pass.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.270
But they're getting
in on the first guy.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.370
They're not necessarily
trying to win the battle,

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.317
they just don't want the
Sharks to win the battle.

00:11:34.317 --> 00:11:36.150
They go in and, like,
don't lose the battle.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.949
And then, because
they're so fast

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:40.490
and they're so disciplined--
and they've been doing this now.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.706
They've been playing this
way for so long here,

00:11:42.706 --> 00:11:44.080
you know, the last
month and half

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.670
of the season in the playoffs--
that the next guy's there.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.250
And then he's
winning the battle.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.117
So the Sharks have
some things to--

00:11:50.117 --> 00:11:51.700
and that's what the
Sharks were doing.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.640
Sharks were doing it.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.539
They did it to LA.

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:54.580
They did it to Nashville.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.100
They did it to St. Louis.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.780
And now it's happening to them.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.720
SHANNON DEEGAN: So
how do you control it

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.495
if you're the Sharks?

00:11:59.495 --> 00:12:00.580
How to you get on top of that?

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.460
JAMIE BAKER: Geez, it's
not going to be easy.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.960
So you've got to
simplify your game.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.585
You're not going to
be able to execute.

00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:10.510
And I don't know, I couldn't
make a comparison in business.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.390
Sometimes you go
into one scenario,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.710
and then there's another.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.890
And whatever worked here isn't
necessarily going to work,

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.150
and you have to be creative.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.680
In this case, they
need to simplify.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.720
I think they have
to just get away,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.564
a little bit, from trying to
execute these breakout passes.

00:12:25.564 --> 00:12:27.230
I think they need to
just start chipping

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.604
the puck out in
the neutral zone,

00:12:28.604 --> 00:12:32.260
and creating races there, and
then getting the puck deep.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.700
Because there have been
too many turnovers.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.950
And when there's a turnover,
Pittsburgh's feasting on it.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.300
So I think they have
to simplify the game,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.370
slow the game down a little bit.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.670
And then if they spend less
time in the defensive zone--

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.160
you've got to slow the speed of
Pittsburgh in the neutral zone.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.540
And if they get their
forecheck going--

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.310
simplify their game
in the defense,

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.660
neutral zone, get
the puck deep, go

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.160
to work on the forecheck--
that's their bread and butter.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.910
They're going to get
outnumbered down low.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.680
If you watch-- again, if
you're at the game, watch.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.760
Because Pittsburgh's
forwards are so fast,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.070
they collapse even
lower in the defensive.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.890
They're going to have all
five guys down below the dots

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:10.750
guaranteed.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.590
So what do you have to do?

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.330
Kick it back to the
defensemen, keep

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.530
getting shots on net, things
like that, like real simple.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.257
And then try and frustrate
Pittsburgh from that regard,

00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:21.840
and hopefully draw
some penalties too.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.770
They've only had three
powerplays so far this series.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.330
SHANNON DEEGAN:
Yeah, and that's been

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.913
one of the impressive things, I
think, about Pittsburgh is-- I

00:13:26.913 --> 00:13:29.330
think Malkin and Letang, in
particular, have a reputation

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.860
for getting under their skin.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.850
And you saw Thornton
take a shot at Malkin,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.590
and you saw them go after Letang
a bit and try to goad them.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.527
Once you get these
guys-- get their tempers,

00:13:38.527 --> 00:13:39.610
and it's just not working.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.290
JAMIE BAKER: That's
like you trying

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.950
to get me-- goad me,
from a hockey standpoint,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.940
knowing that I beat you
every time we've ever

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.860
played against each other.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.280
SHANNON DEEGAN: Not
every time, right?

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.230
JAMIE BAKER: Well, you won once.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.890
SHANNON DEEGAN:
Yeah, fair enough.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.540
JAMIE BAKER: But
how can you-- like,

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.240
you can't frustrate
me when it comes

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.990
to our head-to-head
match-ups, right?

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.860
SHANNON DEEGAN:
That's fair enough.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.234
JAMIE BAKER: Like, I'll never
play him in a senior league

00:13:58.234 --> 00:14:01.670
game, because my record stands
for itself moving forward.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.350
I have bragging rights.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:06.176
I felt so bad for you, my
daughter goes to your school.

00:14:06.176 --> 00:14:08.170
SHANNON DEEGAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.340
JAMIE BAKER: Malkin and
Letang aren't frustrated,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.900
they're in control
of the series.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.590
So they need-- that's where
the Sharks-- but that's

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.220
what you want to see.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.160
You want to see them going
up banging their stick,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.390
because they're not
having their way.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.210
But they have for five
of the six periods.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.030
SHANNON DEEGAN: Yeah, on
that, my old coach was saying,

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.850
you should look up Jamie
when you're out in San Jose.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.300
When I moved out here, I
said, I won't, specifically

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.060
for that reason.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.070
But I ended up doing it anyway.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.210
JAMIE BAKER: Then my
daughter went there, are

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.010
we became friends.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.832
And here we are.

00:14:29.832 --> 00:14:31.290
SHANNON DEEGAN:
What have you liked

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.630
what you've seen from the
Sharks in this series so far?

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.650
JAMIE BAKER: Goaltending.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:34.000
SHANNON DEEGAN: That's it?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.420
Next

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:34.640
JAMIE BAKER: Question.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.720
SHANNON DEEGAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.220
Exactly.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.830
JAMIE BAKER: That's it,
honestly, yeah, goaltending.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.400
And actually, well,
the goaltending

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.983
is the reason they've
stayed in there.

00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:46.280
Like, I had someone
text me this morning.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.350
They say, is Pittsburgh
really that fast?

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:54.880
And if we got a
couple of breaks,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.650
could we be up 2-0
in this series?

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.410
I'm like, yeah,
you're right on both.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.180
Pittsburgh's dominated the
series, first and foremost,

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.840
with their speed, and
their compete level,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.230
and their ability to win
battles, and do all the things

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.440
that I've already discussed.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.040
But yet the Sharks have hung on.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.020
If you were out of the
country and you just

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.430
saw the scores, if you just
looked at the score sheet,

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.000
you're like, well, this series,
this is as close as it gets.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.090
Because it was a
broken-- a couple

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.910
of mistakes by the
Sharks in game 1.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.129
And Pittsburgh scored with
two and 1/2 minutes left.

00:15:26.129 --> 00:15:27.670
And last night, they
won in overtime.

00:15:30.072 --> 00:15:31.780
I don't know if it's
a glass is half full

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.738
or glass is half empty.

00:15:32.738 --> 00:15:34.880
That's the beautiful
thing about sports.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.960
We're going to
find out Saturday.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.840
Shannon was saying,
well, maybe, is it good

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.006
that they've been outplayed?

00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:41.910
You asked me that when
I was driving over.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.884
I said, is it good that
they've been outplayed,

00:15:43.884 --> 00:15:45.050
but yet the games are close?

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.720
I'm like, yeah, it is good.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.830
But at the same time, Crosby
and Malkin haven't scored yet.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.130
So is it good or not good?

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.130
We're going to find out.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.890
I just know-- I think it's
the two days between games,

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.200
which I didn't like at first
when the series came out.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.660
I think, for all the
travel that these teams

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.332
are doing-- there's
two days between games

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.540
whenever they have to go
from one coast to the other.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.780
It makes sense, but
all the other series

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.619
is every other day.

00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:14.410
To me, this is an
advantage for Pittsburgh,

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.285
who doesn't-- they're
not used to the travel.

00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:17.890
The Sharks are used to it.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.510
So I didn't like the schedule.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.060
I thought it favored
Pittsburgh, because they

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.000
haven't been out of
the Eastern time zone

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.925
since, like, mid-January.

00:16:27.925 --> 00:16:30.210
That's our life, you know,
like Nashville, St. Louis.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.510
So we're used to it.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.020
We're used to the long flights.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.440
It's part of the
routine for the guys.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.170
But now, the way the
series has played out,

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.619
I think the Sharks are
fortunate they have two days.

00:16:42.619 --> 00:16:44.160
They were frustrated
during the game.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.610
They were frustrated in
their post-game comments.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.690
And I think they're a
little shell-shocked.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.360
And I think today's
a travel day.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.880
And tomorrow, they can go and
meet, and watch some video,

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.151
and have a closed-door practice.

00:16:55.151 --> 00:16:57.150
And then they can start
to ramp up for Saturday.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:01.050
So I think the two days prior
to that game 7 against Nashville

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.840
helped San Jose, and I think
it's going to help them here,

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.394
in this case.

00:17:04.394 --> 00:17:05.310
SHANNON DEEGAN: Great.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.560
Let's look for some questions.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.200
Anybody got any
questions for Jamie?

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.250
AUDIENCE: My question is about
the Pittsburgh-- San Jose

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.970
and how they got here.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.550
I've got a theory, and I just
want to get your idea about it.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.883
And it kind of ties in with
the whole fact the, usually,

00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:22.150
present trophy winners have
this curse of not advancing.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.589
I've got a theory that,
for any championship team,

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.810
especially in hockey, to
make it to the finals,

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.974
there has to be an extended
period of strife or conflict

00:17:31.974 --> 00:17:32.890
in the regular season.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.780
Because that's when the
team learns who they are,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.170
and what works,
and what doesn't.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.350
With Washington, I think, as
soon as they got to Pittsburgh,

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.530
they hadn't really ever
been into a situation

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.190
where things weren't
working for them.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.460
And it's kind of telling that
Pittsburgh and San Jose were

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.412
making it to the final when
they were really mediocre teams

00:17:49.412 --> 00:17:50.620
the first half of the season.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.460
So is that a theory
that you think

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.760
has to happen for a
championship to occur, or no?

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.230
JAMIE BAKER: It's
a good question.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:04.260
And I've asked coaches, over
the years, that question.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.390
And they'll tell you, well, we
don't go out seeking adversity,

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.530
or strife, if you will.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.390
We don't seek it out.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.470
But when it's there,
you have to turn it

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.110
into a positive
in the long term.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.240
When you're going through
it, it's not good.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.280
And this is-- it's in
your personal lives,

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.590
it's at work, whatever.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.440
There's conflicts.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.650
Perseverance--
perseverance is what?

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.210
It's overcoming adversity,
and it takes time.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.340
It's like going through
different experiences.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.630
And that's what resiliency is.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.460
So I agree.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.335
I think it's beneficial
to go through those

00:18:38.335 --> 00:18:39.585
during the course of the year.

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:41.580
Part of the thing is, you
have to have the horses.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.835
Like, you've got
to have the horses.

00:18:42.835 --> 00:18:44.126
You've got to have the players.

00:18:44.126 --> 00:18:46.419
Both these teams
have the talent.

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:47.460
They've got the coaching.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.270
They've got all of that.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.320
I mean, Pittsburgh went
through a coaching change.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.986
That's not easy to
do, but it turned out

00:18:51.986 --> 00:18:54.930
to be a terrific
move on their part.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:59.010
So my belief is-- and I
don't think it's a theory,

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.679
but my belief is I
think it's good to go

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:02.970
through that type of adversity.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.500
I listen to Barry
Trotz, the head

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.180
coach of Washington, his
post-series media press

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.310
conference, you know?

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.660
And he's like, Pittsburgh was
the best team coming down.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.259
We finished with
the most points,

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:19.550
but the last month and a half
of the season, Pittsburgh

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.100
was the best team in the NHL.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.270
And they carried it through.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.090
And they're a better
team, right now, than us.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:31.440
So when you look at the entire
season-- because in sports,

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.910
it is different.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.750
There can be trades or different
things, or teams have injuries.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.040
There's more personnel
changes in such a short time

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.360
than, necessarily, you see
in everyday work situations

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.867
that you can't necessarily--
like the Sharks power

00:19:47.867 --> 00:19:49.200
play-- well, you can look at it.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.783
Or their home record,
the Sharks' home

00:19:50.783 --> 00:19:53.770
record over the course of
the season wasn't great.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:58.110
Well, now we're not talking
about the regular season home

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.850
record.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.505
We're talking about how
they've been in the playoffs.

00:20:00.505 --> 00:20:01.700
SHANNON DEEGAN:
That's 7-1, right?

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.080
JAMIE BAKER: There was a
reason why they weren't

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.432
as good in the regular season.

00:20:04.432 --> 00:20:05.890
One, at the start
of the year, they

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.904
were all still learning
Pete DeBoer's new systems.

00:20:08.904 --> 00:20:10.320
They weren't all
on the same page.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.820
They had some key injuries
with Logan Couture.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.670
Paul Martin was out.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.230
Vlasic, Braun, they were
all out for a few games.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.550
The other thing is, the
way the schedule is,

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.540
the sharks travel so much
that-- you look at their record,

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.630
I think they were 07 or 08 and
1 whenever they've had a road

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.485
trip two games or more.

00:20:26.485 --> 00:20:27.860
So they were so
good on the road,

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.490
but they almost maxed out on
their road trips, especially

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.160
the four- and
five-game road trips.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.830
They'd play so good in
games 4 and 5, but then--

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.300
and I've talked to Doug Wilson
about this a little bit.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.960
And when they came
back-- so let's

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.210
say they finished their road
trip somewhere like, say,

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.610
Chicago on a Tuesday.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.260
Their next home
game was Thursday.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.550
So you fly home.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.670
I'm with them.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.560
You roll into your house
2:00, 3:00 in the morning,

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.590
but that's 5 o'clock
central time.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.220
So you've been
traveling all night.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.170
And you've got, the
next day's a day off.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.270
And then you're right
back, and you have a game.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.160
Those are the games
they were losing.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.990
So when you look at
the President's Trophy,

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:10.120
you're looking at a
6-month time frame

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.970
where Washington
had the most points.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:16.830
But if you look at the best team
coming in-- the best two teams

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.130
heading into the playoffs
coming down the stretch--

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.380
it was the Pittsburgh
Penguins and San Jose Sharks.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.490
So sometimes, I think, that's
where it's not necessarily

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:24.990
a theory.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.930
You've got to also study trends.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.610
And that's the trend
right now, is the Sharks

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.860
have been really good at home.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.480
And I said that at
the-- people said, well,

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.440
we want to start on the road.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.860
I'm like, meh, I don't
want to start on the road.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.943
You're like, you're crazy.

00:21:35.943 --> 00:21:37.150
I'm like, no, I'm not.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.010
The regular season
doesn't matter anymore.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.820
It's the playoffs.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.080
I want last change.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.100
And if there's a game
7, I want it here.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.310
And even in this
series, I'm like,

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.710
I wanted-- people ask
me, who do you want,

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.570
when it was game 7,
Pittsburgh-Tampa.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.110
I said, I want Tampa.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.090
It had nothing to do--
if they beat Pittsburgh,

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.850
they're going to be
a great match-up.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.933
You could say, well, we
match up better than them.

00:21:57.933 --> 00:21:58.644
Do we?

00:21:58.644 --> 00:21:59.810
They knocked off Pittsburgh.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.940
And now we're finding out
how good Pittsburgh is.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.400
So I don't know if they
would've been a better match-up.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.130
I just know we'd have home ice.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.660
And if the series
went seven games,

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.620
I want them traveling across
the country, three time zones,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.130
three times, not us.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.060
That was it.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.186
So it's all about
trends, especially

00:22:14.186 --> 00:22:15.310
at this time of the season.

00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:19.340
SHANNON DEEGAN: Megan.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.300
JAMIE BAKER: Row three asking
a lot of questions today.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.684
How come it's always row
three asking questions?

00:22:26.684 --> 00:22:27.350
I have a theory.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.770
AUDIENCE: This
kind of piggybacks

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.520
on what you were
just saying, talking

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.610
about how they did so well
on the road this season,

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.300
set a record with that.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.740
In your opinion and
your experience,

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.260
how important is
home ice advantage

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.860
during the regular season, and
then, opposed to the playoff?

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.294
JAMIE BAKER: More
so in the playoffs.

00:22:50.294 --> 00:22:51.710
In the regular
season, it's there.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.724
But every game is-- it's
typically-- sometimes,

00:22:54.724 --> 00:22:56.640
there's back-to-back
games with the same team.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.910
But for the most part, every
game, you're facing a new team.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.110
So you study the other
team a little bit,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.240
but you're more focused
on your own play.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:12.960
And there's no sugarcoating
it, these guys-- 82 games

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.780
is a long season.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.940
It is a marathon.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.744
And just from how
excited you get-- like,

00:23:19.744 --> 00:23:21.410
they want to go to
the rink, but there's

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.451
times they're just tired.

00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:23.140
I see it.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.659
I'm tired, and I'm just
broadcasting the games.

00:23:25.659 --> 00:23:27.450
So you can only imagine
how these guys are.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.300
So the adrenaline isn't
going some nights.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.630
Like, it's hard to get
up for some opponents,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.750
especially like
if-- a New Jersey--

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.270
SHANNON DEEGAN: Columbus on
a Tuesday night in January.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:36.950
JAMIE BAKER: Yeah.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.340
And it's not
disregard to Columbus,

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.590
but they're not a
rival, and they're not

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.464
one of the top teams.

00:23:40.464 --> 00:23:41.910
It's just the way it is.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.320
It's easy to get up for
the LAs, and the Anaheims,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.630
and those types of games.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.390
That's easy.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.950
Montreal, Toronto, they're
pretty easy for the guys.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.190
It's the original six teams.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.584
We've got a lot of guys
that are from those areas,

00:23:52.584 --> 00:23:53.750
so you get pretty jacked up.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:54.874
They have all their family.

00:23:54.874 --> 00:23:57.102
When we play Montreal,
the guys that

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.310
are on our team from Montreal
or anywhere near there,

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.480
or even eastern Canada, all
their familiy is watching.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.865
So you get a little
more amped up for it.

00:24:04.865 --> 00:24:07.980
So home ice helps more,
I think, from a coaching,

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.750
from a last change standpoint.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.950
In the playoffs, I don't
know if last change--

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.800
it helps on face-offs
in the offensive zone,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.190
but otherwise, not as much.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.820
Because the guys,
they'll-- if you watch--

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.830
and you can't necessarily
see it as much on TV.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.950
But if you're at a game, you can
see, there could be a face-off.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:30.080
And within 15 seconds, if
San Jose-- if Pittsburgh--

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.020
on Saturday, if
Pittsburgh wins the draw

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.975
and they want to change their
D to get Letang and his partner

00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:37.850
out there against
Thornton's line, let's say,

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.700
and they just iced the puck,
and those guys aren't out there,

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.120
if they win the
face-off and chip it out

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.579
and it goes into
the Sharks' zone,

00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:46.120
they'll change those
guys right away.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.050
So there's a lot more live
changes in the playoffs

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.880
to get the potential
match-ups you want.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.360
I think the crowd
is a bigger factor.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.520
Same thing-- it's more exciting.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.780
There's more at stake.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.960
Crowd's more amped up.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.330
Players feed off of it.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.175
And they can carry it through.

00:25:02.175 --> 00:25:03.416
SHANNON DEEGAN: That's great.

00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:04.690
JAMIE BAKER: You're
up next over there.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.630
You're row three.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:06.390
I'm just joking.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:07.644
SHANNON DEEGAN: OK.

00:25:07.644 --> 00:25:09.480
Just keeping it real, exactly.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jamie.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.130
I wonder if you could talk about
the physical and the mental.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.058
I heard-- I'll start
with the mental--

00:25:18.058 --> 00:25:21.730
the announcer, last night's
game, said, a few more

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.955
minutes for a
last-minute meditation.

00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:27.240
What kind of mental
thing are they doing?

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.140
Actually doing Zen
meditation in there?

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.450
Visualization?

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.310
What are they doing?

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.340
And then the second part
is, well, [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.090
JAMIE BAKER: Yeah.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:38.200
Well, the physical's
easier to answer,

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.910
but I'll answer that after.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.660
Joe Pavelski is a great example.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.372
Guys are thinking
about it all the time.

00:25:43.372 --> 00:25:45.830
You can't get it out of your
mind at this time of the year.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.080
So they're thinking about
last night's game, what

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.350
they could have done,
different areas and all that.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.494
Joe Pavelski gets to the
rink about an hour and a half

00:25:53.494 --> 00:25:54.160
before the game.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.950
He goes and sits
out on the bench.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.550
And he has a visualization
checklist that he goes through,

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.800
starting in the defensive
zone, into the neutral zone,

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.440
offensive zone.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.690
And he just goes over all
kinds of different sequences

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.276
and plays.

00:26:05.276 --> 00:26:06.400
And he does face-off plays.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.410
It only takes-- it takes,
three, four minutes.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.980
And I've talked to him about it.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.400
So guys do different
things from that.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.810
Some guys are
listening to music.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:19.800
They're all doing it.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.097
But they're also now--
the mental part can also--

00:26:24.097 --> 00:26:25.680
and this is what
this series is about.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.550
And Pittsburgh has
a huge lead in this.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.460
And you saw it, Thornton
going after Crosby,

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.005
Crosby just whatever.

00:26:34.005 --> 00:26:36.320
Even Logan Couture
saying, after the game,

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.455
that Crosby's cheating
on the face-offs-- well,

00:26:38.455 --> 00:26:39.080
I was a center.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.580
Like, if you're not
cheating, you're

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.770
not trying when it
comes to face-offs.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.270
If the linesman's not-- if
he's not kicking you out,

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.494
then go cheat more.

00:26:48.494 --> 00:26:49.660
You gotta win the face-offs.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.400
So that's frustration.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.350
That's mental.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.310
So what the Sharks
are dealing with now

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.790
and what they wanted to impose--
and Pete DeBoer talked it.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.570
Whoever imposes their will
will get into the heads

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.700
of the other team.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.860
Huge advantage-- huge
advantage Pittsburgh right now.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.250
That's why I think the
two days is actually, now,

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.000
a advantage for the Sharks.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.870
They need it.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.040
They need it mentally.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.380
They don't need it physically.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.100
They need it, mentally,
To get rid of-- again,

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.780
the fans, the media, people
are going to be talking.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.600
These guys, turn the TV off.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.162
Don't watch the
NHL Network, even

00:27:24.162 --> 00:27:25.870
though I'm going to
be on it later today,

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.010
and they don't want
hear what I said.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.070
No, I'm just joking.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.740
But don't read anything.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.870
Don't listen to XM radio.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:33.710
Block things out.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.320
Spend some time
with your family.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.780
Come down a little bit.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.060
And then remember
what got you here.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.982
And they know what
the opponent is now,

00:27:41.982 --> 00:27:43.690
but you can't let them
get into your head

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.940
that you start to lose your
confidence or anything.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.180
And then you start
to force plays.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.810
If you start doing
that, this thing's over.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.290
So the mental part is the last
bastion you have to hold onto.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:58.740
And you see it in different
teams [INAUDIBLE] trying.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.880
You have to think of
this as a 7-game series.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.230
It's like a 15-round
heavyweight title bout.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.070
Its body shots.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.580
Every shift is an investment.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.175
And we've seen the Sharks now.

00:28:07.175 --> 00:28:09.550
We've seen other teams when
they were getting frustrated.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.425
And we talk about it.

00:28:10.425 --> 00:28:12.090
We're like, that's good.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.360
When I played and
I coached-- I've

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.940
coached every amateur level--
but I would teach the kids.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.190
I'm like, let's
watch the other team.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.240
And when they're frustrated,
I'm like, don't say anything.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.230
Don't do anything.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.646
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

00:28:22.646 --> 00:28:24.270
I'm like, we're in
control right now.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.685
And that's what's going on.

00:28:25.685 --> 00:28:28.100
And it's not going to
happen just in one game,

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.450
it's going to take, minimum, two
to start to get into the heads.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.150
You've got to plant
a seed of doubt.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.620
Like, right now, Pittsburgh's
not walking around--

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.480
the players aren't saying, we're
going to win the Stanley Cup.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.063
They know there's a
lot of work to do.

00:28:40.063 --> 00:28:42.542
But they're feeling real good.

00:28:42.542 --> 00:28:45.900
There's no reason for them
to believe, right now,

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.590
that they can't win two
out of the next five games.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.630
But if the Sharks win
Saturday, and then they

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.552
come out and win on Monday, now
there's been a seed planted.

00:28:55.552 --> 00:28:56.760
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.852
And it starts to grow.

00:28:57.852 --> 00:28:59.560
And it doesn't happen
to be in every guy.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.935
It could only be
in certain guys.

00:29:00.935 --> 00:29:03.190
So the mental part
is absolutely huge.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.000
And that's what the Sharks
have to want, and use

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.360
the physical prowess, their
skills, their execution, all

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.016
of that.

00:29:10.016 --> 00:29:12.640
They're going to be fine from--
they take care of their bodies.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.223
It's all good.

00:29:13.223 --> 00:29:16.980
They need that to get into the
heads of Pittsburgh mentally.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.725
Good question.

00:29:17.725 --> 00:29:20.100
AUDIENCE: Where does hitting
come into this? [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:24.577 --> 00:29:26.410
JAMIE BAKER: Hitting
can wear to other teams

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:30.050
down and all that,
but first of all,

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.000
you're not going to
intimidate players in the NHL.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.570
You pass the stages and phases
of intimidation coming up.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:41.166
In college, I intimidated him.

00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:43.019
And I don't want to
beat a dead horse,

00:29:43.019 --> 00:29:44.560
but it's making me
feel better today.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:44.964
SHANNON DEEGAN: Oh, it's dead.

00:29:44.964 --> 00:29:45.772
It's dead.

00:29:45.772 --> 00:29:46.580
JAMIE BAKER: Right?

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.630
Like, I intimidated
him back then.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.340
But no, you're not going
to intimidate anybody

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.430
at the NHL level.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.430
The physical part is just
to finish your checks.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.360
Wear them down a
little bit later on.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.400
Let them know that
they're going to get hit.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.870
But trust me, if you
knock Crosby down

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:07.010
with a good, hard hit-- let's
say he comes over the red line,

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:10.070
and dumps it in, and gets
the puck into our end.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.456
And then, let's just say
Justin Braun steps up and hits

00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:14.580
him good, and he goes down.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.913
You guys are all going to cheer.

00:30:15.913 --> 00:30:16.997
You're all, yah, yah, yah.

00:30:16.997 --> 00:30:18.413
When Crosby goes
to the bench, you

00:30:18.413 --> 00:30:20.090
know what his guys
are going to say?

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.900
Way to go, Sid.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.970
Way to take a hit
to make a play.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.402
So the physical
part, right now, it's

00:30:26.402 --> 00:30:28.860
more about what I was talking
about, controlling the lanes.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.720
It's getting in front of them,
establishing body position,

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.650
slowing them down.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.600
Soft picks away from
the play without getting

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.290
interference
penalties, that's going

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.970
to have more effect,
long-term, in this series,

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:40.929
than the big hits.

00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:42.470
I mean, you've got
to make your hits,

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.170
but you don't want to chase.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.807
You don't want to run out
of your way just looking

00:30:46.807 --> 00:30:48.640
for the big hits, because
Pittsburgh, that's

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.840
not going to work against them.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.400
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
thought or would like

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.340
to be a head coach in the NHL.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.910
JAMIE BAKER: Yes and no.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:02.040
Yes, I've thought about it,
and no, I don't want to do it.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.040
SHANNON DEEGAN: Why not?

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.540
Why not?

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.920
JAMIE BAKER: I don't.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.966
No interest in coaching
at the NHL level.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.020
I like broadcasting.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.880
I love my job.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:19.040
I would maybe consider coaching
in the college or something

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.910
like that, where
there's more teaching

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:27.940
and you're in more control of
the acquisition of players.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.940
My first year doing
broadcasting on radio,

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.630
I saw how much video they did.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:32.830
And I'll use Columbus.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.910
It was a Tuesday game in
Columbus in mid-January.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:39.060
And it was like, we lost, and
it was just a boring game, just

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:39.980
a boring game.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.690
And we'd be on.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.520
And at the time, Ron
Wilson and-- who else--

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.120
Tim Hunter, Rob
Zeller, they were all

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.119
watching the game again.

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:49.720
I'm like, oh my gosh, they
got to watch that again.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.580
I can't do this.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.050
I couldn't do it.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.220
They do so much video.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.010
It's for a certain
mindset of a guy.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.860
So I love coaching.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.835
I don't have an interest.

00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:02.250
You're gone all the time.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.360
And you're in front of
the-- it's too much video

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.360
that I would want to sit
in front of the screens

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360
that much to watch it.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.999
So I love what I do.

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:12.040
I've done a lot of coaching
at the amateur level.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.325
I actually am proud to
say, I spent a lot of time

00:32:14.325 --> 00:32:15.450
when my daughter was there.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.780
But I coached every amateur
level, so mite, squirt,

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.640
all the way through.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.890
I actually coached ASU club.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.750
I've coached AAA,
AA, boys and girls.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.450
And I did it because I
was passionate about it.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.760
I was giving back.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.710
But also, as a
student of the game,

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.720
I wanted-- I had some
people, and even when

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.830
my daughter was
young, well, just

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.190
because you played
in the NHL doesn't

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:38.315
mean you know how to teach.

00:32:38.315 --> 00:32:39.500
I'm like, you're right.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.040
But you know what, if
I learn how to teach,

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.732
then I guess I got you, don't I?

00:32:44.732 --> 00:32:46.440
No, because they did,
they pissed me off.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.629
They really pissed me off.

00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:49.170
Because he wasn't
doing things right.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.254
He wasn't listening to me.

00:32:50.254 --> 00:32:51.878
I'm like, you're not
teaching it right.

00:32:51.878 --> 00:32:54.391
I'm telling my daughter, don't
listen to what he's saying.

00:32:54.391 --> 00:32:55.890
And his answer was,
just because you

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.639
played doesn't mean
you know how to teach.

00:32:57.639 --> 00:32:59.490
So I went and started
learning how to teach.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.290
That's how I became a teacher.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.010
Even at youth sports,
they call it coach.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.134
I don't think it's a coach.

00:33:04.134 --> 00:33:05.600
I think you're called a teacher.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.060
You're really there to teach.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.650
And I hung out with
a guy who taught.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.294
He allowed-- my
daughter got into-- we

00:33:12.294 --> 00:33:14.710
were living in Arizona, but
she got to go to all his power

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.350
skating clinics, whenever
they were, for free, which

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.850
was great.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.683
And then I would go out
on the ice and help.

00:33:19.683 --> 00:33:21.680
But I would basically
just-- every now

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.940
and then, I'd chime in, and
take something he was teaching,

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.310
and relate it to how it would
help you in a game situation.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.157
So it was an add-on for him.

00:33:31.157 --> 00:33:33.490
And my daughter was there,
and she hated it at the time.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.740
She's like, I don't want to go.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.850
We're always doing
the same thing.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:36.190
I know.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.690
I know.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.990
That's why you're
going, repetition.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.480
Well, she's got a college
scholarship right now,

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.810
so it worked out.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:43.667
So I spent my time--

00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:45.000
SHANNON DEEGAN: To a top school.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.333
JAMIE BAKER: Yeah, great school.

00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:47.040
Great school.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.320
Great school.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.840
Great town, great
school, fantastic alumni.

00:33:53.249 --> 00:33:54.540
The warm fuzzies are happening.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:54.820
SHANNON DEEGAN: Yeah, exaclty.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.940
There we go.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.350
JAMIE BAKER: And I think
some of all that teaching--

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:59.730
and I was a coach.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.547
But part of it--
and Dan Rusanowsky

00:34:01.547 --> 00:34:03.630
knows this, because I said
it to him at one point.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.660
I said, I want to spend more
time coaching the youth level

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.870
than any other broadcaster.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.150
It was actually a goal.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:12.549
And the reason is you can go
look up stats, and do all this.

00:34:12.549 --> 00:34:15.090
Or you can have your contacts
that you can call and all that.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.710
But if I can teach the game, it
can also parlay in my analysis.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.467
And hopefully that
can come across

00:34:21.467 --> 00:34:22.550
in some of the broadcasts.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.730
Sometimes I'll
catch something that

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:28.310
comes from all the time I put
in at the youth sport level

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:31.259
that, potentially, other
broadcasters may not have.

00:34:31.259 --> 00:34:32.820
During the seasons
or in the summers,

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.219
I was doing camps and clinics,
and they were golfing.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:38.100
So it's helped me
in my broadcasting

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.469
career, which I love doing.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:40.250
SHANNON DEEGAN: And
all kidding aside, I

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.625
think one of the things that
I'm most impressed with when

00:34:42.625 --> 00:34:44.510
I watch the Sharks since
I've been out here,

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.159
in the eight years
I've been out here,

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.356
is how detailed and
analytical Jamie

00:34:49.356 --> 00:34:50.980
is compared to a lot
of the color guys.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:51.350
JAMIE BAKER: It was
going to happen.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:51.880
Give me a hug here.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.419
SHANNON DEEGAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:53.524
JAMIE BAKER: Come here.

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:53.850
OK.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.620
I'll never bring up
the Vermont stuff again

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.530
in front of your staff.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:56.920
SHANNON DEEGAN: Yeah, please.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.460
I'm trying whatever I can.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.960
JAMIE BAKER: In
front of anyone that

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.560
works with you or
in any capacity,

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.129
I'll never bring up
the records again.

00:35:03.129 --> 00:35:04.420
SHANNON DEEGAN: But it is true.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.295
JAMIE BAKER: A man hug
is always good, right?

00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:08.125
SHANNON DEEGAN: I
think it is true.

00:35:08.125 --> 00:35:10.430
You're actually talking
about the analysis.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.300
A lot of color commentators are
just talking about the player

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.350
or talking about something
that's just general.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:17.350
But there's a lot of stuff
that you're watching,

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:20.122
I'm watching and learning, which
is really cool to watch and see

00:35:20.122 --> 00:35:20.830
it at that level.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:21.795
So it's real fun.

00:35:21.795 --> 00:35:23.670
AUDIENCE: So can you
give us a little insight

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:25.930
into what the system is
that the new coach has

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.615
and how it differs
from other systems?

00:35:27.615 --> 00:35:28.740
JAMIE BAKER: Pete DeBoer's?

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.210
JAMIE BAKER: Well,
first of all, he

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:38.780
inherited good details and
habits-- so stick position,

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.790
body position,
communication, all

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.480
of this stuff that the
previous coaches have done,

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.370
and the commitment
level of the players.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.300
And his whole thing is
to contest every puck,

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.820
be pressure oriented, to do
what Pittsburgh's doing to us.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.130
Don't let the other team set up.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.070
Get on them so they're
not in a position--

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.460
their D don't have time
to go back, get a puck,

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.980
turn, and face the play.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.460
If a defenseman can come
back, turn, and face the play,

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.651
he's going to be
able to make a pass.

00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:11.150
Off you go.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.441
Then you're back on your heels.

00:36:12.441 --> 00:36:15.160
You want to get to him before he
can do it-- pressure, pressure,

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.070
pressure.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.970
And that's where the
Sharks, right now,

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:23.650
they're getting a lesson in
what they do to other teams.

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:27.044
Now, it takes about, at the
NHL level, two to three months.

00:36:27.044 --> 00:36:28.460
Even Joe Thornton
talked about it.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.390
He says it took him
a couple of months

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.294
to get used to all the
different pressure points.

00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:35.960
Because you're skating
more, your shifts

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.334
are going to be
a little shorter.

00:36:37.334 --> 00:36:39.770
It's very reactionary,
very anticipatory.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.730
Like, you go right away.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.752
It's great for a guy like Burns.

00:36:44.752 --> 00:36:45.960
There's no thinking involved.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.450
It's [SNAPS FINGERS] go.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.410
Take away time first, not space.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:53.090
So the previous coaching
staff, they would come up--

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:54.330
and I'll get up.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.460
They would sometimes come
in and influence you, try

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.860
and get you to go to the corner.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.140
In this case, boom,
just get on the guy

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.710
right away-- right away--
don't give him any time.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.390
And don't worry about
forcing him to his backhand.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.080
Get on him so he can't
make a pass either way.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.759
And we're seeing,
that's what-- and that's

00:37:10.759 --> 00:37:11.800
the system, more or less.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.510
I mean, there's a few things
they did in the neutral zone.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.870
It's called stay above.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:20.990
They've got one of their
forwards-- the F1, whoever,

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.854
the first forward--
back, closer to the D.

00:37:23.854 --> 00:37:26.610
He picks up the opposing
team's player that's

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:27.830
cutting across the ice.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.270
And he'll be like three feet
on the other side of him.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:33.130
So if the pass comes,
we're right on him.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.950
And then one D takes
away the stretch play.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:39.310
The other D comes up
and moves in with him.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:43.290
So when you watch it, the game
of hockey is moving so fast.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.350
But it takes a few
months for everybody.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.080
If it takes Joe
Thornton two months,

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.420
then it's going to take younger,
inexperienced guys that don't

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.300
have the same amount
of hockey IQ--

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.760
it's going to take them
at least three months.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.510
And that's when you
really started to see,

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.440
the team really
started to click.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.320
I thought mid-December's
when they started to go.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.627
Really took off in mid-January.

00:38:03.627 --> 00:38:05.210
SHANNON DEEGAN: On
that point, I think

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:08.700
the guy who seems to have had
the most drastic turnaround

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.220
in his style of play as a
result of DeBoer's style

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.100
is Patrick Marleau.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.492
He's playing on top of the guys.

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:15.950
He's playing a lot
more aggressive.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:16.750
He's hitting.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.540
He's just doing
things in this playoff

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.810
that he hasn't done before.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.240
In terms of the style of play,
it's completely different.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.740
Joe Thornton's
playing at that level

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.170
that we always see him play at.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.820
But Marleau is just
a different player

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.050
compared to what he's been in
the rest of his career, which

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.030
is pretty amazing to see.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.405
JAMIE BAKER: Well,
you don't want

00:38:32.405 --> 00:38:35.050
to be the one spoke
in the wheel that's

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.290
not fulfilling your obligation
from contesting and being

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:39.120
aggressive.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.590
And it's very noticeable
on film, you know?

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:45.876
It's not necessarily as
noticeable every game.

00:38:45.876 --> 00:38:47.500
Especially if you're
watching it on TV,

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.660
you don't see everything.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.760
But when these coaches--
they're seeing stuff live

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.740
and breaking it down.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.647
But for Marleau,
this is just go.

00:38:55.647 --> 00:38:57.480
I mean, with your speed,
it just plays right

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.510
into-- his best asset is
his quickness and his speed.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.582
SHANNON DEEGAN: Absolutely.

00:39:02.582 --> 00:39:04.540
AUDIENCE: I want to go
back to the second round

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:09.170
against Nashville, the black cat
that was laid out in the rink.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.990
Was it someone's idea, or
did it happen by accident?

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.450
JAMIE BAKER: It would be
great if somebody planned it,

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.769
but I don't think so.

00:39:18.769 --> 00:39:21.060
But it is a little weird that
the cat was on the bench,

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:21.745
right?

00:39:21.745 --> 00:39:23.510
Like, how did the cat-- and
then come out on the ice

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.010
and warm up?

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.720
But no, it was
totally accidental.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.860
I guess the cat had been in
the arena for a few days.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.950
And they knew about it,
but couldn't catch it.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.750
And then after
that, it caught on.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.610
AUDIENCE: It was interesting how
the social media team picked it

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:38.110
up.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.580
JAMIE BAKER: Yeah.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.670
Well, that's our world.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.880
Social media picked it up
and ran with it, right?

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.730
There's something to go with.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.390
Yeah, interesting.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.840
And I guess the-- went
to the Humane Society,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.080
and is now happy in a home.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.070
SHANNON DEEGAN: Happy
in a home, exactly.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:53.635
JAMIE BAKER: Pavelski.

00:39:53.635 --> 00:39:54.140
SHANNON DEEGAN:
Question here-- I

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.650
don't know if we can get
the Pittsburgh people?

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.275
Can we hear them if
they have questions

00:39:57.275 --> 00:40:01.270
or if we want to give
them an opportunity to--

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.695
JAMIE BAKER: Do we want to?

00:40:03.695 --> 00:40:04.195
No.

00:40:04.195 --> 00:40:05.940
No.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.772
You guys just sit back there
comfortably, all smiles.

00:40:08.772 --> 00:40:09.730
You're loving all this.

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:10.271
You're happy.

00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:11.355
You're in a good position.

00:40:11.355 --> 00:40:13.229
What are you going to
do, start gloating now?

00:40:13.229 --> 00:40:13.860
Don't do that.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.670
It's too early.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:18.240
But I'll tell you,
Pittsburgh, great town.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.370
And very impressed
by this hockey team,

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.140
very, very impressed.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.730
I like the way they play, I do.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:29.540
They play fast.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.345
They play a real--
there they are.

00:40:33.345 --> 00:40:34.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
sorry about that.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.932
We were muted before.

00:40:35.932 --> 00:40:36.890
JAMIE BAKER: All right.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:37.410
Fire away.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.080
What do you got?

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I don't know.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.230
I was going to ask you about--

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.630
JAMIE BAKER: Look at how
comfortable they are.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.880
AUDIENCE: --Couture's comments
about cheating on the face-off

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.379
there.

00:40:43.379 --> 00:40:45.000
JAMIE BAKER: Ah, you braggarts.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.041
SHANNON DEEGAN: Go ahead.

00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:46.800
Go ahead.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.850
AUDIENCE: I said, I
was going to ask you

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.530
what you thought of Couture's
comments about Crosby cheating

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:54.700
on the face-off, but I
think you covered it there.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.850
I thought that was a well-known
thing, that every does it.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:59.140
JAMIE BAKER: Frustration.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:03.410
And it defers talking about
the X's and O's of the games.

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.536
So I don't know what
his motives are.

00:41:07.332 --> 00:41:08.790
SHANNON DEEGAN:
Yeah, I don't think

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:09.880
the refs are going
to look at it and go,

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.380
ah, we better pay attention to
that a little more next game.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.954
That's not going to cross
the linesman-- his head.

00:41:14.954 --> 00:41:16.370
So I don't know
what he was doing.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.537
It's frustration.

00:41:18.537 --> 00:41:20.870
AUDIENCE: Is that part of it,
that kind of gamesmanship?

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:24.017
Because I think the Penguins
did that a little bit

00:41:24.017 --> 00:41:25.850
in the Capitals series,
where I thought they

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.560
were getting away with a
lot in the face-off circle.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.430
And then they seemed
to get it waved out

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:32.610
a little more after that.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.720
Do the officials pay
any attention to that,

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.660
or it doesn't enter
their mind at all?

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.160
JAMIE BAKER: Oh,
the officials, they

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.640
pay attention to everything.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.745
There's a lot of interaction
going down on ice level.

00:41:42.745 --> 00:41:46.750
And I'll tell you,
toughest-- I think

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:48.390
hockey officials,
that's the toughest

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:49.610
sport to be an official in.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.776
I don't even know how they
don't get hit more often,

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:54.790
either by players or pucks.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:57.760
If you're ever at a game
down low, it is fast.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.410
And there's no out of bounds.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:00.540
There's nowhere to go.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.460
And these guys, somehow, they
have to stay out of the way

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.580
and make calls at the
pace that's going on.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:10.190
Extremely difficult. So what
you're seeing is frustration

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.990
and also deferring
potential questions.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.670
What do you want to talk about?

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.500
Oh, you guys are
getting dominated.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.561
Well, no one's
going to admit that.

00:42:18.561 --> 00:42:20.560
They're like, well, these
games have been close.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.330
We hung in.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.100
We need to play better.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.480
So you're getting
into, pack your bags,

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.570
we're move to
"clicheville" right now.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:28.904
And he said it.

00:42:28.904 --> 00:42:30.070
It doesn't have any meaning.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:33.395
It doesn't have any bearing
on next game other than,

00:42:33.395 --> 00:42:37.150
you know what, he needs to win
more face-offs against Crosby.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.670
I mean, that was the
game-deciding goal.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.170
It was an offensive
face-off win.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.087
And he set it up
right before it too.

00:42:43.087 --> 00:42:43.920
The cameras had him.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.850
He talked to Letang.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:47.820
It was a set play
executed to perfection,

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.560
and it gave them a
commanding 2-0 lead.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.340
OK.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.860
Get out of here.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.846
Get out of here.

00:42:55.846 --> 00:42:56.346
Geez.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.840
I mean, I'm not
going to be nice yet.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.620
Yeah, wave away.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.400
Keep it going.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.895
Yeah, yeah, keep it going.

00:43:04.895 --> 00:43:05.937
SHANNON DEEGAN: Go ahead.

00:43:05.937 --> 00:43:08.270
AUDIENCE: So this question's
all about the young players

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.900
on the Sharks.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.500
I remember, I think you
were talking about some

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.270
of the changes that Doug
Wilson made in between seasons.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.960
And I think one thing that I was
talking to some of my coworkers

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.467
who are big sharks fans
was also looking at what

00:43:19.467 --> 00:43:21.550
the young players from the
Sharks from past season

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.740
to this season-- you've
seen Hertl come up.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.900
You've seen Wingels take
his game to another level.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.215
I think Couture finally
got that extra gear

00:43:28.215 --> 00:43:29.090
from the past season.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.811
So how do you think the young
players of the Sharks fit

00:43:31.811 --> 00:43:32.310
into this?

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.768
And also, going
forward, how do you

00:43:33.768 --> 00:43:36.530
see this team where you have
a core that's getting older,

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.780
but they've also got some
young players coming up too?

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.270
How do you see that panning
out into the future?

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.690
JAMIE BAKER: You
know, the young guys,

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:45.580
it starts with the
professionalism

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.100
of the top guys.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.330
It's leadership.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.960
It's your core leaders.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:56.560
Thornton, Marleau, Pavelski,
Vlasic, those guys, Burns,

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.450
these guys work
out, train so hard.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.000
You go look at how many
games that these guys play

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.700
every single season, there's
a reason why-- knock on wood,

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.790
but there's a reason why--
they don't get injured.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:06.790
It's the way they train.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:08.539
And it's also with
the training staff.

00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:10.580
Mike Potenza, the strength
and conditioning coach

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.260
for the Sharks, he's awesome.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.050
These guys, you're reaching
success at a very young age.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:21.460
It's something that most
people don't really talk about.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:25.350
You're in your early 20s,
and you're at the peak.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:28.040
It doesn't happen in your
world, usually-- I mean,

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.510
the odd start-up,
the odd start-up.

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:33.450
But in sports, it
happens regularly.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.189
You're making
millions of dollars.

00:44:35.189 --> 00:44:36.730
If you're in the
NHL at 23 and you're

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:40.030
making a million dollars,
that's it, the pinnacle.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.250
You can make a bit
more money, but you've

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:44.017
reached the pinnacle
of what you can do.

00:44:44.017 --> 00:44:46.350
And now you're just trying
to win a championship, right?

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.300
But when you have
that leadership core

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.160
and you watch those
guys work hard,

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.170
and how they take care of each
other, take care of themselves,

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:56.290
from nutrition to sleep,
everything, their training-- I

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:57.782
remember, a couple
of years ago-- I

00:44:57.782 --> 00:44:59.490
think it was three
years ago-- the Sharks

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.020
lost out in the playoffs.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.860
And I was over at the
practice facility.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.570
This was like a week, 10
days after they'd lost.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:08.660
There's Joe Thornton working
out already-- not hard,

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.422
but he was maintaining to get
ready for his summer training.

00:45:11.422 --> 00:45:13.130
He took a week off,
and then that was it.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:15.660
So I'll bundle all those guys.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.640
Hertl-- like, an
example for Hertl,

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.270
he had that terrible
injury his first year.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:23.690
So the first summer
was basically rehab.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:25.560
So he lost a summer
of working out.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.950
It affected him his
sophomore year in the NHL.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.500
Then, last summer,
he got to train.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.300
First, they missed the playoffs.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.156
So now he's got--

00:45:34.156 --> 00:45:35.530
SHANNON DEEGAN:
Five, six months.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:35.880
Yeah, five, six months.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.630
JAMIE BAKER: Yeah, he's got
an extra month right there,

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:39.490
of training.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.310
So he gets the training
and all that, puts it in.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:44.480
Well, we see, he reaps
the benefits this year.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.100
He's stronger on the puck.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.980
His skating is better
because of that.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.650
He's become an elite
power forward in the NHL.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:52.840
And you transfer that
through all the young guys.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.881
All the young guys coming
up, even the guys here,

00:45:54.881 --> 00:45:57.340
the Barracuda, now that
they're here in San Jose,

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.500
they get to see this.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.660
They get to see how these
guys prepare and train

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.850
on a day-to-day basis.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:03.350
And Pete DeBoer has
talked about it.

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.260
He knew these guys
were good players.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.490
He didn't know the
level of professionalism

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:12.180
that the Burns, the Thorntons,
the Marleaus, the Pavelskis,

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.010
those guys have on
a day-to-day basis,

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:15.980
and it makes it much
easier for a coach.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.520
It's a good question.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.248
Do you have any tips
for rapid recovery

00:46:21.248 --> 00:46:22.707
for cross-country
trips, like, say,

00:46:22.707 --> 00:46:24.373
if we had to visit
the Pittsburgh office

00:46:24.373 --> 00:46:25.302
and then be back here?

00:46:27.085 --> 00:46:29.210
JAMIE BAKER: I don't even
know what the players do.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:32.820
I struggle with it.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.170
They've studied it from
a sleep standpoint.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:40.080
The hardest part is
nutrition and sleep, right?

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.610
And if you're working in
that, that's the hardest part.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.179
So me, we're out.

00:46:44.179 --> 00:46:45.970
You don't even want to
know what it's like.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:46.840
We're a disaster.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.700
We're the broadcasters.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.530
We're out.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:50.630
We're social guys.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:51.130
We go out.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:52.921
If there are sponsors,
we're out with them.

00:46:52.921 --> 00:46:56.350
We're eating, and having
some beers, and all that.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:57.830
It's different though.

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.560
My lifestyle is--
and my wife knows.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.090
If you travel, it's not easy.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.460
And we travel for long periods.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.570
It wears you down.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:09.940
You get as used to it as
you can is the best way.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:15.609
And I don't know, we
travel different time zones

00:47:15.609 --> 00:47:16.650
so often during the year.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.660
But even when I come back,
my lifestyle's different.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:20.910
I work nights.

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:24.184
So I'm drinking coffee
or tea at 7 o'clock,

00:47:24.184 --> 00:47:25.225
getting ready for a game.

00:47:25.225 --> 00:47:28.370
And you guys are--
you know, caffeinated.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:29.860
So you guys aren't doing that.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.400
Your days are-- well, maybe.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.140
See, I forgot.

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.040
I forgot, I'm at Google.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.410
Know your crowd, Jamie.

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:37.030
Read the room.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.900
Read the room.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.509
So we work nights.

00:47:40.509 --> 00:47:43.050
And then it takes me a little
while to wind down after games.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:43.883
You know, I go home.

00:47:43.883 --> 00:47:46.850
Typically, even a home game,
I won't fall asleep til 1:00.

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:47.890
I decompress.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:51.170
Because even though it's not
out on the ice, trust me,

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:54.602
if I screw up on the
broadcast, it's on Twitter.

00:47:54.602 --> 00:47:56.060
I'll be reading
about it somewhere,

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.420
and hearing about it.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.670
And you want to do a good job.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.240
And you need energy.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.980
So the whole day builds up.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.370
Then you do the game.

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:09.120
And there's a little bit of
a progression to decompress.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.620
And then you start
the process over.

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.911
SHANNON DEEGAN: It's amazing
to watch the players today

00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:14.970
in terms of how they
focus on all that.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:16.880
You know, certainly,
when I played,

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.550
that was not even part of it.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:20.264
I remember talking
to players-- Gretzky,

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:21.680
the year after he
won a Cup and he

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.280
got traded to LA in training
camp-- saying to him, when

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.340
was the last time
you were on skates.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.360
And this is now September,
for training camp.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.071
And he says, when
we won the Cup.

00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:31.570
He hadn't been on
skates all summer.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.050
Now it doesn't matter
what player you are.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:35.710
Two weeks after
this Cup, Crosby's

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.793
going to be back on the
ice, or certainly training

00:48:37.793 --> 00:48:39.636
at a very intense level.

00:48:39.636 --> 00:48:41.010
And then the sleep
patterns-- you

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.200
talk to some of the
guys on the team now.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.090
I know Pavelski.

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.920
And just the food, he's
drinking a lot of tea.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.930
He's got a whole rhythm to sleep
patterns that he has to manage,

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.580
stuff that you didn't
even think about.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.210
And you just see, the
physical level that they're at

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:57.770
is just phenomenal
to watch, right?

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.460
JAMIE BAKER: These
guys make more money,

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:03.180
we had way more stories--
that I can't share.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.260
We had way more fun.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.150
It's non-negotiable.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:10.020
But they're in better shape,
and their abs look better,

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.724
and they make more money.

00:49:11.724 --> 00:49:13.640
They look better on
Instagram with their shirt

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.430
off than we did.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:15.060
SHANNON DEEGAN:
They certainly do.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:15.810
They certainly do.

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:17.920
You to talk to them,
and that's exactly-- how

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.880
was the road trip?

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.963
Did you have a lot of fun?

00:49:19.963 --> 00:49:23.180
And the old days, the road
trips were the epic stories

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.880
that-- and the don't have them
anymore when you talk to them.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.480
I mean, it's just amazing
to watch the discipline.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.780
JAMIE BAKER: You guys-- the
internet and the camera phone

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:33.890
has changed pro
sports in that regard.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.890
I played with this guy
named Jamie McCallen when

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:36.598
I was in Toronto.

00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:39.120
And he was an old-school guy.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.620
He told the trainers, he goes,
I don't-- they'd give him his

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.030
equipment to bring home
for the summer at the end

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.420
of the season.

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.580
He goes, I don't need it.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.746
And they didn't believe him.

00:49:45.746 --> 00:49:46.972
He goes, I don't skate.

00:49:46.972 --> 00:49:47.930
They don't believe him.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.680
So one year, they put
a banana in his bag.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.300
When they came back, it was
this little shriveled-up, black

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.930
banana sitting there,
right in the bag.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:55.270
He had never opened it up.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.610
He's was like, the bastard,
he didn't lie to us.

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:58.650
He doesn't skate at all.

00:49:58.650 --> 00:49:59.890
Yeah.

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:02.830
Poor banana.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:04.275
If you were going
to be a banana,

00:50:04.275 --> 00:50:06.599
that's a bad banana
to be right there.

00:50:06.599 --> 00:50:07.640
SHANNON DEEGAN: Go ahead.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.940
AUDIENCE: I was just going
to ask about Joel Ward.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.790
He's become one of my
favorite players out there,

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:13.206
and I didn't really know him
before he came to the Sharks.

00:50:13.206 --> 00:50:15.965
But what do you think he's
really brought to the club?

00:50:15.965 --> 00:50:19.050
JAMIE BAKER: Oh, everything.

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:23.492
First of all, and
this is where this-- I

00:50:23.492 --> 00:50:25.450
know Pittsburgh's playing
great and everything.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:30.020
But this Sharks team, they're
a resilient, persistent bunch,

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:30.540
you know?

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:33.950
I'm curious to see how they try
and climb out of this thing.

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.282
And maybe they can't.

00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:37.240
But if there's a group
in this league that can,

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.580
if there's a team that
can overcome the and beat

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.830
the Penguins, it's
the San Jose Sharks.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.480
They have the goaltending,
but they have all these guys.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.750
Their history, their
bios, who they are

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:49.330
is about resiliency
and perseverance.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:52.230
And I don't overuse those words,
because they're really, really

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.750
important.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.530
But Joel Ward, he went and
played for years junior

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:56.470
in Canada.

00:50:56.470 --> 00:51:01.090
And then, most players, you
go pro to some level, right?

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.180
You're playing, maybe, in the
minors, but you're playing pro.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.270
He then went-- he didn't go pro.

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:09.340
He went and played four years
Canadian college hockey,

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:14.229
which is-- the next step, you're
preparing for adult hockey.

00:51:14.229 --> 00:51:16.270
I think he's the only
player in the NHL right now

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:18.320
that played Canadian
college hockey.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.680
US college hockey is still
a pipeline to the NHL.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.890
But Canadian colleges, guys
that have played juniors,

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.970
it's hockey's graveyard.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:29.910
You're going to
finish your education,

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.940
and it's your fraternity.

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:33.680
It's like an
athletic fraternity.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.840
You play hockey.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.860
You're staying in shape.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:36.790
You love the sport.

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:39.170
It keeps you busy,
helps you keep

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:40.500
your schedule, all of that.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.500
And they try and win the
championships up there,

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.270
and it's awesome.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.970
It's great.

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:44.800
He played four years there.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.290
Then he went and
played in the minors.

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:47.860
And then he made
his way to the NHL.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.730
And here he is.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.480
He said, I don't
have any pressure.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.440
I have nothing to lose.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.140
He's beaten the odds.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.550
You know he did last week?

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:57.420
I got an email.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:05.070
He had a pizza day at SAP
Center for all the employees

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:08.210
just a week ago--
yeah, last Friday,

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:13.640
I think it was-- just to send
an appreciation to everybody.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.900
And I'm like, that's
the type of guy he is.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.000
We went back this year.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.370
When we were back in Washington,
you should see the people

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:23.220
that-- it was a love fest.

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.650
But the people
behind the scenes,

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:27.310
the janitors, the guy
that drives the Zamboni,

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:30.050
he treats everyone the
same, with respect.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.350
And he works hard,
straight-line guy.

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:35.410
You talk about just a great
guy on and off the ice--

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.570
he's a great player, and
he's a better person.

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:40.950
And the Sharks have
a lot of those guys.

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:43.620
That's where it's tough seeing
them in this hole right now.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:49.352
But I'm excited to
see how-- if and how--

00:52:49.352 --> 00:52:50.310
they can get out of it.

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:51.684
Because I can tell
you right now,

00:52:51.684 --> 00:52:54.770
if Joel Ward was sitting
here, he wouldn't really

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:58.440
be able to say anything,
like tactically and all that.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.550
But he's like, no, we're
planning on winning the series.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.210
We're not going down.

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:04.630
This thing isn't over yet.

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.560
And that's what he believes.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:09.120
That's the type of person.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.770
And the same thing
with Joe Pavelski.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:13.030
He's a great, great person.

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:17.460
Here's a guy that's
seventh round draft pick.

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.200
204 guys were
drafted before him.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.305
29 other teams would love
that guy on their team.

00:53:22.305 --> 00:53:22.930
He's a captain.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:23.550
He's huge.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:24.550
He's not going away.

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:26.800
He's not packing his bags,
saying, we can't do this.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.650
So it's guys like
that, now, that

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:31.720
have to lead the
charge come Saturday.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.560
AUDIENCE: So outside
of the current season,

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:36.790
which team do you think has
all the right young elements

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.250
to become the one team to beat
in the next, let's say, four

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:42.272
or five years?

00:53:42.272 --> 00:53:43.730
JAMIE BAKER: It's
a tough question,

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:50.740
because there's so much
parity in the league.

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.330
You know?

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:52.954
Like, coming into
this year's playoffs,

00:53:52.954 --> 00:53:55.630
the Western
Conference, I thought

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:58.500
seven of the eight
teams could potentially

00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.380
win the Stanley Cup.

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.150
I didn't think Minnesota
was good enough.

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:02.108
That was the only team.

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.050
And in some teams, the
way they restack-- I mean,

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:10.650
you look at an Edmonton, they're
loaded with young players,

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:11.680
and they have McDavid.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.250
But they're going to have
to make some changes,

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.791
because their culture
is not winning.

00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:16.140
Their culture is losing.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.740
Their culture is
getting frustrated.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:18.680
That's what it was.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.929
And it was a frustrating year.

00:54:19.929 --> 00:54:22.340
I think with Todd McLellan
and his staff there,

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.640
they made some inroads.

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.850
But I'm curious to see what
they do this summer, if they

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:28.446
keep all those young players.

00:54:28.446 --> 00:54:30.820
Because some of them, that
they don't know anything other

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.750
than losing.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.230
And it's like, maybe they
should move out and bring

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:38.550
in-- maybe they should
build it around McDavid.

00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:40.550
He's a generational player.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:45.712
Like Edmonton, even Calgary's
got some good young players.

00:54:45.712 --> 00:54:47.920
SHANNON DEEGAN: I think
Dallas, with Seguin and Benn,

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.020
those are young guys
who are just turning up.

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:49.120
JAMIE BAKER: Yeah.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.690
Phoenix is doing
some good moves.

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:53.490
It could take a few years.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.110
But it's tough to say,
because some of these guys

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:58.250
don't all develop the same.

00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:03.290
The thing about the NHL is,
it's the best hockey league

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:04.650
in the world for a reason.

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:07.170
You're coached by the best.

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.560
You're playing against the
best every single night.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.370
And if you have a weakness--
at the end of my career,

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:15.020
I got sent back to the minors,
and I finished my career

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:16.160
in the Chicago Wolves.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.800
There were players on that
team, and we won a championship.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.677
And I went to the coaching
staff two, three weeks

00:55:21.677 --> 00:55:22.510
before the playoffs.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.850
I said, just make me
a third-line center.

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:26.390
That's what I did in the NHL.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:28.100
I'm good at it.

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.090
I'll kill penalties.

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:30.594
I'll be good on face-offs.

00:55:30.594 --> 00:55:32.760
I'll drive some of the top
players on the other team

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.510
crazy.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:34.890
Don't put me on a top line.

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:36.620
We had other guys who
were more skilled.

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:41.626
But they'd ask me, why'd you
make it, and why haven't I?

00:55:41.626 --> 00:55:43.500
And I'm like, because
when you're in the NHL,

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.680
if you have a weakness,
it gets personified.

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.990
Because we talk about every
player before every game.

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:52.680
Whatever it is-- if it's
speed, you will get exposed.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.070
If you don't like the physical
play, you will get exposed.

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:58.216
If you don't make
good backhand passes,

00:55:58.216 --> 00:56:00.090
you will get exposed,
because guys will know.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.470
And they will force you on
your backhand all the time.

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:04.470
So we know all the
strengths and-- and that's

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:07.094
what makes the great
players so amazing,

00:56:07.094 --> 00:56:08.760
because they don't
have many weaknesses.

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.210
You can't exploit them.

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:13.120
And you've got to play against
those guys every single night.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.740
So who, moving forward?

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:16.470
We just touched on a
few of those teams.

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:19.011
The Islanders have some good--
and the other thing you've got

00:56:19.011 --> 00:56:21.680
to remember-- and this is good.

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.465
It's parity, but
it's the salary cap.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.370
Tampa Bay is in trouble.

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:31.170
They're stockpiled, right
now, with young talent.

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:33.751
But they've got a whole bunch
of guys in contract situations.

00:56:33.751 --> 00:56:36.000
I don't think they're going
to able to keep everybody.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.270
So you can be great now
and have a nice little run.

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:41.030
And then if you
have any semblance

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:43.880
of success and
contracts are coming up,

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.821
good luck signing everybody.

00:56:45.821 --> 00:56:47.320
But I think it's
good for the sport,

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.361
because I don't think we
can predict three, four,

00:56:49.361 --> 00:56:51.197
five years down the road.

00:56:51.197 --> 00:56:53.530
SHANNON DEEGAN: Well, look,
I thank everyone for coming.

00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:54.900
Jamie, thank you, in
particular, for coming.

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:55.470
JAMIE BAKER: Yeah, thank you.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:57.386
SHANNON DEEGAN: I think
it's been a great day.

00:56:57.386 --> 00:56:58.220
