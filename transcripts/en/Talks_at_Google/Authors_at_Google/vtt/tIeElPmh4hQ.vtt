SCOTT SOSEBEE: Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:02.307
My name is Scott Sosebee.

00:00:02.307 --> 00:00:03.890
I can't thank Google
enough for having

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.400
me here today to moderate this
conversation with our guest.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.040
If you've been living under a
rock, and don't know who he is,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.320
he is one of the most
successful and well known

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.950
businessmen in the world.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.110
New York Times best
selling author,

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.330
Grammy winning recording artist,
co-founder of the hottest rock

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.902
band in the world, KISS, ladies
and gentlemen, Gene Simmons.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.640
Thank you, sir.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.259
GENE SIMMONS: No microphones?

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.220
You guys can hear us?

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.080
All right.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.490
SCOTT SOSEBEE: So you have
written a book, Me, Inc.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.630
GENE SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.600
SCOTT SOSEBEE: A lot of
these people probably

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.350
have not read it.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.720
I have.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.990
You explain how to
become successful.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.650
GENE SIMMONS: No,
that's not fair.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.660
It really isn't fair, and
I'll tell you what I mean.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.640
When I came to this
country-- English

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.477
is not my original language.

00:00:52.477 --> 00:00:53.560
This is my third language.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.550
I spoke Hebrew, then Hungarian,
and then your language.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.900
And we'll get to why that's
important in a second.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.830
Then I learned to speak German,
then a little bit of Japanese.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.930
Anybody speak Japanese?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.140
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]
How's my accent?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.390
Oh, nobody speaks Japanese.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.500
OK, forget it.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.450
I thought somebody said, I do.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.880
But in all seriousness,
when I came to America,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.890
and I went through the
educational system,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.530
and I learned, in other words,
my inferred fiduciary duty,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.110
I had to learn how to speak
the language of the culture,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.326
dress British, think Yiddish--
see the pregnant pause so they

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:40.400
can, dress British-- And
so those are the keys.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.470
That's the first step.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.110
Learn language skills, then
people skills, ad infinitum ad

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.610
nauseum.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.410
But school didn't teach
me anything, you know?

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.206
I learned about Columbus, and
the original first nations

00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:55.580
here, who weren't from India,
but they're called Indians.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.940
And then all of a sudden, you
have to start earning a living.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.130
And nobody prepares you
for how life actually is.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.630
I mean, I want to turn it over
to you for one quick second.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.110
Since you're all in very
dramatic silhouettes,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.520
I can't tell who's
the best looking one,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.160
so I'm going to ask you, may I?

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.460
What do you do at Google?

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.010
Or if you do work at Google?

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.968
AUDIENCE: Oh yes, I do.

00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:22.270
I'm a partner manager.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.130
GENE SIMMONS: You're
a partner manager.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.130
I don't know what
that title does.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.792
What does a partner manager do?

00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:30.167
AUDIENCE: Make
sure our partners,

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:34.570
like, support and
sell Google apps.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.420
GENE SIMMONS: I see.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.520
So Zuckerberg must pay you
a fortune for doing this,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.550
and has now made you a partner
in the entire entity, right?

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.580
I'm sure that's true.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.302
So what was the name
of the high school

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:49.760
class, in all
seriousness, what was

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.470
the name of the
class in high school

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.360
that prepared you for making
the money that you're making now

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.390
in the job you're doing?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.294
AUDIENCE: High school
class, hmmmmm...

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.550
GENE SIMMONS: Probably not.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.261
GENE SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:03:03.261 --> 00:03:04.450
Probably nothing.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.356
Because they don't teach
life in high school.

00:03:07.356 --> 00:03:08.980
The educational
system, and by the way,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.750
I was a sixth
grade teacher once.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.700
I was.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.530
Why is that funny?

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.714
[CLAPPING FOR ATTENTION]
Attention, class!

00:03:18.714 --> 00:03:19.880
Come on, why was that funny?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.510
I'm serious.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.306
I was a sixth grade
teacher in Spanish Harlem.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:24.790
Yes, I was.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.450
That's uptown.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.740
And on the first day, I
heard, [SPEAKING SPANISH],

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.120
which does not mean, good
morning, Jewish person.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.980
Anybody speak Spanish?

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.687
How was the accent?

00:03:35.687 --> 00:03:37.270
[INAUDIBLE] It's a
little [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.690
with a little Mexicano.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.500
Right?

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.010
But in all seriousness,
what we learn in school,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.597
doesn't prepare many people
for much of anything.

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:51.180
You learn, sort of,
facts and figures.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.710
It's kind of like
playing Trivial Pursuit.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.060
You know the answers.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.360
Great, now how do I make money?

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.060
You don't.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.080
And so I use this term
often, many times,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.350
the inferred fiduciary
duty to yourselves.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.300
It's your responsibility
to learn whatever

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.360
it is you need to unlock
that key that opens the door.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.800
Because the mountain ain't
coming to you, Mohammed.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.399
Kim, who is very beautiful and
who was walking around here

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:23.590
someplace, and was our
escort, taught herself

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.640
how to do that
push-button stuff,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.240
that the rest of the world--
because don't presume

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.940
that everybody's on
computers and does

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.370
all that kind of stuff.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.580
She taught herself how to
do that, which then led her

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.210
to this, and on and on.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.750
So I wanted to,
finally, even though you

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.740
can tell I love the
sound of my own voice,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.700
finally, I wanted
to write a book that

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.870
helps the great unwashed masses.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.260
And I mean that with
all due respect.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.500
There are many, many,
many times more people

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.150
that are not like you, that
don't have credit cards,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.570
don't understand what social
media is, don't understand

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.450
how the free market
capitalist system works,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.420
don't understand
how to get a job.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.210
They really don't.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.550
They're the ones who built
this building that you're in,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.780
that you bought for
$2 or $3 billion.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.820
So they know how
to do one thing.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.339
They probably goofed
around school.

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.630
They didn't learn the stuff
they need, so they wound up

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.940
being menial laborers, and
still don't understand concept--

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.460
So I wanted to write a
book in plain English,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.000
without graphs, without
using words like meta.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.724
Right, Kim?

00:05:34.724 --> 00:05:37.390
On the way in she said meta, and
then I asked her what it meant,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.530
and she couldn't do it.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.054
Well give me an
application, and I

00:05:42.054 --> 00:05:43.470
don't mean a
computer application.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.511
See that, that's a different
kind of application.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.020
So "Me, Inc."

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.330
Is a kind of a
Cliff Notes of life.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.120
It's not very specific.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.070
It just points the
finger back at you.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.240
So there's a chapter called
lady entrepreneurship,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.890
and kid entrepreneurs,
and there's actually

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.930
a chapter called
"Speak English."

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.790
It gets people really angry.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.600
What are you trying
to tell me I can't

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.450
speak Serbian and Zimbabwean?

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.620
No, you go right ahead.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.030
Speak any language you want to.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.620
Remember, I don't have
a horse in this race.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.200
I wasn't born in America.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.650
I just recognize that
I have an advantage

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.950
if I know the
language of business.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.510
And in this culture,
in this time,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.690
as a matter of fact
anywhere on planet Earth,

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.350
English is a decided advantage
in the language of business.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.870
Just like you have a decided.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.520
Advantage, because you know
how to do all that social media

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.710
stuff, and Google stuff that
I can barely understand.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.310
You're better at this than I,
because you know that stuff.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.687
So I can continue on, but
any oxygen left for you?

00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:45.520
SCOTT SOSEBEE: Sure.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.736
GENE SIMMONS: OK, go ahead.

00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:49.110
SCOTT SOSEBEE: So this book
is really easy to understand.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.210
GENE SIMMONS: Very simple.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:07:00.720
Because if I have a self
imposed mandate in this book--

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.270
because I don't
have enough money,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.150
but I have a lot of money.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.750
I love saying that.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.250
I do.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.370
I have shitloads of money.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.320
I sleep on fucking money.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.500
I shit money.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.810
Trying to think of other--

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.480
But in all seriousness,
nobody helped me.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.100
I really want the book,
and I know it's going to,

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.300
because it already has-- I
wanted to inspire and motivate

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.000
somebody to get themselves
off the fucking floor

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.090
and do something with your
life instead of going,

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.390
I'm 24 years old, I'm
going to go on a vacation.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.330
What?

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.060
You're going to
go on a vacation?

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.490
To do what?

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.810
You're just waiting to die.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.410
The days are going by.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:52.080
The fuse has been lit, and
after a while, we're done.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.670
So it seems to me, we have
a limited amount of time.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.230
Here, let me give
you a wake-up call.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.760
This is what I realized.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.190
One third of your life
is spent comatose.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.700
You're asleep.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.050
You're not even alive.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.280
That leaves 2/3.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.880
I'm going to live
to be 80 years old.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.030
Great, take a third off.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.720
You're asleep.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.740
You're dead.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.560
Now you've got 2/3 of your life.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.060
OK.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.730
So you work seven days a week,
and you take two days off.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.000
Two days off, every
week, times 52 weeks

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.560
is 104 days doing nothing.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.210
You're watching Oprah reruns,
or whatever you're doing.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.890
I'm sorry, you don't
watch TV anymore.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.390
Now it's on this.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.030
Should have known that.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.890
And then you've got
Christmas vacation,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.730
I forgot to tie my
shoelaces vacation,

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.659
pregnancy leave,
and even, you women

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:44.210
have to do that-- see that was
a slight attempt at a joke.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.150
And then Hanukkah, of
course, and all the holidays.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.340
By the time you're done, at
the end of the year, 365 days,

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.600
you work a minuscule
amount of days.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.790
The rest of the time is yours.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.300
So the real question is, what
are you going to do with that?

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.560
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a huge opportunity.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.860
Especially for young
people to understand

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.720
that all that time
can be used for me.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.430
To create a me business
model, me incorporated.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.960
And there's some rules
that greatly increase

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.850
your chances of
making a lot of money.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.660
Same things I did, by the way.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.115
Never put your eggs, all
your eggs in one basket.

00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:24.240
I didn't come up with that.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.930
But that's what
Wall Street does.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.180
It's called spreading the risk.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.630
Never bet all your
money on black.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.140
39 black, all my money.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.130
Win or lose.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.380
Yeah, the problem is when
you lose, you lose your ass.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.160
You lose everything.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.890
So, by the way, am I allowed
to say words like ass and shit?

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:42.390
OK.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.080
Great.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.090
Fucking great.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:51.340
And so it's a very serious
book that's a little gimmicky,

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.720
and is really designed
to help, perhaps not

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.730
you, but the masses in
understanding that every day,

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.040
they should pick up, or
go online, the Wall Street

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.690
Journal.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.440
Don't read the whole thing.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.460
Just go to the left hand
margin, and read those little--

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.550
there are two margins.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.340
One is business.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.550
One is politics and news.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.090
You'll understand something.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.860
Because they won't watch on TV.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.510
CNN now does cooking travelogue
shows and forensic science.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.550
I'm not making that up.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.910
You can't find a hard
news item anywhere.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:32.490
Fox blasts and destroys all
the other cable news agencies.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.570
Good, bad, or otherwise.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.028
Whether you agree
with them or not,

00:10:35.028 --> 00:10:37.470
it's 24 hours of that stuff.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.850
Although it may not be
to your political liking.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.280
But they're getting 4 to
6 million people on that.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.830
The nightly news,
CBS and NBC, is

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.840
getting 300,000
or 400,000 views.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.350
Bill O'Reilly can
get $6 million.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.940
The point is nobody's reading
newspapers, nobody's following

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.120
news, nobody's finding
out how to do stuff.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.260
Because it's so easy to
watch women who text and fall

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.570
over fountains in malls, dogs
that walk backwards and wear

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.190
yarmulkes.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.220
You know, it's like all
that stuff is so much more

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:10.880
interesting.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.440
And business is boring, and I
want to make it interesting.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.480
Which is why I wear leather
pants, and in the band I'm in,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.290
I wear more makeup and higher
heels than your mommy ever did.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.540
I want to make it interesting.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.490
I want to make
business interesting,

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.280
because it'll help
a lot of people.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.750
And there was an economist that
actually had a singularity,

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.580
this thought that if these
United States of America,

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.670
and therefore the
world, because we're

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.630
the biggest wasters, the
biggest spenders of everything,

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.185
if we did certain very
smart moves, which

00:11:44.185 --> 00:11:46.250
is to balance the budget
and all that stuff,

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.140
everybody could be
hypothetically rich.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.690
The definition of rich is
anything above $250,000,

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.330
says the United
States government.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.830
Which actually
it's the IRS, which

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.500
is not a part of the government.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.480
You can't sue the IRS,
designed that way.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.830
But the definition of
rich starts at $250,000.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.980
That's when you're at
the highest tax rate.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.070
And economists are telling us
that if we do certain things,

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.400
there's more than enough
money for everybody

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.670
to have their own house,
yup, without exception.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.849
With their own property, their
own estate, and all that stuff.

00:12:20.849 --> 00:12:22.390
But we're not doing
it the right way.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.700
Because it's easier to walk
by the dessert tray, which

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.580
is what I did, and keep
eating those carbs.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.910
Because they taste good,
and because they're easy.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.030
The thing that's good for
you, who dreams of spinach?

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.382
I don't.

00:12:35.382 --> 00:12:39.080
I have no idea what that meant.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.580
Your turn.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.684
I'll shut up.

00:12:40.684 --> 00:12:42.350
SCOTT SOSEBEE: So
your book could easily

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.895
inspire a single individual
to go out and build an empire.

00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:46.240
It's really inspirational.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.080
GENE SIMMONS: Me, I did it.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.538
SCOTT SOSEBEE: Did
you have a book,

00:12:48.538 --> 00:12:49.690
similar that inspired you?

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.398
GENE SIMMONS: No.

00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:53.650
No, my biggest
inspiration, actually,

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.120
was a combination of my
mother, who still to this day

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.460
doesn't speak English very well.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.640
She, at 14 years of
age, was a survivor

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.390
of Nazi Germany's
concentration camps.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.570
Came to Israel six
months after the country

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.860
became an independent state.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.880
And I was born six months
after the country was born.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.660
It was nothing.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.220
There was dirt.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.790
I never saw a toothbrush,
never saw a toilet

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.580
until I was nine years old.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.452
We had a hole outside.

00:13:27.452 --> 00:13:28.910
Excuse me, there
was nothing there.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:34.680
And through the-- sometimes I
get choked up, so pardon me.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.640
So through the eyes of my
mother, because my father,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.420
like many families, dumped us
when I was about six or seven.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.729
A shameful, shameful
reflection on men.

00:13:46.729 --> 00:13:48.020
All over the world, by the way.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.030
It's not unique to America.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.230
So at a very young age, all
of a sudden there we were.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.510
My mother had to
fend for herself.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.230
And I had no brothers and
sisters, I'm an only child.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.270
Which explains why
I talk so much.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.170
And there was a realization,
stark or otherwise,

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.070
that I couldn't depend,
even on my parents,

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.370
to get food in my mouth,
and to live and stuff.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.570
I, at a very young age, although
I couldn't verbalize it,

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.260
I knew I had to depend on me.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.150
First lesson in life.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.860
First cure, first step of
curing the entitlement age

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.640
that we live in, which is
that the masses are still

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.430
connected at the teat to the
United States government.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.420
I'm not working this week.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.330
They'll pay me a weekly
salary until I can't work.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.350
I need help with
my job, job things.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.400
I need food stamps,
you need food.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.020
So the government
will take care of it.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.540
And I don't ascribe
or prescribe to that.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.070
I don't remember what
the question was,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.270
but I wanted to answer it.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.720
SCOTT SOSEBEE: It was about you
having an inspirational book--

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.094
GENE SIMMONS: My
mother continues

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.600
to be the greatest inspiration.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.430
Which is, if you take
away all your stuff,

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.190
could you do it again,
in a different field?

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.950
See?

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.110
So I'm in a band.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.950
And I have a restaurant chain
called Rock and Brews, which

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.900
is at Los Angeles, and
Nashville, and Kansas

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.371
City, Maui, Cabo.

00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:14.870
Everywhere.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.250
It's exploding.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.810
And I own a football team.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.150
The only one in Los
Angeles called LA KISS.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.310
We're on CBS Sports,
ESPN, and all that stuff.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.310
Branding, licensing,
merchandising.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.550
KISS is celebrating
our 40th anniversary.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.920
And boy, do I look good.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.730
We continue to tour the world.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.480
I leave Friday from New
York, and go to Mexico City

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.630
where we're going to be
playing the stadium there.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.280
The day after, I go
to Phoenix to continue

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.370
with Me, Inc.
promotion and stuff.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.580
Then hop on to the Bahamas
for the KISS cruise,

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.860
where 4,000 or 5,000
crazy KISS fans

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.810
pay about five grand apiece.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.420
Let me see, that's $20
to $25 million gross.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.150
We take 70%.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.070
And then I go into a Vegas
residency-- in other words,

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.260
the band would be
enough for anybody.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.280
But I'm voracious.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.410
That's a big word
like gymnasium.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.860
I want to read everything.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.720
I want to learn
stuff I don't know,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:20.010
because the mouse
when it first starts

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.541
to learn how the
maze works, is alive.

00:16:22.541 --> 00:16:24.290
Because you don't know
where you're going,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.540
and it's the hunt, you
know, not the kill.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.820
And that's a killer
mouse that's going in,

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.910
finally gets to the cheese.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.870
Now unless, and if, that
maze continues to change,

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.630
that mouse is going
to take its time

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.700
and get fat, bloated, and lazy,
and finally get to the cheese.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.840
Because it knows
where it's going.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.370
Give me a new maze every day.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.920
I want to lose my killer
instinct, you know?

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.360
So every day, as
far as I'm concerned

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.760
should be a new Me, Inc.
New Me incorporated.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.260
Because I am the business.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.060
I am.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.400
I have an inferred
fiduciary duty to myself.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.180
I have to balance my budget.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.860
Yes, I know there are corporate
entities, and conduits,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.839
and other stuff.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:09.510
But how much I spend should be
much less than how much I make.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.150
Because remember, the
IRS is your partner.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.020
They're right in bed,
right beside you.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.910
And at the highest
tax rate, which

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.089
is not far from--
of course, you're

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:21.450
already making over
$250,000 a year.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.510
But they're going to take 50%
of your gross pretax dollars.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.160
And there's insurance, and
houses, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.000
And you're paying
with after tax money.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.890
So it costs a
fortune to survive.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.130
Never mind having kids.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.750
Raising one child,
at the lowest rate,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.530
is about $500,000 pre-tax.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.730
Which means by the
time they're 18,

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.310
you will have had to
earn a million dollars

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.610
to raise one child.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.790
Multiply that by 10.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.340
The numbers are staggering.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.620
You have to take
charge of your life.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:58.370
I do a better job at running
me, Gene Simmons Incorporated,

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.880
than the United
States government does

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.180
of taking care of America.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:06.540
We're almost $17, maybe
even $18 trillion in debt.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.814
I've never been in debt.

00:18:09.814 --> 00:18:11.480
SCOTT SOSEBEE: Speaking
of big business,

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.800
you went to school in
south Williamsburg.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.150
Have you been back recently?

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.149
GENE SIMMONS: Oh, I did
worse than school there.

00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:19.300
I went to Yeshiva.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.877
I was a Hasidic Jew.

00:18:20.877 --> 00:18:22.710
You know, Hasidim, but
I don't believe them?

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.840
Yeah.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.800
I know I don't look
like I come from Sweden,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.970
but when I first
came to America,

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.450
my mother wisely wanted to
keep me off the streets.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.230
Because in Williamsburg, it
was the Williamsburg Dragons.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.960
And it was a street
gang made up of guys,

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.110
and I never heard of Christ
or anything like that.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.160
And I started, in broken
English and stuff,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.990
at night if I stayed out
there longer than 10:00 PM,

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.080
I'd hear "Christ killer."

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.310
Never heard of
Christ, didn't know

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.680
what they were talking about.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.250
But they were
coming after me, you

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.660
know, trying to do
some harm, just because

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.940
of my religious beliefs.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.720
And I was a Jew.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.660
It wasn't popular then, it's
still not a popular thing.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.190
But by the way, it's
not popular to be

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.930
a woman, everybody picks on you.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.670
It's not popular to
be black, Hispanic.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.150
We all have our crosses to bear.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.420
So fucking what?

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.330
Get over it.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.950
Get over it.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.135
Cry over there, there's
a puddle of water,

00:19:20.135 --> 00:19:21.260
everybody takes their turn.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.259
They say I was a kid and
everybody picked on me.

00:19:23.259 --> 00:19:25.810
But you're right the
world is an unfair place.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:26.770
It's prejudiced.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.790
It's biased.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.320
He will think-- I'm a Jew.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.090
He's gay.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.270
Fuck all of you, OK?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.075
Get over it.

00:19:36.075 --> 00:19:41.160
Now of course it's tough when
you're black, gay, Jewish,

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.470
like a lot of stuff.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.300
Like then, you've
got a lot of stuff.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.560
And you can get over that too.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.750
Everybody's got their stuff.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.920
At least America
gives you a shot.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.780
In this biased,
racist world, we have

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.710
an African American president.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.680
So you can do anything.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.380
We may even have a female
president next time.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.410
So cry to your mommy.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.580
I don't really give a shit.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.040
Just get out there.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.210
You know the military's got
a great phrase-- shame on you

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.046
if you don't get up, and
be all that you can be.

00:20:12.046 --> 00:20:15.020
Could you imagine if you don't
live up to your potential?

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.350
And I guarantee you that
there's greater greatness in you

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.730
than you ever imagined.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.510
Because once upon a time,
when you were little child,

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.140
did you ever, I'm making it
up, you're making $100 grand

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:25.640
a year.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.382
Did you ever envision
more than that?

00:20:28.382 --> 00:20:29.090
AUDIENCE:Oh yeah.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.820
GENE SIMMONS: OK.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:33.987
$100 million a day.

00:20:33.987 --> 00:20:34.528
I don't know.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.380
When you were a kid,
you couldn't imagine.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.610
If I found $1 on the floor--
so perception of wealth,

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.657
and how you're doing in life
is all based on where you are,

00:20:47.657 --> 00:20:48.740
and what you can perceive.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.010
And I'm telling
you that the future

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:54.000
can be so much bigger, and
so much greater for you.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.760
And more is a good word.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.690
And aspirational is a good word.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.710
And self empowerment
is a good word.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.390
And no it's never enough, bitch.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:04.120
No, it's never.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.640
I just want enough to get by.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.517
You're a liar.

00:21:06.517 --> 00:21:08.350
You're lying to you,
and you're lying to me.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.340
And I'll prove it you.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.420
OK, I've got to stand up
for a dramatic moment.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.660
Because I also want you
to look at me, not him.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.610
OK.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.080
So for all you
hippies out there.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.380
Oh, you're all
about money, you--

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.210
That's right.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.150
I am all about money.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:27.590
Even God passes the hat.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.500
So just stay with me for second.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.840
I just want enough
money to get by in life.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.027
That's a lie.

00:21:34.027 --> 00:21:36.360
By the way, if you know anybody
who says that, make sure

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.020
they know where to get me,
because I want every dollar

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.050
you don't want.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.000
Just send it to me.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.750
So God miraculously appears to
everyone here, and to hippies,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.510
and to communists,
and to fascists,

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.750
and every-- the rich, even
appears to Zuckerberg.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.900
Though probably less.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.660
So God appears to Zuckerberg,
all way down to the poorest

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.020
person, and says, I know
what's in your pocket.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.520
I know how much
money you got there,

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.910
because after all I'm God.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.390
So I'm going to
give you a choice.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.940
One of the few times ever that
I'm going to give you choice.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.060
You can have more money in
that pocket, or less money.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.810
What would all sane
human beings say?

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.630
Rich and poor,
anywhere in the world.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.386
Pardon?

00:22:18.386 --> 00:22:19.694
AUDIENCE: More.

00:22:19.694 --> 00:22:21.900
GENE SIMMONS: See?

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.640
I'm just like you.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.760
I want more.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.650
Trust me.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.980
Zuckerberg, and Gates,
and Buffett, and everybody

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.250
gets up every day and goes to
work, because they want more.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.694
They want to get richer and
more powerful and stuff.

00:22:35.694 --> 00:22:37.110
Now the fact that
you can actually

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.050
do good with your money,
and give to charity the way

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.070
Buffett's given half and
Bill has given-- that's fine.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.960
And even if you're a fucking
rich, capitalist pig,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.620
and don't want to give a penny
to charity, the very fact

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.430
that you are rich, and build
mansions, and do whatever

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.080
you do, you're creating jobs.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.300
That's how capitalism works.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.020
You feed people, even though
you don't want to feed people.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:00.890
You create jobs.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:01.640
So that's it.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.687
I like capitalism

00:23:04.687 --> 00:23:07.020
SCOTT SOSEBEE: Is there a
point where you draw the line?

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.820
You don't really talk
about business ethics

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.560
much in the book.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.470
GENE SIMMONS: Of course.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.380
I'd like to think that there's
a vague definition of good guy.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.880
But for instance, you
know, it's relative.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.870
Here's what I mean.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:26.380
It is against, the law to
buy or sell, as an example,

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.485
Cuban cigars.

00:23:28.485 --> 00:23:29.360
It's against the law.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.520
If you do, you're a criminal,
you pay fines, you go to jail.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.590
But I don't consider
that a criminal.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.100
Because if you were
living in Cuba,

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.240
and you bought and
sold Cuban cigars,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.420
you're not hurting anybody.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:47.850
In fact are contributing to the
commerce, you don't go to jail.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.490
So there is a kind
of an ethical,

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.470
moral bad that I agree with.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:54.990
And probably with yours.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:58.340
Sort of the biblical version--
don't kill, don't steal.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.690
And by the way, in
Hebrew, you guys

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.450
misrepresented what the
original Aramaic in Hebrew says.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.230
It's not do not kill.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.290
It says, do not murder.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.380
Because if it said, do not
kill, along with, do not steal,

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.120
you couldn't have
cops and the military.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.480
Of course you can kill.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.130
You can kill all
the Nazis you want.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.360
It's OK.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.870
It says, do not murder.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.380
So I believe in
ethical, but in a sort

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:30.274
of a victim, ethical
definition of it.

00:24:30.274 --> 00:24:32.440
Because there are some gray
areas, where nobody gets

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.980
hurt, and everybody
wants to do it.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.350
As an example, my limo driver
Christo, who's a Greek,

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.990
was telling me that
when he was a kid,

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.850
they used to steal
candies from [? thing ?],

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.860
and the cops took him
down in the basement,

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.854
and beat the crap out
of them in New Jersey.

00:24:46.854 --> 00:24:49.270
Then his father came down,
beat the crap out of him again.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.810
He said, that's the
last time I did that.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.190
But, you know, we're street
kids, and we did stuff.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.160
And we're going down the
street, my guys and I,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.800
and we saw this guy come
out of a grocery store.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.270
And you know, I
held up the thing,

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.330
and he had a gun, so we ran
after him, and took the gun.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.850
And we beat the shit
out of that guy.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.080
Because we brought the
groceries back to them.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.514
And the cop car came
up, and he said to them,

00:25:12.514 --> 00:25:14.430
what do you got, what
are you doing over here?

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.830
And Christo, whose
name should be Christos

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.080
because if it's real Greek,
said this guy stole the thing,

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.800
here's the gun-- And
the cop said, I'm

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.810
going to go around
the block a few times.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.720
Let me know when you
catch the assailant.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.740
Good for that cop.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.640
Because the justice
system would-- Oh,

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.580
did somebody hurt you?

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.630
Did your father molest
you when you were a child?

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.310
Oh, here let me rehabilitate you

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:47.080
The justice system
is, hypothetically OK.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.630
I also believe in
street justice.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.789
Somebody commits a crime,
and you beat up somebody,

00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:55.330
I know it's not perfect, there
will be some innocent victims.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.500
Somebody beats up something,
before the cops get there?

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.710
Beat the shit out of that guy.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.760
Because nothing will happen
to him in the system.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.890
Don't get me started.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.770
Don't get me started.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:07.220
SCOTT SOSEBEE: So the book
is a really good roadmap

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.570
to getting rich.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.740
I want to-- you're here to
talk about the book, right?

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.290
Do you think you're
inviting people

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.450
into the rich dudes club?

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.900
This is teaching
everyone how to be rich.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.770
Do you think, like, Trump's
sitting, being like,

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.770
Gene, what are you doing?

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.460
Why are you telling
everybody how to do this?

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:21.590
GENE SIMMONS:No, no, no, no.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.090
The rich guys aren't afraid
that more people come in.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.610
Because the more
rich people come

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.060
into the rich class, the
more business you make.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.370
Look, as an example, if
I was the only rich dude

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.470
around on earth, I
couldn't get richer.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.340
Not really, I mean I'd do the
old futile English system,

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.520
where you'd give me pennies.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.140
I don't like to do that.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.360
I like the LIBOR.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.430
London International
Banking Rates,

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.190
where people are lending each
other billions and billions,

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.200
and charging each other
hundreds of millions.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.400
Yeah.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.730
The more rich people there
are, the richer you can get.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.540
And the more jobs you create.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.040
The big secret is, there's
no limit to how many people

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.200
can join the rich club.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.720
That's the big secret.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.300
Really.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.680
And something about America
prevents the culture

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.620
from looking at rich,
especially self-made rich,

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.530
as a good thing.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.310
You're suspicious of it.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.790
It's very strange to me.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.040
Because that very
pretty young lady,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.420
if she won the lottery
today, and won $100 million,

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.240
we would throw a
parade in her honor.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.190
Whoopee, you won $199 million.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.130
She didn't do a fucking
thing to earn that money.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:36.220
But she gets an interview with
you, right here at Google.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.870
You won $100 million, fantastic.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.910
If I work for it every single
day of my life, and now I'm 65,

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.460
and by the time I'm 65,
I make $100 million--

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:50.416
I have a lot more than
that, then it's suspicious.

00:27:50.416 --> 00:27:52.510
Well, what did you do
to get there and stuff?

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.070
I think that's wrong.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:58.190
I think you should praise
by the sweat of thy brow.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:00.694
If you make it, and
you worked for it,

00:28:00.694 --> 00:28:02.110
that's the parade
you should-- not

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.700
the guy that won the lottery.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.130
You didn't do anything
to deserve it.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.090
You know, all the
races that people

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.770
have won in the
Olympics, nobody just

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.180
walks across the finish line.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.770
You've got to train
the whole year,

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.060
and if you're the fastest
of the fastest, that's

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.902
the one that gets
the, yay, you win.

00:28:18.902 --> 00:28:20.360
SCOTT SOSEBEE: In
the same respect,

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.830
you were talking about
handouts, governmental handouts.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.110
What do you think about
funding for the arts?

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:26.110
Where you stand on that?

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:27.652
GENE SIMMONS: I'm
totally against it.

00:28:27.652 --> 00:28:29.568
SCOTT SOSEBEE: OK, well
you had made a comment

00:28:29.568 --> 00:28:31.950
in the press about how rock
had been murdered recently.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.950
GENE SIMMONS: Oh, but
rock is dead a long time--

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.090
rock died a long time ago.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.320
But I'm totally against
government handouts ,

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.430
and I'll tell you why.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.310
Because it takes the
power away from you.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.560
The power of the wallet.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.595
Look, WNET here in New
York, all the stations

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:52.060
that nobody watches.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.520
You know the ones.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.570
There's ballet on,
a guy is long winded

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.400
about a historical event
that happens, something.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.980
And you go right to whatever
the latest, Big Bang

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:03.880
Theory or something.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.640
That's the thing that
gets billions, millions.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.170
No, I'm against government
handouts for almost anything.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.720
Really.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.922
I like incentives.

00:29:11.922 --> 00:29:14.860
You know, I support
1,400 kids in Africa,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.414
and I have for 25 years.

00:29:17.414 --> 00:29:19.580
Clothe them, and then feed
them, and all that stuff.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.959
But you've got to
come to school.

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:23.250
If you come to school, you
can eat as much as you want,

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.640
one meal a day.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.004
Stuff your Bellies.

00:29:26.004 --> 00:29:26.670
Here's clothing.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:28.461
If you don't come to
school, you don't eat.

00:29:28.461 --> 00:29:30.230
You have to have the incentive.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.320
I ascribe and prescribe
to the micro banks,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.280
especially in Africa, where
you loan somebody money.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.530
Usually a single mother,
because the fathers,

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.110
there you go again,
run out on them.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.200
So you've got single mothers
in Africa, here's $1,000.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.840
They give the single
mother in Zimbabwe $1,000.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.680
She can then buy cows and
sheep, and changes the economy

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.560
of the system, can
support herself.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.460
Then she pays back
to that amount

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.970
to the micro bank, no interest,
and the micro bank loans

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.780
that amount again to
another deserving mother.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.920
I like that idea.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.560
Don't give them fish.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.190
Teach them how to fish, so
that you have a sense of pride.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:12.280
Charity is easy.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.560
Here's $1,000.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.060
No, no.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.330
Get the graffiti off this
building, I'll give you $1,000.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.060
Clean up the streets.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.240
You made a job.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.960
You don't have to
say thank you to me.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.830
It's a job.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:28.380
Create jobs, under
the guise of charity.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.230
And kick unions in the nuts
and make them stand over there

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.420
and be quiet.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.150
Because as far as I'm concerned,
it is the wonderful idea,

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:48.210
an ideal when we had child
labor, and the rich fat cats

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.440
really were bad guys.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:54.410
Sort of Robin Hood economics, I
used on Varney &amp; Company today.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.290
I'm totally against them.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.580
Here's why.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.180
Once upon a time, the
Sheriff of Nottingham,

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.760
and the feudal lords of
England really were bad guys.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.330
Everybody were slaves,
the literate, and so on,

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.760
and it was a feudal society.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.277
And there was no
upward mobility.

00:31:11.277 --> 00:31:13.110
They were a illiterate,
and everything else,

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.440
and only the rich, the few
rich, controlled everything.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.340
And so Robin Hood stole from
the rich, and gave to the poor.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.070
Good for Robin Hood-- then.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.070
Nowadays, the rich
are self made.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.180
They create jobs.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.000
They pay, something like,
over 50% of the taxes.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.650
5% pay the vast majority
of all taxes in America.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:34.760
The rich are good.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.870
As far as I'm concerned,
the rich are the good guys.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.490
I don't see Wall Street as evil.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.730
I see them as the people
who loan you money,

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.270
so you can have cellphones,
the infrastructure in America.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.080
Without them, you
would have chaos.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.610
Yeah, there are bad people.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:51.320
Yes, Bank of America stole
and Goldman Sachs stole.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.730
Yeah, human beings steal.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:53.800
OK.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.720
But the basic sense of it
is, Robin Hood economics,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.190
and I made that up today
on Varney &amp; Company,

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:05.060
is a bad thing, I believe.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.040
Because you're going to
punish the people who

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.700
create all the jobs.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.410
Go ahead, give them a reason
to move to Switzerland,

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.910
and take their money and
put tens of thousands

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.850
of people-- one of those
rich, fat cats leaves,

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:21.380
he takes his business with
him, and you're, fucked.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.060
Be nice to the rich.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.770
Especially if they're self made.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.780
They give you jobs.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.020
It's not a popular thing.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.590
Too bad.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:31.790
I create jobs.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:32.850
I'm rich.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.180
I create lots of jobs,
because I like that.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.059
It's a good thing.

00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:37.600
I don't want my
money to stand still,

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.160
because inflation eats it up.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.360
So I reinvested it.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.580
I create new things, and
do all that kind of stuff.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.692
That's good for everybody.

00:32:44.692 --> 00:32:48.560
Yeah, it gets quiet, you
don't like that, huh?

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.170
You like the idyllic guy, that
comes in on a white horse,

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.652
and just throws
the money around.

00:32:52.652 --> 00:32:54.110
Yeah, well that's
not going to fly.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.270
I don't believe that.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.190
I'm not a fan of that at all.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.580
So "Me, Inc."

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.830
Is how you can be the
Superman and Superwoman that's

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.655
lurking inside of you,
waiting to get out.

00:33:06.655 --> 00:33:08.030
SCOTT SOSEBEE:

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.775

00:33:09.775 --> 00:33:10.650
