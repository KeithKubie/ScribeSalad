CHAO-HUI JENNY LIU: There was a performance 
of "Farewell My Concubine" at Princeton.

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:09.966
And to our surprise tickets 
sold out in 4 days.

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.466
CHAO-HUI JENNY LIU: We're landing 19 
American students here in Shanghai

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.736
and dropping them into 
immersion Peking opera.

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:44.576
We have the actors working closely
with our students in very small groups.

00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:50.456
Each of the students learn an aria by the
traditional way of teaching line-by-line

00:00:50.456 --> 00:00:55.676
and the teacher explaining, as they go along,
what it means and then expanding on it.

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:58.566
That's part of the tradition
and that's part of the culture.

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:02.496
TERESA IRIGOYEN-LOPEZ: I had actually seen 
this company perform at Princeton last fall.

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:07.116
I really had no clue what it meant to
come here like what classes would be like.

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:08.766
It changes a lot my idea 
of what art means.

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:14.076
Like what different disciplines mean and also,
like, specifically, like, what dance means.

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:17.536
Because for me, dance was always
like a lot of movement and here

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:23.226
like even the tiniest movement is dance because
it's already combined with, your face means

00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:25.466
so much more when you're 
dancing really slowly.

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:31.076
And your eyes mean so much more when like
that is all that constitutes the dance.

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:35.256
MING WILSON: My first memory of Peking 
opera was when I was 3 and I remember

00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:39.036
on TV seeing someone dressed as a
woman with the very colorful makeup.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.236
Yesterday was actually 
a great moment for me

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:46.936
because I actually started
feeling my nasal cavity vibrating.

00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:52.316
Probably, to a normal person it's weird,
but to me it was like, wow this is --

00:01:52.316 --> 00:01:58.496
now I'm actually getting something
very close to Peking opera style.

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:07.996
SHERYL CHOW: In Western opera, they focus on 
singing but in Peking opera those gestures,

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:14.866
those dance, those movements
are integrated with the singing.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:18.456
So they are all together. While
you are singing you have

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:23.286
to remember [singing]. The
excerpt that I am working on

00:02:23.286 --> 00:02:29.596
it's a love story about 
a lady in the morning.

00:02:29.596 --> 00:02:33.916
She go out and then feed the chicken
and go back to do the needle work.

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:38.506
WILLIAM SIMON: What Peking Opera tries 
to do, like a lot of other art forms,

00:02:38.656 --> 00:02:45.806
is just tell a story really
well in its particular way.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:53.796
WENDY HELLER: It opens up the students' 
ears to imagine that this one aesthetic

00:02:53.836 --> 00:02:58.596
of what is beautiful does not necessarily 
pertain within another culture.

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:04.546
And that's an extraordinarily rich kind of
experience to have both aurally and physically.

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:07.256
SHERYL CHOW: After three weeks of practice and then
getting onto the stage and perform the piece --

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.696
it's a really great 
sense of accomplishment.

00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:10.616
WILLIAM SIMON: We want to make our teacher proud 
so we are a little nervous because of that.

00:03:10.646 --> 00:03:11.306
But, I think it went well.

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:13.076
TERESA IRIGOYEN-LOPEZ: To see, like, such an 
important Peking opera company invite us here,

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:15.296
teach us what they've been learning from so
many years, let us perform with other students

00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:16.976
and see how they actually enjoy our
performance which is really nice.
