00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:01.845
- [Instructor] In other
videos, we talk about

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:04.405
how a current flowing through a wire

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:07.395
can induce a magnetic field.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:09.252
Now what we're going to
talk about in this video

00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:11.042
is how we can go the other way.

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:13.227
How a change in a magnetic field

00:00:13.227 --> 00:00:18.063
can affect or induce a
current in a loop of wire.

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:20.794
We're gonna be going from a change,

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:25.619
change in, and actually we're
gonna focus on magnetic flux.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.452
Magnetic.

00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:29.821
Magnetic flux through a loop.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.992
Through a loop.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.100
Now we're going to see how this actually

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.890
induces a current in that loop.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.697
So, induces.

00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:42.197
Induces a current.

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:44.378
Induced current.

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:46.847
This right over here,

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.368
all right, this is my attempted
drawing a magnetic field

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:51.138
and these are the magnetic field lines.

00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:52.184
They don't look like lines

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.103
because they're all
popping out of the screen.

00:00:54.103 --> 00:00:56.944
They're moving towards
you, towards the viewer

00:00:56.944 --> 00:01:00.524
so you could view these
as the tips of the arrow.

00:01:00.524 --> 00:01:02.331
Now there's different ways
of showing magnetic fields.

00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:04.445
You could show magnetic
field lines like this,

00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:06.103
you could also use vectors.

00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:07.781
And when you're using field lines,

00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:09.703
it's the density of the field lines

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.908
tell you how strong the magnetic field is.

00:01:11.908 --> 00:01:13.234
If you got to the right here,

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:15.252
they are less dense and
so the magnetic field

00:01:15.252 --> 00:01:18.138
is less strong on the
right hand side over here

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:20.342
than they are on the left hand side,

00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:23.174
or at least that's what
I'm trying to depict.

00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:24.158
Now if we did it with vectors

00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:26.488
we would have bigger arrows
pointing out over here

00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:28.173
than we would over here.

00:01:28.173 --> 00:01:30.524
But now let's do a loop of,

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.161
let's do a loop of wire.

00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:34.645
Let me draw a loop of wire here.

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:38.540
Let's say I have a loop of wire that is,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.540
this is my loop of wire.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.812
My loop of wire.

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:46.271
If I just throw that loop of wire

00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:48.599
and if it's just stationary,
it's in this magnetic field

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.176
and the magnetic field isn't changing,

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:53.434
I do have some flux going through the,

00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:55.563
I guess you can say the
surface defined by this wire.

00:01:55.563 --> 00:01:57.868
And if you're unfamiliar
with the term magnetic flux,

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:00.722
I encourage you to watch
the video on magnetic flux.

00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:02.053
But if I just have this wire

00:02:02.053 --> 00:02:03.642
stationary in the magnetic field,

00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:05.878
nothing is going to happen.

00:02:05.878 --> 00:02:08.486
But I will be able to induce a current

00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:11.323
if I change the magnetic flux

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:14.814
going through this surface in some way.

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:16.926
So for example, right
now the magnetic field

00:02:16.926 --> 00:02:19.586
is pointing out of the screen.

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:21.508
If I were to make it even stronger

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:25.091
in the direction pointing
out of the screen.

00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:27.494
So, I guess one way to think about it is

00:02:27.494 --> 00:02:30.460
if I were to, if the change
in the magnetic field,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.295
the change in the flux
were to get even stronger

00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:34.915
in the outward direction.

00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:36.259
So I don't know, a good way to,

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.571
just gonna get even stronger
in the outward direction.

00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:40.128
I'll draw a big arrow there.

00:02:40.128 --> 00:02:41.076
I guess you could say that

00:02:41.076 --> 00:02:45.017
these things became even denser
in this outward direction.

00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:47.879
It is actually going to induce a current.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.578
And the current that it
will induce is going to go,

00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:53.402
is going to go in that direction

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:55.191
and let me draw it a little bit clearer.

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:57.588
The current is going to
go in that direction.

00:02:57.588 --> 00:03:01.562
It's going to go in a clockwise
direction around this.

00:03:01.562 --> 00:03:04.628
And that is because that
change in the magnetic flux

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:06.660
that induces a voltage,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.016
an electromotive force that
causes this current to flow.

00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:13.044
That causes the current to flow

00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:15.294
and there's other ways to
change the magnetic flux.

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:18.461
If I were to lessen the magnetic field

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:21.009
in the outward direction or another way,

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.744
if the change in the
magnetic field were inwards,

00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:25.701
then the current would
go the other direction.

00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:28.277
But the key here is when I change the flux

00:03:28.277 --> 00:03:32.359
through this surface defined by this wire,

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.295
it's going to induce a current.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:36.317
The current isn't going to
be there if the thing is,

00:03:36.317 --> 00:03:37.903
if the magnetic field is stationary

00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:41.235
and I'm not changing this loop in any way.

00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:43.730
But as soon as I change
the flux in some way,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.664
I am going to induce a current.

00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:48.224
I could also instead
of changing the field,

00:03:48.224 --> 00:03:50.724
I could actually move my coil.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.103
I could move it that way.

00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:55.293
And if I were to move it that way,

00:03:55.293 --> 00:03:58.813
the flux going through this surface

00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:01.617
or I guess coming out of
this surface will increase.

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:03.135
Because if I move this to the left,

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:05.411
the magnetic field is denser,

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.767
I guess it's stronger
so there'll be more flux

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:08.965
through this area here.

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:10.295
So, if you move it that way,

00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:12.100
you also would have a current like this.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.634
Now if you moved it the other way,

00:04:13.634 --> 00:04:16.188
if it was on the left hand
side and you moved it that way,

00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:17.809
it would also induce a current

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:19.656
but now since the flux is lessening

00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:20.834
in the outward direction,

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.132
the current would go in the other way.

00:04:23.132 --> 00:04:24.537
Now there's other ways to change the flux.

00:04:24.537 --> 00:04:28.176
You could actually change
the area of this actual loop

00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:29.634
if somehow it was made out of some

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:33.432
maybe stretchy, stretchy wire somehow.

00:04:33.432 --> 00:04:35.969
If you increased its,

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.505
if you would increase.

00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:39.588
Let me draw it this way.

00:04:39.588 --> 00:04:42.838
If you were somehow able to stretch it.

00:04:44.276 --> 00:04:47.032
Stretch it so it contains,

00:04:47.032 --> 00:04:50.206
so the actual area increases.

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.669
If you were able to stretch it out

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.191
so that the actual area increases

00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:55.048
which would cause the flux in the

00:04:55.048 --> 00:04:57.604
out of the screen direction
to increase even more,

00:04:57.604 --> 00:04:59.752
that also would induce,

00:04:59.752 --> 00:05:02.125
that also would induce the current.

00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:06.498
And so this whole idea of
a change in magnetic flux

00:05:06.498 --> 00:05:09.383
inducing a current, this is the essence

00:05:09.383 --> 00:05:11.636
and we'll go deeper into
it in future videos,

00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:14.719
this is the essence of Faraday's Law.

00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:16.484
Faraday's,

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.218
Faraday's Law.

00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:23.668
And we'll quantify this
more in future videos

00:05:23.668 --> 00:05:27.640
but it's just the notion
that if I have a loop of wire

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.780
and I have a changing magnetic flux

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.425
through the loop of wire,

00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:35.342
that is going to induce
a current in that wire.
