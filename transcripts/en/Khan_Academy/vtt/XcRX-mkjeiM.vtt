00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.840
Dennis is vacationing
in China and wants

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.530
to spend $30 on a new sweater.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.220
The sweater he likes
costs 197 Chinese yuan .

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.540
One US dollar can be
converted into 6 Chinese yuan.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.262
Dennis will have blank Chinese
yuan if he converts his $30.

00:00:19.262 --> 00:00:20.470
Well, let's think about this.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.660
He's going to take $30,
and the conversion rate

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.010
is 6 yuan per dollar.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.970
So he's going to have $30
times 6 yuan per dollar.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.439
So he's going to
have 30 times 6 yuan.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.970
And 30 times 6, well, that's the
same thing as 3 times 6 times

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.470
10, or 180.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.570
So he's going to have
a 180 Chinese yuan.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.910
Now does he have enough
money to buy the sweater?

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.360
Well, the sweater cost 197 yuan.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.460
So no, he does not have enough
money to buy the sweater.
