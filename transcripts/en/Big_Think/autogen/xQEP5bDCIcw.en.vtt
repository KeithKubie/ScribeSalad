even the Boston Herald because the
 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.020
even the Boston Herald because the
National Enquirer was all about telling

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030

has maintained the very consistent and
strong support from his Republican base

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410
strong support from his Republican base
 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.950
strong support from his Republican base
that he has is because he has been quite

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960
that he has is because he has been quite
 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.850
that he has is because he has been quite
consistent in trying to implement many

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860
consistent in trying to implement many
 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.430
consistent in trying to implement many
if not almost all of his campaign

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440
if not almost all of his campaign
 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.590
if not almost all of his campaign
promises no matter how well or badly

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600

that would work out for him so for
 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.370
that would work out for him so for
example he wants to build a wall I think

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850
most people that understand policy
 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.310

money on defense or else has been much

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900
money on defense or else has been much
 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.110
money on defense or else has been much
harder than we've seen from previous

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120
harder than we've seen from previous
 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.270
harder than we've seen from previous
presidents so I'm not suggesting that

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280

work so far I would say the jury is very
much out and initial results are

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410
much out and initial results are
 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.510
much out and initial results are
extremely mixed but I do believe that if

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520
extremely mixed but I do believe that if
 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.300
extremely mixed but I do believe that if
