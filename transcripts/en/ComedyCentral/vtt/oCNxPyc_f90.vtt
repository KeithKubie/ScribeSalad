- Hey, c'mon in.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:17.384

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.154

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.856

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.292
- Great to see ya buddy!

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:27.527
- Good to see you.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.728
- Making a protein
shake, I'm outta ice

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.964
I gotta run down
to the ice machine.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.133
- Oh, okay, sure let's go.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.937
I think you got enough,
I think you got enough.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.073
There's a, I think there's a...

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:40.907
I think

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.677
- Got our ice.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.913
Let's go make some protein.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.315
We've got the ice.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.884
We got the protein powder.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.353 line:0%
We got all the ingredients
because I'm a healthy guy

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.055
and you gotta get
the ingredients.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.189
So you a banana guy?

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.290
Are you a strawberry guy?

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.258
You a carrot guy?

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.225
- Can I eat this one?

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.393
- Yeah if you're willing to.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.562 align:start size:88% position:13%
Healthy. You're
vision's getting better.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.165
I'm becoming attractive.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.599
Alright so we've
got some carrots,

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.001 align:start size:94% position:6%
what do you think we
should put in there next?

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.202
- One of these bananas?

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.370 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You peel one,
I'll peel the other.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.404
- Okay.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.639
- And I go like that.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.208
- You know I actually
peel 'em from the side.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.042
- You peel from that?

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:16.876
- Yeah.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:17.811
- Why is that?

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.379
- 'Cause this is a handle.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.347 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you peel it from
this side, guess what?

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.550 align:start size:97% position:3%
You get more of the banana
and you have a way to hold it.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.685 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But how do you,
wait but how do you--

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:26.519
- You can't do it--

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.887
- Now it's like corn.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.089
- That's true.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.622
- Just throw the
peel on the ground.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:30.557
- Okay.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.558
- Just throw it on the ground.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.026
See ya later.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:34.694
Somebody's gonna slip on
it and it's gonna be funny.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:36.696 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's why Comedy
Central wants to do that.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.530
I'm gonna drop in.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.364
- Okay

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.499
- Drop in.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.333
- Some soy milk.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.634
- Soy milk.

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:42.702
Let's just do a little,
tell me when, say when.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:43.903
- And done.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.138 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Brody] And
done. Strawberries.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:46.106 align:start size:84% position:16%
- All of 'em, gotta
put all of 'em.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.073
- Dump 'em all in.

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.441
Three, two, one, they're in.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.943
Somebody toss me an orange.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:50.910
- Orange!

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.579
- Bingo! Orange, there ya go.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.713
I'm not sure how to peel that.

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:55.348
- Neither am I.

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:56.883
- You're taking a risk.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.818
I'm gonna do one and a half
scoops of protein powder.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:02.522
There's the protein, that
is muscle development.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.756
- Get on the ground.

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.358
- Get down on the
ground orange peel.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:07.961 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So this is not an
orange, like a nectarine?

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.462
- I put the wrong cap,
you know what's funny?

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:13.566
I just took the blender cap
and put it on the protein.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.704
It's crazy!

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:18.538
- It's very crazy.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:19.906
- It's crazy. Okay.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:20.840
- Alright.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.574
- Oh, you know what we forgot?

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:22.509
- What?

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.510
- Ice. I mean, why did we go,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.011
- That's true.

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.747
- Why did we go, I mean
we did a whole ice thing.

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.249
I'm gonna let you do the ice.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.150
- You tell me when on the ice.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.584
- Okay.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.019
That's great.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.922 align:start size:97% position:3%
Okay, so Baron tell me a
little about, are you excited?

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:36.956
You're doing your special here?

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.158
- I'm so excited man--

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:42.162 align:start size:81% position:19%
(blender noise
drowns out speech)

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:47.934
when you have like, depression.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:48.902
- Exactly.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.136
- I mean I have material--

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:53.806 align:start size:81% position:19%
(blender noise
drowns out speech)

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.516 align:start size:97% position:3%
so that way I can say things
like, "mothersmurfer."

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.617
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:05.552
- Yeah.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.986
- Okay I can't quite get the...

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.555
- Is there a thing?

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:09.789 align:start size:94% position:6%
Okay, yeah, you just gotta
pour the whole thing.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.291
- Yeah, we're gonna
pour the whole thing.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.227
- Okay, here we go, boom! Ha ha!

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.094
- Look at the thickness.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.196
- That looks great.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.397
- Okay if you can help me out.

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:18.364
Team work.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.199
- Team work.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.033
- Team work.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.501

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:22.368
Yes!

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.803
- Yes! You got it!

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:26.005

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:26.873
- Boom.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:27.807
- All those things.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:28.708
You know, let's do a toast.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.642
- Do a toast.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:30.944
