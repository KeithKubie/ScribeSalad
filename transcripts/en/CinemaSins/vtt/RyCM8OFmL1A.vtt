You know, I was with you on the sins videos
until The Hobbit.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.830
What?
That one was bullsh*t.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.869
So The Hobbit is where you draw the line?
You were fine with all the other videos I

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.859
made but The Hobbit was so drastically different
that you can’t stand it?

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.730
Dude you completely ignored the book.
Exactly. Are we going to have this conversation

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.180
again?
Well, we didn’t even have a conversation

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:35.000
last time. Mostly it was, generally, just
you being a dick. Or, I would say, a f*cktard.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.770
Hey, f*cktard is offensive. The proper term
is “Caucasian American.”

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.850
Dude, I mean, “It was in a hole in the ground?”
And you complain about that as a sin? What’s

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.350
next? A Tale of Two Cities? “It was the
best of times, it was the worst of times,”

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.070
Ding!
Is there some movie version of Tale of Two

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.920
Cities that I should be aware of?
Or 1984? It was a bright cold April morning,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.340
and the clocks were striking thirteen.”
What kind of f*cking stupid clock strikes

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.760
thirteen? Ding!
I wouldn’t say that.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.520
Why not?
The Shepherd Gate clock outside of the Royal

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.640
Observatory in Greenwich strikes thirteen.
It strikes thirteen every day. It’s got

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.640
roman numerals zero through 23.
So if you were to go there, I assume you would

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.149
confuse 12 o’clock and 7 o’clock?
That again!? How am I supposed to know Final

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.810
Fantasy had 14 f*cking games?!
You don’t have to know that! All you need

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.490
to know is that if the Roman numeral starts
with “X”, “7” should be the furthest

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.529
thing from your mind, and also you should
never see a movie that has that Roman numeral.

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:39.120
I thought Malcon 10 was pretty good. I didn’t
see the first 9 but that one was pretty amazing.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.880
How do you know about the Shepherd Gate clock,
but you don’t know about the first line

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.509
of The Hobbit? How is that possible?
I knew the line was from the Hobbit book.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.899
I knew it before I made the video.
Dude the point is not that they used the line

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.459
from the book. In movie world, they set it
up as though The Hobbit book that we know

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.049
is something that Bilbo wrote to Frodo. Which
is fine. That’s cool. I get that. But then

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.959
don’t go pull the first line of the book
that says “It began in a hole in the ground,”

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.360
because f*cking Frodo knows it began in a
hole in the ground.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.099
I also knew why the eagles didn’t take them
all the way to Lonely Mountain.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.370
Wasn’t explained in the movie, though.
What?

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.629
Personally I think it’s kind of Caucasian-American
of them to not explain it in the movie. As

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.200
it is, it just seems like Gandalf can summon
the eagles whenever he needs them, and that

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.569
the eagles are just bad at geography.
Said the guy who said, “Idaho is not a real

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.560
place.”
I just call it “Southwest Montana,” man.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.020
If the locals want to call it something different,
they’re more than welcome to. That’s their

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.670
prerogative.
You might be more of an asshole than Bobby

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.819
Brown.
Dude. Alright. Give me a goal. Give me a goal

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.069
post.
Do I have to?

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.900
Oh, crap. Give me a goal post.
I’m giving you—

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900
(glass breaking)
It’s good!

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.900
Give me another goal post.
No.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.540
Come on.
No, I’m not doing it.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.829
It’s no fun to kick without a goal post!
Well, you’re gonna have to get used to disappointment.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.910
I’m gonna kick it anyway.
Don’t kick that thing at me.
