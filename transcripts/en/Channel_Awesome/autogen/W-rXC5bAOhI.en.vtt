00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much her voice it's a little
 

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.050 align:start position:0%
pretty much her voice it's a little
higher<00:21:37.330><c> pitch</c><00:21:37.750><c> but</c><00:21:38.380><c> that</c><00:21:38.440><c> is</c><00:21:38.740><c> her</c><00:21:38.920><c> voice</c><00:21:39.160><c> so</c><00:21:39.910><c> it</c>

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:40.060 align:start position:0%
higher pitch but that is her voice so it
 

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.850 align:start position:0%
higher pitch but that is her voice so it
is<00:21:40.150><c> funny</c><00:21:40.330><c> that</c><00:21:40.450><c> we</c><00:21:40.510><c> were</c><00:21:40.600><c> talking</c><00:21:40.990><c> about</c><00:21:41.050><c> you</c>
