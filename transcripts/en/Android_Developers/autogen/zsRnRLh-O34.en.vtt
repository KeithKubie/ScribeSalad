on your page using touch so we should

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820
on your page using touch so we should

for the focus sequence to traverse your
 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.530
for the focus sequence to traverse your
pages another optimization tip is to

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540
pages another optimization tip is to
 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.600
pages another optimization tip is to
actually change your layout to be more

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610
actually change your layout to be more
 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.880

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430
tablets have already adapted to this
 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.170
tablets have already adapted to this
approach but again the idea here is to

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180
approach but again the idea here is to
 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.020
approach but again the idea here is to
minimize number of key prices user 1

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030
minimize number of key prices user 1
 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.670

in a non touch UI in this case you can

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070
in a non touch UI in this case you can
 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.120
in a non touch UI in this case you can
jump forward in the tabs by traversing

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130

has made a lot of improvements

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520
has made a lot of improvements
 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.390
has made a lot of improvements
in the last release to support d-pad and

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400
in the last release to support d-pad and
 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.029
in the last release to support d-pad and
as you see here in a second so now I've

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039
as you see here in a second so now I've
 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.600
as you see here in a second so now I've
switched to a USB keyboard and you can

through out the app by changing the

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520
through out the app by changing the
 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.960
through out the app by changing the
focus on the top and selecting a content

so the movie started so Escape key would

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900
so the movie started so Escape key would
 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.260
