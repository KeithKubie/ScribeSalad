00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.400
We'll illustrate
the distinction between P and

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.120
NP by trying to analyze a world
of friends and enemies.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.390
By the way, Lance gets credit for
this example.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.940
His daughters were the right age for
the Twilight movie when it came out.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.210
Everyone in this world is
either a friend or an enemy.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.930
And we'll represent this by drawing
an edge between all the friends like so.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.490
Given all this information,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.570
there are several types of analysis
that you might want to do.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.660
Some easier and some harder.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.540
For instance,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.260
if you wanted to run a dating service,
you'd be in pretty good shape.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.720
Say that you wanted to maximize the
number of matches that you could make

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.290
and enhance the number
of happy customers.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.220
Or perhaps you just want to know if
it's possible to get everyone a date.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.560
Well, we have efficient algorithms for
finding matching,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.320
and we'll see some in a future lesson.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.840
Here in this example,
it's possible to match everyone up, and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.480
such a matching is fairly easy to find.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.990
Contrast this with the problem
of identifying cliques.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.300
By clique I mean a set of people who
are all friends with each other.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.570
For instance,
here is a clique of size three.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.870
Every pair of members
has an edge between.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.400
And cliques of that size
aren't too hard to find.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.450
As we look for larger cliques, however,
the problem becomes harder and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.160
harder to solve.
