1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
[inaudible] you probably watch,

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:10,410
listen to or at the very least heard about
Joe Rogan's interview with tech giant

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,000
Elon Musk from last week.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,990
Joe and Alan had a wide ranging
discussion for two and a half hours about

5
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:17,640
evolution,
technology,

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:21,990
market simulation theory and much more
immediately after though the headlines

7
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,040
were all about the blunt that they smoked
in the last 20 minutes along with the

8
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,130
very memorable image of Alon
with smoke surrounding his head.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,490
Shortly after aligns Rogan interview
aired two topic Tesla executives resigned

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:39,630
and Tesla stock dropped significantly.
The usual suspects wrote, think pieces,

11
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:44,070
questioning whether Musk was mentally
stable or fit to be an executive at the

12
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:45,960
very company he created.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,920
I think the majority of people found
the whole ordeal to be kind of funny and

14
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:53,940
Quirky. You know, like a surprising moment
that makes life kind of interesting,

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,320
but apparently these days if
you do anything that doesn't
conform to group thing,

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,640
there's a media click machine that'll
see blood and is waiting to strike.

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,380
Now first off, we'd is totally,
completely 100% legal here in California.

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,400
I'm guessing that you person watching
this right now have probably tried it once

19
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,070
or twice yourself,
maybe even inhaled,

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,840
but perhaps more importantly than legal
issue or whether marijuana has health

21
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:22,460
benefits, impairs your judgment
or all of the above lies.

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,400
A more important question,
Alon Musk may be a little nutty,

23
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:31,401
but is unquestionably one of the most
important visionaries we have today beyond

24
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:36,690
Tesla, his electric car company, which
is revolutionize the automobile industry.

25
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,630
He's also the founder and CEO of space x,

26
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:44,631
which is sending rockets beyond Earth's
orbit and will most likely make life on

27
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:48,450
Mars a reality within our lifetime.
If that's not enough.

28
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:53,220
His ironically named boring company is
building tunnels under Los Angeles and an

29
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:57,750
attempt to relieve Las infamously
insane traffic. In short,

30
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,600
alon isn't just changing
the world for the better.

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,580
He's creating the reality of a future
that most people can only dream of.

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,890
While the Alon marijuana memes were great,

33
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:12,150
they overshadow the conversation with
one of the few modern visionaries we have

34
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:16,620
left. As Tesla employees stepped down
or traders worry about Musk's behavior.

35
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:19,950
Perhaps it's just this
adventure is attitude,

36
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:23,880
which allows Musk to solve problems.
While most people just complain,

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,500
think the automobile industry is moving
on electric cars to slowly create Tesla.

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,520
Think NASA is in exploring space
fast enough, start space x.

39
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,800
While we all talk a few people
actually do, and for those who do,

40
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:41,610
maybe being different isn't a flaw in
the system. It's part of the design.

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,710
Since when do we live in a time when
our geniuses can't have idiosyncratic

42
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,540
quirks or act out in ways that make
them stand apart from the rest of us are

43
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,860
inventors need the room to be different
because that different way of thinking

44
00:02:55,861 --> 00:03:00,640
is where they find the spark that ignites
their genius. With all this in mind,

45
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:04,150
let's shift to the very company
which put a line on the map.

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,390
He cocreated paypal alongside another
misunderstood tech giant Peter Teal Teal.

47
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,970
The guy on the left in this picture is
an entrepreneur, venture capitalists,

48
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:17,380
philanthropist, author, and my
guest on the Rubin report this week.

49
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,400
Perhaps even more than MUSC. Teal
seems to be misunderstood by the media,

50
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:26,050
which seems more interested in him
as a caricature than as a person.

51
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,370
Over the last two years,

52
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:31,060
I've become friends with Peter through
his friend and my friend and confidant,

53
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:35,230
Eric Weinstein. I know Peter to
be an open, decent, thoughtful,

54
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,370
curious person.

55
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:40,780
Someone who privately is all of the
things that the media says he is not,

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,220
and that's the person I hope to introduce
you to today. Beyond founding paypal,

57
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:50,221
teal was also the first outside investor
in Facebook who turned $500,000 into

58
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:55,210
considerably more than that.
He also funded Hulk Hogan's lawsuit,

59
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:58,360
which ultimately toppled
Gawker, uh, move many things,

60
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:59,890
was an attack against the media,

61
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:04,180
but I believe to be a seminal moment
in defense of the fourth amendment,

62
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,400
which defended our right to privacy.

63
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,260
Peter has become the ultimate contrarian
in the tech world of Silicon Valley,

64
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,570
which has become stagnant and dull.

65
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,440
When's the last time you were really
excited about a new APP for your phone?

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
Remember when there was a new app
every day that you just had to have?

67
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,360
Those days seem to be long gone
and Peter sees a reason for it.

68
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,490
He has long talked about the dangers of
group think and Foad diversity to have

69
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:34,720
the idea destroying forces which
have taken over the tech world.

70
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,020
That's exactly why his recent move
from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles has

71
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,950
happened. Yeah, that's right.

72
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,040
La is suddenly becoming a home of free
thought thanks to the creatively crushing

73
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,650
progressive orthodoxy that
has taken over Silicon Valley.

74
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,420
We live in strange times.
Indeed.

75
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,380
Peter was also the person with the highest
profile in the tech world to support

76
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:00,130
Donald Trump for president and even spoke
at the Republican National Convention

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,970
when he told a room full of Republicans
that he was proud to be gay.

78
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,260
He received a thunderous round of
applause and I remember thinking how that

79
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:13,240
moment was a powerful shift in the
democratic lock on Gay Americans and the

80
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:17,490
beginning of a new, perhaps more
tolerant Republican party deal.

81
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,500
I had no idea if he was going to
get booed or cheered at that moment,

82
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:25,060
but I believe that the new libertarian
view the Republican party has taken on

83
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:29,800
marriage equality is in large part
because Peter Dare to stand up for what he

84
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:30,670
believed in,

85
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,500
even if it was against
conservative orthodoxy with
so much in flux in the world

86
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:35,951
right now,

87
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:40,030
people like Alon and Peter have more of
a chance to shape the future than ever

88
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:43,090
before.
As old institutions continue to crumble,

89
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:47,080
we need new visionaries to build
us the institutions of the future.

90
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,630
If they're quirky or misunderstood,

91
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,500
then they're probably exactly the
people we need to get the job done.
