Speaker 1:          00:01          The general Hogan experience. So you're, you're 100% in on ghosts. I am now. Tell me about why you're 100% in on Sasquatch cause that that one is a, that's more puzzling to me. Well, just, uh, that it's, it's a, again, a Gabriel Reese's, uh, story was quite convincing. Jeff Meldrum his research like in missing, I would have talked to her about [inaudible]. Belgium told me he cut his finger off. He said if he could find out if Sasquatch is really take a pinky off. I said, if you cut your finger off to know that Sasquatch is real, would you do it? He goes, which finger? I'm like, your pinky. Well, he's got casts. He's got hair. I'm going to Jamie, Jeff Meldrum, M. E. L. D. R. U. N. D. he used to be, it's in my room. He was a, he's a, you know, he's a paleontological scientist at the university of South Dakota, but he can also be a silly man sometimes you study things, you memorize them, you pass a test, but you still silly well lit.

Speaker 1:          00:56          But you talked to him. Did you think? Did you feel he was a w? You know, I open up my finger for nobody, man. I ain't giving up a finger to find out if Sasquatch is real. That's crazy. You know, he's pretty devoted to it. But, um, it's been, you know, Yeti the yak and Yeti story and all the Yeti story and just the round the world. Uh, just the, um, the sightings that that people have had. Um, I read a book, well, it was a book called a diary in Alaska, housewife. It was about a woman. She wrote it, she, uh, left, uh, in the 70s to move from Kansas to Alaska. And her husband worked on the pipeline and she tells a story one afternoon when she was at her, you know, uh, her window in the kitchen and she went outside into the garden.

Speaker 1:          01:44          So she felt, saw something went outside and she smelled this really strong, strong musky, musky odor. And she saw this big, huge shape at the corner of her garden. Kind of disappear into the woods. And I dunno, bear grizzly [inaudible], who knows. Sure. Yeah. How about town? Where are you on trooper Cobre? Not at all. I think it's nonsense. I think it's a coyotes with mange. Yeah, I'm convinced. Yeah. Okay. I mean, they've, they've captured coyotes with mains. It look like demons. How about moth? Man, that's a neat story. Listen, let's go back to big foot. Let's not, you don't believe that these kids think they're full of shit. Let's go back to the moth man. Prophecies. The, the bridge collapsing holes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm not, I'm not gonna sit here and argue on behalf of moth man, but it's an intriguing story because when you have multiple witnesses, like as far as the UFO, I will go back to a good foot. But the, the aerial encounter, the, the school children at the aerial, a school in, in Zimbabwe, in the, uh, in the 90s. You know the story, John Mack was working on it. No two beings landed in two different craft and they encountered these schoolchildren all in elementary school and now they've come back and they're interviewing them now in their adult time. And it's amazing how their stories synchronize. Why would all of them inspire to make something up? Okay. We deal with two different things and the moth mountain, there were four really credible kids there that

Speaker 2:          03:06          man, the UFO thing is less preposterous than anything because we are currently sending spaceships into orbit. We are currently sending probes to Mars. We are, we're involved, deeply involved in the exploration of our solar system, at least with these robots and drones and things that we can control that that all, all that makes 100% sense to me. Big foot is interesting to me because there was a creature called gigantic [inaudible]. It was an enormous primate that was a, without a doubt lived it. It's a real thing. It was a bipedal hominid. They think it was between eight and perhaps even 10 feet tall. It was a huge apelike creature and it went extinct and the reason why they found it is because there was an apothecary shop, I believe it was in the 1920s an anthropologist found a tooth in its apothecary shop in China. He talked to the people. Where'd you find this? He recognized it as a primate tooth. They brought him to the site where they found it and then they started finding other pieces. They found bones that re that seemed to indicate that this thing was by Peatal. And this is something that's accepted in the paleontological paleontological record. This is like when anthropologists look at the history of primates, when they look at the, they think this is a widely accepted real animal. So

Speaker 1:          04:32          why? Why wouldn't it was real? Why? What's the, why did it, why do you say that? It couldn't have survived and uh, and, and beyond extinction and, and, and exist today in some form. We don't know. There's no evidence that's compelling. Just like there's no illness fake. They think they pretty much the film is fake. The Patterson footage. Yeah. That's for shit. I say it's fake. Here's the thing. If it looks like a man in a suit, no animal looks like a man in a suit. There's not a fucking single current kangaroo out there. Does that kinda person kangaroo suit? I just, I just think Gabriel story, Belle drums research, the book that I read of the woman's Gabrielle Risa story, she was in the camping up there in one of those Northern States, Washington, and I believe she has video footage of him shaking, shaking, shaking, the shaking, the shaking, the motor home that they were in. Yeah. She was quite excited to tell me the story and, and uh, quite vivid about it. She said that it was, it was scary. It was scary. If there was a small popular look, try finding a Wolverine, you know, try finding RA RA or a super one of these super sloths and the South American jungle. Now these big slots, well,

Speaker 2:          05:45          there's one, there's one scientist that has literally risked his reputation and he's, his whole fucking credibility is in demise because he decided that he was going to spend his life looking for giant sloths.

Speaker 1:          05:58          And these indigenous people have pointed them in the right direction and they've recognized that there's, you know, there's dung that seems to be sloppy, dung that they've found and they're trying to point him towards where these things are. And the giant sloths was a real creature, but there's no real evidence that the giant swath is currently alive. But the, the thing is the vast wilderness of the Amazon rain forest is so impenetrable. It will be like trying to walk across the earth and make a good audit of all the creatures that are on it. You're not going to run into them. And you know, we many species are dying on this planet right now for dirt, various reasons, but there are many that are being discovered, we never even knew about before. And you know, the Northwestern forests are pretty impeditive triple to the Washington for us.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Interesting. You said the location of the area where if the thing crossed the Bering land bridge and it came into the United States, that's exactly where it would be. It would be in that Pacific Northwest because that's, you know, as you walked down from Alaska and we've heard the stories of loggers going in there and seeing them more, sensing them or because they're being driven out of their environment, hostile accident logging companies that they think have been perpetrated by, uh, by, you know, those, uh, by the Sasquatch. Nobody wants to believe in Bigfoot more than me. I work, I worked up in, uh, in the Northwest territories. I was a flex track, uh, assistant mechanic on crawlers and I was a road surveyor when I was a kid. I worked for the department of public works and we were up there and along the [inaudible] river I had less river where explorers would go in and they'd find their heads and then never come back.

Speaker 1:          07:32          That can of big foot heads. No, no, no good though. Human heads, human hair, the headless Valley, the headless river, no honey river in a H and I, but when I went up there and was with the survey people, there had been guys who've been up there, you know, uh, you know, years before me. And they, and they said that Sasquatch was a common thing that was spoken about among the natives and among the survey crews up there. Do you ever see the Bobcat Goldthwait movie Willow Creek? No. Outstanding movie. Cat Goldthwait made a horror movie about Bigfoot Bobcat Goldthwait. The comedian made excellent horror movies that, Oh my God, that's like fire in the sky. Thought good depiction. You would love it. Oh, I will love it. It's about a bunch of people that go up there to try to replicate the Patterson Bigfoot film sort of as a Lark.

Speaker 1:          08:16          Oh, they go up there for fun and they encounter a real Sasquatch. So Willow Creek, it's called. Yes, it's really good. I love that. I love that. That spread is a 100% believer. He believes he and I've had some ridiculous conversations about it. It'd be nice to go and and go into the intense woods up there and maybe camp for a weekend look, man DOE, to see something like that, a bipedal hominid that is avoided detection for hundreds, if not thousands of years. It'd be amazing. But they spoke from native Americans as native Americans had more than a hundred different names between all the various tribes. 100 different names for Sasquatch. I really, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, ma was one of them.

Speaker 2:          08:56          You know that you saw that American werewolf in London thing that is, uh, the, the guy who created that Pat, uh, Rob Baker? No, no, that's Rick Baker. Baker. I'm sorry. Yeah. Pat McGee, who's the special effects guy, created the one for me, but Rick Baker designed it originally, but he made a, Pat McGee made a movie called OMOP, what was it called? Omar primal scream CV. But it's basically a horror movie about Sasquatch and you know, it's, it's incredibly compelling to people. This is enormous. Primates, it's been avoiding detection living in the forest among the indigenous people say that they, they sometimes grab children and take them. I think that's because it used to be a real thing. That's what I think. I think that's because if, if we all agree in scientists agree that this gigantic Pythius was a real thing, if that is the case, then it's entirely possible that one point at one point in time, human beings were in direct contact with them on a regular basis, and those stories been passed down through generation after generation.

Speaker 2:          09:57          The real question is, are they still here? Because the people that are telling you these stories, like when we talk about, uh, people in North America, it's widely accepted that most native Americans, they share a lot of genetics with people from Siberia because Siberia is what's close to the Bering land bridge. They come down, these people eventually, many, many, many, many, many thousands of years migrated into America and they have, so those are people that would have been in contact 100,000, whatever years ago if they don't know. They know that these teeth that they found from judge [inaudible] indicate that at the, at least a hundred thousand years ago, they were alive. Does that mean they were alive 50,000 years ago? Very possibly fit like a homo floresiensis. You know that the Hobbit person that you found this tiny little thing on the Flores Island, that thing they didn't even know that was real until the two thousands and that thing existed as recently as, I think it was 13 or 14,000 years ago, which is incredibly recent.

Speaker 2:          11:02          And this is a completely new discovery that people found that there was a totally different species of human being that was very small, Lou, the Chimp size brain, but it was human. It used tools and it lived amongst humans. So this thing, if they know it lived a hundred thousand years ago, it could have easily live 50, it might have lived 20, so it lived 20,000 years ago. Today. We just know way they're going fine. Yeah. But there's, there's no evidence of mammoths either, right? We know they were real, but there's no, like if someone said I saw a mammoth, you'd be like, where do you have a picture? No, no, no. But I sensed it the fuck out of here with your sensing mammas I think if you did, if you put an Mt. Mt. At a horrible avatar style military. Uh, uh, let's say incursion into some of the deep woods of

Speaker 1:          11:54          Northwest America. You might, you might get traces, but coming down, what a horrible thing that would beat it to do. Excellent thing. We get footage. I know, but then you're destroying. That's a Pat McGee's version of a great, yeah, it's like kind of look grouped and yeah. Wow. That's just a weird picture. No, that's beautiful. It's called primal rage. A neat, neat look at the um, the animatronics. Yeah. You see the, that face right there, Jim? Yeah. When's that coming out or is it that out? Okay. Now for quite a while, primal rage and, and from Willow Creek, the Creek is really interesting cause Willow Creek is like Blair witch style. It's all like found footage. Like the whole thing, like the, okay, here we are, we're in the woods. You know, like that kind of shit. It's really Bobcat's a genius is, he did a great job with it.

Speaker 1:          12:44          He's really good. It's like compelling. It's exciting. And even if I don't believe in Bigfoot or don't, don't believe it's currently alive, just I know too many people that are in the woods all the time. I know too many people that are hunters that are in the woods, that haven't seen weeks and weeks in the woods. And none of them I've seen shit. They see bears walking on two feet though. That's really normal. And when you're in thick, dense forests, bears walking on two feet and you see him in the dusk. Oh my God, I saw big foot. I'm convinced. And then you really are convinced. So then you go back and tell everybody. Yeah, I think, you know, basically just each individual as to make their own minds up about all of this stuff. And if you want to believe it's just like your religion, you know, I believe in mediumship.

Speaker 1:          13:28          I believe in the afterlife I have of our consciousness and that's kind of my religion. And who's to say, why should I be disputed on that? You know, I'm glad you believe. I'm glad there's people I don't, I'm glad there's intelligent people that believe in silly shit. Well, you know, look, uh, you know, many people live in the Virgin Mary cause Kathlyn and that's quite a myth and many believe in the angel Moroni and the golden plates and the magic spectacles and, and many believe in Zeno, you know, the Scientologists believe. So I'm not going to go and say, Hey, Oh, I dispute your belief. There were no golden spectacles or there were no gold and no, there was no Zeno, no, there was no Virgin Mary. No. I respect people's belief and they realize that's what you believe and that's what helps you, you know? And I, I would never dispute that.

Speaker 1:          14:13          And likewise, I, I want to be respected for my belief in spiritualism and mediumship. And so there's a religion and skepticism as well. I think there's this, there's a, and I respect that Gulf war. Yeah. But there's, you know what I'm saying? That there's a tendency to just try to dismiss everything as being, as believe the official story of every single thing. I know why that's good. Because that empirical view will be able to sort out the fake stuff, the Hoke stuff from the real stuff. If people have real scientific minds and real, you know, inquests they're going into it. That's what's gonna. That's what's gonna sort out what's real and what isn't.

Speaker 3:          14:59          [inaudible].
