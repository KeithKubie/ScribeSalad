00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
Do you think you’re middle class?

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.070
If you’re American, there’s a pretty good
chance that you do.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:10.590
In a survey conducted by the Pew Research
Center in 2015, 87% of those surveyed identified
themselves as middle class.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.520
That’s a pretty big middle.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:19.560
But your intuition about what the middle class is –
like who it includes, and what constitutes a middle
class lifestyle – probably isn’t the full picture.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.820
And a lot of questions that sociologists try to
answer are questions just like this – questions that
you think you know the answer to already.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.300
Many a person has played the armchair
sociologist at some point in their lives –

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.940
spouting off about how they think “Society
Really Works” because of their own experience.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.460
Or the experience of their friend’s brother’s
roommate.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.440
We all do it.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.520
But having personal opinions about the world
doesn’t make you a sociologist.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.340
Sorry.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.580
This is where sociological research comes
in:

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.570
It helps us understand society’s patterns,
even when they go against our intuitions.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.620
Rather than using our gut to answer questions, we
use a research method, a systematic plan for gathering
and analyzing observations about the world.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.440
This is where we’re gonna learn how to do
sociology!

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:07.500
[Theme Music]

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.460
First things first: Research starts with a
question.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:18.020
And the key to deciding on a question is defining
the concepts that you’re studying, and making sure
that both you and your audience agree on what
those concepts mean.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.780
It’s like that thing with The Dress.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.240
Some people thought it looked black and blue,
and other people thought it looked white and gold.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.880
It turns out that some things that seem totally
objective just aren’t.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.640
And this becomes infinitely more complicated when you replace the concepts of blue or gold with concepts like the economy, poverty, parenting, education, or love.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.680
So, what if the way I am defining poverty
isn’t how you’re imagining poverty?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.000
What if we’re all seeing different levels of well-being
as being “poor,” but we refer to them all as “poverty”?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.960
That won’t work.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.760
So you have to define your concepts, which
becomes even more important when you get to
the next part of the research process:

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.040
Stating a hypothesis – a statement of a
possible relationship between two variables.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.719
A variable is just something that can take
on many different values – it varies.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:59.799
Hence, the name!

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.640
So before you can assign a value to a variable,
you have to operationalize it.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.740
That is, you have to define the exact variable you’re
going to measure, and exactly how you will measure it.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.180
For example, you can operationalize a variable
that you want to use to understand relationships,
by defining it as “reported marital status.”

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.740
Only then can you assign each person in your sample
a number corresponding to their relationship status.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.900
Like 0 if they’re married, 1 if they’re
divorced, 2 if they’ve never been married,
etc., etc., until every person is labelled.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.360
And what value a variable takes on is called
its measurement.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.960
You can measure someone’s height, you can
measure someone’s income, and you can measure
someone’s relationship status.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.900
It doesn’t matter how many categories your
variable has: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 whatever.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.330
What’s important is that the way you define
your categories is both reliable and valid.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.090
Suppose you decide to use Facebook relationship
status as your measure of relationship status among
your subjects.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.020
For your measurement to be reliable, you have
to be consistent in how you measure the variable.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.300
So, here’s what not to do:

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.760
Say you have two categories for relationship
status: Single or Not Single.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.720
Two different sociologists are going through the
data, assigning values based on Facebook status.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.680
One decides that people who say “It’s
Complicated” get the label “Not Single,”

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.140
while the other decides that these people
should be called “Single.”

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.480
That’s not consistent.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.060
Every person with the same characteristics
– in this case, the same relationship status –
needs to be assigned the same value.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.960
And for your measurement to be valid, it has to
actually measure something that directly reflects
the concept that you’re trying to study.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.480
Facebook relationship status may be a useful
measure of whether someone’s single or not,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.410
but it’s not a valid measure of, say, their
political views.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.480
Once you know how you want to measure your variables, your hypothesis will be an educated guess about how they’re related – often using an if-then statement.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.880
Here’s an example of a hypothesis, based
on what I was talking about earlier:

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.440
If someone lives in a city, then they are less
likely to refer themselves as middle class.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.000
In this case, geographic location is what
we call the independent variable;

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.920
it’s the variable that we think is affecting
the change in how people describe themselves.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.300
But you can also have variables that you believe
are affected by changes in your independent variable;
these are your dependent variables.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.460
Your hypothesis is that they change when the
independent variable changes.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.960
But you have to be careful because correlation
does not always equal causation.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.380
Correlation is what happens when two variables
move together.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.260
It can be easy to misinterpret a correlation
to conclude that one thing causes the other,
when it really doesn’t.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.980
For example, murder rates tend to be high
when ice cream sales are high.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.220
But it’s ridiculous to think that more ice
cream causes more violence – or vice versa.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.740
What’s missing is a third variable: heat.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.900
More people commit crimes during hot months,
and more people buy ice cream then too.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.640
OK! Once you have your hypothesis, and you
know what types of variables you need to test it,
you’re at your next step:

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.900
Collecting your data.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.400
There are four main ways that sociologists
collect data:

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.560
Experiments, Surveys, Participant Observation,
and Existing Resources.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.540
Experiments in sociology work much as they
do in the natural sciences, just with humans as
subjects instead of mice or atoms of beryllium.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.620
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to see a real life
example of how a sociology experiment works!

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.160
In the 1990s, the US Department of Housing
and Urban Development conducted an experiment
known as The Moving to Opportunity study.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.840
In it, social scientists randomly assigned
low-income families into a control group or
one of two experimental groups.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.400
One group was a control group, which means
nothing was changed in their environments.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.310
This allowed for a comparison between them
and the experimental groups.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.440
They received a housing voucher that
allowed them to move to cheaper housing –

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.580
often in a better neighborhood than they
were currently in – if they wanted to.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.580
Then, a whole bunch of data was collected
– and is still being collected –

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.780
on many different short and long term
outcomes, including earnings, children’s educations,
and health outcomes.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.340
These outcomes are the experiment’s
dependent variables.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.600
So we have one independent variable –
receiving the voucher or not –

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.640
and a bunch of possible dependent variables,
like earnings, education, and health outcomes.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.610
In an experiment, if the change you predicted occurs
for the experimental group but not for the control group,
then your experiment supports your hypothesis.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.080
And in the HUD experiment, sociologists compared
how the measures of well-being changed for the control
group, compared to those for the experimental group.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.260
One of the findings:

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.300
those who received a voucher had better
mental health outcomes – such as lower rates
of depression – than those who didn’t.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.760
The data from Moving to Opportunity continues to
be studied to this day and is a key source of research
into how neighborhoods affect families’ well-being.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.900
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.540
The second method that researchers use is
a survey, where people respond to a set of
prepared questions.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.900
Typically, researchers are interested in the
responses of a specific group of people –
what we call the population of interest.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.620
Women aged 18 to 35. Veterans.
Left-handed people. Youtubers.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.800
Whoever your research question is about, this
is your population.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.840
But it’s unlikely you’ll be able to survey
the WHOLE population.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.860
Even government-run surveys, like the Census,
don’t reach everyone.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.460
So instead, you survey a sample – a smaller
group that’s representative of the population.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.120
And a survey can take many forms.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.320
There can be open-ended questions, or Yes
or No questions.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.040
The questions can appear in many different
orders, or be phrased in different ways.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.880
So, sociologists have to think carefully
about these things –

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.260
and about whether the structure of their survey
might bias the respondents’ answers.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.280
Now, some research takes place in a much less
controlled environment.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.200
Tons of sociology research is done “in the field,”
through our third method, participant observation.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.380
Participant observation is when researchers
observe people by joining them in their daily routines.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.020
The result of this type of research is called
an ethnography.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.170
Researchers try to integrate themselves into
a community, hanging out with their subjects,
working with them, and so on.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.420
They’re both observers and participants.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.620
This type of data-collection tends to be exploratory
and descriptive.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.580
You’re not trying to prove a specific hypothesis.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.620
Instead you’re trying to understand the
lifestyle of your subject.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.240
Some say that this type of research is too subjective,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:20.280
but a major benefit of doing fieldwork is that it
lets you to gain insights into people’s behavior, in the
real world, in a way that experiments won’t.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.870
Take, for example, sociologist Alice Goffman’s
field work in Philadelphia.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.560
She spent six years living in a low-income,
crime-ridden neighborhood in West Philadelphia

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.460
where she befriended and lived with two
young African American men

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.830
and documented the ways the criminal justice system intersected and disrupted the lives of them, their families, and other members of the neighborhood.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.380
The documentation of lived experience like
that can provide insights that you just couldn’t
get simply from looking at statistics.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.980
Now, there’s one thing that’s important
note about these three types of research:

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.410
When researchers interact with their subjects,
whether it’s through an experiment, an interview,

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.240
or participant observation, they have to take
seriously the ethics of their research.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.120
Sociologists are answerable to an
Institutional Review Board,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:02.240
which ensures that all researchers take the privacy
and well-being of their subjects into consideration
when they design their research methods.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.120
For example, informed consent of the subject
is a must.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.360
This means that your subjects must know you’re
observing them, and must be made aware of any
risks they take by being part of your study.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.060
Not all research methods require you to interact
with subjects though, or even collect your own data.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.220
Many sociologists analyze existing sources
of data, collected by others.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:26.920
The most common of these sources is government
agencies, which collect statistics on income, health,
education, employment, marriage, fertility –

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.040
I could keep going.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.620
The point is, these data sets are much larger
and cover more years than an individual researcher
could collect on their own.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.120
Plus, it saves time and money for the researcher.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:42.740
Once you’ve collected your data using one of these
methods, the final step is turning that data into
information that helps answer your question of interest.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.120
You can do this in two ways: through inductive
or deductive logical thought.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.680
Inductive logical thought takes your observations
and uses them to build a theory.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.420
You start with data and then use them to form
an idea about how the world works.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:09:01.280
For example, seeing the results of the Moving to Opportunity study might prompt a researcher to theorize that the neighborhood a person lives in is a key factor in their mental health.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.200
Deductive logical thought, meanwhile, uses an
existing theory to inform the hypothesis you test.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.460
In this case, you start with a theory and you
collect data that allows you to test the theory.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:19.040
Theories about the relationship between where you live and your child’s well-being is part of what prompted the government to not just collect data on the heads of household in the HUD study, but also on their children.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.160
And these two types of reasoning are not mutually
exclusive;

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.780
within one study, a researcher will use both
to develop theories about the social world.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.460
And guess what?
You’re done!

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.180
Today we discussed the research method:

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:35.320
form a question and a hypothesis, collect
data, and analyze that data to contribute
to your theories about society.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.230
