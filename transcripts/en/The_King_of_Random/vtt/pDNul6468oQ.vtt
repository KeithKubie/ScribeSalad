00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.310
In today's video we are taking a look at how you can safely make your own breakaway glass at home

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.200
Guys we love this studio. It has been our home for a really long time

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.509
But that said it's a bit time for an update

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.869
So we're going to be adding a few new things throughout the next coming videos, but before we get started on our project today

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.170
Let's start with a fresh coat of paint

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.919
Alright guys, we have started redecorating the studio as you can see we're not done yet

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.129
But don't panic it is gonna be changing over the next few videos and the idea right now is to get some decorations in place

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.980
So for the first decoration that I think that I want now we have been working on building a new work bench

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.489
Which is going to be fantastic, we're gonna have a few new really useful things

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.879
But I think we need an in case of emergency box. Now what we put in this will have to decide later

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.470
But for now if we have an in case of emergency break blast box

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.009
We don't necessarily want actual broken glass all around the studio

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.169
so there are a few different ways that you can make safe breakaway glass or film or

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.619
theater anything like that in modern film work one of the most common forms of breakaway glass is actually

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.909
smashed glass or different types of breakaway plastic now

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.160
That's not how they used to do it

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.410
It used to actually just be a type of sugar glass

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.269
Now sugar glass has the tendency of turning yellow if you try and harden it

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.020
So what we actually want to try today is sugar glass and then compare it with

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.519
Isomalt sugar glass has the tendency of having a bit of a yellow tint as it

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.109
Caramelizes when it gets to the hard crack stage, so it doesn't look perfectly clear now

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.409
Isomalt is a little bit different isomalt tends to melt at a slightly lower temperature and ends up crystal clear

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.199
So that's what we're gonna try today along with some sugar glass

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:14.889
See we can actually get that in our shadow box to make our own break in case of emergency box. Here's the basic idea

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.500
We have got a shadow box. We've got some isomalt

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.199
We've got some sugar and we've got a few ideas on how we can turn this into some glass that we can break safely in

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.190
The studio so for our first few steps here, we're gonna go ahead and take our isomalt

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.679
we're gonna take our sugar and we're gonna get them melting on the stove while that's going we're gonna take apart our shadow box and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.470
Get rid of the actual glass get it ready for our sugar glass

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.379
So when it comes to making breakaway glass at home

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.299
It's actually pretty simple if you have sugar and you have a candy thermometer, then it's really really easy

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.029
We'll go ahead and go over measurements and a cup of minutes

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.259
But if you can heat this sugar up to the hard crack stage and then pour it smooth

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.460
You shouldn't have any problems. As I said before though. It will be caramelized

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.749
You will have a slight discoloration which is why we're going to try the ice malt as well

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.059
So we're gonna go ahead and preheat our oven

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.000
Preheat the stove and get this going now because I know that the sugar is going to be discolored

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.630
I'm not even going to bother trying to put that into our breakaway box today

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.460
So I will be making a smaller sheet with our sugar glass and then we have a larger sheet

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.479
That's actually smoother with no bent edges for our isomalt. So we're not gonna have any problems with warping for the isomalt

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.850
I'm also aware that my shadow box has a piece of glass that is ten by twenty inches and this

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.800
Cookie sheet is a little bit larger than that. So I shouldn't have any problems there right now

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.339
I'm just testing to see how much sugar I actually am going to be needing to make now

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.510
This is two cups of water that I've just poured into the the pan for our sugar glass

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.300
It's not quite coating it thick enough to make me happy

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.829
So I think we're gonna double this recipe might be a thicker pane that might not use all of it

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.929
But that way I'd rather have more than less. So for your basic sugar recipe this is gonna be very simple

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.050
This is gonna be four cups of sugar a cup and a half of water and then two 2/3 cups of corn syrup

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.010
We're gonna go ahead and stir this on a low heat until it's fully

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.419
Dissolved and then we'll turn that up to a medium heat and we're gonna go ahead and let this

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.880
Heat up until it hits hard crack stage and then we'll remove it from the heat and pour it directly into our mold

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.309
you guys I have no idea if I got enough ice and mom you don't really need to use a lot of water for the

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.709
Isomalt, so let's just see how this

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.769
look

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.169
So I actually think this is going to be a perfect amount of isomalt

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.859
So one bag of kitchen alchemy, this is 2.2 pounds or 36 ounces of isomalt

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.260
I think that's going to be pretty perfect for our 10 by 20 inch pane of glass that we need

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.429
However, I am going to use both bags. I did buy two bags of isomalt

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.850
I'm gonna melt it all but I'm not going to pour it all at the same time

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.229
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have it all melt down on the stove. The oven will be preheated to

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.479
275 degrees Fahrenheit we'll go ahead and just let all of the bubble sort of rise

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.910
To make it really really clear and then after that we'll go ahead and pour two separate sheets when melting isomalt

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.830
Everyone does things a little bit differently

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.169
some people say you want to add enough water for it to be the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.710
Consistency of what's and some people say you don't even need to add any at all

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.510
I like to add just a little bit to my pot to make sure that nothing's burning on the bottom

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.909
But then I just keep it at a low heat until it's all melted

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.700
then pop it into the oven to make sure that we had all of those bubbles rising to the surface the main thing you really

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.679
Want to make sure of when you're working with icing up is that all of your equipment is very very clean?

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.840
Distilled water is preferred

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.739
I have found that I've been able to get some very very nice results without it

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.929
But do make sure you have a very clean pot

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.510
Very clean spatula and make sure not to cross contaminate it with your sugar if you're melting them at the same time

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:51.109
We're gonna go ahead and keep a simmer for our sugar while our isomalt is melting the ice melts gonna be much slower

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.700
It's gonna be much calmer. Well this hits a hard crack stage. This is simply just gonna melt down

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.220
Until it's ready to go in the oven

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.670
so I would say we've probably got about 10 minutes where I can actually leave these kind of let them melt as they go so

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.899
Well, they're melting on the stove. I'm going to go ahead and get started on the shadowbox itself

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:16.730
So to begin with this is a shadowbox. These can be found at most craft stores framing stores things like that

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.179
Normally what they're used for is for pinning or placing little mementos that might be thicker that you might put in a normal frame

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.609
So you can see that we've got a pretty good depth here on this one. So it should give us a really nice sort of

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.380
Emergency box we can put any sort of emergency supplies in here that we might need

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.469
So first things first, we don't need the real glass. So let's take that

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.500
Reowww glass removed

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.099
Our isomalt is not done melting

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.619
However, our sugar has hit it's hard crack stage and you can see it's actually already got that sort of a yellow tint

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.880
It's pretty much ready to pour. I want to do get my tray ready for it now

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.700
Well, I'm not too worried about it sticking to my non-stick pan

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.539
I am going to add a very thin layer of cooking oil it will

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.269
Fog up the glass just a little bit but less chance of it breaking when I try and pull it out later

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.250
You can see that there's obviously going to be a color change. That's not going to look like regular glass

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.309
It's still going to be a nice safe breakaway glass

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.729
But not the color we're going for so we're going to show you the difference

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.469
So I'm going to go ahead and pour this now and hope it cools and comes out without breaking. Let's see

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.120
That is about

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:39.449
350 degrees Fahrenheit right now. So just tipping this tray. I'd be super careful

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:46.500
I'm gonna take this and we're just gonna dip the bottom to cool it down just enough so that it does stop cooking

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.019
It'll still be heated, but it won't be cooking anymore

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.619
Be very careful if you do this because this steam rising is hot enough to burn you

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.619
There we go, but you can see that our bubbles have all calmed down

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.389
So now what we're gonna do is we're gonna pop this in the oven for about 15 minutes again

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:08.819
Just to get these bubbles to rise to the surface so that women report we get a nice clear glass look

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.129
Yes, oh now I do wish I have my audio on because I'm like dancing over here

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:36.179
This is looking super good the surface has a really interesting texture kind of looks like the surface of the Moon guys

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.080
I still made again because I needed a second pair of hands and he has hands

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.270
But we have got our sugar glass

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:47.219
we have got our isomalt glass and we want to try and get these out of the pans and

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.070
I'm very worried that with just one set of hands. The bending is gonna probably break them. So here's the plan

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.310
I'm gonna try and tip them out once we've got them out

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.719
We will need to cut one down to size and the way you do that is with a very very hot knife

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:07.979
We've got our knives heating up on the stove. Yeah this one it's already actually can already see. Yes it delaminates at the edges

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.469
It's just beautiful, which is exactly what we were going for

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.150
So I think well

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.219
What we can do is we if we put the cardboard over it

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.339
And flip it and we can just gently press from the back on the metal plate. I think it will all release

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:22.589
All right. We give it a try. We give it a try

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.740
I've never actually seen anybody try and make sheet isomalt before glass or sugar glass

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.260
Yes, but I don't think I needed to do any pouring not just yeah pop right out there. Oh

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.159
My gosh, oh that's gonna taste like cooking spray. Oh

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:48.569
It tastes great. This turned out so much better than we are expecting. Yes, because it is sugar glass. Yes

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.719
It does caramelize it does turn, you know a little bit yellow

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.810
But this is so much smoother than we were expecting. You can even see the logo of harvest, right?

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.560
So from our freeze dry pan, you can see it right there

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.990
So very very hot knife

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.650
We've had it just boiling on the stove

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:11.039
But then I'm drying it so that it won't it won't gum up our our sugar glass now

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:18.240
I know that supposedly this works with isomalt. I do not know if it works with sugar glass quite the same so far

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.039
I'm gonna say no, but we're still gonna try because even regular glass you can score and break

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.560
All right. Yep thousand-degree knife challenge go for it

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:39.719
Aha hey that looks like it did something Wow, yeah that was much much more efficient

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:49.139
Exactly those look like that. I came off nice exactly how you do it. I just want it to be known

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.580
I don't know if it was caught on camera. She literally just said hit me in the head. It's fine. I got it

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.580
Just go for it. All right

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.940
Yeah

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.099
Action star we're gonna clean up and then we're gonna move on to our isomalt

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.889
All right. So sugar glass it does work. You can make amazing breakaway panels with it

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.070
The isomalt is the one that's very clear. This is the one I'm excited about

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.939
This is the one that I want to put into our emergency kit box to put on the wall

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:44.299
So see if we get it to come out just as easily as the sugar glass. Did I'm gonna flip towards you. Okay ready? Oh,

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:50.719
Sure, that's out that sounded like a freak though. That sounds like correct, please don't be broken. Please don't be broken

00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:01.399
Yes, amazing sheet, I think that's gonna be okay and again there's this bit of cloudiness from the oil

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.410
So I think we're gonna try and hit it with the torch again

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:08.269
see if we can clean it up just a little bit and then we're gonna cut it down to size and get it into our

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.430
emergency kit

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.129
We've got it in place it's not perfectly smooth

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.450
So I'm gonna use our smaller torch see if we can clean that up a little bit and then we're gonna get some writing on

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.659
It mess happening along the side here. There we go

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.530
Alright guys

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.480
We've got it in case of emergency we are set

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.270
But I'll show you put in the studio

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.220
