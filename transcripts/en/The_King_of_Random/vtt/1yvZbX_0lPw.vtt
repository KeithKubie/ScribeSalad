00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.650
In this video I’m going to show you how
to build a super secret shelf that’ll hide

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.830
spare keys, cash, passports, or anything else
you don’t want people knowing about.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.430
For this project we’re going to need a 4’
length of 1”x12” common board, a length

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.480
of 1/4”x1” hardwood emboss rope, and a
4” ft length of 4-1/2” hardwood emboss crown molding.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.989
All of which you can find at the hardware
store.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.539
Crown molding is the stuff that has the angled
ends and it’s typically used for decoration,

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.060
to make the corner under your ceiling look
fancy.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.680
We can get away with using a 12” chop saw
to cut out all the pieces we need, but if

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.320
you don’t have one of those, you could maybe
borrow one from your neighbor, or just use hand tools instead.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.860
Start by cutting the common board into a rectangle
24” long by 11-1/4” wide, then use the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.600
same board to cut another piece 18-1/4”
long by 8-3/8” wide.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.420
If you do it right, you can use the rest of
the board to get an 18” by 2-1/2” piece, and two 6” by 2” pieces like these.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.180
And go ahead and trim a 45º cut from the tips of those pieces while you’re at it.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.180
With your pieces of board cut, you should
have just enough scrap left over to make a

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.320
few prism shapes, and you’ll see what these
are for in just a minute.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.680
Now when it comes to crown molding., it can
be extremely difficult to cut corners that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.880
actually line up. But here’s a cool little
trick for making perfect cuts every time,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940
simply by using a bit of masking tape.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.420
Place some tape on both sides of your cutting
base, and lay the crown molding with the top side facing down.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.010
And when the molding feels like it’s locked
squarely into place, use a pen to mark a line

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.940
on the tape along the top edge.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.320
Do the same thing on the other side so you
have reference lines to guide you, and this

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.680
should save you about $20 from having to buy
a cutting jig.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.030
Now the easiest way to measure the walls for
our custom shelf is by lining the bottoms

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.000
of the moldings up with the 8-3/8” wide
board, then using a pen to mark where the bottoms meet the front edge.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.880
When you’re confident you understand how
it’s going together, rotate the table of

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.740
your miter saw clockwise so the blade is cutting
at a 45º angle.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.080
Set your crown molding in place with the top
facing downward, and make sure it’s perfectly

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.799
aligned with the marks on your tape, then
carefully cut the crown molding so the blade

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.399
slices exactly through your marking.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.700
This will give your side piece a nice angle,
and you can double-check the length by lining

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.830
the bottom of the molding back up with the
edge of the board, and making sure the edges

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.190
at the back and front are perfectly flush.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.149
Ok that’s looking great, so let’s flip
the saw around to 45º the other direction

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.680
and do the same thing with the other side
of the board.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.920
Line up the molding with the tape marks, and
cut it to it’s custom length like you did before,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.020
but this time make sure you use the
other end of the board, so you keep one of the edges flat.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.310
At this point we've got the two sides of our
shelf finished, so let’s move on to making the front piece next.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.250
Since we’ve already got the saw angled to
the right, let's go ahead and trim a new piece

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.250
so it’s pointing the right direction, then
use the length of the 18-1/4” board to mark

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.150
the bottom of the molding exactly where we
need the other end cut.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.859
Flip the saw back the other way one more time,
and make your custom cut, and that’s it.

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.530
The front wall of our shelf is finished, and
now if you try pressing two of the pieces

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.180
together, it should make a near perfect joint
without any special tools or training. Let’s

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.340
move on to working the trim next.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.960
The trim I’m using is a 4’ length of 1/4”x1”
hardwood emboss rope, and I’m using it as

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.580
decoration for the top part of my shelf.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.820
Measure it to where it matches the front and
sides of the larger board, then cut them at

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.220
45º angles so the front edges join together
as they wrap around the board.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.380
With these final cuts, the hard work is over,
and we’ve got all the pieces we need to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.960
start putting our shelf together. So let’s
get ready to assemble.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.239
Now for a strong and sturdy shelf it’s a
good idea to run a bead of wood glue between

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.439
all your connections, and I like to start
assembly with the smaller blocks, and the 18” board.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.550
Make sure the flat sides of the board are
all flush, except for the underside, where

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.230
it should be slightly offset from the bottom,
with the 1” angled cut pointing down.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.440
Now we’ll need to fasten these pieces together,
and while you could just use a hammer and

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.069
finishing nails, I’m using a brad nailer
I found at a garage sale for $35 instead,

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.780
because it’s a lot faster, and much easier
to use.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.620
Punch one small nail in from the back to hold
the pieces together, then drill a couple of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.770
pilot holes so you can add two 2” wood screws
to hold the pieces firmly together. This just

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.989
makes the shelf a lot more durable.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.440
The next step is to add glue to the bottoms
of the crown molding, and press them into

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.800
place around the sides of the board, then
fasten them to the base with finishing nails

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.580
to hold them securely in place.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.080
It’s a good idea to glue and tack the corner
joints as well to help reinforce them, and

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.830
I found that spacing the nails around 2”
apart seemed to work really well.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.120
Ok the bottom of our shelf is finished, so
we can start adding the 1” trim around the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.940
top plank, and for best results you’ll want
to glue it in place as well, so it’s hanging

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.900
halfway off the bottom edge.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.090
Set the top of your shelf so it’s resting
on the base, and you’ll see how the overlap

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.850
gives a wonderfully decorative feel to the
shelf, and completely conceals any visible gaps that might give it away.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.050
Alright our shelf is framed and looking good,
so let’s install some functionality next.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.000
The secret to making the shelf open and close
properly are very specific cabinet hinges

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.150
I found in the hardware isle of my hardware
store.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.220
They’re called mortised full overlay cup
hinges for frameless cabinets and come in

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.320
a pack of 2 for under $6. (HC11SFC-NP-C5)

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.770
A small adjustment needs to be made to lengthen
out the hinges, which can be done quickly

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.130
and easily by loosing the bottom screw clockwise,
loosening the top screw counter-clockwise

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.190
and sliding it up as far as it will go.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.000
Then simply re-tighten the screws again so
the hinge is locked into position.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.800
Just for reference, this is what the hinge
looks like before the adjustment, and here’s what it looks like after.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.190
A nice feature of cabinet hinges is they come
with templates, and you’ll need to center

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.000
them 3-1/2” in from the sides and use something
like a screw to mark the center of the circle.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.220
Do the same thing from the other side as well,
then use a 1-3/8” Forstner bit to drill

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.060
out the hole according to the instructions.
If you don’t have a Forstner bit, you could

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.410
always chip the wood out with a chisel or
a knife as well, but only go deep enough to

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.650
just barely press the hinges into place so
they rest firmly on the top of the board.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.930
When you’ve secured the the hinges to the
base of the shelf, then it’s time to bring it all together.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.320
The hinges need to be attached to the inside
of the support bar, and I’ve found the best

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.900
way to align them perfectly, is to stand everything
upright with the hinges slightly overlapping,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.880
then using the top of the shelf to gently
close the container all the way shut.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.880
When you pull the top off again, your hinges
should be, in the perfect position.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.380
So let’s mark their location, and screw
them into place..

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.820
With the support bar secured, and the top
side flush and flat, we can join it to the

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.009
top of the shelf, finishing off this basic
assembly.

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.729
The top of the shelf needs to be glued and
nailed down along the back edge of the board,

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.360
and secured to where the arms are extending
underneath.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.080
With this final step, the most basic version
of our shelf is finished, and all for around $35 in materials!

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.699
Now before we move on, it’s a really good
idea to test out the hinge mechanism by propping

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.700
the shelf upright on a table and gently opening
and closing it, so you can study the movement

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.150
of the bottom corner.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.870
Notice how it doesn’t actually contact the
table through the testing cycles. This means

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.139
it should’t make any dent’s or holes in
your wall once it’s installed, which is really important.

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.050
It should also fit snugly and symmetrically
inside the trim around the top, and if it

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.990
does, then you’re ready to install the secret
magnetic locking system that makes this whole thing work.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.490
I found some magnetic locks at my local hardware
store in the cabinet isle, sold as child safety

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.240
locks for kid-proofing cupboards.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.699
You can see that when a super strong rare
earth magnet comes within about an inch of

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.919
the lock, it’ll magically activate the mechanism,
allowing it open and close.

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.350
You can get away using just one, or as many
of them as you want, and by hiding them inside

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.930
the compartment, no-one will know they even
exist at all.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.810
Ok it’s time to bring back the wooden prisms
we saved from earlier, and choose where want our locks to go. we

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.700
Glue and nail the prisms to the inside walls
of the crown molding anywhere you want, but

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.949
make sure they’re flush with the top lip
because this will create a flat inner edge,

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.350
for us to screw the locking plates into position.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.170
Now go find something like a tube of toothpaste
because we’re going to life hack these locks into place.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.900
Add a generous amount of toothpaste to the
top ridges of the locking plates, and you’ll

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.520
see that when we close the shelf, then open
it again, it leaves markings exactly where the locks need to go.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.259
Use these marks as a reference point for securing
the main part of the unit to the underside

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.979
of the of the shelf. And don’t worry if
you’re a little off because there is some

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.520
wiggle room you can play with until you get
it perfected.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.389
Oh yeah, I have to mention here it’s extremely
important to manually move the lock into the

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:38.230
closed position, so you don’t accidentally
close the shelf and lock yourself out prematurely.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.990
With the switches locked in the open position,
you can close and re-open the shelf for testing

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.000
purposes, without the headache of having to
magnetically unlock them each time.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.720
Now at this point we’ve got a high quality,
and fully functional secret shelf, at a price

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.160
point about as low as it gets. The only thing
left to do now, is make it look good.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.479
For my shelf I decided to use a red chestnut
wood stain, and a fast-drying polyurethane

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:01.319
semi-gloss to give it a nice rich color and
make it shine.

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:05.100
I removed all the hinges and hardware before
I stained my shelf, so they’d stay clean

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.350
and professional looking. Then I went back
to the hardware store and got some diamond

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.509
plated aluminum tread, for decoration.

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:15.330
I cut a place for the hinges, then screwed
it on using small round-head screws, and reattached

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.229
all the hinges and magnets into their respective
places.

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:21.669
Now to prevent our shelf from falling open
and banging down into the wall, I’m using

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:27.729
some #6 sheet metal screws that are 1/2”
long, a couple #6 flat washers, and a couple feet of Jack chain.

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:31.729
Let’s cut two pieces of chain seven and
a half inches long, then use the washers and

00:08:31.729 --> 00:08:35.969
machine screws to secure one end of the chain
to the centers of the 45º cuts on the tips

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:40.430
of the support arms. The other ends screw
to the bottom corners of the base.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.380
With this simple addition, you can see that
when the shelf is opened, it hangs neatly

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:49.780
at a forty five degree angle, giving the whole
system a smooth and professional look. And a bit more functionality as well.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.230
The magnetic key that came with my child lock
is a little too obvious for the system, so

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.110
I got a couple Neodymium magnets off the internet,
which are really small, but extremely strong.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.730
The cool thing about this approach is now
you can drill a few smalls holes into random

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.519
decorations and instantly convert them into
covert magnetic keys.

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:09.970
I left my magnets exposed so you could see
them, but if you stick a price tag or glue

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.110
a piece of felt to the bottoms, no one would
ever know.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.529
With that final step, our Stealth Shelf is
completely finished and ready for testing,

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:19.589
so let’s explore how it works in the real
world.

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:23.709
When you want to open your shelf, simply position
your select decorations in the secret locations

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:27.220
that only you know about, to active the child
locks inside.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.309
Then push up gently from the bottom, and if
you got the combination right, it’ll click

00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:33.519
open and reveal your secret stash inside.

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:37.269
As easy as that you’ve got quick and easy
access to whatever you need, and if want,

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:41.829
you can even install a little motion activated
LED that’ll turn on whenever you crack the case.

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:45.600
This turns your shelf into a cool looking
display case, but also doubles as an emergency

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:50.449
flashlight if the power ever goes out, or
if you need to locate an intruder in the dark.

00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:55.069
I found mine online for about $10, and I’ll
put a link in the description to where you can get it.

00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:59.970
By the way they’re also magnetic, so they
conveniently clip back into place in seconds.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.670
Now if you’re concerned about kids getting
into your shelf, then simply hide your magnets in heavier objects.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.100
Heavier objects won’t respond to the magnetic
fields the same way, so it’ll be a lot more

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.029
difficult to find any secret lock locations.

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:16.289
And if you install more than one lock in your
system, it’ll make it exponentially tricker to figure out.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.790
When you’ve got your secret safe loaded
up and ready to close, simply move your covert

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.110
keys out of the way, and press the bottom
of the shelf back into place until you hear it click.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:30.540
It instantly transforms into a nice piece
of home decor. While secretly keeping your valuables tucked away inside.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.959
Now if you want to go one step further, you
could always make a magnetic baseplate as well.

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:38.670
I ordered a few magnets with countersink holes,
and screwed them onto the bottom, then covered

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.269
them with sticky-back foam from the craft
store.

00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:45.189
The magnets are more than strong enough to
hold defensive weapons securely in place,

00:10:45.189 --> 00:10:49.849
and make it easy to click them out, then lock
back on again when they’re ready go back into hiding.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.639
Now of course you can customize your shelf
any way you want to, and make it any color you desire.

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:57.759
I used a can of black spray paint to make
this one, and you can see it looks just as

00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:00.610
good, and nicely compliments my workshop.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.610
The magnetic lock for this one’s in a different
spot, and hides my CO2 powered BB gun out

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.370
of sight, and out of mind.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:12.019
These shelves also hide things like spare
keys, passports, or any extra cash you don’t want anyone to know about.

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:15.869
It’ll make electronics virtually disappear
when your kids need a break, or conceal those

00:11:15.869 --> 00:11:19.259
little indulgences you might have, that you
don’t want anyone getting into.

00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:23.350
Well now you know how to use commonly available
materials from the hardware store to make

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.559
a decorative, functional, and multi purpose
“floating shelf”, on a budget.

00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:32.579
And don’t forget. They still work as shelves
for displaying pictures and other random trinkets as well.

00:11:32.589 --> 00:11:36.489
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
