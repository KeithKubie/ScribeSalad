00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:08.624
On the coast of Northern Ireland,

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:12.121
a vast plateau of basalt slabs
and columns

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:14.162
called the Giant’s Causeway

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:16.042
stretches into the ocean.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.042
The scientific explanation for this

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:22.397
is that it’s the result of
molten lava contracting and fracturing

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:25.775
as it cooled in the wake 
of a volcanic eruption.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:30.526
But an ancient Irish myth 
has a different accounting.

00:00:30.526 --> 00:00:32.158
According to legend,

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:36.401
the giant Finn MacCool lived happily 
on the North Antrim coast

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.279
with his wife Oonagh.

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:41.008
Their only disturbance came from
the taunts and threats

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.338
of the giant Benandonner,

00:00:43.338 --> 00:00:47.870
or the red man, 
who lived across the sea in Scotland.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.078
The two roared insults 
and hurled rocks at each other

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:54.077
in dramatic shows of strength.

00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:58.601
Once, Finn tore up a great clump of land 
and heaved it at his rival,

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.223
but it fell short of reaching land.

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:04.172
Instead, the clump became the Isle of Man,

00:01:04.172 --> 00:01:07.360
and the crater left from the disturbed
earth filled with water

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.874
to become Lough Neagh.

00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:12.213
The giants’ tough talk continued,

00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:17.109
until one day Benandonner challenged 
Finn to a fight, face to face.

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:21.188
And so the Irish giant tossed 
enough boulders into the sea

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:26.230
to create a bridge of stepping 
stones to the Scottish coast.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.548
Finn marched across in a fit of rage.

00:01:28.548 --> 00:01:30.466
When Scotland loomed before him,

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:33.597
he made out the figure 
of Benandonner from afar.

00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:36.066
Finn was a substantial size,

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:39.498
but at the sight of his colossal
enemy thundering towards him,

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.304
his courage faltered.

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:47.986
With one look at Benandonner’s thick neck
and crushing fists, Finn turned and ran.

00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:50.813
Back home, with Benandonner 
fast approaching,

00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:55.446
Finn trembled as he described 
his enemy’s bulk to Oonagh.

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:58.114
They knew that if he faced 
Benandonner head on,

00:01:58.114 --> 00:01:59.663
he’d be crushed.

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:02.180
And so Oonagh hatched a cunning plan -

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.583
they needed to create an illusion of size,

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:09.850
to suggest Finn was a mountain 
of a man whilst keeping him out of sight.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.533
As Benandonner neared 
the end of the bridge,

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:15.785
Oonagh stuffed her husband 
in a huge cradle.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:18.602
Disguised as an enormous baby,

00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:22.405
Finn lay quiet as Benandonnner 
pounded on the door.

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:25.053
The house shook as he stepped inside.

00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:29.106
Oonagh told the enraged visitor 
that her husband wasn’t home,

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:32.897
but welcomed him to sit
and eat while he waited.

00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:35.869
When Benandonner tore into the cakes 
placed before him,

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:37.919
he cried out in pain

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:43.281
for he’d shattered his teeth 
on the metal Oonagh had concealed inside.

00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:45.970
She told him that this 
was Finn’s favorite bread,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.865
sowing a seed of doubt 
in Benandonner’s mind

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:51.708
that he was any match for his rival.

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:53.444
When Finn let out a squawk,

00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:58.838
Benandonner’s attention was drawn 
to the gigantic baby in the corner.

00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:02.704
So hefty was the infant swaddled 
under piles of blankets,

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:07.170
Benandonner shuddered at the thought 
of what the father would look like.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.681
He decided he’d rather not find out.

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:13.947
As he fled, Benandonner tore up the rocks 
connecting the shores,

00:03:13.947 --> 00:03:15.984
breaking up the causeway.

00:03:15.984 --> 00:03:19.436
What remains are two identical 
rock formations:

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:22.305
one on the North Antrim coast of Ireland

00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:26.663
and one at Fingal’s Cave in Scotland, 
right across the sea.
