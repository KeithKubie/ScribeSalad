00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:02.324
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.324 --> 00:00:05.268
is try to find the
derivative with respect to X

00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:06.268
of X squared

00:00:07.925 --> 00:00:08.758
sin of X.

00:00:10.068 --> 00:00:12.359
All of that to the third power.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.882
And what's going to be
interesting is that there's

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:15.505
multiple ways to tackle it.

00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:16.925
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:20.341
and see if you could work
through it on your own.

00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:22.682
So there's actually multiple techniques.

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.504
One path is to do the chain rule first.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:27.087
So I'll just say CR

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:30.215
for chain rule first.

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:33.005
And so I have, I'm taking the
derivative with respect to X

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.442
of something to the third power.

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:37.963
So, if I take the derivative it would be

00:00:37.963 --> 00:00:40.329
the derivative with
respect to that something.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.556
So that would be

00:00:41.556 --> 00:00:43.877
three times that something

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.404
squared

00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:48.826
times the derivative with respect to X

00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:50.936
of that something.

00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:52.657
Where the something, in this case,

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:54.490
is X squared sin of X.

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:57.984
X squared sin

00:00:59.054 --> 00:00:59.932
of X.

00:00:59.932 --> 00:01:03.244
This is just an application
of the chain rule.

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:06.143
Now, the second part, what would that be?

00:01:06.143 --> 00:01:07.707
The second part here

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:09.518
do this in another color.

00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:10.884
In orange.

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:13.225
Well here, I would apply the product rule.

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:15.325
I have a product of two expressions.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.694
So I would take the derivative
of, let me write this down.

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:20.913
So this is gonna be the product rule.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:21.996
Product rule.

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:26.179
I would take the derivative
of the first expression.

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.103
So, X, derivative of X squared

00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:30.544
is two X.

00:01:30.544 --> 00:01:32.280
Let me write a little bit to the right.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.437
This is gonna be two X

00:01:33.437 --> 00:01:34.873
times the second expression

00:01:34.873 --> 00:01:35.706
sin of X.

00:01:36.923 --> 00:01:39.795
Plus the first expression X squared

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:41.695
times the derivative of the second one.

00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:42.662
Cosin of X.

00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:43.862
That's just the product rule

00:01:43.862 --> 00:01:45.685
as applied to this part

00:01:45.685 --> 00:01:47.292
right over here.

00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:49.289
And all of that, of course,
is being multiplied by

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.802
this up front.

00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:52.460
Which actually, let me just

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.120
rewrite that.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.581
So all of this I could rewrite as

00:01:57.581 --> 00:01:59.532
let's see, this would be

00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:00.449
three times

00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:04.848
if I have the product
raised to the second power

00:02:04.848 --> 00:02:06.500
I could take each of
them to the second power

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.642
and then take their products.

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:09.558
So X squared squared is

00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:11.321
X to the fourth.

00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:13.019
And then sin of X squared is

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.415
sin

00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:16.023
squared of X.

00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:18.931
And then all of that is
being multiplied by that.

00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:22.151
And, if we want, we can
algebraically simplify.

00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:24.835
We can distribute everything out.

00:02:24.835 --> 00:02:27.581
In which case, what would we get?

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:28.556
Well let's see.

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:30.473
Three times two is six.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.698
X to the fourth times X is

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:35.011
X to the fifth.

00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:36.856
Sin squared of X times sin of X

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:37.773
is sin of X

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.432
to the third power.

00:02:40.432 --> 00:02:42.595
And then, let's see, three

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.742
so plus three, X to the
fourth times X squared is

00:02:45.742 --> 00:02:47.465
X to the sixth power.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:50.132
And then I have sin squared of X

00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:51.770
sin squared of X

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.687
cosin of X.

00:02:53.528 --> 00:02:55.257
So there you have it, that's one strategy

00:02:55.257 --> 00:02:57.539
chain rule first, and then product rule.

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:59.448
What would be another strategy

00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:02.098
pause the video and try to think of it.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:04.250
Well, we could just algebraically

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.520
use our exponent properties first.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.313
In which case, this is
going to be equal to

00:03:09.313 --> 00:03:11.954
the derivative with respect to X

00:03:11.954 --> 00:03:12.787
of

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:17.585
if I'm taking X squared times
sin of X to the third power

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:19.584
instead I could say X to the third power

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:22.986
which is going to be X to the sixth.

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:24.860
And then sin of X to the third power.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.693
Sin of X

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.947
to the

00:03:27.947 --> 00:03:28.849
third power.

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.929
I'm using the same exponent property

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:34.255
that we used right over
here to simplify this.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.334
If I have if I'm doing the product things

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:38.396
to some exponent, well
that's the same thing

00:03:38.396 --> 00:03:40.012
if each of them raised to the exponent

00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:42.036
and then the product of the two.

00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:43.919
Now how would we tackle this?

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.867
Well, I here, I would do

00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:47.970
the product rule first.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.337
So let's do that.

00:03:49.337 --> 00:03:51.379
So let's do the product

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.638
rule.

00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:53.904
So, we're gonna take

00:03:53.904 --> 00:03:56.125
the derivative of the first expression.

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:57.619
So, derivative of X to the sixth

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:58.452
is six

00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:01.568
X to the fifth.

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:03.053
Times the second expression.

00:04:03.053 --> 00:04:04.284
Sin

00:04:04.284 --> 00:04:06.076
to the third of X.

00:04:06.076 --> 00:04:07.921
Or, sin of X to the third power.

00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:10.754
Plus the first X to the sixth

00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:12.376
times the derivative of the second

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:13.937
and I'm just gonna write that

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:14.976
D DX of

00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:15.809
sin of X

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:19.159
to the third power.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:23.342
Now, to evaluate this right over here

00:04:23.342 --> 00:04:26.125
it does definitely make sense

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.650
to use the chain rule.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.298
Use

00:04:30.298 --> 00:04:31.695
the chain rule.

00:04:31.695 --> 00:04:34.224
And so what is this going to be?

00:04:34.224 --> 00:04:36.057
Well I have the derivative of something

00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:37.069
to the third power.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.086
So that's going to be three

00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:40.777
times that something squared

00:04:40.777 --> 00:04:43.751
times the derivative of that something.

00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:46.678
So in this case, the
something is sin of X.

00:04:46.678 --> 00:04:49.867
And the derivative of
sin of X is cosin of X.

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:51.987
Then I have all of this
business over here.

00:04:51.987 --> 00:04:54.823
I have six X to the fifth.

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:56.647
Sin to the third

00:04:56.647 --> 00:04:58.422
or sin of X to the third power.

00:04:58.422 --> 00:04:59.472
Plus

00:04:59.472 --> 00:05:00.722
X to the sixth.

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:04.331
And if I were to just
simplify this a little bit

00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:05.798
in fact, you see it very clearly.

00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:08.467
These two things are equivalent.

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:09.300
This

00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:12.402
this term is exactly
equivalent to this term

00:05:12.402 --> 00:05:13.413
the way it's written.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.545
And then this is exactly,

00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:18.399
if you multiply three times X to the sixth

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.123
sin of X squared

00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:21.547
cosin of X.

00:05:21.547 --> 00:05:23.143
So, the nice thing about math

00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:24.982
if we're doing things
that make logical sense

00:05:24.982 --> 00:05:26.842
we should get to the same endpoint.

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:29.583
But the point here is that
there's multiple strategies.

00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:30.940
You could use a chain rule first

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.077
and then the product rule.

00:05:32.077 --> 00:05:33.378
Or you could use a product rule first,

00:05:33.378 --> 00:05:34.502
and then the chain rule.

00:05:34.502 --> 00:05:36.910
In this case, you could
debate which one is faster.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.040
It looks like the one on the right

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.886
might be a little bit faster.

00:05:39.886 --> 00:05:40.956
But

00:05:40.956 --> 00:05:42.060
sometimes

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.533
these two are pretty close.

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:45.640
But sometimes it'll be more clear than not

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.428
which one is preferable.

00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:49.588
You really want to minimize
the amount of hairiness,

00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:51.355
the amount the number of steps

00:05:51.355 --> 00:05:53.659
the chances for careless
mistakes you might have.
