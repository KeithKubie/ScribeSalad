00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:08.269
There's a common misconception

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.000
that if you like to meticulously 
organize your things,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.573
keep your hands clean,

00:00:12.573 --> 00:00:15.727
or plan out your weekend 
to the last detail,

00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:19.152
you might have OCD.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:24.129
In fact, OCD, which stands 
for obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.348
is a serious psychiatric condition

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:28.623
that is frequently 
misunderstood by society

00:00:28.623 --> 00:00:31.739
and mental health professionals alike.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.669
So let's start by debunking some myths.

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:40.318
Myth one: repetitive or ritualistic
behaviors are synonymous with OCD.

00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:41.951
As its name suggests,

00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:45.102
obsessive compulsive disorder
has two aspects:

00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:50.106
the intrusive thoughts, images,
or impulses, known as obsessions,

00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:53.413
and the behavioral 
compulsions people engage in

00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:56.942
to relieve the anxiety 
the obsessions cause.

00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:00.217
The kinds of actions that people often 
associate with OCD,

00:01:00.217 --> 00:01:04.079
like excessive hand washing,
or checking things repeatedly,

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.029
may be examples of obsessive
or compulsive tendencies

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:10.847
that many of us exhibit from time to time.

00:01:10.847 --> 00:01:16.264
But the actual disorder is far more rare
and can be quite debilitating.

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:20.279
People affected have little or no
control over their obsessive thoughts

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.333
and compulsive behaviors,

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.108
which tend to be time consuming

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:28.405
and interfere with work, 
school or social life

00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:31.230
to the point of causing 
significant distress.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.506
This set of diagnostic criteria is what
separates people suffering from OCD

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:39.702
from those who may 
just be a bit more meticulous

00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:42.488
or hygiene obsessed than usual.

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:47.239
Myth two: the main symptom of OCD
is excessive hand washing.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.864
Although hand washing is the most common
image of OCD in popular culture,

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:55.718
obsessions and compulsions
can take many different forms.

00:01:55.718 --> 00:01:59.847
Obsessions can manifest 
as fears of contamination and illness,

00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:02.196
worries about harming others,

00:02:02.196 --> 00:02:08.035
or preoccupations with numbers,
patterns, morality, or sexual identity.

00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:11.623
And compulsions can range from
excessive cleaning or double checking,

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:14.938
to the fastidious arrangement of objects,

00:02:14.938 --> 00:02:18.534
or walking in predetermined patterns.

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:19.856
Myth three:

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:24.857
individuals with OCD don't understand
that they are acting irrationally.

00:02:24.857 --> 00:02:28.712
Many individuals with OCD actually
understand the relationship

00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:32.729
between their obsessions 
and compulsions quite well.

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.358
Being unable to avoid 
these thoughts and actions

00:02:35.358 --> 00:02:38.444
despite being aware of their irrationality

00:02:38.444 --> 00:02:42.040
is part of the reason
why OCD is so distressing.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.489
OCD sufferers report feeling crazy

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.465
for experiencing anxiety 
based on irrational thoughts

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:50.836
and finding it difficult 
to control their responses.

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:53.371
So what exactly causes OCD?

00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:56.328
The frustrating answer 
is we don't really know.

00:02:56.328 --> 00:02:58.765
However, we have some important clues.

00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:02.236
OCD is considered 
a neurobiological disorder.

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:06.466
In other words, research suggests 
that OCD sufferers brains

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:10.228
are actually hardwired 
to behave in a certain fashion.

00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:12.701
Research has implicated 
three regions of the brain

00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:16.900
variously involved in social behavior
and complex cognitive planning,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.575
voluntary movement,

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:22.261
and emotional and motivational responses.

00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:24.089
The other piece of the puzzle

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.271
is that OCD is associated 
with low levels of serotonin,

00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:32.023
a neurotransmitter 
that communicates between brain structures

00:03:32.023 --> 00:03:34.594
and helps regulate vital processes,

00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:37.417
such as mood, aggression, impulse control,

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:42.205
sleep, appetite, 
body temperature and pain.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:46.728
But are serotonin and activity 
in these brain regions the sources of OCD

00:03:46.728 --> 00:03:51.227
or symptoms of an unknown
underlying cause of the disorder.

00:03:51.227 --> 00:03:52.768
We probably won't know until

00:03:52.768 --> 00:03:56.726
we have a much more intimate 
understanding of the brain.

00:03:56.726 --> 00:04:00.254
The good news is there are 
effective treatments for OCD,

00:04:00.254 --> 00:04:03.462
including medications, which increase
serotonin in the brain

00:04:03.462 --> 00:04:06.513
by limiting its reabsorption 
by brain cells,

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:11.517
behavioral therapy that gradually
desensitizes patients to their anxieties,

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:14.660
and in some cases, 
electroconvulsive therapy,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.188
or surgery, when OCD doesn't respond
to other forms of treatment.

00:04:19.188 --> 00:04:21.762
Knowing that your own brain 
is lying to you

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:26.000
while not being able 
to resist its commands can be agonizing.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.105
But with knowledge and understanding
comes the power to seek help,

00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:31.750
and future research into the brain

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.962
may finally provide 
the answers we're looking for.
