00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.620
- [Instructor] The word
inequality by it's very nature

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.440
at least sounds, sounds
a little bit unfair.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.300
Obviously everyone's not
getting the same thing.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.780
They're not getting the same income

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.180
or they don't have the same wealth.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.070
But the question needs to be asked is

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.940
is this necessarily a bad thing?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.660
And even if it is a bad thing,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.280
are the ways of fixing it
or trying to address it,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.400
could they make matters worse in some ways

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.420
especially for the people
that you're trying to help.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.440
And once again my goal
here is to not tell you

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.630
one way or the other,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.930
but to at least give you a
framework for thinking about this

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.440
So let's just think about

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.780
a world where he have kind
of a fixed pie economy

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.010
and there increasing inequality

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.900
is clearly not doing good for

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.180
for the people who have less resources.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.200
So let's imagine a fixed pie economy.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.360
So let's say this, this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.240
this rectangle right over here

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.200
represents the total national
income in a given period.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.140
So year one, this is the
total national income.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.310
Total national income.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.960
And let's say that in year one,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.980
the top 10% of earners,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.860
the top 10% of earners

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.250
make a third of the national income.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.800
So they make a third
of the national income.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.130
This is the top 10%.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.030
Now let me very clear.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.510
This area right over here is
not 10% of the whole rectangle.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.840
This is 35%, or actually this not

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.460
I said this is a third,
so this is going to be 33.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.080
This is 1/3 of the entire rectangle

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.400
but it's the income from the top 10%.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.110
Income from the top 10%.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.573
Now that would mean that the other 90%,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.260
other 90% is essentially splitting

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.130
the remaining 2/3 of
national income between them.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.220
So if you go, if you take this reality

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.810
and if the total pie,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.120
so let's do a static pie right over here.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.750
So pie stays the same.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.700
So pie,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.533
now I say pie,

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:15.750
I'm talking about the square thing here.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.950
I guess it doesn't look
to, to much like a pie

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.060
so we better call it a pie.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.350
So national income,
national income static,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.730
so it's not changing right over here.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.200
So then you have,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.620
let me try to draw a
rectangle of the same size,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.323
of the same size.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.520
And if you have increasing
inequality in this situation,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.160
then you might have the
top 10$ of earners by,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.063
let's just say this is year 10,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.440
year 10 right over here.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.890
Maybe instead of having
1/3 of the national income,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.620
maybe they have 50% of
the national income.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.180
I'm just picking round
numbers for simplicity.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.110
So this right over here is
1/2 of national income now

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.380
from the top 10%.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.160
From the top,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.790
from the top 10%.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.130
So clearly if this happens,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.400
the other 90% are now splitting only 1/2

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.870
of the national income.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.770
So this is the other,
other 90% right over here.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.990
So here it's essentially a zero sum game.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.580
If you had a static economy,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.900
if it was not growing at all,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.780
then of course rising
inequality would mean

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.669
that these people,
right over the other 90%

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.030
are going to have lower per capita,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.120
I think you could say
income lower per capita GDP,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.560
they're going to have a
lower standard of living.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.330
So they're not doing
good in this situation.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.570
But let's think of the other way

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.470
of where do you have economic growth.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.020
And economic growth that's enough

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.290
so even if you have some inequality,

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.930
the growth more than offsets that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.210
so that the, the other
90% is still better off.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.430
So let's se if we could visualize that.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.020
So,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.723
so economic growth.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.053
Economic,

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.440
economic growth.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.170
Now let's your pie has grown
dramatically over 10 years

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.200
and I'm just,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.670
maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.900
for the sake of, for
the sake of discussion.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.350
Let me draw them like this.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.660
So I'm trying about the same height,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.910
but now, our whole economy,

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.300
let's say our whole
economy has, has doubled.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.750
Our whole economy has doubled here.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.740
And now at this situation,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.620
let's say you still have this
wealth and equality growing.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.920
So the top 10% in year one
having 1/3 of national income.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.910
Let's say that it still grows
to 1/2 of national income

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.440
in year 10.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.360
So 1/2 of national income,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.830
so I can draw that a little bit neater.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.340
So half of national
income right over there.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.005
Half of national income, so

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.120
1/2 of national income.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.120
So this is still the situation

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.200
where you've had inequality increase

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.250
but the half of national income,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.990
that's half going to have to be split

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.637
between the other,

00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:14.320
other 90% has still grown
fairly dramatically.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.500
If we assume that I've
drawn it pretty close

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.890
to proportional,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.060
so let me just copy and paste this.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.560
So copy and paste.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.490
So this is how much was being split

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.570
amongst the other 90% in year one.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.600
And notice, it's much smaller
than how much is being split

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.820
by the other 90%

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.430
and naturally I'll put it right over here

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.690
to the other 90% in year 10.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.060
If we assume that the
population hasn't grown

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.893
by this amount.

00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:43.430
It's grown by something smaller than this

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.140
or maybe the population
has been relatively stable,

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.050
then your per capita,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.980
your per capita GDP,
your per capita income

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.700
is actually going to improve.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.210
So this is a situation here,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.030
where even though
inequality has increased,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.580
because the pie has gotten bigger,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.940
these people are better off.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.500
These people are better, are better off.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.220
And so that leads to

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.270
really one of the fundamental questions,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.340
especially when you're thinking
about economic systems,

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.210
is that you have this,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.650
you have this market system,
this capitalist system,

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.653
this market economy,

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.800
market economy

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.970
and at least in recent
history it's shown us

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.660
that hey, this is, this leads to growth,

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.040
wealth creation.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.390
So pie, so economic growth,

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.200
economic growth

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.020
but it also leads to inequality.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.450
It also leads to inequality.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.000
Inequality is an inevitable by-product.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.140
Inequality.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.620
Now the question you might have to ask is

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.610
well look, is this necessarily bad?

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.720
If this economic growth is enough,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.040
everyone is better off.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.620
It doesn't matter if some
people are even more better off

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.930
than other people but
everyone is better off

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.470
and it's important to think about

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.810
if you try to just focus on inequality,

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.360
just focus inequality,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.150
are you also going to
stop this from happening?

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.270
Another way of thinking about it.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.320
If you're one of the people in this

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.150
in this situation right over here,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.870
you're the other 90%,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.240
would you rather stay in this world

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.600
where you're in a static pie

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.660
and inequality is not increasing,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.540
or would you rather go to
this world right over here.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.860
Now once again, the point of my video

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.720
isn't to say that this world
is necessarily going to happen.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.300
There could be a world where
your total economic growth

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.200
was less than this and the pie got bigger

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.460
and these people are not as well off.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.010
But I, the whole point of this

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.130
is just to highlight that inequality

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.740
is not necessarily always going to lead to

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.470
the people on, I guess who
are getting less of the pie,

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.040
being worse off if the
pie grows fast enough

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.580
and the other thing to realize is well,

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.860
if you sometimes, you
might in an attempt to

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.820
lessen inequality,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.520
you might also stifle economic growth.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.480
And that might keep everyone
from being better off

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.770
in this scenario right over here.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.560
So once again, it really
depends on the context,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.960
it really depends on the
situation and the variables

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.620
and then the numbers you're looking at,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.530
but I really just wanna emphasize that

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.980
there's no such thing as hey,
if there's rising inequality

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.560
it's going to hurt always the other 90%.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.980
It will definitely benefit the people

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.760
who are maybe in the top 10%,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.210
but it also, because that's a
by-product of economic growth,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.833
it might make these
people better off as well.
