00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.670
(gentle instrumental music)

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.274 size:88% position:44%
We are in the western side
of the Lambayeque Valley

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.143
in the north coast of Peru.

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:12.912 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
This is an area
where, in the past,

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.015 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
many, many important
Pre-Columbian
societies developed,

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:19.252 align:start size:84% position:16%
particularly the Moche
and the Lambayeque.

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:21.087
This is an area that
is super-interesting

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.157 align:start size:81% position:19%
from many point
of views, ecology,

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.859
the creation of landscape,
the creation of culture.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.361
And in the center of everything

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.532
is this complex of pyramids
called Chotuna-Chornancap.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.002
Are we in a hurry?

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:36.836
Yes.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.806 align:start size:88% position:13%
Damaged by water,
looting and encroachment

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:43.643
is the biggest threat
to archaeological sites

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.411
all around the world.

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:49.849 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's why we are here
in Chotuna looking
at an excavation,

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:53.686 align:start size:94% position:6%
helping people like
Carlos Wester do his work.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.151
Archeologists have
always been looking

00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.022
for better ways of
doing their work.

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.156
We're very opportunistic.

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:33.993 align:start size:84% position:16%
We are in the early
stages of using drones

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.295
for this type of work.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.898
Finally we can fly
above our excavations

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.866 align:start size:88% position:13%
and take a picture
that reveals everything

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.469
that we have been
seeing from below.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.106
(light instrumental music)

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.941
Within a day, we can have
all the pictures taken

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.377 align:start size:94% position:6%
and we can have
three-dimensional models.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.747
And by the next day, I will
have a completely developed

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.916
assessment of what to do

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.952
to prevent damage
produced by water.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:02.221
So, what one drone
can do in one hour

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.156 align:start size:84% position:16%
is equivalent of
what we could do it,

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:07.627 align:start size:94% position:6%
with traditional
methods, in three months.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:08.828
Drones only fly.

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:10.062
They take pictures.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:11.530
We don't have a
real confirmation

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.232
of what is below the ground,

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:16.069
and for that, we
need archaeology.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.574 align:start size:84% position:16%
Archaeology is a
destructive process.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.276
When we dig, we destroy,

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.210
so we have to be
extremely careful

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.580
to record everything
we find in the ground.

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:04.283
We are rushing to save sites
before they are destroyed.

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:05.685
And the truth of
the matter is that

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.553
they are destroyed
on a faster pace

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:09.956 align:start size:97% position:3%
than we can rescue the
information that they contain.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.826 align:start size:84% position:16%
There are many
reasons for studying

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.828
and preserving the past.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.131 align:start size:94% position:6%
We are only the
continuation of a process

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.534
that started a long time ago.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.635 align:start size:88% position:13%
And many of the problems
that we have today

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:25.504
can only be solved
if we look back at

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:28.241
how we came to be
the way we are.
