STACIE CHAN: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.440
Welcome to another
Media Talks at Google.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.210
The Google News
team, Richard and I,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.220
are so excited to bring in
another incredibly innovative

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.900
entrepreneur in
the digital space.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.610
Steven Levy is the
editor-in-chief of Medium.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.156
And with that, let's
welcome Steven Levy.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:26.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.210
RICHARD GRINGAS:
And thanks, Stacey.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.300
I actually need to give
a shout out to Stacie,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.180
because she's done a great job
putting this series together.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.180
And we'll be doing quite a
bit more as we go forward

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.700
because we have such, I
think, great opportunities

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.210
to bring interesting people
to come talk to us at Google.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.500
So Stacie does
all the hard work,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.700
and I just get to sit up
here and talk to folks.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.160
So thank you for that.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.690
So Steven Levy has been
writing about Silicon Valley,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.350
like, before there was a
Silicon Valley, a long time.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.420
Without question one
of the most prominent,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.420
if not the most prominent,
and prolific tech

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.800
writers of our generation.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.690
He's written seven
books about everything

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.240
from cryptology, to Apple--
couple of books about Apple.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.100
And, of course,
one significant one

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.580
about Google, which with that
2011 book, "In The Plex,"

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.760
I think is generally considered
to be the definitive book

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.630
about Google.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.960
And Larry and Sergey gave
you unprecedented access,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.840
and the result was a really
superb work on your part.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.490
And we thank you for that.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.980
Of course, he's
written extensively

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.260
about Apple over the years.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.910
Besides those books, his
obituary on Steve when he died

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.760
was the most-read story ever
on Wired.com, not surprisingly.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.730
Now Steven is at Medium, as
editor-in-chief of Medium,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.540
and also created their
tech-focused Backchannel.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.210
And then we'll be talking about
some of that today as well.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.710
So, as usual, I'm going to start
off with maybe half a dozen

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.070
or so questions,
and then we're going

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.389
to open it up to the Dory
and the folks in this room.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.325
So, get your thoughts together.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.040
Given that you have
spent as much time

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.400
as you have covering the
sector, covering major companies

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.900
and getting deep inside
Google, in looking

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.870
at the state of the industry
and the ecosystem today,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.050
what do you think that Google
could do better, compared

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.650
to other tech companies?

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.230
STEVEN LEVY: Well, first let
me-- thanks to that and thanks

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.396
for that great introduction.

00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:39.320
I actually should say I'm the
editor-in-chief of Backchannel,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.700
not all of Medium.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.460
I don't think Medium
has an editor-in-chief.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.560
But thanks for the kind words,
and it's great to be here.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.470
I'm going to say
something that I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.620
think Google's been doing a
better job of over the years

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.380
but still can do better at,
and that's transparency.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.010
I think that a lot of the
issues that Google finds itself

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.470
mired in, a lot
of the suspicions

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.520
that people have about
Google, could be mitigated

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.880
with even more openness.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.250
I found Google, when I
looked into it, as sort

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.850
of like a lobster.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.290
It was sort of like
crusty on the outside.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.680
It was hard for an
outsider, generally,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.806
to know what was going on.

00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:23.680
But in the inside, it
was all soft and mushy.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.880
Everyone in Google knows
what's going on at Google.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.740
Google did a great
job of letting

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.020
the people who work there
know what was happening there.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.990
All your internal
communications,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.448
you could look up anyone and
see what they were working on,

00:03:37.448 --> 00:03:39.000
which I thought was fantastic.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.670
And giving me access was
sort of something that

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.980
was a step that Google took,
which I think helped Google.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.500
And I think that, by and large,
you do see people from Google,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.190
like, interviewed.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.060
But I think you can
go farther than that.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.280
And I think that
the more you share

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.817
the way you think with us, the
better off you're going to be.

00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:11.900
RICHARD GRINGAS: And I
think that's a valid point.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.210
I've certainly gotten
that criticism many times

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.529
from folks who say it's just
too much of a black box--

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.320
from publishers who we
work with, and so on.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.130
Now, having said that, I want to
just poke a little bit further,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.117
because I said, "in comparison."

00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:28.700
And I'm not looking
for laudates here,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.990
but we look at Apple, of
course, which is profoundly

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.830
and notoriously secret.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.320
Facebook, not so sure.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.990
Is anyone--

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.862
STEVEN LEVY: A little more open.

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.070
RICHARD GRINGAS: Who would
you say is doing it right,

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.472
for that matter?

00:04:42.472 --> 00:04:43.930
STEVEN LEVY: Well,
I think Facebook

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.690
has been more open there.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.390
I haven't talked
to them recently,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.530
but I had a streak where
I was not a stranger

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.970
to Mark Zuckerberg's office.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.390
And I wasn't the only
journalist there.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.889
In a sense, they have a
lot of radioactive things

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:07.680
they present to us.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.130
And so they understand that--
talk us to death, really,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.349
and diffuse it there.

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:17.890
You're right.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.660
Apple is super-secretive.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.120
I think they're starting to
come out of that just a little

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.780
there.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.979
You're seeing-- it
used to be-- it's sort

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.270
of like the opposite of Google.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.140
Google, for a long period,
Larry did-- his interviews

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.070
were and still are very rare.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.920
It's not a secret.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.850
It's not his
favorite thing to do.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.420
Whereas Apple, for many
years, the only person

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.060
you wind up talking to
would be the CEO, right?

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.460
So I had zillions of
conversations with Steve Jobs,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.590
but it was harder
to get conversations

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.694
with the people working for him.

00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:56.610
He said, "Oh, I don't
want people to hire them

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.820
away from me there."

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.040
And then there were
some that you would see,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.190
like the marketing people.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.580
To get in with engineers
was really tough.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.080
And I think, Google actually
does a pretty good job of that.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.250
I spent a lot of
time with engineers

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.560
and you make them present there.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.780
Some of the other ones, like
I've spent a lot of time

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.530
with Twitter.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.840
They're pretty open there.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.330
Microsoft, again, you
could spend a lot of time

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.960
with Microsoft.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.590
And I've had zillions
of dives going

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.960
through those corridors
of their buildings

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.450
there, talking to people there.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.470
You give up something when
you let a journalist in.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.490
It is a very competitive
industry, obviously,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.480
and there are secrets to have.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.540
But generally, I
think by letting

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:54.110
people know what you're doing,
they feel better about you.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.500
RICHARD GRINGAS: I'm going
to switch subjects a bit.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.720
Folks can ask more questions
about your perceptions

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.800
of Google if they'd like.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.030
But you're a
technology journalist

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.600
who's covered the
tsunami of change

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.250
over the last 15, 20 years,
including, obviously,

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.120
with the practice and
business of journalism itself.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.900
So, from your perspective,
are you pessimistic?

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.300
Optimistic?

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.960
What gets you
excited, what gets you

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.730
depressed in these transitions?

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.300
STEVEN LEVY: I'm
generally optimistic,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.625
though I have my
moments of darkness.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:39.220
I think that what journalists
and serious journalists

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.160
have to offer is so valuable
that they will always

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.752
be a call for them.

00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:48.460
There's always
going to be, like,

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.390
a need for people
to read that stuff.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.070
And get briefed on that.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:00.020
I think that, consistently,
when a journalist

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.330
produces a work of
value, dives into it,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.230
spends days, weeks, months,
working on something

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.830
carefully-- you can see
it's carefully vetted

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.620
and presented-- there's
always a response.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.310
There's always
appreciation from this.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.860
I see it at Backchannel, which
is the thing that we just

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.890
created.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.920
It went live last October there.

00:08:27.047 --> 00:08:28.880
Because we didn't have
a built-in audience--

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.421
the first really
lengthy story we did

00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:32.940
was a story by this woman
named Susan Crawford, who's

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.730
an expert on internet
access, and she's

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.557
a law professor at
Harvard, but also has

00:08:38.557 --> 00:08:39.640
written a couple of books.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.880
She did this really detailed
thing based on data analysis.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.880
Some of them were the
group that actually Google

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.360
participated with about how
the Cogent network was being

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.890
throttled in some indirect way
by Comcast because of their war

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.060
with Netflix.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.930
And it was really complicated.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.480
And it was about a 6,000
word story or something

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.497
like that, with charts
and things like that.

00:09:04.497 --> 00:09:06.330
And I thought, man who's
going to read this?

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:06.830
Right?

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.610
And it became at that time
our most popular story,

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.890
our first story really to rise
up well into six figures there.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.960
So, that shows me there's
a huge appetite for this.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.750
On the other hand,
I can't ignore

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.230
the depopulated newsrooms, and
that some of the newsrooms that

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.140
have sprung up
are full of people

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.580
who are rewriting other people's
stories and posting listicles.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.320
I think it was not a
happy moment for me

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.580
when I saw the New York Times
run a story a couple weeks ago,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.175
"Five Things You Didn't
Know About Hillary Clinton."

00:09:43.175 --> 00:09:45.090
I thought, where did
that come from, right?

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.880
I mean, what was the discussion
in the newsroom about that?

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.050
So, I worry sometimes.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.360
RICHARD GRINGAS: Well, Let's
go a bit further on that.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.050
I think what's excited
us about the internet,

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.120
particularly those
of journalistic bent,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.420
is just how open the environment
is for free expression,

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.060
far more open than
any environment we've

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.720
had in the history of
civilization, for that matter.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.480
But it's also under threat, in
some ways obvious-- governments

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.490
or issues like net
neutrality-- but others

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:22.404
in less and more nuanced ways.

00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:24.320
We talk about, for
instance, billions of users

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.910
coming online around the world.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.630
But because of data
plans or whatever,

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.210
they're using two or three apps
and the web isn't among them.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.810
On mobile, we're frankly seeing
a decline of the mobile web

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.410
in terms of time spent.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.140
We're seeing an increase
in walled gardens,

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.680
from Facebook to Snapchat and
so on, all of which are sort

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.870
of chewing away, theoretically,
at this open environment.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.980
Does that concern you?

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.850
Do you have a
perspective to share?

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.150
STEVEN LEVY: I think
it is something.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:07.180
My more parochial concern is
that just the mobile format

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.180
is one that doesn't
necessarily welcome

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:17.950
the kind of complex,
long-form articles

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:23.000
that I think are important
to understanding our world.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.150
And I'm still waiting
to see what we come up

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.550
with to make up for that.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.190
That's concerning.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.070
But in terms of
the narrowing, it

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.900
is a concern because
if just a few apps are

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.450
going to be our filters
that all journalists

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.360
for all publications have
to take them through,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.440
that's a problem.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.960
I've been watching
with fascination.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.930
I spent a lot of time with
the Facebook News Feed group,

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.950
and I've done several
articles about them,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:06.220
because I think they are
genuinely attempting to balance

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.120
what their users see.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.590
And they find
themselves in a position

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.690
where for a lot of
their users, they're

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:20.310
curating-- algorithmically,
I guess-- the world of news

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.730
that comes through
the news feed there.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.800
And they don't want the
world of news to be trivial,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.970
but they sort of paint
themselves into a corner

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.210
by saying, well, what people
click on is what people like.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.325
Right?

00:12:35.325 --> 00:12:37.650
And I invented this concept
called the dozen doughnuts

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.320
concept that I've
run by them, which

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.306
is if you go to work someplace,
and the first day they say,

00:12:43.306 --> 00:12:45.680
would you like a dozen doughnuts
delivered to the office?

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.220
You're probably going
to say no, because I

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.261
am going to put a lot of
weight if someone brings

00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:50.500
a dozen doughnuts every day.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.359
But if they just bring
a dozen doughnuts,

00:12:52.359 --> 00:12:54.650
you're going to see the
doughnuts are going to be there

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.700
and you're going to
eat it there, right?

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.720
RICHARD GRINGAS:
Particularly if you chop them

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.795
up into bite-size pieces.

00:12:58.795 --> 00:12:59.050
STEVEN LEVY: That's right.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:12:59.930
Yes, yes.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:00.740
RICHARD GRINGAS:
Posts in their feed.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.550
STEVEN LEVY: So the
doughnut holes, or whatever,

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.720
if they don't really ask
you, they take them there.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.200
They'll see you taking
it, and they'll say,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.741
wow, this guy really
likes doughnuts!

00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:09.290
Let's bring more
doughnuts there.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.200
Right?

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.180
And that's the way
the News Feed works.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.125
And they have to
get around that.

00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:16.382
And they're doing things
now like trying to say,

00:13:16.382 --> 00:13:18.340
well, maybe we should
vet some of these stories

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.372
to find out they're
not hoaxes and have

00:13:20.372 --> 00:13:21.330
them percolate through.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.896
And then a couple of months
ago they said, well, gee,

00:13:23.896 --> 00:13:25.270
maybe there's just
too much news.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.590
People aren't seeing news
from their friends anymore.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.620
And then that changes there.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.490
When what is it, 20%,
25%, 30% of the time

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.506
people spend on
mobile is Facebook--

00:13:35.506 --> 00:13:36.880
is that your
Facebook feed there?

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.110
That's an issue there.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.520
And I think it's going to
be tough, because face it.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:51.330
The publications-- an individual
app, an app for Backchannel,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.420
as opposed to Medium, which of
course has its app-- that would

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.720
be tough to compete with space.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.900
And then you have your
Backchannel app, your New

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:04.380
Yorker app, your New York
Times app, your Newsweek,

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.320
your everything.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.080
It's going to be
confusing there.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.640
So as we move to this,
we have to figure out

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.140
where you can get
your news from a range

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.610
of different places,
the same kind of range

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.810
you had pre-mobile.

00:14:23.492 --> 00:14:25.450
RICHARD GRINGAS: I know
people in this room who

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.991
are going to take advantage of
that dozen doughnuts metaphor,

00:14:27.991 --> 00:14:30.920
so just make sure to call
"Steven Levy's dozen doughnuts

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.730
metaphor."

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.146
STEVEN LEVY: I
actually have given

00:14:33.146 --> 00:14:36.220
thought to the idea of when
you come up with a meme

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.210
and things like that.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.860
And I think I've reached the
Zen state where I have passed

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.700
having it attributed to me.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.140
I was the first person to say,
"The Mother of All Demos,"

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.100
for the Doug
Engelbart demo there.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.699
And Wikipedia recognized it.

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:51.740
That's all I need, right?

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.450
Just like something
you could look it up,

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.607
but I don't need to
be cited each time.

00:14:56.607 --> 00:14:57.440
RICHARD GRINGAS: No.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.057
My father-in-law wrote the
meme, "I am Spartacus," and--

00:15:01.057 --> 00:15:01.890
STEVEN LEVY: Really?

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:02.610
Whoa.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.030
RICHARD GRINGAS: Always
it's amusing, like the,

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.696
"Je suis Hebdo."

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.740
And I say, wait, credit
where credit is due.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.010
Ain't going to happen.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.650
Let's talk about Medium.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.090
What was your
impetus in joining?

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:19.200
STEVEN LEVY: So I'd been
thinking at that point

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.700
last year-- it's a
little over a year ago

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.590
that I had this idea-- I
hadn't even actually been

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.890
at Medium for a year yet-- that
I'd been working at big news

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.400
organizations for 18 years.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.200
I was a freelancer.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:34.990
I joined Newsweek.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.300
I spent 12 years at Newsweek
when it was really Newsweek.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.930
And then took a buy-out,
like a lot of people

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.140
did, and went to
Wired, which sort of

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.570
had been an informal home for
me since the thing started.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.120
But it belonged to a big media
organization, Conde Nast.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.680
So that's 18 years during
this time of amazing change

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.965
that I was working for
the old guys, right?

00:15:59.965 --> 00:16:04.760
And I thought, wow, I'd
like to do something new.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.180
And in a way, a reaction to what
was happening on the internet

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.900
there.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.280
Because I saw it even at Wired.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.010
Wired.com ran like 50
stories a day, right?

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.460
And a lot of them were just
because they needed stories

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:18.960
there.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.290
The business model was to get
as many page views as possible

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.130
and sell ads against them.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.290
And I had an idea that, gee,
what if we did something

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.930
that we did a lot fewer stories,
like maybe even just one

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.030
day even, and said that was it.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.340
And the idea was that
our competition wouldn't

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.612
be these publications in
toto, but the best thing

00:16:41.612 --> 00:16:42.820
that those publications does.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.710
So in a given day
on Backchannel,

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.650
is my story as good as the best
story in the New York Times

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.740
business section,
or on The Verge,

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.510
or any of these
other places there?

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.220
Would that be a place?

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.230
And I'd been looking.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.850
Medium had been coming up
in my feed more and more.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.730
I'd seen a lot of
good stuff on there.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.160
And they had
professional journalists.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.900
They were paying
people to do stuff,

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.950
but it wasn't really
so much centered

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.660
around publications there.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.829
So I ran into Ev Williams,
who's the CEO of Medium.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.800
And you all know him.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.119
He was here when Google
bought his company Blogger,

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:20.260
which he founded.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.220
And then, of course,
he co-founded Twitter.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.210
And so Medium is his thing.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.710
And I approached him
at Ted over a year ago

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.360
and said we should talk.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.300
And we wound up talking, and it
wound up that I found a home.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.740
And also, I was just I
was just hungry to join

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.660
one of these internet
companies and experience

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.870
what that was like.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.490
I'd visited countless
companies there,

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.100
and one of the fun things now
is that there was always a time

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.054
when I'd visit the
company, and then I'd leave

00:17:50.054 --> 00:17:51.720
and the interesting
things would happen.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.155
They'd go to a
meeting and do stuff

00:17:54.155 --> 00:17:56.030
that they wouldn't talk
about to journalists.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.000
And so now I'm in the room
there for the interesting stuff.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.100
RICHARD GRINGAS: And I
think as you're learning,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.520
it's evolutionary,
it's experimentational,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.470
explorational, mean
there's no visible business

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.864
model underneath Backchannel.

00:18:09.864 --> 00:18:12.030
STEVEN LEVY: Although today,
actually, I have to say

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.030
is a special day for me.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.580
It's the first day that
Backchannel has turned a buck.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:15.930
RICHARD GRINGAS: Really?

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:16.638
STEVEN LEVY: Yes.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:19.300
We published a story today.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:25.790
It was sponsored by a company
that used to be Elance,

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.310
and they did a series
on the future of work.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.709
We've labeled it clearly as
done in partnership with them.

00:18:31.709 --> 00:18:32.500
You can look it up.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.980
It's written by Kevin Maney,
who is a distinguished tech

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.910
journalist there.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.100
And we've included it
in Backchannel today.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.730
And tomorrow, we
have another one

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.260
that's in partnership
with Samsung,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.490
which is an interview
with Harper Reed telling

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.690
what his pivotal moment was
on becoming who he was there.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:19:00.100
So Ev is very clear at
saying we can take our time.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.270
He believes building an audience
first, monetization later.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:07.380
But we thought it was time
to introduce a little revenue

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.680
into this world.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.030
RICHARD GRINGAS: And also, as
I think you're experiencing,

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.520
being in a startup up
means things change.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.520
STEVEN LEVY: Absolutely.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.311
RICHARD GRINGAS: And
I know recently, there

00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:20.180
have been stories of
changes in strategy

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.540
at Medium, cutbacks
in certain areas.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.570
Evan made a point in
a post about Medium

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:30.940
not being a publishing
platform but a network.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:36.280
So is the thinking to become
more of a social platform?

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.230
What's going on?

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.021
STEVEN LEVY: Right.

00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:43.010
So the way Ev explained it
was-- and everyone described

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.055
it like he woke up
one day and said,

00:19:45.055 --> 00:19:47.840
oh, we have to go
from this to that.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.470
And he pulled up the
data, which is something

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.810
he wrote early on, saying that
the things he said in that post

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.230
were things that were
always part of the idea

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.790
that it was going
to be a network.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.560
So what he wanted
to do, I would say

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.590
it's a course correction to
double-down on the network

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.560
part of it there.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.730
So the idea was never to
be a big media company,

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.110
but to use these publications,
or use the journalistic talent

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:25.760
that he hired, in the service
of building that network there.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:31.080
And again, that kind of
changes, and experimentation

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.960
is one reason why I wanted to
come to a company like that.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.760
So I think we're still
doing Backchannel.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.480
One thing that
you're going to see--

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.670
and if you look
carefully, you already

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.878
saw it-- is that we're going
to start thinking, well,

00:20:42.878 --> 00:20:46.640
what ways can we use journalism
to build our network growth?

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.840
So for instance, last
week we did a story

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.620
by David Weinberger, who's
the guy who co-invented

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.677
the Cluetrain Manifesto.

00:20:54.677 --> 00:20:56.760
He's written some fantastic
books on the internet.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.343
And he did a really
interesting thing.

00:20:58.343 --> 00:21:04.680
He compared the questions that
a CNN reporter interviewed

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.540
Bernie Sanders with after
Senator Sanders declared

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.540
himself a candidate
for president,

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.249
and then he compared those
to the Reddit AMA questions

00:21:14.249 --> 00:21:15.040
that were up-voted.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.750
And he got all the questions
from CNN and all the questions

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.830
from Reddit.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.220
And then he concluded
the crowd does a better

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.680
job of interviewing a
presidential candidate

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.200
than a professional journalist.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.390
And I ran it and changed
that to, please discuss.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.575
And I called up some people I
know-- Jonathan Alter, who's

00:21:34.575 --> 00:21:38.250
a former colleague at Newsweek;
Dan Pfeiffer, who actually had

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:42.820
written for Backchannel,
and who used to be,

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.830
until recently,
President Obama's Chief

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.480
of Communications;
Jay Rosen, who's

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.450
one of the best critics
from academia of the press;

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:58.290
Dan Gillmor; Vivian Schiller,
who until recently was

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.670
Twitter's media contact.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.440
She'd been at NPR and
the New York Times.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.900
And they responded to it.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.820
And then Craig
Newmark spontaneously

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.560
responded with
his comment there.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.150
So we brought this in and made
it more of a conversation.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.680
In a matter of fact,
Jay's comment wound up--

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.390
and the way the responses
work on Medium is really nice.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.817
If you keep writing,
it really is

00:22:17.817 --> 00:22:20.150
almost like you're posting
something original because it

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:25.230
doesn't stop you, certainly not
at 140 characters, but nowhere.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.872
And he really made
a whole post of it

00:22:26.872 --> 00:22:29.352
and we brought it into the
Backchannel collection there.

00:22:29.352 --> 00:22:31.060
RICHARD GRINGAS: Since
Weinberg concluded

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.749
that the crowd asks
better questions,

00:22:32.749 --> 00:22:34.290
I think I'll take
my cue on that one.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.272
STEVEN LEVY: OK.

00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:37.980
RICHARD GRINGAS: You
know, interestingly,

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.500
since Steven has probably
interviewed some of you,

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.300
and if not, many of
your colleagues, it's

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.040
our turn now to
poke back at him.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.640
So in the room, if
you've got a question,

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.320
we do have a microphone
that we would

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.910
ask you to use because we are
recording this, of course.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.672
I'm going to start with
something from the Dory,

00:22:57.672 --> 00:22:58.880
and that's a very simple one.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.110
What's your next book?

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.960
What are you working on?

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.140
STEVEN LEVY: So actually, when
I did this, I had a book in mind

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.960
that I put aside.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.325
It was going to be this
massive book about startups.

00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:13.450
I don't know if any of you
are familiar with a book

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.430
that Richard Ben Cramer,
a fantastic journalist who

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.720
tragically died a couple
of years ago, wrote,

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.900
called, "What It Takes."

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.750
And he did-- I think it was
the 1996 presidential election,

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:26.630
every candidate.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.600
And it was like
an 800-page book.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.460
This was going to be like
"What It Takes" of startups.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.260
And I had cast the
whole thing there.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.330
And I realized I could not
do a thing of that proportion

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.970
while I was doing this.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.870
To be honest, I've
never worked harder

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.560
than doing this
thing for a startup.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.550
That's what you do.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.050
But I've never had
more fun, either.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.640
Down the road-- and actually,
I think someone else actually

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.660
might be doing a book
very much like that now.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.709
So maybe my window
has passed for that.

00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:56.750
But there is another idea
I have which I probably

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.750
don't want to share now.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:02.390
But it's probably
a shorter book that

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:06.167
is going to run more
like a narrative there.

00:24:06.167 --> 00:24:07.875
RICHARD GRINGAS:
Questions from the room?

00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:13.000
AUDIENCE: As an author and an
observer of related industries,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.619
what do you think
about DRM and books?

00:24:15.619 --> 00:24:16.660
STEVEN LEVY: Interesting.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.900
I once had a conversation
with Richard Stallman,

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:25.211
who I met when I did my
first book, "Hackers."

00:24:25.211 --> 00:24:26.710
This was a more
recent conversation,

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.990
where he just went
for 20 minutes

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:33.940
why I should never let Amazon
do one of my books there.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:43.870
I think, philosophically,
DRM, I see problems with it.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.660
About a year and a
half, my mother died.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.710
She was an avid reader.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:55.250
She had 750 books
on her Kindle there.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.080
I have her Kindle,
but Amazon won't

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.530
let you move it over to yours.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.440
I have to keep her account
alive to keep her books alive.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.830
That strikes me as wrong.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.940
On the other hand, I
will say it's super easy

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.476
to copy a book there.

00:25:14.476 --> 00:25:16.100
Generally, by and
large, I do generally

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.880
think that convenience is the
way to fight piracy as opposed

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.470
to DRM.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:29.300
And I actually do
agree with Jeff Bezos

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.303
that-- and there's
been law suits

00:25:31.303 --> 00:25:33.480
and things like that--
that selling lots of books

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:39.210
at a lower price is
probably the answer there.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:44.570
It seems a more attractive
answer to me than DRM.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.150
RICHARD GRINGAS: I'm going to
get back to your-- since again,

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.550
you, like me, come from
a different generation.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.120
I mean, computers when I was
in college were punch cards.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.240
I believe you studied
literature in college.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.780
So what triggered your interest
in technology and technology

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.170
writing?

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.830
STEVEN LEVY: So when I went
to college, you're right.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:10.140
Literally, they
were punch cards.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.850
We had our courses.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.120
We had to hand in these
punch cards there.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.190
And the computer center was
someplace we'd never visit.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.680
It was walled off.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.470
And I went to grad
school in literature

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:28.192
and realized I wasn't cut out
for me, the work of a scholar.

00:26:28.192 --> 00:26:29.650
The teachers made
that clear to me.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.070
So one took pity
on me and gave me

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.020
an internship at
the local newspaper

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.590
in central Pennsylvania.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.110
At that point, they were
switching from hot type

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.340
to cold type, right?

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.650
The people working in
the Linotype thing there.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.830
There were some
pretty unhappy people

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.010
who used to be master
craftspeople, who were now

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.310
pasting down things on boards,
and that was the new wave.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.020
And they were pretty
unhappy and I saw that.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.880
But I loved the
writing part of it

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.510
and became a journalist writing
about all kinds of stuff.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:03.970
I was a rock critic.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.600
I interviewed Bob Marley.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.770
I covered sports
and other stuff.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.290
But in 1981, I got an
assignment to write

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.960
about computer hackers.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.766
I did a story for Rolling Stone
about it and it blew my mind.

00:27:19.766 --> 00:27:21.890
When I did my research,
the only thing I could find

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.760
presented hackers--
this was before there

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.290
was any association
with bad behavior.

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.170
They were more presented like
booger-stained curiosities,

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.700
total losers who couldn't
relate to people.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.360
But when I came out
actually to California here,

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.040
I went to Stanford, talked to
other people in the burgeoning

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.350
personal computer industry,
the people blew my mind.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.050
They were like explorers.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.620
They were adventurers.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.210
And they were so
excited about this,

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.870
and they were onto something.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.450
This was the future there.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.840
And I said, this is what
I have to write about.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:59.610
And pretty much from that point
on, the bulk of my writing

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.140
was about technology.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.280
AUDIENCE: I'm really
curious about you

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.470
and what personal attributes
you would attribute

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.630
to having done
things that you did,

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.600
like find Einstein's brain
when no one else did that,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.060
and how you knew the right
people to interview for hackers

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.580
and how you got that so right.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.315
It's fascinating.

00:28:19.315 --> 00:28:21.190
STEVEN LEVY: Actually,
it's a great question.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:26.540
I think there is something in
the personality of a journalist

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:32.270
that is a combination of
curiosity and desperation

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:37.140
which leads us to go on.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.980
Even if our personalities
in cocktail parties

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.470
might not be aggressive,
when we're on a story,

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.260
you just have to be
aggressive there.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.130
You mentioned the story about
I found Einstein's brain

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.790
when I was working for a
magazine in New Jersey.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.140
My editor told me, "Go
find Einstein's brain."

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.930
And I actually figured out
who had it, and called up

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:57.870
the guy on the phone.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.870
He hadn't talked to any
reporter for 23 years.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.410
And he didn't want
to talk to me.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:06.697
But to me, it was like every
story I wrote back then,

00:29:06.697 --> 00:29:08.530
I figured, if I didn't
get the story, that's

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.150
the end of my career.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.370
So I pushed and pushed until
he agreed to see me there.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.560
So even though I might not
be that way personally,

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.235
one-on-one, when I'm on a story,
I still have some of that.

00:29:22.235 --> 00:29:23.860
And when I was at
Newsweek, I remember,

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.410
it would just
baffle me sometimes.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.030
We would get these interns
from amazing schools.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.780
And you'd say, could
you call up these people

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.620
and see what they have
to say about x or y?

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.010
And then the next day
you'd talk to them and say,

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.040
did you make the call?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.706
And they'd say, yeah,
the line was busy,

00:29:39.706 --> 00:29:41.190
or something like that.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:42.310
And I'd say, what?

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.520
What field are you getting in?

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.476
So you have to be, I
guess in some degrees,

00:29:46.476 --> 00:29:48.225
a little bit of a jerk
to be a journalist.

00:29:50.362 --> 00:29:52.320
RICHARD GRINGAS: You say
you push and you push.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.820
I want to push you on that
with regard to technique.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.870
Some of my very closest
friends are journalists,

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.610
and it happens to
me time and again

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.140
where I find that they get me
to talk about stuff that I had

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.490
no intention of talking about.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:04.520
STEVEN LEVY: Well, I don't mean
you don't have to be pushy--

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:04.760
RICHARD GRINGAS: I
don't mean business.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.692
I mean personal stuff.

00:30:05.692 --> 00:30:07.150
STEVEN LEVY: You
could push subtly,

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.460
the Colombo kind of approach.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.751
RICHARD GRINGAS: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:09.751 --> 00:30:10.610
So come on.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.940
Share a technique or two.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.304
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:15.304 --> 00:30:15.970
STEVEN LEVY: OK.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.040
Well, one thing
is-- and this isn't

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.350
in a necessarily pushy way.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.610
It seems obvious when
I say it, but actually

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.570
if you look at
other journalists,

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.070
watch other people do things,
they don't do this enough,

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.860
is to ask a direct question.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.380
A lot of times, particularly
when it's a sensitive subject,

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.550
people beat around the bush.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.930
Like, "oh, other people
have said," or like,

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:42.050
"I've heard talk that."

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.400
Just ask the damn question.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.490
And don't be necessarily
mean about it,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.849
but if you ask a direct
question, especially

00:30:49.849 --> 00:30:51.390
when people aren't
even expecting it.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.660
They're almost bracing for you
to sort of beat around the bush

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.990
because they know what
you want to ask about.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.550
Ask the question, especially
if it's a question

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.890
that you know your readers
want to know, right?

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.840
Confront the elephant
in the room right away.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.260
The other side is
that it is true

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:13.240
that just shutting up sometimes
will let the other person fill

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:13.980
the gap there.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.170
And I remember
early in my career,

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:20.410
I'd listen to tapes when
I transcribed there.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.780
And I would sort of
to talk to myself

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.560
as I was listening to the tape.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.530
And I would say to
myself, shut up!

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.029
Shut up!

00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.900
Shut up!

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.250
You're cutting the person off.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.450
So after listening to
enough of those tapes,

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:38.222
I learned if someone is saying
something, don't stop them.

00:31:38.222 --> 00:31:39.930
RICHARD GRINGAS:
Actually, I learned this

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.070
in an entirely different
realm of negotiation.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:47.770
Same thing is let the
pregnant pause last forever

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:48.550
if it needs to.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.780
People will fill
the vacuum, right?

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.280
Don't rush in and
change your offer.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.120
STEVEN LEVY: One guy who
that technique doesn't really

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.010
work on is Bill Gates.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:03.300
Bill Gates, he uses
it against you.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.600
I went to his office once.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.870
I did the first story about
the browser wars, right?

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:13.760
Which is another phrase that
Microsoft's PR people said,

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.460
you're the first one to
talk about the browser wars.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.910
And I had just
come from Netscape

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.830
and went up to Bill
Gates's office.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.780
And my editor from Newsweek
was with me at the time.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.110
He wanted to see what it was
like to interview Bill Gates.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.160
And I started.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.610
I said Bill, I just
came from Netscape

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.340
and they're saying
you're doing this.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.919
I outlined the whole
overview of the browser wars,

00:32:36.919 --> 00:32:38.710
and so, what do you
have to say about that?

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.630
And he just sat
there, and he there.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:47.810
And, you know, time stopped.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:52.240
And finally I said, well,
while you're pondering that.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.490
But he got back to it.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:56.220
He knew.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.384
But you had to confront him.

00:32:59.384 --> 00:33:01.050
It was like a little
war of wills there.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.410
And he's got a strong will.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.430
RICHARD GRINGAS:
Well, if I might,

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.480
what was the
interaction model-- I

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.500
can't believe I used
that phase-- interaction

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.865
model with Steve Jobs?

00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:13.430
STEVEN LEVY: The
UX for Steve Jobs?

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.400
RICHARD GRINGAS: Yes, exactly.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.691
STEVEN LEVY: Totally different.

00:33:15.691 --> 00:33:17.290
So when you
interview Bill Gates,

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.790
you had to be totally prepared.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.900
If you made the
slightest mistake,

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.990
he'd use that as a way to
distract the whole thing

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.530
like there.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:30.724
Like you would make some comment
about the GEM operating system,

00:33:30.724 --> 00:33:32.890
and he would say, well
actually, it wasn't that way,

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:33.556
it was this way.

00:33:33.556 --> 00:33:37.690
And just take you down this
side road there, right?

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.350
So you had to be very careful
when you interviewed him

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:46.100
because he'd always tangle
you in a little dispute there.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.900
So you had sort of know how
to steer the thing around.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.110
Or just open the gap a little.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:55.210
Because he actually did get to
the questions there and sort of

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:59.700
understand what you needed
there, but you had to earn it.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.170
So Steve Jobs was
a self-starter.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:03.840
He knew what he
wanted to say to you.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.900
And he would go on.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.920
And so after he did his pitch
and said all the other things,

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.520
that was the time
to start asking him

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.400
the questions about other stuff.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:20.210
And I was lucky because I got
to him early in his career.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.850
Later on, it turned
out other journalists

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.540
who would ask him
those same questions,

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.498
he'd end the interview.

00:34:25.498 --> 00:34:26.570
He'd walk out, right?

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.469
But I was sort of
grandfathered in

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:32.510
to ask him a challenging
question here and there.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.580
AUDIENCE: So on that subject,
I read your "Insanely Great"

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.340
in the mid-'90s.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.929
And then at the end of
the '90s, another book

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:43.270
came out by Michael S. Malone
called "Infinite Loop."

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:47.699
And so it made "Insanely Great"
kind of look like fan fic,

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.580
almost.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.830
So how did you react?

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.679
Were you aware of
this other book?

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:57.530
STEVEN LEVY: Well, I'll
dispute that fan fic thing.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:02.340
I think that, basically,
one chapter began,

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.990
how the Mac almost failed.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.670
There was a lot of
stories in there,

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:12.320
just the whole story about
Jef Raskin getting booted off

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.700
the team.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.774
It was all the stuff you read
in Walter Isaacson's book.

00:35:17.774 --> 00:35:19.690
Matter of fact, a lot
of it was taken directly

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:22.580
from "Insanely Great" on there.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.760
So I'll push back
on that, and I'll

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.140
stand behind that as the
history the Macintosh,

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.395
not to dispute
Malone's reporting.

00:35:32.395 --> 00:35:33.540
AUDIENCE: Hi, Steven.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.320
I noticed that you
have worked closely

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.710
with generations of
great hackers, inventors,

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.040
co-founders,
founders of startups.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.860
Have you noticed any interesting
similarity or dissimilarity

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.300
among generations of them?

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.130
Technically speaking,
some of them

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.079
could be grandfathers
of the younger ones.

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:52.870
STEVEN LEVY: Right.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:56.280
Well, when I did
"Hackers," it really

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.430
was a story of
generations there.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.290
It was my first book.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.969
Again, I was running on
that engine of desperation,

00:36:03.969 --> 00:36:05.010
like, they're reading it?

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.340
Wow, this really has
to be right there.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.325
And I took on a
pretty ambitious task

00:36:09.325 --> 00:36:11.380
to really tell three
different stories there

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.190
of three generations
of hackers, beginning

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:17.200
with the very first
hackers, as we know them,

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.840
at MIT in the late
'50s early '60s,

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.910
and then went to the
home-brew computer club,

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:24.660
and finally it was
what contemporaneously

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.470
was happening.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:30.210
So I was writing the book in the
early '80s, mid-'80s about game

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:30.940
hackers.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:34.640
And on the 25th
anniversary of the book,

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.879
I went and interviewed
some people, some of them

00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:39.670
who were in the book
that I followed up on,

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.150
but some of them who would
have been in the book

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:46.030
if I had written it 25 years
later, like a Mark Zuckerberg

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.830
there.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.205
And I thought it
was interesting.

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:50.430
The one thing that
was really different,

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.710
that would have surprised
me when I published

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.970
the book in 1984 is
I actually sort of

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:59.420
had a dark outlook that
money you would ruin hacking.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.250
But what happened
was that somehow,

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.380
the idea of being a
billionaire became

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:09.540
one which was not in opposition
to being a pure hacker now.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.980
So somehow, they worked it out
where you could be idealistic,

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:19.680
and having all the
riches in the world

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.936
wasn't a conflict with that.

00:37:21.936 --> 00:37:24.300
They pulled off that
trick, which is--

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.090
RICHARD GRINGAS:
Is it fair to say--

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:27.590
I've always thought
this to be true,

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.750
but maybe I'm wrong-- that if
I had looked back at earlier

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.170
generations of
entrepreneurs, particularly

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.850
with regard to the internet,
that most of those folks

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:40.820
came into it with a passion
other than financial.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.630
In fact, most of us
back then didn't really

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:46.679
think that this was
going to be something.

00:37:46.679 --> 00:37:47.470
STEVEN LEVY: Right.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:48.320
RICHARD GRINGAS:
Yet today, it does

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.950
seem like there's a much, much
higher proportion of folks

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:53.740
who are coming into
it to pursue wealth.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.920
STEVEN LEVY: Well, but also
the idea is, everyone says,

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.760
well, I'm changing the world.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.970
But I do feel that
the idea that you

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.590
could be super-wealthy
by pursuing it,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:13.040
doesn't necessarily mean
that your vision of changing

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.800
the world isn't one which
is idealistic, right?

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.740
So look at this
company there, right?

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.480
Who could be richer
than your founders?

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.610
But on the other hand, I do
believe that they pursued this

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:30.700
from the start of their days
of Stanford saying, wow,

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.060
we can change the world.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.490
AUDIENCE: As a
writer and journalist

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.660
who interacts so closely with
people in the tech industry,

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.230
you probably bring a unique
literary and worldly background

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.420
into some these discussions.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.810
And I was wondering
if you've noticed

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.910
that a lot of
entrepreneurs and CEOs

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.565
have very strong opinions
about life, the interactions

00:38:48.565 --> 00:38:49.970
of people, maybe religion.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.531
And do you feel like these
engineers and entrepreneurs

00:38:52.531 --> 00:38:54.530
have read enough books
or should read more books

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.799
or are reading too
many books, basically?

00:38:56.799 --> 00:38:58.340
STEVEN LEVY: That's
a great question.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:03.930
I feel in general, everyone
could read more books.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:07.820
And it varies.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:15.000
I mean, some people haven't
read a lot of books.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.180
I think it's fair to say,
in general, that people

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.810
who are in their 20s
haven't read as many books

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.660
as people who came out
of college in my era

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:32.620
there, particularly when they
have such fascinating things

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.267
to occupy their minds
that aren't books

00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:38.350
that we didn't have when
we went to college there.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:40.850
So that isn't necessarily
a criticism there.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.440
Though I do feel--
I guess what I'm

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.660
sort of waiting for is
I do believe that you're

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.290
more fit to compete if you
have that kind of background

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:55.110
that I think you're referring
to there, of reading books

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.030
and getting those
lessons you can only

00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:00.590
get from that extensive
concentration in books.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.460
So I'm waiting for the
recognition that that's so.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.330
So the people who
really want to get ahead

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.690
are also going to spend a
lot of time reading books

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:12.621
there as an advantage
over their competitors.

00:40:12.621 --> 00:40:14.370
AUDIENCE: Venture
capitalism has certainly

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:18.660
changed a lot over the time
that you've been reporting.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:22.790
And it seems that now, there may
be more motivation financially,

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.880
but there's also a
lot more impatience.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.550
If you haven't become a huge
success within 18 months,

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.300
well, maybe you
shouldn't be doing this.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.656
How do you see that changing?

00:40:31.656 --> 00:40:33.030
And do you see
that as a problem,

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.430
or is there a solution to that?

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.560
STEVEN LEVY: I think,
look, an entrepreneur knows

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.460
what he or she
gets into when they

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.000
do VC, when they take VC money.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.890
As it turns out, it's
super-well documented.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:54.580
The stakes to get in
and build a company now,

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.370
what you have to bring
financially to it

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:58.530
are lower than they've
ever been there, right?

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.810
So there's a little
more leverage

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:04.240
that the entrepreneur
has over the VCs.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.310
And I think, really, if
you look at the time frame,

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:12.250
though, in the late
'90s, man, people

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:17.070
were going public and
doing things for liquidity

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:21.150
way earlier than they are now.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.120
There's any number of
places that didn't even

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.710
have a viable business
plan, let alone

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:30.440
a penny of revenue,
that went public and had

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.739
not great outcomes from that.

00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:34.030
RICHARD GRINGAS: What did
you think about the situation

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.890
with Secret, and not just them.

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.630
But as you said,
they're not necessarily

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.920
going to the public markets.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.870
But we're in this
interesting arena

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.180
now where people are raising
vast amounts of money

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.160
against valuations that may
or may not be plausible,

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.930
also founders taking
money off the table.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.710
STEVEN LEVY: Well, it's all
to be expected when you're

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.350
playing a lottery game, right?

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:02.130
So the VCs, and especially
the seed investors,

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.860
will tell you their
model is based

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:09.940
on a couple of hits out of
100, which more than compensate

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:14.470
for the vast majority of
the ones that don't pay off.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.880
So that stuff is
just to be expected.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.140
I think it's a good thing.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.940
I think, really,
it's a positive thing

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.790
that we found out all this about
Secret, because now there's

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:28.870
more of a stigma to cashing
out and buying a Ferrari,

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:30.620
and maybe we'll see a
little less of that.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.744
RICHARD GRINGAS: Before we
go to the next question,

00:42:32.744 --> 00:42:34.650
I'll pull one from the Dory.

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:37.560
Speaking of writers, which
fiction writers do you think

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.819
have the most interesting
insights about technology?

00:42:40.819 --> 00:42:42.360
STEVEN LEVY: You
know, Thomas Pynchon

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.020
is really on top of stuff.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.970
It was interesting and not
a surprise to me, really,

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:54.630
that his most-recent book was
about Silicon Alley, right?

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:58.370
I actually used a
passage from him

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.740
in the epigraph of a book
about artificial life

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.240
where he was writing
about something

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.660
that seemed to be, to me at
least, about cellular automata.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.350
AUDIENCE: I think you mentioned
that the range of news sources

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:12.510
was getting more limited now
because of mobile devices.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:14.710
So just wondering,
what do you think

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:19.570
about how mobile
devices and fast news

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.934
has affected media in general?

00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:25.350
STEVEN LEVY: I don't think
we've seen the full impact yet.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:31.950
I think there's still
a lot of newsrooms

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.620
that are operating at a lag.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.610
It's like the Wile E. Coyote
running past the cliff.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.700
And I guess in
recent years, we've

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.780
seen that moment happen
where, whoops, there's

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.650
nothing propping
up Wile E. Coyote,

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.420
and there's a plummet there.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.500
I think in mobile, we've seen
that moment happen on the web,

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.980
but not quite yet
in mobile there.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.210
I don't think we've gotten
the full impact of that format

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:00.135
there, let alone figured
out a way around it.

00:44:00.135 --> 00:44:01.760
RICHARD GRINGAS: I
also think that when

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.120
we look at patterns of
content consumption today,

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.340
people look and say, oh, gee,
it's all about cat videos,

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.840
and so on and so forth.

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.000
But I sometimes think we've lost
our sense of comparative scale.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.590
Like we see someone like the
Guardian or BuzzFeed with 200,

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:22.780
300 million uniques, as
if, somehow, those folks

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.740
are interested, theoretically,
in serious content.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.750
I mean, if you look
back in history,

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.390
during the heyday
of mainstream media,

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:33.270
the percentage of
our population who

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.770
actually consumed content
from those vehicles

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:37.540
was comparatively small.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.950
STEVEN LEVY: Right.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:41.585
I mentioned it
before, but I think

00:44:41.585 --> 00:44:44.580
it's worth
re-emphasizing that there

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:50.430
is a hunger for well-reported,
well-researched, well-written,

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.840
long-form stories.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:58.630
When I was at Wired, I came
to favor a kind of story

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:01.970
where I'd do a deep dive
into a product right

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.205
before it was launched.

00:45:03.205 --> 00:45:06.470
And I did one for a couple
Google products there, right?

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:13.370
And people really appreciated
that, as opposed to getting

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:17.180
the quick takes the
day after, or based

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:22.175
on the product announcement
or a briefing the day before.

00:45:22.175 --> 00:45:24.550
AUDIENCE: You've reported on
lots of successful startups,

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.424
but my question is, what
makes startups fail?

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.610
STEVEN LEVY: Well,
there's a lot of things,

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:36.850
but mainly they've misjudged
who is going to like it.

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:40.820
They don't have the
lesson that the people

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:42.630
in the original
Macintosh team had,

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:46.780
saying, build a product
you really want.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.550
Sometimes they'll do
a product and saying,

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.370
those people might like
something like that.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:58.250
But I think that you have
to see if it's really

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.044
great to understand it there.

00:46:01.044 --> 00:46:02.460
RICHARD GRINGAS:
I do think timing

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.855
is a not insignificant factor.

00:46:03.855 --> 00:46:04.980
STEVEN LEVY: Oh sure, sure.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.960
RICHARD GRINGAS: And if
you look at the history

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.070
of entrepreneurship, how many
ideas that are successful today

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.114
were actually surfaced
10, 15 years ago.

00:46:13.114 --> 00:46:14.780
Different time,
different circumstances.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.060
STEVEN LEVY: Point well taken.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:21.000
I did a big story about the
tablet computer, Bill Gates's

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.980
and Microsoft's
tablet computer there.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.150
Besides the stylus, which was
not a great idea, and Windows,

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:32.140
which was not a great
idea for a tablet,

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:35.065
it looked a lot like the iPad.

00:46:35.065 --> 00:46:37.190
AUDIENCE: So what is the
brightest idea you've ever

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.249
had that miserably failed?

00:46:39.249 --> 00:46:41.040
STEVEN LEVY: The
brightest idea I ever had?

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.090
AUDIENCE: That failed miserably.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.340
STEVEN LEVY: Hmm, interesting.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:51.417
I know there were some.

00:46:51.417 --> 00:46:52.750
AUDIENCE: You forget about that?

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:53.570
STEVEN LEVY: Hm?

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:56.570
AUDIENCE: You forget about that?

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.230
STEVEN LEVY: Yeah.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:00.680
I don't know.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.250
Nothing, I guess--
clearly the fact

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:06.030
that I haven't been able to
come up with it right away,

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.405
even though I know
they're there,

00:47:07.405 --> 00:47:10.390
shows that I've probably
gone back and erased it

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.510
from my memory there.

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:23.090
I think that at Newsweek, there
were any number of dead ends

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:29.760
that I pursued and
tried to sell them

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.970
that didn't work out there.

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.900
I will say one thing,
because I don't

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.070
want to get away without
saying anything embarrassing.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.960
I had a column for Rolling
Stone for a little while

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.579
in the early '80s and talked
about technology and everything

00:47:46.579 --> 00:47:48.120
from television and
things like that.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.245
And I was reporting on the
brand-new channel called

00:47:50.245 --> 00:47:54.520
the Weather Channel, which I
thought would be a total flop,

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.550
it would never last.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.965
And the headline was,
"When it rains, it pours."

00:47:57.965 --> 00:47:58.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.772
So I've gotten
some things wrong.

00:48:00.772 --> 00:48:03.230
RICHARD GRINGAS: Yes, but what
you weren't thinking of then

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:04.604
was the number of
people who were

00:48:04.604 --> 00:48:07.450
willing to equip vans with
videos and chase tornadoes.

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:08.200
STEVEN LEVY: Yeah.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.330
That was before that.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:10.310
RICHARD GRINGAS:
The Weather Channel

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:12.020
is hardly about the
weather anymore,

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.108
except as a meta for a story.

00:48:14.108 --> 00:48:15.805
STEVEN LEVY: Right.

00:48:15.805 --> 00:48:18.180
STACIE CHAN: Steven, you said
when you were a journalist,

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:18.820
you were always sort
of the outside--

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.361
STEVEN LEVY: When
I was a journalist?

00:48:20.361 --> 00:48:23.060
STACIE CHAN: Well, you work for
Medium now, so it's different.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:23.700
It's different.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.200
And you said when
you joined Medium,

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.459
you were excited to
now be an insider.

00:48:27.459 --> 00:48:28.250
STEVEN LEVY: Right.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.140
STACIE CHAN: But as you said
your background is still

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.940
editorial, you're
still a journalist.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:35.390
What insights are you
providing the product managers,

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:37.360
the engineers that you
don't think they quite

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.610
grasp because they don't
have the editorial background

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:41.532
that you have?

00:48:41.532 --> 00:48:43.740
STEVEN LEVY: I think that's
one role that we do have,

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:48.120
the journalists who are working
at Medium, do provide there,

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.280
is that.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.450
To say, hey, here's
what we did here.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:56.240
This could have been better
if the product did x or y.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.350
So for instance, the
thing I mentioned

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:01.680
before where we got a lot
of comments-- responses,

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.400
actually-- to the
David Weinberger story.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.420
It surfaced some
ways that I felt

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.340
we could do responses better.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.410
And I'm writing a thing on our
internal version of Medium,

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:16.145
called Hatch, with some lessons
that we can learn from that.

00:49:16.145 --> 00:49:17.020
AUDIENCE: Hi, Steven.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.810
I'm just wondering if more
media publications, kind

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.730
of like Backchannel,
you mentioned earlier,

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:24.339
will look into doing
sponsored content.

00:49:24.339 --> 00:49:25.130
STEVEN LEVY: Right.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:29.240
Well, I think, as I said,
we started it today.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.900
And I think it's
one way that you

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:39.870
could do ads and get out of the
chase for just clicks, right?

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:43.860
One thing I'm proud of that
we have at Backchannel--

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.110
and I think this goes for a
lot of Medium in general--

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:50.800
is we don't lure people to the
page with misleading headlines.

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.370
Our bounce rate is super low.

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:56.280
But for an advertiser
point of view,

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.980
if they're just
looking at page view,

00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.650
that's just as
worthwhile for them

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:04.415
as spending a long time on
a page reading something

00:50:04.415 --> 00:50:06.000
and getting something
out of it there.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.980
So in this case, if a sponsor
is going to be clever about it

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.100
and bring up something
which is inherently

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:16.260
interesting to people
but somehow illuminates

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:21.100
their product, their
field, it's a win-win.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:29.220
And it helps us support, in
theory, the kind of journalism

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:34.970
that everyone loves in an era
where the business model still

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.770
is-- I think it's going to end,
but it still is bringing people

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:39.390
to a page and clicking on it.

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:40.440
RICHARD GRINGAS: What
are your favorite sources

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.560
of long-form tech journalism?

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.920
Just so we have it on the tape.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.680
STEVEN LEVY: Well,
look, I have always

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.380
been a lover of Wired magazine
from the time it started.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.920
I think Businessweek is doing
really good work these days.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.820
I'm really encouraged that
a lot of the online sites,

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.000
which did not start
doing that, are

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:11.070
doing quality long-form there--
BuzzFeed, Business Insider.

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.620
Even though that might not be
the majority of their content,

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.040
they're investing in
long stories there.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.530
And of course, sometimes
people like Clive Thompson,

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:23.890
who writes for the New
York Times Magazine.

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.685
There's lots of bylines
I always look for.

00:51:26.685 --> 00:51:28.060
RICHARD GRINGAS:
And I last night

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:31.620
read a great 12,000 word article
on ISIS from The Atlantic

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.020
on my phone.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.230
So it can be done.

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:35.450
STEVEN LEVY: Excellent.

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:37.150
RICHARD GRINGAS: I just want
to thank you for being with us.

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:38.950
This has been an
interesting hour,

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:41.510
and we just look forward to
your continued great writing

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:42.415
and insights.

00:51:42.415 --> 00:51:43.900
We really appreciate it.

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.500
STEVEN LEVY: Thanks, Richard.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.624
RICHARD GRINGAS: Thank you.

00:51:45.624 --> 00:51:48.450
[APPLAUSE]
