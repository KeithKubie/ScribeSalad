00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.180
Subclassing was really easy when we were using the functional pattern here.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.370
But let's explore how we might do this if we were using the pseudo-classical

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.420
pattern for our base class.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.780
How do we go about writing pseudo-classical subclasses?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.830
For practice, let's start this program from scratch.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.558
It'll be good to build up the program one line at a time, anyway.

00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:21.790
Since the pseudo-classical code we're about to write is going to look so

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.170
different from the functional code we already wrote.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.300
Furthermore, let's use some different sample code in our run.js file.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.110
It'll be easier to think about this if we're only instantiating one instance of

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.980
the superclass and one instance of one of the subclasses.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.100
So just like before, Van is a subclass of Car.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.640
Amy is an instance of van, and this new zed object will be an instance of a car.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.980
We won't examine the cop class here, or any instantiation of it,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.190
because we only need to see one example of a subclass to make the point.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.900
By reading this first line of code,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.520
I can tell that I'm going to need a car function to make instances of cars and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.350
it'll take an input to use as a location for the new car.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.190
Inside the Car function we will do the work that is specific to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.160
one instance of a car.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.830
In this case, adding a property that should be different across all cars.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.510
But what about that move property that Car instances like zed appear to need?

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.290
Take a moment to decide where you think you would add that functionality for

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.910
this pseudo-classical Car class.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.200
Edit the car class so

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.050
that it exhibits the move function that we remember from before.
