1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello, David. Here we go.
We're live. We're, we're
doing it. Yes, we're doing it.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,420
I'm nervous. I'm nervous. Don't be, I
enjoy your show. I really do. Thank you.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,320
It's a pleasure to watch you. You're very
smart guy, man. You, and like I said,

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,650
we were just talking about it.
You're very reasonable in this world.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,750
I think there's so much of this,
the youtube political world,

6
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,950
the youtube commentary world where people
are so fucking toxic, you know, there's,

7
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:30,330
there's so much negativity, there's so
much what they called dunking on people.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,450
There's so much dunking and you do a
little Dunkin. Some of it's warranted.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,650
It is warranted. Yes. But I don't
know if it's beneficial, uh, to the,

10
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:40,980
to the people doing the dunking.
Yes. Or even to the cause.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,830
I think it is temporarily,

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,450
but sometimes it's good because it showed
that mocks people's positions and it

13
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:50,610
makes people realize, yeah,
that is a ridiculous position.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,580
So if you're on the fence or if you're
not really quite sure how you feel about

15
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:57,120
things and you see someone get mocked
for ridiculous position that maybe you

16
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,880
even shared for a little bit.
Right.

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,160
Maybe maybe haven't explored it deeply
and you see someone who has explored that

18
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:06,330
deeply sort of expose all the flaws
in this line of thinking it's good.

19
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:11,331
But my thing when I interview a lot of
people on the right and a lot of people

20
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:17,590
on the left and I just hate
all this conflict that I,

21
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:22,530
I'd say the unnecessary
conflict I think is when you,

22
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:27,531
when you watch television today and
you see Antifa fighting with the,

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,660
you know,
Trump supporters and all this,

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,800
all this weird conflict.
I don't,

25
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,840
I don't necessarily think that
most of it is, is necessary.

26
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,610
Necessary. Well I think the devil's in
the details. Yeah. So like as an example,

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,370
if you want to bring together,
I don't know,

28
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:50,940
people who are on opera opposite
opposite sides of the climate debate for

29
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:53,550
example. Good luck, I'm sure. Right? Well,

30
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:58,551
why is part part of that you could argue
is if one side just does not accept

31
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:01,380
science, how can you really
bring those people together?

32
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,990
It doesn't mean you need physical
conflict to resolve it. In fact,

33
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,740
I completely agree with you. The physical
conflict is totally counter productive,

34
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,830
but at a certain point on some issues,

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,920
I understand why there's
like an intractability to
the debate where it seems

36
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:19,620
completely impossible to move forward
because whichever side you're on,

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,160
I would argue that I'm on the right
side of these issues and others would

38
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:23,994
disagree.

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,800
When you're far apart in a way that you
can't even agree as to like what the

40
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,980
starting point facts are about
the conversation. How do you even,

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,140
how do you start? I have some ideas as to
how I try to do it, but it's very tough.

42
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,050
It is very tough.

43
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,030
I just don't think dunking on people
always like constantly shitting on people

44
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,223
is necessarily the way.

45
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:44,961
Yeah,

46
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:49,130
and I think it's important to distinguish
between just straight up ad hominems

47
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,170
where someone is wrong and bad,
uh,

48
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,790
because I think they're a bad person
or they're an idiot or whatever to

49
00:02:55,791 --> 00:03:00,610
recognizing when somebody is a
participant in bad faith in a conversation

50
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,010
to when someone has maybe fallen prey to
audience capture or whatever else might

51
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:10,780
be kind of influencing what,
what and how they're doing.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,970
I think that those
criticisms are legitimate,

53
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:17,410
but you got to stay away from just
ad Hominem. Yes, yes, I agree.

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,650
And I think that it's just so
common today. It's, it's, it's,

55
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:25,450
it's also extremely attractive.
The, the Youtube Algorithm,
uh, you know, as far as,

56
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,350
um, comments go, I mean,

57
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,110
it actually kind of encourages it
and so does Facebook. So it does,

58
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:36,700
you know, anytime there's a social
media platform that is add dependent,

59
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,240
one of the best ways to get people to
engage is to have something they disagree

60
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,890
with so they can get angry.
Yes.

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,640
Until it becomes no longer brand safe
according to whoever's running the

62
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,600
platform. Right. I mean,
you go back to April,

63
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,600
2017 where I woke up and saw that my
youtube channel made 19 cents the previous

64
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,370
day. And I text Kyle Kalinsky and I
say, I think there's like a glitch.

65
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,400
Is it like it says I made 19
cents? And he says, he says,

66
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,610
I made 35 cents or something like
that. Uh, something's going on.

67
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:13,990
And it was the beginning of like an
apocalypse 1.0 and that was a rough three

68
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:17,380
week period. And uh, so, so you know,

69
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:21,640
encourage the debate and the battle of
ideas so to speak in all of this stuff

70
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,480
until advertisers get worried
and they say, oh, you know,

71
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,450
our ads are showing up on stuff that's
a little bit touch and go for us.

72
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,780
That's a weird one to me because um,
I,

73
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,990
youtube has always been a
secondary thought for me.

74
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,230
The first thought was the audio version
of the podcast and in fact when we were

75
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:43,360
uploading it to youtube at first I
was like, why are we even doing this?

76
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,260
I guess why not?

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,490
Some people probably want to watch it
and then somewhere along the line it

78
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:53,320
became at least close to as
big as the audio version of it.

79
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,380
And then maybe even more significant
because one of the things that the youtube

80
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:02,290
version has is the comment section,
which is often the fucking dumpster fire,

81
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:07,291
but it at least there is some sort of
like a community engagement aspect of it

82
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:11,470
that doesn't really exist in iTunes.
Like an iTunes, it's sort of,

83
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,780
it's in a vacuum. Right? Sure. Um,

84
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,100
but when the ad pocalypse thing
happened, I was like, hmm,

85
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:21,400
what was going on here? Like
wasn't, it wasn't my primary focus,

86
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,050
so it wasn't terrifying.

87
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,910
But people that only did
youtube and people that relied
on that for their living,

88
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,030
I mean it was, it's a huge blow.
It was huge. And at the time,

89
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,050
I'm trying to think back,

90
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,560
I think maybe like around 30% of my entire
shows revenue was coming from youtube

91
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:42,640
at the time. So it was not everything, but
it was still significant. Right. I mean,

92
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,850
I've staff and overhead and all
of that stuff, so just overnight,

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,800
30% going away is huge.

94
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:51,070
And that's why I've tried to move
to the model of telling my audience,

95
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,420
you can skip all of this stuff.
You know, even, uh, uh, some
of these other, you know,

96
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,890
super chats and all of this other stuff.

97
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,050
Like we run a membership
program on my website,

98
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:04,100
I control a hundred percent of it. So
it's not a patriot and you are on Patrion,

99
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,960
but it's not big for us.

100
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,850
The way I think about it is as long as,
I mean, listen, yeah, there's, you know,

101
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,030
marijuana companies that are having
trouble even processing payments.

102
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,430
But assuming like stripe and paypal,

103
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:19,790
don't say you can't even accept
payments anymore. David Pakman,

104
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,690
I control the entire process
on my website. So when
people pay their six bucks,

105
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,830
all but 2.9% gets to me.
And when ad apocalypse happened,

106
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,820
I saw it as a maybe blessing in disguise
and that I can now explain to the

107
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:35,900
audience, here's the problem with
these algorithms. Here's the problem.

108
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,430
When it goes from,

109
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,630
I am fighting white supremacist
content to an algorithm,

110
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:45,950
can't distinguish between that and
white supremacists content. Right?

111
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,010
That's bad for me. Right. When
I interviewed Richard Spencer,

112
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,630
I obviously don't agree
with Richard Spencer. Uh,

113
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,530
but can an algorithm figure
out that there's a difference
between an interview I

114
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:00,830
do with Richard Spencer and white
nationalist propaganda? I don't know.

115
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:05,060
But we can kind of get around all of
that if you just go directly to me.

116
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:08,330
And that's why my focus has been growing
that those direct members you interview

117
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:12,500
Richard Spencer. Yeah. Did you
get shit for that? Yes. Yeah.

118
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,970
That's a weird one. Right.
And you know, um, I'm sure
you're aware of that, uh, that,

119
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,690
what is it called,
data and society that can,

120
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,200
whether there was a woman who
made a bunch of connections,

121
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,780
like Joe Rogan knows David Packman
and Joe Rogan also knows Alex Jones.

122
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,550
Alex Jones wants to be friends with
David Pakman. Like the math sort of,

123
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,510
it was like one of those
minds and it was really weird.

124
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,140
It's like guilt by association.
I saw a couple of them.

125
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,300
There was like an initial one
which made be thinking of,

126
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:45,260
then there was a map of like the youtube
sphere specifically left middle and

127
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,700
right or something like that.
Yeah.

128
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,510
And this idea that everyone's like on a
part of a grand conspiracy to help each

129
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,670
other out and push right ideology.

130
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,590
Even though you know a lot of people
that were labeled as right. Art, right?

131
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,610
Like who like me, Oh,
I'm not writing at all.

132
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,930
My sense is you're politics
are pretty left on most stuff.

133
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
Um, although I don't, I mean,

134
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:11,720
I don't know you personally
beyond just seeing your shows. Um,

135
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,680
but maybe the critique is based on,

136
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:17,420
because I think that those maps were
based on what is the youtube algorithm

137
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,250
suggesting. And so that may not be
in line with your personal politics.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,260
Maybe what we're talking about,

139
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,250
like if you're interested in conflict
and if you're trying to get engagement,

140
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,270
that's the way to do it.

141
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:33,140
Like in a few youtube out
youtube algorithm is constantly
suggesting people like

142
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:35,390
Ben Shapiro, right? Gavin
McInnes or whatever.

143
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:38,120
And those videos come up over
and over again. Sure. And I mean,

144
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,140
so a lot of those people's
channels do really well on youtube.

145
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,820
So if you interview someone
who has a channel themselves,

146
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,710
there's a very good
chance that the algorithm,

147
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,500
if they're watching your interview
with that person, will say, well,

148
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,740
here's a lot of their stuff.
And then once you click there,

149
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,710
the algorithm very quickly
starts to build a picture of,

150
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,100
of every individual user.

151
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,700
If you watch your interview with Ben
Shapiro and then it takes you to a daily

152
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:06,990
wire video, then it takes you to like the
daily wire, second string or guy, right.

153
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,950
And then you're off. Who knows where,
right. It's all machine learning. Right?

154
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:15,150
I mean that's one of the most
part. Yeah, that's a, it is.

155
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,430
It's a troubling aspect of that thing
that they do where they suggest the next

156
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:24,540
videos, which didn't use to be a thing.
It used to be you would go to youtube,

157
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,320
you would watch a video, right? And then
you would go find another video. Right.

158
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,800
They didn't suggest anything.
And then somewhere along the line,

159
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,390
I don't remember what year it was,

160
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:36,990
but this started happening and then they
started auto playing the next video.

161
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,680
Auto play.
Yeah.

162
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,680
I think there was some kind of
recommendation thing very early on,

163
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:46,770
but initially it might have
been restricted to just
other videos from the same

164
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,270
channel you're watching probably,

165
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,290
and at a certain point it started
to recommend other things.

166
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,100
And I don't know if you look at your
analytics and see what percentage of your

167
00:09:56,101 --> 00:10:00,360
views are coming from that
recommendations feed from other stuff.

168
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,950
Um, but it's significant for a
lot of youtube channels. The,

169
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:09,951
the tagging your videos and getting the
right metadata on them in order to bring

170
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,730
an audience is an important thing.

171
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:14,640
So it's a double edged sword in some
sentence it sounds, sounds like,

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,750
but to get back to what you were
saying about so rich labeled you owe is

173
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,240
Richards. Okay. Yeah, I was going to
say it. They labeled you as right,

174
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:24,480
but you're not right. Do what other
ones? It's disingenuous. I mean,

175
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:26,040
I've said it over and over and over again.

176
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,110
I've never voted for a
Republican in my life.

177
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,680
I've voted independent for Gary Johnson
just because he did my podcast. Okay.

178
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,740
I wasn't happy with Clinton and I
wasn't happy with Trump. I was like,

179
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:38,040
this is gross. I'm just going to
vote for Gary Johnson. I mean,

180
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,080
I didn't think he was going to win.
You know,

181
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,700
he had almost no chance when he didn't
know what Aleppo was. Right. I was like,

182
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,770
that was his, he was his
scream. You know, like, uh,

183
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:51,570
what's his face from New Hampshire?
Howard Dean. Howard Dean. Yeah.

184
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,150
Well voting in California also.
I S I assume you've,

185
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:57,410
I'm sure it wasn't going to Joe. Yeah. Um,

186
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,420
but people conveniently,
we'll just as,

187
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,580
or they'll say that like
you're a Trojan horse.

188
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,890
They like a pretend left wing person
who's really just pushing right wing

189
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,320
ideologies. I'm like,
well which one? Which,

190
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:14,120
which right wing ideologies that gay
marriage is it, what is it? I put,

191
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,330
I'm on the left on everything except
maybe a second amendment right.

192
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,510
I think the criticism that um,

193
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,840
could be levied if one wanted to make it
into a criticism would be if you engage

194
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:31,770
with right wing ideas and that
you don't agree with, right.

195
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,130
Like I take you at your face,
you know,

196
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:35,650
at face value that you don't agree with
a lot of the stuff that you're right.

197
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:40,651
When guests say one could
make the argument that by
not challenging those ideas,

198
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,230
it's implicitly lending
them more credibility than
maybe you think they should

199
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:51,000
have. That's interesting because
what I try to do with people, um,

200
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,220
unless something, say someone saying
something egregious, I try to let

201
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,530
them talk.
I want to know how they feel.

202
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,540
I want to know what
their thought processes.

203
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,920
And so instead of just challenging on it
on everything, I want them to elaborate.

204
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,010
Right.
And I feel like by doing that,

205
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,910
I get a sense of how they've come to
that conclusion and whether it's logical,

206
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,920
right? Whether it's a,
when they're, they've,

207
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,950
they've actually used their thoughts and
they've really calculated and thought,

208
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,230
this is the position I take. And this is
why. And I, a lot of people don't know,

209
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:25,030
there's a lot of, a lot of the times we
challenged people in their positions,

210
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:28,930
you find out like they don't really know
what the fuck they're talking about and

211
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,580
that the best way to find that out as the,

212
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:33,220
let them talk like Candace
Owens on climate change,

213
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,910
right? That was, I mean, there's
the Socratic method of questioning,

214
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,380
which is why do you think that? And how
do you know that that's true? Et Cetera,

215
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:44,660
et cetera. And sort of some other
questions that come from it. Uh,

216
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,450
which I do as well. Um, I
mean I think, I don't know to,

217
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,930
to tie it to the Richard
Spencer interview that I did,

218
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,640
some of the criticism I received after
was from people on the left. I mean,

219
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:54,941
the people,

220
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,690
I would assume it was most of the people
on the low for doing the interview. Yes.

221
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,180
Or for what I said in the interview
for what I'm doing it. Okay. Yeah.

222
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,410
For doing the interview at all.

223
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:05,590
The criticism was more from the left
for what I said in the interview.

224
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,600
The criticism was more from the right,

225
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:09,190
from people who just agreed
with Richard Spencer,

226
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,430
like what things did they agree with
that it is inevitable that people with

227
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:20,401
different ethnic or religious backgrounds
simply will not be able to coexist

228
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:23,500
together peacefully and we're better
off trying to figure out how can we

229
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:28,501
separate people based on their
membership in ethnic or religious groups.

230
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Separatism.
I mean literally separatism.

231
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,753
That's sad.

232
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,680
That's a sad thought that you just can't
get along with people that do other

233
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:40,080
things that are interested,

234
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,180
interested in other things that come
from other places that have different

235
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:45,790
religions that have different
points of view. Like why,

236
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,100
uh, the Oh, well they, they
have a series of, uh, you know,

237
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:53,550
decades of what they call
scholarship supporting their view.

238
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,710
But for the context of my interview,

239
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,080
I made it abundantly clear that I didn't
agree with that stuff. Right. Yeah.

240
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,870
And my view is,

241
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:03,390
and everybody can have a different
view about how they do interviews.

242
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:06,630
My view is if I just allow the,

243
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,920
what I consider to be disgusting views
to be spread out, right. You know,

244
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,360
like a spray bottle to spray them
everywhere, not do anything else. Uh,

245
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,850
I can't say that I'm doing
something that I think is valuable.

246
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,510
I don't feel like it's
valuable. So my, my approach is,

247
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,400
are the ideas known enough
to be worth refuting?

248
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,150
That's number one.

249
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:32,150
If it's some weird conspiracy theory that
has not even any following whatsoever,

250
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,470
I'm probably not going to choose to even
entertain it because it's irrelevant in,

251
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,430
in sort of always.

252
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,780
So my first question is it was Richard
Spencer relevant at the time outright was

253
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:47,100
rising, this guy was considered by many
of the sort of creator of the outright,

254
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,090
he was growing a following in the
context of the Trump candidacy,

255
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,960
the time or maybe administration.
I don't remember when exactly it was,

256
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,160
it was I think 2016 or,
I'm trying to remember when it was.

257
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,560
I don't remember when I first heard
his name. Yeah. But how did he become,

258
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,750
how did he come to prominence?
I don't know the sequence,

259
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,610
but I think he had a wet,

260
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,640
an alt right website that had
articles of some kind and then,

261
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,640
um, he, that website became
more known and the fucking term,

262
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:20,180
so talk the alt right,
you know,

263
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:23,310
all left the centrist,
like all these,

264
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,720
all these different labels or talk
about issues. I agree with you there.

265
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,680
So clunky. But, so, you know, first
thing was I did want to interview him,

266
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,000
but if I had felt that I
wouldn't be prepared to make
it abundantly clear that I

267
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,310
don't agree with the guy.
And I think his ideas are terrible.

268
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,420
I wouldn't have done the interview yet.

269
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,440
So the problem I had with the critiques
from the left of me doing that,

270
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,790
some who said, the last thing we need
to be doing is giving this guy a voice.

271
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,920
That's often how they say it,
or a platform.

272
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,630
My response was this guy's getting
interviewed in lots of other places that

273
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,060
aren't even challenging him.
Right.

274
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,810
I'm at least making an attempt here to
get something in the record that there

275
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:02,480
are arguments against these ideas.
These are bad ideas.

276
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:06,170
And I don't want to be part of the
diffusion of just the ideas themselves.

277
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:07,280
I'm gonna have to,
I'm going to be pushing back.

278
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,850
I'm going to have to watch that
note. Now. When you did do that,

279
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,260
like what was his response
was during the interview,

280
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,400
what was his response to your push back?
Uh, I mean he had answers, you know, he's,

281
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:19,250
he's, he was well prepared.
I don't know if they're,

282
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,630
they were unique or new
arguments that I was making. Um,

283
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,470
but there was no argument to be made
that I was letting him just parrot white

284
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,810
nationalists talking points on a post,
which I wouldn't,

285
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:32,780
I just wouldn't feel good about that.
It's not how I do interviews. Yeah.

286
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:36,640
And then the left was upset that you're
giving him air quotes, a platform,

287
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,760
very small portion of the left. I just
want to be super clear. Let's go left.

288
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:44,000
I mean my audience is very left. Almost
everybody understood what I was doing.

289
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,210
10 years ago I was interviewing
the Westboro Baptist church.

290
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,750
Most people understood what I was doing.
They were more prominent at the time,

291
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:54,410
but there was this sliver of the left
that just didn't want the conversation to

292
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:58,580
take place. And I always struggle
with this because as you can see,

293
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,610
I have no problem criticizing
that sliver of the left.

294
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,940
My concern is getting like overly wrapped
up to criticisms of the left that are

295
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:12,650
only held by these like niche
slices. Yes. And that's why,

296
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,370
um,

297
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:18,050
I try to avoid going further than
necessary into those criticisms.

298
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,490
Like I think there are more serious
critiques of the left to be made, um,

299
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,690
beyond anti speech or want
to limit speech or whatever.

300
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:29,930
I mean that's, that's a pretty
big issue. Well, I don't,

301
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:33,350
I don't actually agree that it exists
on a significant portion of the left.

302
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,060
Like I think a bigger issue,
for example,

303
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:38,030
like if you said what is like a serious
issue that the left needs to contend

304
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:38,864
with right now?

305
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:44,170
I would say a more serious issue
is if you look at the progressive

306
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,350
accomplishments of the early 20th century,
for example,

307
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,380
like 19 five to 1925 and the new deal
accomplishments that the left had in the

308
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:57,390
time of Fdr,
what was different,

309
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,450
I think then than the left now is that
you didn't have to be completely in line

310
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:06,690
with a specific set of policies or ideas.

311
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,120
And I worry that now there's a little bit,
um,

312
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,250
of the left maybe having this idea that
if you're not in line on all of these

313
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,680
issues, whatever the
checklist is, so to speak,

314
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,980
you're not really worthy of being a
participant in what is clearly a leftward

315
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:28,830
move in sort of the average
Americans political orientation.

316
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,050
I don't want to see that prevent progress.

317
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,900
Right? Yeah. That's the, that's the
hard tribalism, right? That's worth the,

318
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,490
the line gets drawn. You're with us or
against us. And there's one way to think

319
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,010
there is,
there is a lot of that.

320
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:44,100
I mean I saw it with healthcare
recently with healthcare.

321
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,090
I don't think that you can make any
serious case from the left that healthcare

322
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,670
is fine and the for profit employer
connected system that we have is working.

323
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,400
Like I, I don't think there's any
progressive case to be made for that.

324
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,090
Where people will differ is what about
Medicare for all versus some other system

325
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,980
system that looks more like Canada's
or the UK or Germany or whatever.

326
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,400
And I've already started to
see like when I say on my show,

327
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,370
I'm kind of agnostic on this,
like the system we have as a disaster,

328
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,620
we need a system that will
get coverage to everybody.

329
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,730
The the numbers can be made to work any
number of different ways we've looked at

330
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:21,090
it,

331
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,770
but 80% of people on Medicare I believe
it is have some additional coverage.

332
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,070
They either are still working part time
or full time and get coverage that way

333
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,870
or they're poor enough to be on Medicaid.

334
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,420
The point is medicare for all
doesn't solve every issue.

335
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,720
It's way better than what we have, but
here's like a dozen other possibilities.

336
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,790
Looking at other countries,

337
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,780
there is a portion of the left that
doesn't like that because I'm saying I'm

338
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,880
against Medicare for all.
I'm not saying that.

339
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,660
What I'm saying is there are a number
of different ways to improve upon the

340
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:48,961
system.

341
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:53,961
We have all of which sever
this relationship between
usually your employer and

342
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,420
these for profit insurance companies.
Y'All yet we'd be open to them. I really

343
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,420
don't understand private citizens that
don't want easy access to quality health

344
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:08,690
care for everybody. That confuses
the shit out of me. Like,

345
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:13,070
have you ever been hurt?
Have you ever been sick? Have
you ever been broke? Right?

346
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,660
Do you want to be broke and have no
access to healthcare? No one does.

347
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,140
No one wants anybody to care about to
not have access to health care of all the

348
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:22,670
things that we concentrate
on this country,

349
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,260
there's two things that drive me
fucking crazy that people just dismiss

350
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,700
education and healthcare. The idea
that you have to like my buddy Greg,

351
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,860
Greg Fitzsimmons,
he's sending his kid off to school.

352
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,050
How much did he say that it was?

353
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,030
65 or $65,000 a year for both of his kids,

354
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,140
for each of his kid. So you know,
he's got two kids that that's,

355
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,520
that hurts my head.

356
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,690
Even about spending
$130,000 a year just on,

357
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:56,710
if you're a regular person with a
regular job, how the fuck do you do that?

358
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,920
Impossible. It's impossible.
It's so much fucking money.

359
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:02,830
And then that's not
even paying for housing.

360
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:06,340
And Food and transportation and books
and everything else that you're going to

361
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:07,174
need to.

362
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,450
And to make it more difficult for young
people to succeed is one of the worst

363
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:16,480
ways to make a stronger country.
If you want to see a strong country,

364
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,240
you want educated people that
get to pursue their dreams.

365
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,370
And the idea that we are so willing
to spend so much money on these costly

366
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,640
regime change wars and flying troops
overseas to these places that they don't

367
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:33,010
want to go. No one, no
one wants it to happen.

368
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,640
And it's trillions of dollars
and people are fine with that.

369
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,020
But you talk to them about some sort of
socialize education system and people

370
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:42,940
freak out and think you want
to turn us into Communist.

371
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,000
Well I think what is really important
to understand is that the facts you just

372
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:50,810
laid out don't matter to people who
see this as an issue of what do people

373
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,120
deserve?
What do they deserve?

374
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,810
So if you say to a fiscal conservative,
you know,

375
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:01,640
if you consider the amount that the
employee pays for premiums plus the

376
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:05,970
employer, plus your copays, a
plus Co insurance, right? You,

377
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:09,500
you put it all together into some
amount and you explain to them.

378
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,470
There's lots of great analyses that
have been done which tell us that with

379
00:22:12,471 --> 00:22:14,120
roughly the same amount of money,

380
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,330
maybe small payroll tax in addition
with roughly that same amount,

381
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,220
it all could be done with a single
payer system that covers everybody.

382
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,390
It's the same.

383
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:26,390
You're taking all of these individual
risk pools where you have different

384
00:22:26,391 --> 00:22:30,500
for-profit insurers and then you have
systems for people that don't have enough

385
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:33,980
money. Medicaid, you have systems
for people that are over 65 medicare.

386
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,280
You put it all together,
you spread the risk far wider.

387
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,740
The employer no longer has to
pay their part of the premium.

388
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,550
The employee no longer pays part of
their premium to the for profit insurance

389
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:48,120
company. The numbers work. They're still
not going to say, you know what, that?

390
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:50,300
That sounds great. It's actually
pretty fiscally conservative.

391
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:54,800
Let's do it because at some point there
is a portion of the right that just

392
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:58,100
doesn't think people have earned
healthcare. They just haven't earned it.

393
00:22:58,101 --> 00:23:00,170
They have education or
education. Yeah, that's right.

394
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:05,171
And it's very hard to change people's
minds when that's their view.

395
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,480
I think it's might be George Lake off
who I believe calls it strict father

396
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,743
morality,

397
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,870
which is like how would a really strict
father treat a child who comes to them

398
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:21,410
and says, Hey, you know what? I figured
out a way that we can all have healthcare.

399
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,770
The strict father, even if the
numbers make sense, would say,

400
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,390
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

401
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:29,930
You haven't earned that health care
either because you don't work or you don't

402
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:32,930
make enough money or you're on disability,
whatever the case may be.

403
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,090
How do you convince someone
to change their mind when
that's the world worldview?

404
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,970
Yeah. How do you, when it's a,

405
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
an ideologically based decision and
the you're on team our or team l,

406
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,160
you know what, which uh, which group of

407
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,860
ideas do you adopt? Right. Ah,

408
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,800
in the UK system sucks.

409
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,590
Need you talk to people that get
health care over in the UK it's socks,

410
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,910
but at least they have a system.

411
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:58,430
It's just not the same quality
health care that you get in America.

412
00:23:58,431 --> 00:23:59,570
Same with my friends in Canada.

413
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,660
I have friends in Canada that have come
down here to get surgery because they

414
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:06,230
find better doctors over here because
the Paul was going to Canada to get his,

415
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:09,530
um, uh, operation. That was, why
was that? Why did he do that?

416
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,800
The best places in Canada, the best place
for Hernias for that type of hernia,

417
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,110
I believe. Yeah. Hmm. I
mean, here's the thing,

418
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:20,000
even in saying the UK system and the
Canadian system, neither one is that good,

419
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,550
right? Those two systems are
totally different, right?

420
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,780
So if I fucked the whole socialized
medicine, they are both, well, yes,

421
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:30,590
in some sense. I mean, the Canadian system
is administered at the province level.

422
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,080
So the province is sort
of like the market.

423
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,620
Instead of having all these submarkets
attached to individual for-profit

424
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,880
insurers at the provincial level,
uh, that's how it's organized.

425
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,930
The UK has a, the national health
service where they're actually,

426
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,840
they don't actually run
the healthcare facilities,

427
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:50,600
but they're the ones who
are contracting them.

428
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:54,110
So it's sort of like the
health care facility still, uh,

429
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,700
isn't own entity.

430
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:59,180
It's not that you're going
and the government is the
employer of the doctors so

431
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:02,870
to speak, but they're contracting
with the health care facilities.

432
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,410
But the point I want to make is that
there are criticisms of all of these

433
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:08,090
systems,
but there are different ones.

434
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,530
So when we say the British and Canadian
systems aren't that good, right,

435
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,130
let's figure out in what
ways each is not that good.

436
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,040
Because there are different ways, whether
you're talking about health outcomes,

437
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,240
early detection, cost
per treatment, whatever.

438
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,260
You really have to drill down and figure
out in what way are we saying it's not

439
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:32,150
as good. Yeah. What I'm saying is
that there is no perfect system.

440
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,950
There is no perfect systems are right,

441
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,980
but I believe that most of the best
doctors in terms of like North America at

442
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:41,180
least,
or in the United States,

443
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,270
I'm sure there's probably some very good
doctors in Canada that do specialize

444
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:49,520
medicine, but I think really good
doctors are incentivized by profit.

445
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,451
I really do.

446
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:54,230
I think there is some motivation for
if you spend so much money for medical

447
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,270
school and you,
you bust your ass,

448
00:25:56,271 --> 00:26:00,290
you want to make a lot of money and some
of the best doctors earn a really good

449
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,190
living, then I think, I
think limiting their, uh,

450
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:08,420
their ability to earn that money won't
incentivize people to be excellent.

451
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,660
So a couple of different things.
I mean, number one, to be clear,

452
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,750
we're just now starting to get into a
little bit of broader economic philosophy.

453
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:18,680
Like I'm a capitalist, I'm, I'm for
social democracy, which is a mixed system.

454
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:22,370
That's a capitalist system that
says we're going to invest, uh,

455
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,960
tax revenue in a particular way to make
sure that no one falls below a certain

456
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,620
level. So I, my, my, just
to contextualize that,

457
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:34,250
my point of view is not from one
of becoming a socialist country.

458
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,890
So I think we share those
views. I think. So. Um,

459
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,840
a lot of doctors will say
that even though on sort of,

460
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:44,190
on paper,
in a socialized

461
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:49,120
medicine system, they might make less
for a particular procedure, for example,

462
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:49,963
or something like that.

463
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,410
A lot of them are still in favor of those
systems because it would drastically

464
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:56,730
reduce their overhead.

465
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,120
So there's all of this apparatus that
includes medical billing and coding both

466
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,080
on the insurer end and at the healthcare
provider and the hospital and the

467
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:11,160
insurance company both are battling over
what is it that was done right and what

468
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:15,030
are the codes that apply here and how,
what are our reimbursement rates?

469
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,420
There's fraud when it comes to that.
Um,

470
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,460
and that requires an apparatus
for investigating and
adjudicating that that adds

471
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,630
more and more cost.
So I don't think it says easy.

472
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:31,680
I don't think it's as obvious that under
those systems, at the end of the day,

473
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:36,420
a doctor that owns a PCP,
a group for example,

474
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,240
or an orthopedic clinic or
whatever the case may be,

475
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,280
I don't know that it's that clear that
they end up taking home less money. Hm.

476
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,710
That's interesting. I'd wonder if in
practice that would play out that way.

477
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,120
I mean,

478
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,170
maybe I'm talking about just like high
end orthopedic surgeons that do knee

479
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,050
surgeries for athletes and
things along those lines.

480
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,880
They often would be outside of whatever
insurance apparatus we were talking

481
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:03,450
about anyway. A lot of those folks are
often being paid out of pocket anyway.

482
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,420
So it's less in belief,
some at least some.

483
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,330
So for the average person's experience,
I think it's less relevant.

484
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,600
Yeah. Um, then there's also liability
insurance, which is extremely expensive.

485
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:16,930
That's a giant issue with, with
doctors. It's a huge expense.

486
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,040
It is. Yeah. I mean I
think it is necessary. Uh,

487
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,110
there's a question as to whether
it's organized in the best way.

488
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:28,460
I know less about that component than
some of the other ones, you know? Um,

489
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,110
th th th the education and healthcare,

490
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,340
those are the two things that I think we
can both agree we need to invest money

491
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:38,940
on and we need to figure out some way
to make that more accessible. Yes. Yes.

492
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,310
And I don't understand
people that don't think that.

493
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:44,840
And if that's what that is the
strict father mentality, that just,

494
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:49,170
the only thing that it makes sense to
me is that you don't want people who are

495
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:52,890
kind of half ass in college
did that can just get in.

496
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,730
I think that that comes up a lot. Yeah.
And you hear about so called Free College,

497
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,640
which isn't free. It's where we're saying
we're paying for it through taxation.

498
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,330
Really important to point that out.
It's, it's just not for everybody.

499
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,960
And that's okay. I mean, I think that
that, that sometimes gets lost. Yes,

500
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,310
yes. There are more and more jobs
that require college degrees.

501
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,840
Even though you could make the case,

502
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,120
maybe the college degree
is not actually necessary,

503
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:20,650
but it's a way to sort of thin the herd
of applicants in order to just make

504
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:24,010
hiring, uh, you know,
more, more practical. Um,

505
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,150
but I do think that it's okay to say
that college isn't for everybody,

506
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:31,480
but the same ideas that apply
to so called free college,

507
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:34,990
meaning college paid for through
education could apply to trade school.

508
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,820
They could apply to retraining programs.

509
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,630
There's a whole bunch of other ways that
it could be done. Yeah, no, I agree. Yeah.

510
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:42,070
I just,
the

511
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,210
college is not for everyone.
Thing is more true now than ever before,

512
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:49,360
particularly with certain
technology studies.

513
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,890
You're learning things during your four
years at a university that are just

514
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:57,340
going to be completely outdated by
the time you graduated in what kind of

515
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:01,270
program? For example, Jamie, what he
did with audio engineering. Oh I see.

516
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,250
You went to school for audio engineering.

517
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,080
By the time he got out it was all useless,

518
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,370
but that was not a four year bachelors
program. Right. It is now. Oh it is now.

519
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:12,430
Okay. When I went there, it
wasn't available for that.

520
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:16,150
But since then they have made that
available and that's also in the time that

521
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:18,910
youtube has made basically
education free for a lot of people.

522
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,470
Sure.
So I mean I think with that,

523
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,880
the issue is in my mind that when you
consider the cost relative to the earnings

524
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:31,840
potential,
as you pointed out,

525
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:35,090
when you're talking about $68,000
a year or you know, whatever it is,

526
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,760
guest taught at Boston college and I
think it was like 64,000 or something like

527
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:43,800
that. Um, depending on what
field you're going into, it's,

528
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:47,710
it's almost impossible to
pay that off ever. So some,

529
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:49,690
at some point something needs to change.

530
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,040
And this kind of gets us into the
technological automate automation and

531
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:58,690
unemployment stuff of what happens as
computers and technology start to replace

532
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,040
jobs. And that's where I think there's a
pretty clear line between a free market

533
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:07,210
capitalist, a Social Democrat
like myself and actual socialism.

534
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:10,210
Like what should happen with the gains
that come from those technological

535
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:13,810
advancements. But as far as the
education piece is concerned,

536
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,570
so it's completely
unsustainable the way it is.

537
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,590
No,
I knew about you before this happened,

538
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,630
but then I really kind of got on board
with you when someone was trying to get

539
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:28,260
you fired from Boston University. And I
remember some college, Boston College,

540
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,500
sorry. And I tweeted it and I was
like, right, like what? What is this?

541
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:33,630
This is craziness.
So it's a woman named [inaudible],

542
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,370
Amy Siskind, who, I don't
know. Other than that incident

543
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,910
where you had a disagreement about
something, it wasn't, it wasn't toxic.

544
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,600
It wasn't hostile, I would
think. Said I didn't lose that.

545
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:48,400
Explain what you said and what she,
what she had said that you disagree with.

546
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,930
So we may be able to

547
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,260
even find the tweet,
but she tweeted something that just being,

548
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,573
um,

549
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,240
that she would not be supporting any
candidate in 2020 who's white or male.

550
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:06,320
I think that that was the gist of it. And
I responded, I'm going from memory here.

551
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:10,970
The gist was something like,
isn't that the definition of racism?

552
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:15,110
You're sort of preemptively excluding
someone from consideration on the basis of

553
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:19,820
race and in that case, gender, if it was
white and there it is right there. Uh,

554
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,683
yeah.
There's a court,

555
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:25,070
I will not support white male candidates
in the den primary unless you slept

556
00:32:25,071 --> 00:32:27,710
through midterms.
Women were our most successful candidate,

557
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,960
biggest dem vote getters in history.
Obama,

558
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:34,040
oh eight Hillary 16 white male
is not where our party is at.

559
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:38,750
Entities are at least safe
option in 2020. Right. So I said,

560
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,550
isn't something not progressive

561
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,180
about preemptively dismissing a
candidate based on their race and gender?

562
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,270
I feel like there's a word to
describe that as a progressive.

563
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:50,690
I won't be jumping on board. Yeah.
So you can explode basically.

564
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:54,090
Didn't even say it's racist,
right? You said there's a
word to describe that. Yeah,

565
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,720
and that's a very polite way
of disagreeing with someone.

566
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,750
I thought it was polite and she
tried to get you fired. Yeah,

567
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,650
she contacted as far as I
know, so. Okay. I don't,

568
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,510
I'm going by what she said.

569
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:10,460
She said she contacted Boston college
and told them not to allow me to teach

570
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:14,360
there. That's insane. And Boston
College, since I've just an adjunct,

571
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm not on staff when I'm not teaching,

572
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:21,320
like during the three months of the
semester I'm employed there and the other

573
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:22,160
nine months I'm not.

574
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:27,161
So I think Boston College said he's not
currently employed here and I think that

575
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:28,730
that's basically as far as it went.

576
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,980
But I did talk to some other faculty
there who were aware of the thing that was

577
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:34,814
going on.

578
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,170
That's a crazy thing to do just to think.

579
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:44,060
So it's a nasty mean thing to do to like
what someone can't disagree with you.

580
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:44,990
And it's a very good point.

581
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,640
I think she probably got upset because
you made a very good point and tweets

582
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:51,500
started coming her way
and a lot of people,

583
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,180
they read those fucking comments and
people get toxic in those comments. Yeah.

584
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,630
Random strange people that you don't
know and then you're forced to, you know,

585
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,710
look at their opinions and their
criticisms and their insults.

586
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,860
That incident started me down the path
of drastically limiting my social media

587
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:11,820
use. Good for you. Yeah, I mean that,

588
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:15,290
that was the beginning and then it became,
I mean,

589
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,800
you know this way more than I do because
I think on all platforms you have

590
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:23,480
roughly 10 times the following that I do,
no matter what you do post or whatever,

591
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,490
if you look at what the feedback is,

592
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:30,800
it's extraordinarily toxic and
horrible negative stuff that is only a

593
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:34,070
distraction to what I'm trying to do.
And most of it probably isn't,

594
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,910
but I hadn't evolved on yesterday
number all Brown Mckenna. Yeah.

595
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,070
And one of the things that he
brought up this so, so huge,

596
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:43,730
it's so true is that you
can have 10 positive things,

597
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:47,670
but that one negative will outweigh
the 10 positives in your mind. You,

598
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,280
me and your mom. Absolutely.
Yeah, absolutely.

599
00:34:49,281 --> 00:34:54,110
Especially if you're a person who's
self critical or a self, uh, objective,

600
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:57,350
you're analyzing your behavior.
Was that good? Was that bad? Right?

601
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,480
Then you read that one bad
comment. Fuck, are they right?

602
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,870
You don't read all the people
that say you're great. Oh
brilliant. Loved it. Yeah.

603
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,720
Fuck you. Loser. Oh, absolutely.

604
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:07,910
I mean when I announced I was
going to be doing your show,

605
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,860
if you look at what the comments were,
almost all this is awesome.

606
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,940
Great Wing voice talking to
Joe Rogan. Go get him. David.

607
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,620
This is such a great opportunity. I can't
wait to watch you face plant. Oh Geez.

608
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,930
And that's the one where I'm
like, man, are they right?

609
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:27,890
Like I'm not going to money in
a face plant. So I don't know.

610
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:30,170
I'm just trying to limit the
amount that I'm on social media.

611
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,310
One thing I am doing though because I
mean my show is in part as successful as

612
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:38,760
it is because of social media.
So it, I can't that right.
You don't have to engage.

613
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,030
I don't have to engage.
And I also can just say,

614
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,410
I will check our networks in the morning,
then I'll spend the whole day,

615
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,131
I'll do my show,

616
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:49,890
I'll do what I need to do and then
before I sign off for the evening,

617
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,240
I'll check it [inaudible] right.

618
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,940
Because what if you read the worst shit
right before you eat dinner and go to

619
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:57,520
bed? Well know it'll be like 5:00
PM so you'll have five hours,

620
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,990
30 hours to cool off it and
it's way better. And weekends,
I'm almost, I mean, uh,

621
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,930
people are like, David, you're
still treating on the weekends.

622
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,450
A lot of those are like prescheduled
tweets where I'll just sit and schedule

623
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:10,980
some stuff and I am trying to stay off
it and it's been really great. I mean,

624
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:13,320
it's been a fantastic, looked
at our phones yesterday. Uh,

625
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:16,520
we did a sober October podcast
with my four friends. Yep.

626
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,640
We looked at our phones to look at phone
usage and I use my iPhone four hours a

627
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:24,480
day on my phone for hours a day
and like, fuck. That's a lot.

628
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,410
What app did you use to measure it? It's
something on your iPhone. Oh, okay. Yeah.

629
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:31,380
You have a android. I'm sure they
have a similar thing. Yeah. Yeah.

630
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,070
Four hours of screen time. I'm
like, Ooh, that's not good.

631
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:37,740
They're adding that to the a computer too,
so it's going to combine.

632
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,690
You'll know how much you're
looking at all screens soon. Yeah.

633
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,820
What if you're writing? Well, I was
going to count that kind of sure.

634
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,420
Work staring at the screen.
That's how it worked. Pitch. Hey,

635
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,440
that's what the argument you guys are
making for the phone just as birth.

636
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,500
Sorry man. Yeah. Well Burt's arguments
not good because he doesn't even write.

637
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,610
That's ridiculous.

638
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,170
One thing I did that actually is useful
is I used to have my social apps on the

639
00:36:58,171 --> 00:37:01,860
home screen and cal Newport
and some others have said got,

640
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,000
you've got to get rid of those.

641
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,990
He actually advocates getting rid of the
apps all together so that you have to

642
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:11,160
go on a computer and choose to
go to facebook.com or Twitter.

643
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,170
I haven't gotten there yet,

644
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,220
but even just removing them from the
home screen makes me significantly less

645
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:18,450
likely to even pull them up.

646
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,040
It's two clicks to swipe up and
scroll over to the APP. Right.

647
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,460
But even just getting them
off the homescreen keeps me
off of them significantly.

648
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,040
That's smart. That makes sense. Yeah.

649
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:33,870
I need a certain amount of access to
those things with my business. Right.

650
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,490
Scheduling shows and things
along those lines, but yeah,

651
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:40,020
it's not good for you.
I mean,

652
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:45,021
I think one of the biggest realizations
is that people don't really miss you

653
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:47,530
that much. They don't hear
from you for a couple of days.

654
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,200
Like that's one of the things where
the idea of needing constant engagement

655
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,040
comes from sort of like a
slightly narcissistic point
of view where like people

656
00:37:56,041 --> 00:38:00,360
are going to notice if I don't tweet
for from Thursday night until Monday

657
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,350
morning or do anything. Right.
Right, right, right. They
really don't. They don't.

658
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,230
They don't. There's a lot of other
people to pay attention. Yes, there are.

659
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,920
There are a few people
that tweet on you that,

660
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:12,190
that are kind of crazy and that want to
hear from you all day long. Yeah. Yeah.

661
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,800
But they'll get used to it. They'll
get used to you. They will vanishing.

662
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,500
And I don't know, I mean, cal
Newport has, have you had him on,

663
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:25,290
he wrote deep work and then more recently
he wrote digital minimalism and he

664
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:29,520
goes into detail about just the effect
of, uh, uh, write it down on my phone,

665
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:34,020
but it feels sacrilegious to put that as
a take it out right now. Yeah. I mean,

666
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,910
he goes into detail this stuff
and just about, you know,

667
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,500
we need more uninterrupted periods of
concentration for what is the book called

668
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:45,580
again?
Deep Work and then digital minimalism.

669
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,460
And they're both, I interviewed
him recently. Really just
solid, very solid stuff.

670
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,570
Awesome. Yeah. Um, what were
we just about to get into? Oh,

671
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,210
so when he says this woman,
Amy Siskind,

672
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:02,200
did you reach out to her when she did
that? And privately? Yeah. No, no.

673
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,180
Did you read a job publicly?
Uh,

674
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:07,690
well you did publicly declare that you
try to get you fired, right? Yes, I did.

675
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,190
Did she respond? I don't know cause
she blocked me. Oh God dammit.

676
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,140
She blocked you over that. Yeah. Geez us.

677
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,370
That is so sensitive.
And what,

678
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,330
what is Twitter for? Right?
Is it just to fall in line?

679
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,800
Is it just to agree with
everything someone says with
no questioning whatsoever.

680
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:33,490
What's extra interesting about
it is she blocked me on Twitter,

681
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:37,960
but then I treat my Facebook
profile basically as public.

682
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,680
So I post stuff on there. It's the same
whether you're friends with me or not.

683
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,730
And I had posted something
totally innocuous about,

684
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,340
I was at a restaurant or
drinking an espresso on it.

685
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:49,300
I don't even know what it was.

686
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,580
She showed up there and commented that
she had called Boston college and told

687
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:57,490
them not to, you know, not to
hire me or to fire me or whatever.

688
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,230
Honestly hosts about you
having an espresso. It was
just a personal posts. Right.

689
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:07,060
But the point she determined that the
exchange was worthy of blocking me on

690
00:40:07,061 --> 00:40:07,894
Twitter.

691
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:12,640
But then she came to my
personal Facebook page and said,

692
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,160
I'm calling Boston college
and telling them to fire you.

693
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,980
There's a word for that.

694
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,270
God, that's really a few. This is a
gang, but there's a big one. Yeah,

695
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:29,200
this is a four letter one that I just
don't understand why someone would want to

696
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:31,930
do that to someone. Why? Why
can't you disagree? Why can't you,

697
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:36,931
and she's just upset that you pointed
out a glaring problem with what she was

698
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:40,540
saying. Yeah, I apparently, and
you know the thing is I don't, I,

699
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:45,130
the way I operate, I don't think even
necessarily that she's a bad person.

700
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,450
I just assumed that she has, you
know, some emotional thing going on.

701
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:51,430
She could have had a terrible
date as far as I know,

702
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:54,190
someone near and dear to
her died that day. I am.

703
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,480
If someone near and dear to me died,
I wouldn't go.

704
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,670
Wouldn't be necessarily be on Twitter
or your Facebook post about you drinking

705
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:03,730
an espresso fair, fair tote.
People. I've tried to get you fired.

706
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:06,190
But my approach is I just,

707
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,570
I really do assume most people are
pretty good people and even when we have

708
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:11,404
disagreements,

709
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,240
I tend to give the benefit of the doubt
that if we could only talk the way we

710
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:20,380
were doing, we could figure out 95% of
the disagreement. Maybe not all of it.

711
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,470
Right. But most of it. So I don't
pick Roger. I mean, yeah, I don't, I,

712
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,520
she behaved in a way I wouldn't behave,
but who knows what she had going on.

713
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,720
You know? I mean it's, yeah. Well it
didn't get you fired so it's not that bad.

714
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:35,000
But if it did that would have horrible,
it would have been a different situation.

715
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,510
Would have been probably a good publicity.
Yeah. I probably would. Helps you.

716
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,530
I think so. You got excited
about that. It's funny,

717
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,980
the reason I'm thinking back actually to
a conversation I had at the time where

718
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:49,790
someone said to me, uh,
if you do get fired,

719
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,630
it's the best possible thing that'll
happen. Right. It would just be fantastic.

720
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,330
And it didn't, cause I wasn't
actually employed there at the time.

721
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:57,620
That's the irony of it.

722
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,150
Well, this is the thing,
the the falling in line,

723
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,950
the no room for deviation from
the ideology. Sure. This is a,

724
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:08,560
this is a giant issue that I have
with both, both parties. It's,

725
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,850
and I think that's one of the reasons
why people were in these parties to begin

726
00:42:11,851 --> 00:42:12,240
with.

727
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,190
I don't necessarily think that people
have clearly thought out every single

728
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,860
aspect of whatever part
of they align with.

729
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,270
I think they fall in line and they adopt
a predetermined pattern or behavior

730
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:28,440
that seems to be attractive at the time
and then they fall in line with whatever

731
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:31,470
that party is saying. I think that
is a giant percentage of people.

732
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,120
When someone deviates from that,

733
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:37,500
like you did someone who is also clearly
a progressive and clearly a left wing

734
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:40,800
person and you're criticizing
something and very,

735
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,630
very politely and that,
that she just goes haywire over that.

736
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,950
That's the thing,
right?

737
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:51,951
It's like are you responsible for the
people who also comment on your post and

738
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,060
this is,

739
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,560
this is where we're getting to this like
vox thing that's happening with Steven

740
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,980
Crowder right now. Right. Are
you responsible for the reaction?

741
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,480
To what you post because if you look
at what Steven Crowder said to that,

742
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,020
if we don't,
people don't know the story.

743
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:12,290
Steven Crowder got into it with this
guy who is a writer for Vox who,

744
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,510
uh, is he's gay. His
Twitter handle is gay Wank,

745
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,110
right? Told us Mazda. Yeah. So it's
not that he's hiding that. He's gay,

746
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,380
talks about it all the time.
He's kind of a feminine.

747
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:30,620
And Steven Crowder mock that and he
mocked that in these videos where he was

748
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,600
criticizing Carlos,

749
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,670
his position on Antifa is
specifically what I saw.

750
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,640
And in doing that, he called him, uh,

751
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,970
this queer Mexican, this like, and
he's doing it in a ribbing way.

752
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,020
He's doing it in a joking way.

753
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:54,410
And then Carlos Mazda posts all these
horrible tweets that came his way.

754
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:59,430
And apparently he got docs. So people got
his phone and they were saying debates,

755
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:03,210
Steven Crowder, who was getting all
these text messages in and all this,

756
00:44:03,211 --> 00:44:07,140
a hateful stuff that was coming his way.
So the question is,

757
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,500
who is responsible for that hateful stuff?

758
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:14,910
If Steven Crowder calls
him queer is what is queer.

759
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,840
Okay. Is Lbgtq. What do we do there?

760
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,790
What do we do if the queue is,
is he is,

761
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,020
is it okay to call someone
gay who identifies as gay?

762
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:29,370
If he calls him the gay little
Mexican, is that, is that bad?

763
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,040
Like what is,
how bad is like what is that?

764
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,480
You know what I'm saying? But so do you
feel what I'm saying here? It's like,

765
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:37,380
do I know where you're getting at? Let's
zoom out a little bit and then we'll,

766
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:40,110
we'll get into this man.
Where do you even start with this?

767
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,270
Because there's a lot to unpack here,
right?

768
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,680
If we will analyze the specifics
in a second maybe. But first,

769
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,520
if you look at the policy,
the terms of service of Youtube,

770
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,400
there's a verge article from
yesterday before, a few days ago,

771
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:57,660
earlier this week before youtube had
made the decision to demonetize Steven

772
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:57,841
Crowder.
Well,

773
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:01,740
they made the decision to not act initial
say that it didn't violate the terms

774
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,020
of services.
And then today as I got in here,

775
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:07,020
Jamie informed me that they made
a decision to demon. That's right.

776
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,860
So in the article where they
made the decision not to act,

777
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,200
they actually put what Youtube [inaudible]
terms of service are with regard to

778
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:19,860
bullying and harassment. My reading
of it, and we could go through them.

779
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:22,260
If we could pull them up, we could go
through it line by line if we wanted.

780
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,850
My reading was that the, that definitely
did break the terms and conditions.

781
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,080
That was my view as I looked at what it
was that was done by Steven Crowder and

782
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,240
what the terms of service are.
Just matching it up,

783
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,720
not looking at the comments from
either poses specifically. It was, um,

784
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,800
specifically targeting an individual
on the basis of sexual orientation,

785
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,780
but he wasn't targeting
them on the basis of it.

786
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,360
He was mentioning that with his bad ideas.

787
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:52,740
He was targeting his bad ideas in
regards to Antifa a lot of that he was

788
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:55,080
dismissing Antifa but
if you look at is video,

789
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,510
I can't believe I spent
so much time doing this,

790
00:45:57,511 --> 00:46:01,000
but that's not like a whole hour
on this two days ago. Yep. Um,

791
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:06,290
he was talking about how
Carlos just dismisses and
tiff has being not that big a

792
00:46:06,691 --> 00:46:10,470
deal and that there's bias in the media
whenever there's anything negative that

793
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:12,210
happens.
But if you look at the overall picture,

794
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,730
and then Crowder goes on to
talk about all the assaults,

795
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,550
all the murders that there was
sexual assaults, there was rapes,

796
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,400
there was all these things
that happen with Antifa.

797
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,940
He was talking about all these different
people that got maced in the face,

798
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:28,350
all kinds of people that got hurt and,
and he's highlighting all,

799
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,890
like this is not something
to easily dismissed. Sure.

800
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,930
And that the FBI had labeled Antifa
a terrorist organization. So,

801
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:36,870
so far it's just politics. It's
just what, what does he think?

802
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:40,980
What do I think so far it's just that
part of it. And along the way he's like,

803
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:44,760
yeah, but the Queer Little Latino says
this. Yeah. And when he does that,

804
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:49,140
that's where it's like, okay, what is he
doing? Is He ma? He's kind of mocking him.

805
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,510
Right. And he's mocking
them by saying he's queer,

806
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:54,420
but he says he's queer or he says he's
gay. Yeah. But that's like saying,

807
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:59,130
I mean listen, just because the n word is
in rap songs, it doesn't mean that any,

808
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:02,340
that that defined to go and I
put the n word is not in like,

809
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:06,540
it's not like the LBGT n,
you know what I'm saying?

810
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:08,970
It's not like a part of
their, their organ. It's,

811
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I think the principle though is you're
suggesting that because a certain word is

812
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:19,521
sometimes used self referentially by
members of a group that any use of it from

813
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:24,180
the outside is by
definition not problematic.

814
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,760
And I'm just saying it's more
complicated and you've got certainly more

815
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,130
complicated. You have to look at
specifics. I'm g I'm going from memory,

816
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:34,480
but wasn't Steven Crowder also wearing a
shirt that said fags with the a with an

817
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:37,570
asterisks, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

818
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,600
It said socialism is for figs and how
he's calling a gay gay is a fig instead of

819
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:49,800
a, an eye as he's calling a gay
guy couldn't Mexico. Yes. Yeah.

820
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,570
I mean in total it's not
crazy. So, but no, there's a,

821
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,220
there's certainly an argument that,
well,

822
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,110
I don't necessarily think the
t shirt is for Carlos Mesa.

823
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,200
I think that's a t shirt that he
just has cause he thinks it's funny.

824
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,070
And because Che Guevara,
who's on the shirt is,

825
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,950
that is one of the weirdest things
that people worship. That guy,

826
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,390
he was a horrific human being. A
mass murderer, a terrible sociopath,

827
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,500
a psychopath.

828
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,550
And because he looks good and it in the
Cuban revolution and I'll it with a bra

829
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:22,660
on, you know, he's, he
became for a long time.

830
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:27,370
I mean it's kind of died off,
but he became like the woke poster boy.

831
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,470
I'm from Argentina. I know.
Uh, yeah. I was born there.
Yeah, no kidding. Yeah. Yeah.

832
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,040
Interesting. So I mean, listen,
here's my country bro. I made it. Um,

833
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,890
so listen,
I think that,

834
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,400
I do appreciate what you're saying and
I agree with you to a certain extent.

835
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,490
I believe that when
Youtube yesterday said,

836
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,720
we looked at the content in total and
we don't think it violates our terms and

837
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,460
conditions.
I disagreed with them.

838
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:54,220
I thought it very clearly violated
their terms and conditions.

839
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:00,060
Where I am thinking about it now is
the application of those terms and

840
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:05,200
conditions violations. Because a similar
thing happened with Alex Jones as well,

841
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,560
which was there's lots of way smaller
players that are violating the same terms

842
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:14,560
and conditions, but nobody knows about
them. Youtube doesn't know about them.

843
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,960
They don't get any attention
because they have no audience.

844
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:21,370
So I think there's the question of the
application of these terms and conditions,

845
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,400
conditions in a way that's sort of
fair and is not ultimately going by the

846
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:31,411
public blow back or reaction to situations
because that that's how I'd pocalypse

847
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:33,670
one point,
oh it happened again,

848
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,700
I think it was a coke ad appeared on an
obviously racist video on a channel with

849
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:44,320
like 800 or a thousand subscribers. The
Wall Street Journal, I think it was,

850
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:45,340
did an article saying,

851
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,400
look at these screenshots of
these advertisers on these
crazy racist videos that

852
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:55,390
led to blow back because youtube didn't
want to lose money and ultimately that's

853
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,224
what this is about.

854
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,950
I know that there are people who say
youtube has an inherently left wing bias.

855
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,810
Others say youtube has a of right
wing by whatever youtube is.

856
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:09,400
Bias is towards corporatism and profit.
Yes. That's fundamentally what it is.

857
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,250
And as a company to have a left wing bias,
I don't know that

858
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,120
in what sense?
Well,

859
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:20,680
in the sense that the woman who's the
CEO of Youtube was talked about it pretty

860
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:24,820
openly, like the fact that she doesn't,
what was it that she had gotten into?

861
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,170
Oh, well first of all was the
James Damore thing. You know,

862
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,270
she was talking about the Google memo
and she was talking about how it was a

863
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,600
incredibly damaging,
the damaging,

864
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,070
damaging stereotypes against women,
which it just wasn't,

865
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,570
it's not accurate.

866
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,430
Is Home Depot a right wing company
because the CEO supports Trump?

867
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,730
That's a good question.
Um, I'm basing it on that.

868
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:53,000
They're a part of Facebook and
Facebook is pretty clearly left wing.

869
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,240
Who's part of Facebook? Google. Oh,
sorry. Google. They're part of Google.

870
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:58,580
I'm at Google.
Google is a very,

871
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:02,330
very left wing group and
it's all silicon valley,

872
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:04,700
which is almost entirely left wing biased.

873
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,590
So I think we have to distinguish
between the personal political biases of

874
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:14,591
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and the
broader place that Google has in the sort

875
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:16,460
of corporate sphere.

876
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:22,030
Google is part of the group of huge
multinational corporations that um,

877
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:29,030
lobbies for particular tax policy
to avoid paying taxes legally.

878
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:34,430
That is not a particularly left
wing thing to do. Uh, Google is um,

879
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:39,490
part of the large tech companies that
in order to avoid serious regulation of

880
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:45,230
their businesses have come up with this
idea of regulating themselves. Okay.

881
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,690
Which I know is a topic self regulation
that's come up before on your program in

882
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:53,150
in a variety of ways.
So those are not left wing things.

883
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:58,151
And if you want to make the case that as
a company it has a left wing politic in

884
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:01,220
the outward facing world,

885
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:05,720
you have to have something more than just
a lot of their engineers live in Palo

886
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,550
Alto and are hipsters who go to coffee
shops. You think? I think that in the,

887
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:15,551
in terms of the place that it occupies
within the economic system we have,

888
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:21,430
they are not very different from all of
the large corporations that are pushing

889
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:27,530
against regulation, pushing four
ways to avoid taxes, period.

890
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,700
So in terms of economic decisions,
yeah. I mean, listen, if,

891
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:37,420
if we want to talk about how the personal
politics of the employees translate to

892
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:39,830
policy,
we can do that,

893
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:43,370
but we need to be able to make some
specific claims about how, how it does,

894
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:48,670
what I'm saying is we know the way in
which the structure that Google is a part

895
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:52,970
of leads to it advocating for
things that are center, right.

896
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,470
Corporatist, capitalist, the
status quo of tax shelters,

897
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:02,270
havens and not paying taxes, regulating
ourselves, et Cetera, et cetera. Well,

898
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:04,700
that's what's interesting about this
crowd or things. They're ultimately,

899
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:09,701
the decision was to allow him to have
his freedom to post videos on there,

900
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:14,210
but the punitive aspect of it is
they're going to reduce his ability or

901
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,600
eliminated his ability to make
money. Right, right. Well,
I should say reduce, right?

902
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:22,130
Because he could, could he put
videos, just put ads up in his video?

903
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:26,250
Yeah, sure. So like we
won, one thing that I do

904
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,690
is we,
uh,

905
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:32,370
we kind of split off the ad sales for my
show into an ad agency and we're doing

906
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:35,220
ad sales, not just for my show,
but for other shows as well.

907
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:40,490
And those include ad placements that are
not like the pre roll ads on Youtube.

908
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,460
It's, the host is actually talking
about a product or whatever. It's a re,

909
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:47,980
you know, alive read sort of thing. Unbox
therapy does a lot of that. Hmm. Yeah.

910
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,720
That's where I first saw those who
does some pretty extensive ones. Okay.

911
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,160
So of course you can do that. I
mean, yeah, there's nothing he can

912
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:55,950
do that,

913
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:00,540
but he can't just collect revenue
like I assume he's been doing before.

914
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,170
He has a significant number
of followers. I think his, uh,

915
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,520
his youtube subscribers are more
than three and a half million.

916
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:10,120
So it's very high.
Yeah.

917
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:15,380
More than me and Dave just eliminated
his income that comes out of youtube.

918
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,710
And this was their decision based on his,

919
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:24,090
his way of talking about Carlos Mesa.

920
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,960
That's, that's what happened. Yeah. I
mean, so what, what are the concerns?

921
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:32,710
To me it's not that he didn't violate
terms and conditions. Like I said,

922
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:36,050
I think he pretty clearly did
the concerns to me are um,

923
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:41,790
is youtube only going to even look into
these circumstances or instances when

924
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,270
there is a public outcry?

925
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:50,170
The answer is probably yes because why
would they look into stuff nobody's

926
00:54:50,171 --> 00:54:51,940
paying attention to.
It's not a good use of change.

927
00:54:51,941 --> 00:54:55,180
Their decision based on public outcry,
based on Carl's mazes,

928
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,250
reaction to the initial decision.

929
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,100
I happen to think their initial
decision was the wrong one.

930
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:02,470
But I have a sort of broader concern here,

931
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:05,860
which is about the fairness of the
application and also the distinguishing

932
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:10,861
between a content that is
promoting whatever falls
under any of our definitions

933
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:17,260
of hateful or whatever content and
those who are fighting against it.

934
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,320
So is it because he mentioned his sexual
orientation and that he called him a

935
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:27,310
list, be little queer or whatever,
you call them, more queer Mexican.

936
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,800
And if he just called him a fucking idiot
and he received the exact same amount

937
00:55:32,801 --> 00:55:35,920
of hate, would you still think
that that was a good move?

938
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,011
No.
I mean,

939
00:55:37,011 --> 00:55:42,011
I think that it would not fall under
what they are now claiming is the

940
00:55:42,681 --> 00:55:44,540
justification for the demonetization.

941
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,650
It would be different because
it would have the same, yeah.

942
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,320
Result.

943
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,560
The only difference would be they wouldn't
be attacking his sexual orientation

944
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:53,290
specifically because of crowd.
That's the only difference.

945
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:58,570
It's policing speech,
you know? It really is.

946
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,720
Here's a,

947
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:04,430
so who gets to decide if
not the private businesses,

948
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:05,740
what their rules are.
That's

949
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,270
where the real question comes up.
Right?

950
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,540
Tulsi Gabbert believes that it's a first
amendment issue and she believes that

951
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:13,720
everyone should have the freedom of
expression and then as long as you're not

952
00:56:13,721 --> 00:56:14,980
doing anything illegal,

953
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,670
you're not putting anyone to danger by
giving up their address or doxing them or

954
00:56:18,671 --> 00:56:22,080
something along those lines or
making overt physical threats. Right.

955
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,070
That you should allowed to do that because

956
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,600
that's what the freedom of speech
is all about. And freedom of speech.

957
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,260
When you eliminate social media
in this country is your, your,

958
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:36,790
your freedom is basically, yes. Yelling,
yelling out in public. I mean you're,

959
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:40,570
we're in this weird place. It's
always a culture. As a culture.

960
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:44,950
It's unprecedented really in terms of
the waters we're navigating right now,

961
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,250
there's a couple of different things to,
so I like the principal,

962
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:49,630
like my principal is,

963
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:54,370
we do almost no moderation on any of
our platforms that my program is on.

964
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,060
My only thing that I tell my team is if
you see something that really seems to

965
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:05,440
be illegal, it's calling for violence, it,
whatever the these are, we have a very,

966
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:08,650
very high bar before we will
remove anything. And quite frankly,

967
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:13,540
we're just too busy. Do you mean by that?
I'm confused. Like who's not your videos?

968
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:17,920
Whose videos?
So if we find out that on our videos,

969
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:22,090
someone is posting endless comments
in the comment. Second comment,

970
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,880
my personal view is if it's not illegal,
I just, just let it all be there and sit.

971
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,080
That's my personal view. And that's
a great principle to have. Well,

972
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:32,290
we don't touch them. We leave them
alone. Even though we get accused of it,

973
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,290
but the,

974
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:37,900
the question is youtube at one point in
time had thrown out there that they were

975
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:40,360
going to make people responsible for
the things that were in their comments.

976
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,830
I vaguely remember that.

977
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:44,440
But it didn't ultimately think they
backed out of it very quickly when they

978
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:46,240
realize that places like yours,
right.

979
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,410
Which like your average video gets how
many thousands of comments a lot and many

980
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:52,480
of them antisemitic.
And how would you, yeah.

981
00:57:52,481 --> 00:57:54,820
And how would you even be able
to look at all those? I mean,

982
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:56,790
you would have to be 24 seven monitoring.
I'm Bryce.

983
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:00,400
You've also got people that are watching
your videos from overseas at all times

984
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:01,234
in the night.
Yup.

985
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:06,450
So I think that the principle of only
only illegal content will be removed is

986
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:10,600
great. That's, uh, that's my
personal principle. However,

987
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:16,080
I think that there is no serious case
to be made that a private company can't

988
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:21,490
say these are our terms of service.
And if you want to, I mean,

989
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:23,560
it's sort of almost a
conservative principle, right?

990
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:27,210
The idea that unless illegal
things are going on, uh,

991
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:31,000
we are not going to tell a business
how it is that it should be run.

992
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:35,380
And that's where I think a lot of right
wingers start to stumble on this issue

993
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:39,610
because they're calling for a very
invasive form of government regulation.

994
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:44,500
They're calling for the government
to step in and even break up these

995
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:46,280
organizations because they've
gotten too large. And,

996
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,890
but you're hearing that
from the left as well? Yeah.

997
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,080
Well I think there's a difference.

998
00:58:49,081 --> 00:58:52,570
There's a difference though between
Elizabeth Warren saying we should separate

999
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,600
the social platform Facebook from the
ad sales revenue generating piece of it.

1000
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,800
That's one thing that
falls under antitrust.

1001
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,670
That's different than
saying the government should
come in and it should tell

1002
00:59:06,671 --> 00:59:10,540
anybody who runs a social
network that you can't even,

1003
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:15,250
you can't do anything unless the content
is illegal because there are financial

1004
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:19,090
considerations, right? I mean there's
lots of content that would not be illegal,

1005
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,780
but it would make a platform
video platform like youtube
not financially viable

1006
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:26,720
because advertisers would see it and
they'd say, oh, we're not going near that.

1007
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,140
Right.

1008
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:32,140
So I have a very hard time taking what
is a very authoritarian perspective that

1009
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:36,890
the government should come in and say,
this is how social networks should be run.

1010
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,190
Now if you want to change the law,
here's the way it could be done.

1011
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:44,420
If you want to change the law and argue
that these platforms have gotten so big

1012
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:48,740
that they represent more of
a town square so to speak,

1013
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:53,900
then okay, maybe you could pass a law
that changes how they would be regulated,

1014
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,070
but that's typically the type of stuff
the right is against because it is more

1015
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:00,800
regulation.
It is more regulation,

1016
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:04,670
but it's regulation to keep a private
company from regulating against free

1017
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:07,760
speech. Do you see what I'm saying?
It's, it's a sneaky kind of regulation.

1018
01:00:07,761 --> 01:00:12,380
It's a regulation that's enforcing the
first amendment and the people's ability

1019
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:17,381
to freely express themselves if we're
admitting or if we're agreeing that we are

1020
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:20,470
entering into this new
world. Yes. Where this is I,

1021
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,770
that's my position is that
it is a town square and I,

1022
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,430
I feel like everybody should
be able to communicate.

1023
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,190
The really unfortunate,

1024
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:33,191
unsavory aspect of it is when someone
gets harassed like Carlos Mesa was because

1025
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:33,471
of this,

1026
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:37,720
where people are sending him all these
homophobic tweets and all the in these

1027
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,180
getting text messages and all this shit.
That's,

1028
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,170
that's the unsavory and unfortunate
aspect of it. And how do you stop that?

1029
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,840
I don't know how you stop it.
I don't know exactly how you stop it,

1030
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:49,970
but I think it would be useful.
I mean,

1031
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:53,570
one thing is when does a platform get
big enough in your mind that it would

1032
01:00:53,571 --> 01:00:57,650
qualify for this like town square
designation? Well for sure. Youtube.

1033
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:00,170
Let's talk about that one.
Cause that's the one we're on.

1034
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:02,990
I mean fucking God damn it.
It's huge. It's gigantic.

1035
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:08,020
So are there other types of businesses
through which communication happens that

1036
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:12,710
you think should be regulated in the
same way? That's not really clear.

1037
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,730
So I'll give an example.
Okay.

1038
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:19,390
If you start regularly
sending people via ups,

1039
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:20,690
uh,

1040
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:25,690
similar things to some of the content
that exists on youtube and ups says we're

1041
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:30,650
getting reports that you're
sending people harassing stuff,

1042
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,680
we don't want you as a customer anymore.
Here's the question though,

1043
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:36,860
isn't there a difference between someone
sending something to a physical address

1044
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:38,480
and someone sending something?

1045
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:42,800
Just let's say to you when your social
media apps or on the third page of your

1046
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:45,770
phone and you have to swipe all the way
over to get them and open it up and you

1047
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:47,540
have to read them.
If you want to find them,

1048
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,550
well you don't necessarily
have to read them.

1049
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,290
There's a difference in a practical sense,

1050
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:54,290
but I guess the question is
would we want the government,

1051
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,460
would you similarly want the government
to enforce for telephone companies?

1052
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,900
If you are harassment, getting harassing
texts and you report it and report it,

1053
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,280
that's a different thing.
I think.

1054
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,880
I think what's coming to your
phone and the phone is ringing.

1055
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:12,380
I think that's a another step.
It's another step towards invasive.

1056
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:16,550
It's a big gray area. Is the phone
ringing? Is it a phone call? Is it a text?

1057
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:20,010
Is it it? Is it a whatsapp message to
read that text? Right? Yeah. No, I feel

1058
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,620
you.
I guess where I hesitate,

1059
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:26,850
and again I'm speaking of someone from
the left who believes regulation of

1060
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:31,851
businesses is an important thing I
would want to be really sure about how

1061
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:38,630
exactly it is that the government would
step in and mandate essentially that

1062
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:43,530
their view has to be listened to over
the terms of service that a private

1063
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:44,670
company you would wish to have.

1064
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,880
Yes.
I feel like when you give people a gun,

1065
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:50,920
they start looking for targets and the,
that is a very common thing.

1066
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:54,610
If you give people the ability to censor
and give people the ability to censor

1067
01:02:54,611 --> 01:02:58,300
based on their political ideology or
based on what they feel is offensive or

1068
01:02:58,301 --> 01:03:02,200
other people don't. It's a slippery
slope and I think that that can,

1069
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,670
that can lead to all sorts.
Look that woman,

1070
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:10,540
what is her name again?
The one who tried to get Amy Siskind.

1071
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,960
Imagine her being in charge of a social
media platform should try to get you

1072
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:16,990
fired from Boston College for something
that was incredibly polite. Right.

1073
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,410
That is what I'm talking about
is there are very action,

1074
01:03:20,411 --> 01:03:24,880
that very same type of thinking
that she tried to impose on you.

1075
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,200
That's what I'm worried about.

1076
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,160
I'm worried about people that are
really strictly trying to promote their

1077
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:35,110
ideologies and what they think is okay
and not okay and it's very slippery cause

1078
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:38,890
there's a lot of weird people out there
that believe a lot of weird things and

1079
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:41,110
want other people to conform
to those weird things.

1080
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:46,060
And we sort of have to decide like
that's why I'm bringing up this crowd or

1081
01:03:46,061 --> 01:03:49,120
thing like do I think that
what he said was good? No,

1082
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:52,480
it's not nice to call someone a
little lispy queer. It's not nice.

1083
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:53,950
It's kind of mean,
you know?

1084
01:03:53,951 --> 01:03:56,110
And especially when that guy
wasn't even engaging with him.

1085
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,870
But he's making fun of him. He's
a comedy show. He's mocking them.

1086
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,400
So the question becomes like when,

1087
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:05,530
when is that mocking considered homophobic
and when is it just ribbing? Right.

1088
01:04:05,531 --> 01:04:07,900
And that's his position.
His position is that it's just ribbing.

1089
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:13,010
This is the problem with a discussion
that is only about the principles.

1090
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:17,100
So like a lot of our conversation for
the last 15 minutes has been what is our

1091
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:18,390
principal about,

1092
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:23,340
what types of business regulation is
okay for the government to do and is not

1093
01:04:23,341 --> 01:04:26,040
okay.
Or when we talk about free speech,

1094
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:30,840
what should do we have a principle of
anything short of illegal content versus

1095
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:34,850
something that is more strict?
The reality is that it's it,

1096
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,210
there's more gray area.

1097
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:36,571
Yeah.

1098
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:40,980
We're trying to sort of regulate the
way people communicate with each other.

1099
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:45,210
So it's not, it's like if someone
said that to someone in a bar,

1100
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:49,140
a cop would not arrest them. Like yeah,
you listen a little queer, you know,

1101
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,490
that would be like, oh, that guy's

1102
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,310
basil. But the bar would be perfectly
within their legal right to say, we don't,

1103
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,830
we don't want you in here.
You're making our customers uncomfortable.

1104
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:00,010
And nobody would say that. It would
be against the law for the bar to say,

1105
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:00,830
you got to go.

1106
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,210
That's a good point.
If they were doing it to their face.

1107
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:08,040
But what if he was in a corner talking
about this guy that wasn't there?

1108
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:09,450
And he was saying,
yeah,

1109
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:12,600
so he's talking about Antifa
has lispy little Mexican queer.

1110
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,570
If you came along and decided to
kick the guy out of the bar, then

1111
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,950
it would, I mean, listen at some bars,

1112
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,490
if you go into the corner and you yell
about Alyssa, right? Mexican queer,

1113
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:22,690
they're going to ask you to leave.

1114
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:25,810
And it still would not be illegal and the
bar would still not be doing anything.

1115
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:27,790
Right. But that's a bar, right?

1116
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:30,640
That's a private business where
people are physically there. Yes.

1117
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:33,160
Isn't there a difference between
that and something like Youtube,

1118
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:35,680
which again falls more in
line with like a town square?

1119
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:39,730
Maybe that's what we need to revisit that
because so much human communication is

1120
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:43,570
now happening across these platforms. I
would imagine most of it, or most of it,

1121
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,600
we know we need to maybe stop drawing
this arbitrary distinction that in person

1122
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:52,450
is a completely different thing
than over the Internet. I mean,

1123
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:56,080
maybe it's not increasingly, maybe
it's more the same. Yeah. Um,

1124
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:02,050
so I'm torn here, right?
On one side I say, well,

1125
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:07,650
it seems like they still allow him to
have his freedom of expression because

1126
01:06:08,891 --> 01:06:13,060
he's still on youtube. He still is
able to upload his show on Youtube.

1127
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,220
He will have to find other
ways to make money. Sure.

1128
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,330
So one part of me looks at it that way
and no one has a right to monetize on

1129
01:06:19,331 --> 01:06:21,730
youtube. Right? Right. So in a sense,

1130
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:25,450
they haven't violated his first amendment
rights because he's still able to

1131
01:06:25,451 --> 01:06:29,200
express himself.
But then you go as a company,

1132
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:34,350
they've made a punitive decision to
eliminate his ability or is radically

1133
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:37,930
reduced his ability to make an
income off of their platform.

1134
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:41,410
That seems like, and I'm not
supporting that, they did it,

1135
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:45,310
but that seems more
reasonable as a decision,

1136
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:50,290
right. To say we're going to demonetize
you. That seems more reasonable.

1137
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:55,060
But the problem is
there's no alternatives.

1138
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:59,830
There's nothing remotely like Youtube to
over there is an alternative to youtube

1139
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:03,490
for him to regain that same
level of monetization. Yes.

1140
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:08,640
Or for people that share his viewpoint
and share his ideology and chair his

1141
01:07:09,131 --> 01:07:12,400
positions. And there's no right
wing. Youtube is my point.

1142
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:16,480
And there's this like I would challenge
the idea that youtube is, is left wing.

1143
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:20,710
I mean in terms of it's
enforcing its policies. How so?

1144
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,710
I mean they had just this, just this
particular issue, but this isn't,

1145
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:27,460
this isn't a left wing.
How is this a left wing enforcement?

1146
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:31,210
I mean they think it is because Carl's
mazes progressive and because the

1147
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,930
argument that he was making is a very
left wing progressive argument and this is

1148
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:36,370
what Crowder was going after.

1149
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:40,480
He was going after the argument in the
process of going after the argument,

1150
01:07:40,481 --> 01:07:42,340
he mocked his sexuality
and his appearance.

1151
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:46,810
I can assure you if it was focused merely
on how much of a problem Antifa is,

1152
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,550
this would not have happened.
I mean I think we both, oh
yeah, for sure. Yeah. No,

1153
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:54,880
it's all about the mocking the
guys sexual orientation and looks.

1154
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:59,140
That's worth Carlos Maza where a gay
Republican and the exact same thing

1155
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,440
happened. Do you think the outcome
would've been different? Yes. Why?

1156
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,740
I just don't think people be
interested. Oh, well that's a dip up.

1157
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:07,570
But so that gets to the real crux of it,

1158
01:08:07,571 --> 01:08:12,571
which is my real concern with this is
youtube only getting involved in even

1159
01:08:13,901 --> 01:08:16,280
publicly saying what they're
doing about a channel,

1160
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:16,670
right?

1161
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:20,930
When it becomes very public and it starts
to have the possibility of impacting

1162
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:24,980
their bottom line and brand saying, yes,
this is too hot and we're getting out.

1163
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:29,900
Well in that sense what Carlos did once
it was revealed that youtube was not

1164
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:32,960
going to take action was very effective.
Absolutely.

1165
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,950
I mean he started tweeting like
crazy and people jumped on board.

1166
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:41,930
He connected it to the LBGT movement and,
and then it became this thing.

1167
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,630
I mean the other side of this is,

1168
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:49,280
I mean I don't know if we even want to
go into identity politics so to speak,

1169
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:51,530
but there has,

1170
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,760
I've s I've read some comments on some
of the few articles that have been

1171
01:08:55,761 --> 01:09:00,761
written about this that are saying that
this is effectively youtube enforcing a

1172
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:06,170
defense of identity politics, so to
speak. And I think that that's just again,

1173
01:09:06,171 --> 01:09:10,910
opening up the door to the incredibly
broad application of that term identity

1174
01:09:10,911 --> 01:09:14,200
politics. I don't even really fully
understand that, but I don't know.

1175
01:09:14,201 --> 01:09:16,370
And I don't even know if that's
a path we want to go down to.

1176
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:20,000
Talk about like the identity politics
component of what's going on with a lot of

1177
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:24,620
this regulation. Find what you mean by the
identity politics of it. I mean listen,

1178
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,560
so I guess in order to
define it, define it, I,

1179
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,880
it would be good to point out that uh,

1180
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:37,060
I have been critical of quote identity
politics on the left in a very limited

1181
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:42,590
way that I think it is actually damaging
while at the same time recognizing that

1182
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:46,490
identity is a really important thing to
consider when we think about sort of how

1183
01:09:46,491 --> 01:09:47,810
the world should be organized.

1184
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:52,870
So like for your audience who may not
know when identity politics is used,

1185
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,020
you know,
like a,

1186
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,550
like a knife to enforce that
because of someone's identity,

1187
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:03,940
their opinion supersedes
and is the opinion that is
the valid one over everybody

1188
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:08,180
else because of membership in some
kind of group. I'm against that.

1189
01:10:08,181 --> 01:10:12,440
I think that's extremely destructive.
It would be very,

1190
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:13,483
uh,

1191
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:18,850
incorrect to believe though that
identity doesn't play a role and that we

1192
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:23,930
shouldn't understand how one's identity
might make us think differently about

1193
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:28,250
certain issues. I mean, any example
would sure would make that pretty clear,

1194
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:30,440
you know, I, as an immigrant
to the United States,

1195
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:36,010
do I get some privileged
position to decide what policy
should be overall native

1196
01:10:36,261 --> 01:10:38,420
born Americans because I immigrated here?
No,

1197
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:42,740
that would meet be me using identity
politics is like a mallet or a cuddle or

1198
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:47,240
whatever, but as someone who did
immigrate here, we should recognize that.

1199
01:10:47,241 --> 01:10:48,980
I may have things to say about it,

1200
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:51,950
which would be valuable and worthy and
important to sort of think about it.

1201
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:53,840
That's my shore on identity politics.

1202
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:58,100
You're just not interested in the
hierarchy of oppressed people.

1203
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,220
I'm not interested in the oppression
Olympics and they're not interested in

1204
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:05,990
using identity to silence ideas that could
be perfectly good coming from someone

1205
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:09,440
who is not a member or checking a
certain box. Exactly. Nor Am I. I,

1206
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:12,950
I strongly believe in the individual and
I think it's one of the most important

1207
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,550
parts of a collective

1208
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:18,660
group of human beings like our country
than we recognize that we're all

1209
01:11:18,661 --> 01:11:22,490
different and there's a lot of weirdness
amongst us but are individuals and I

1210
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:24,840
like to treat people
based on who they are,

1211
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,700
not what classification they fall under.

1212
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,840
Now do you think that that bad version
of identity politics that I mentioned is

1213
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:37,080
a big problem on the left or
not a big problem? I'm curious.

1214
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:41,490
I think it's certainly a problem,
but I think it's a vocal minority problem.

1215
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,570
That's what I think.

1216
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:47,520
I think if you just regular people that
are on the left that are working jobs

1217
01:11:47,521 --> 01:11:52,350
and having families and
doing their hobbies and they
just have left wing ideas,

1218
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:56,250
I don't think the vast majority
of them hold those positions.

1219
01:11:56,251 --> 01:12:00,330
I think those positions are
things that people use as revenue.

1220
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:04,020
I mean not as revenue, but it's like they,
they, they get points from it, you know,

1221
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:04,191
they,

1222
01:12:04,191 --> 01:12:08,490
they get points from certain types of
behavior that they support certain types

1223
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,360
of thinking that they support.
And it,

1224
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:14,590
it lets you know you've got woke social
justice points and then we agree. Yeah.

1225
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,060
I mean I, Jen I asked because
I genuinely didn't know.

1226
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:21,660
I mean I've heard them talking about
any politics dangerous number though in

1227
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:22,830
terms of college campuses,

1228
01:12:22,831 --> 01:12:27,000
when you look at like what
happened in Evergreen state,
Bret Weinstein, it, it, it,

1229
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,040
it's very disruptive.
Yes and no.

1230
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:32,140
I mean I do think that it's
disproportionately a PR.

1231
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,050
I think it's a small
problem like you're saying.

1232
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:38,730
I think a lot of the problem exists
in the college campus setting,

1233
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,400
but um, I mean even at
Boston College, you know,

1234
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:44,550
I had sort of maybe been incorrectly,
um,

1235
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,900
indoctrinated into the idea that this was
really a problem everywhere on college

1236
01:12:48,901 --> 01:12:50,220
campuses and I had an incident,

1237
01:12:50,221 --> 01:12:52,380
the details of which wouldn't
be appropriate to talk about,

1238
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:56,940
but with a student when I taught at
Boston college that because of the

1239
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:59,430
circumstances and the identities involved,

1240
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:02,670
I was ready for it to go into.

1241
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,410
This is going to be resolved the wrong
way on the basis of the toxic identity

1242
01:13:07,411 --> 01:13:10,980
politics I'm hearing is existing on
college campuses. And it was not,

1243
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,570
it was the exact opposite.

1244
01:13:12,571 --> 01:13:15,690
So I think the same way that
when you look at Yelp reviews,

1245
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:19,020
people who had a bad experience are way
more likely to go and write about it.

1246
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:19,740
Yes.

1247
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:24,660
These individual stories get way more
attention than the percentage of the

1248
01:13:24,661 --> 01:13:28,590
problem that they represent. I believe
you're probably correct about that,

1249
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:32,390
but when you see videos like
nick, Nick Christakis getting, uh,

1250
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:36,930
just shouted down at Yale by a group
of students and that they supported the

1251
01:13:36,931 --> 01:13:41,460
students and that kind of Shit, you
say, well, it is real. It does exist.

1252
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:46,530
It's real. It exists. I think that
sensible people on the left like me,

1253
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,070
uh, call it out, but I want to be careful.

1254
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,980
Imagine that you had someone
from Cato on the show,

1255
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:57,360
which is sort of like a traditional
conservative or American Enterprise

1256
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,620
Institute.
Maybe he's like a better example.

1257
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,860
And a lot of the conversation was about
getting them to talk about or denounced

1258
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:06,810
the alt right, for example.
I'm sure they would do it,

1259
01:14:06,811 --> 01:14:11,250
but how much should a
denounced the outright when
that's like a different thing

1260
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:12,570
sample?

1261
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:14,340
Yeah. It's a very good analogy. Yeah.

1262
01:14:14,341 --> 01:14:19,320
I think we oftentimes are responding
to this very vocal minority.

1263
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:19,920
Yes.

1264
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,130
And those are the people that are most
invested in getting these ideas pushed

1265
01:14:23,131 --> 01:14:27,540
through and they're there. It's
also people that, you know,

1266
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,680
for lack of a better term,

1267
01:14:28,681 --> 01:14:32,130
they're probably mentally ill and I only
mean mentally ill in terms of like have

1268
01:14:32,131 --> 01:14:34,890
like legitimate diseases.
But in terms of their thought patterns,

1269
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:39,270
they're probably obsessive. I mean
I've had friends that were, uh,

1270
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,860
especially friends that were heavily
involved in this kind of stuff before and

1271
01:14:43,861 --> 01:14:47,010
it was very damaging to their
mental health, this type of stuff,

1272
01:14:47,011 --> 01:14:50,340
being politics being woke,
left wing,

1273
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,370
shout out at people
attack people politics.

1274
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:56,790
But then you realize somewhere
on the wine and then one of them,

1275
01:14:56,791 --> 01:15:00,420
my friend Jamie Kilstein was a, they
turned on him and then, you know,

1276
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:04,050
devastated his life and he realized
along the way like, oh Jesus Christ.

1277
01:15:04,051 --> 01:15:05,340
Like what?
What was I doing?

1278
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,270
Like I was checking my Twitter every five
seconds and insulting people left and

1279
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:13,320
right. And attacking people just to get
everybody to say, yeah, go get him. And,

1280
01:15:13,321 --> 01:15:16,530
you know, showing everybody how
woke I am and how progressive I am.

1281
01:15:16,531 --> 01:15:21,120
And it becomes a weird sort of a,
a point system.

1282
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,290
Like you're, you're trying
to score points, you're,

1283
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:25,860
you're trying to gain
favor with your party.

1284
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:28,830
There's a lot of that.
I think it's really important though.

1285
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:33,860
So there's people on the left and right
who get pulled into political wokeness,

1286
01:15:33,871 --> 01:15:37,800
whether it's I'm now tea party in 2010
people that got sucked into tea party on

1287
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:39,720
the right and Tifo whatever.

1288
01:15:39,721 --> 01:15:43,800
These are all groups with different sort
of followings. They're not all the same,

1289
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:44,693
whatever.

1290
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:49,530
I do think that there is a difference
between getting extremely passionate about

1291
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,440
the idea that everybody should have
access to just basic health care.

1292
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:57,680
Then getting extremely
passionate about the idea, uh,

1293
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,540
that we need to go out of our way to
shut down every abortion clinic in the

1294
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:02,550
country. I think that there's
just, there's a difference.

1295
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:07,670
So I don't want to participate
in a false equivalency between,

1296
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:08,610
well,

1297
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:12,720
you got very far left in very far right
people and they're the same and you've

1298
01:16:12,721 --> 01:16:16,170
got center left and center right.
And they're the same.

1299
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:17,820
It's just two sides of the same coin.

1300
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:21,960
Like obviously I have a perspective
that is based on my politics.

1301
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:26,820
I'm glad to debate any of these issues
with anybody who wants to on the merits,

1302
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:29,700
but I don't want to make the
false equivalency. I mean, listen,

1303
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,090
when you look at Anti Defamation
League numbers, for example,

1304
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:36,600
the vast majority of, um, of,

1305
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:40,860
of hate incidents in the United
States are coming from the right.

1306
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:45,210
We could talk about other
ways that the left is active.

1307
01:16:45,211 --> 01:16:49,050
We could talk about what it means
or how things should be categorized,

1308
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,120
but that's the reality.

1309
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:53,790
And so I want to make sure I don't
play a false equivalency game.

1310
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,270
My audience would crush me if
I did that, number one. Um,

1311
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,400
but I think it's just wrong.
I think it's wrong to do that.

1312
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,900
I don't think the facts bear it out.

1313
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,430
I think you're right there.

1314
01:17:02,431 --> 01:17:06,320
And I also think that these
false equivalency kind of
conversations or they're

1315
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:11,090
ridiculous because each individual
conversation about each individual issue

1316
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:15,260
deserves its own discussion.
Yes. And to say, what about this?

1317
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:19,460
Or what about that? Those? What about
Isms? Those are the, the death of

1318
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:22,890
any real rational discussion
because they go on forever.

1319
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,070
There they go on forever. There's
no, I mean it's like scroll,

1320
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:30,300
this is why scrolling Twitter endlessly
is a problem because there's really no

1321
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:34,190
end. You can always scroll a little new
to it to the end for right. Yeah. I mean,

1322
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,510
yeah,
the it's the new tweets are coming fast.

1323
01:17:36,511 --> 01:17:39,450
It's the same with a lot of those kind
of one's ever done that just scrolled

1324
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:42,330
until their phone died.
Just charge it,

1325
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:46,920
wake up in the morning and just scroll
down all day. How long does it take?

1326
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:50,850
I think you wouldn't because the new
content appears faster because of the

1327
01:17:50,851 --> 01:17:54,420
algorithm, but you still never
run out? No. Just keep going. No.

1328
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,470
There's a few things. I don't know if
this would be interesting to go into,

1329
01:17:58,471 --> 01:18:03,300
but there's a few things that I've
found have been somewhat successful in

1330
01:18:03,301 --> 01:18:07,920
conversations with people
who really disagree with me
and at least like lowering

1331
01:18:07,921 --> 01:18:12,270
the temperature a little bit and getting
people to maybe engage in a good faith

1332
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:16,920
way. One of them is how do you
think I came to my position?

1333
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,083
Mm.

1334
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:22,680
So you might be four total free
market for profit healthcare.

1335
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:26,760
I am for a system where the government
is more involved and even if you can't

1336
01:18:26,761 --> 01:18:30,420
pay, you get care before
we even start. If I say,

1337
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:35,430
how do you think I arrived at my
position? That has been pretty useful. Um,

1338
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,560
another example is,
uh,

1339
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:40,830
I think this came from Peter Bogosian
who I think you've had on, yes.

1340
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:42,690
The Duffy's ability question,

1341
01:18:42,691 --> 01:18:46,740
which is what evidence if I presented it
to you would bring you over to my side.

1342
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:49,020
I'm not saying I have that
evidence or that it exists,

1343
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:53,550
but give me a framework as to what is
keeping you from seeing this my way.

1344
01:18:53,551 --> 01:18:56,590
Because sometimes that exists,
the person just doesn't know about it.

1345
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Those are two tools that I have found
super useful in trying to make some

1346
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:07,160
headway with people who are hyper
partisan and very escalated with a lot of

1347
01:19:08,401 --> 01:19:08,990
these issues.

1348
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:11,430
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. It's,

1349
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,930
it's very difficult to have good faith
conversations with people when you

1350
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:16,070
disagree with them.
You know,

1351
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:19,130
and you have to have discipline and you
have to have some sort of a sense of

1352
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:24,020
self. Yeah. And you have to
know how to be calm and kind,

1353
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,460
you know, the, the, the,

1354
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:29,530
the descent into insults and
dunking on people as one of the,

1355
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:32,240
one of the reasons why I,
at the beginning of the conversation,

1356
01:19:32,241 --> 01:19:35,030
I was saying that I've,
one of the things I enjoy about your,

1357
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,370
your youtube videos is
you're a very reasonable,

1358
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:40,970
rational person and you don't get
crazy and animated and insulting.

1359
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:42,463
And I think there's,

1360
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:46,010
we need more of that because I think
even though you're not going to convert

1361
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:46,850
some people,

1362
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,570
there's just a certain subsection of
the population that disagrees with you

1363
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:54,230
that's just going to write. But there's
a significant number that I going to go,

1364
01:19:54,231 --> 01:19:57,590
hey, this David Pakman guys, he's
reasonable. He's making a lot of sense.

1365
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:58,740
He's intelligent.
Well,

1366
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:00,030
my goal is,

1367
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:04,710
and I think that it's sort of working and
that we have a lot of Trump supporters

1368
01:20:04,711 --> 01:20:07,950
who are paid subscribers
to my show. A, we have some

1369
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:12,930
are they taking notes? Uh, maybe they
are to the boss, but my, uh, my goal is,

1370
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,830
my goal is, yeah, that would, I mean that,

1371
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:18,600
that would be an interesting day if I
wake up and Trump has responded to one of

1372
01:20:18,601 --> 01:20:22,260
my videos about him, what would you
do? Uh, I think it'd be a good day.

1373
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,230
Well,
that's what Cole bear did.

1374
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:29,400
That was how funny was that when Cole
Bear was on TV's like Donald? Yeah.

1375
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:33,810
How did you not know that you shouldn't
respond to me? Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1376
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,330
That's rule number one.
It's an important one.

1377
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:39,450
Unless you want to create a shit
storm of a very certain email.

1378
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:43,380
My goal is I don't pretend to be neutral.

1379
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:48,940
I think neutrality is almost always
false because on most issues, people,

1380
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:51,930
they're not indifferent. I mean neutral
is another way of saying in different,

1381
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,630
you could be conflicted in neutral,
you can be conflicted in neutral,

1382
01:20:54,631 --> 01:20:58,410
but I try to at least be objective and
transparent in how I arrived at what I

1383
01:20:58,411 --> 01:21:00,930
believe,
so you can disagree with my conclusion.

1384
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,060
You can even come to me
and telling me the facts.

1385
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:05,700
I've used to reach the conclusion
or incomplete or wrong,

1386
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:11,060
but I'm completely genuine and how I
arrived there and I think that that is why

1387
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:14,160
we have some, I mean,
yeah, there's obviously,

1388
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,920
if you look at Youtube comments that
are right wingers that watch my show,

1389
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:20,700
but choosing to support it financially
is a different thing and I get emails

1390
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:23,100
from conservatives who say,
I don't agree with your conclusions,

1391
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:26,730
but I do find that you're at least
reasoning through the issues in a way that

1392
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:29,510
resonates with me and I want to support
the fact that you're doing that.

1393
01:21:29,511 --> 01:21:31,890
That's outstanding.
That's a huge victory.

1394
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:36,540
There really is in a sense in
my eyes is in this day and age,

1395
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,270
I think this is the most polarized time.

1396
01:21:39,271 --> 01:21:44,271
I can remember as a 51 year old man
looking back at my history of paying

1397
01:21:45,061 --> 01:21:50,061
attention to social issues and the way
we communicate with each other and just

1398
01:21:50,321 --> 01:21:53,400
to partisan attitudes that people
seem to have. I don't, I don't,

1399
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:56,640
I mean I think it's probably because
of Trump. That's a giant part of it,

1400
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,570
but it's also just a sign of
the times of social media.

1401
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:05,571
I think it's in part engineered by the
algorithms at Facebook and Twitter and

1402
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:08,850
all these other social
media companies utilize.

1403
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,440
And it's also been engineered by Beth bad
faith participants and people that are

1404
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:15,480
actually manipulating it.
Um,

1405
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:20,410
I don't know if you've paid any
attention to Sam Harris had a fantastic a

1406
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:23,670
podcast with a,
and we had one with her as well.

1407
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Rene de Resta when they arrest a analyzed
all of the various accounts that the

1408
01:22:31,891 --> 01:22:33,270
IRA had created,

1409
01:22:33,271 --> 01:22:38,010
would the internet research agency that
was responsible for all of these fake

1410
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:42,930
accounts that people thought were black
lives matter accounts or pro southern

1411
01:22:42,931 --> 01:22:47,730
secession accounts or all these different
accounts that were very polarizing and

1412
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:52,790
arguing with other people that these
were just Russians that were working for

1413
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:58,101
this organization that was
specifically trying to start chaos.

1414
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:02,670
They were specifically trying
to start arguments and when you,

1415
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:06,130
when you,
you see that and then I mean that's

1416
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,540
a factor.
That's a giant factor.

1417
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:12,541
That kind of shit is a factor and that
that is sort of become part of the sport

1418
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:17,710
of social media has been arguing.
Absolutely. I don't do it. I don't engage,

1419
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:21,760
but I do go on Facebook sometimes when
someone makes an abortion post and I just

1420
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:24,000
watched the chaos like, oh my God. Yeah,

1421
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:28,180
it's in or anything having anything to
do with Trump or anything having anything

1422
01:23:28,181 --> 01:23:31,270
to do with the second
amendment or anything that has
anything to do with the the

1423
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:32,830
wall or immigration.

1424
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:38,050
So I don't know that people are
actually enlarger disagreements,

1425
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:41,090
right, than they were
previously. I think that yes,

1426
01:23:41,091 --> 01:23:44,630
Trump has coarsened the language and
the way in which it's now acceptable to

1427
01:23:44,631 --> 01:23:46,790
talk about a lot of these things.
That's number one.

1428
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:49,490
I think the social media algorithms
like you're pointing out,

1429
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:54,491
reward the most extreme and polarizing
comments and reactions in a never ending

1430
01:23:55,371 --> 01:24:00,371
feedback loop where the most polarizing
initial tweet generates a more risky,

1431
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:06,350
more responses than less polarizing
tweets and then the sub responses that are

1432
01:24:06,351 --> 01:24:10,940
most polarizing and and aggressive do the
exact same thing and it's never ending

1433
01:24:10,941 --> 01:24:12,620
feedback loop.
I think it's all those things,

1434
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:17,780
but I don't know that people are having
bigger disagreements than in times past.

1435
01:24:17,781 --> 01:24:19,790
I just think that they're
public in a different way.

1436
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:20,810
Well,

1437
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:24,530
there's more disagreements because
people have more opportunity to disagree,

1438
01:24:24,531 --> 01:24:26,240
so they have more opportunity to engage.

1439
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,880
In particular when you're talking about
people that are addicted to their phones

1440
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:32,240
and it's coming from a guy who uses
fucking phone four hours a day.

1441
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:35,000
I'd like to think that one
hour that is productive,

1442
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:38,150
but I know that three hours of it
is me staring at butts on Instagram,

1443
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:43,100
looking at muscle cars and watching crazy
videos. And then how much are you on?

1444
01:24:43,101 --> 01:24:48,010
Like a computer? I don't
know. Hmm. I didn't, I don't
have that, that data. Right,

1445
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:50,910
but it's not as much and mow,

1446
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:53,990
the good thing about it is most of
my bullshit I'm doing on the phone,

1447
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,200
most of my computer work,
unless I'm laying in bed and I just watch,

1448
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:01,610
embarrassingly enough, I watch youtube
videos on pool. That's what I watch real.

1449
01:25:01,611 --> 01:25:03,020
I go to bed. Yeah,
that's interesting. Well,

1450
01:25:03,021 --> 01:25:06,650
I play pool so I'll watch
like professional pool
matches before I go to bed

1451
01:25:06,651 --> 01:25:10,820
because it's calming, it's relaxing and
I analyze positions. It's interesting.

1452
01:25:10,821 --> 01:25:13,340
I do the same thing with
chess. Ah, that's what I,

1453
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:17,150
there's like chest streamers that
I watch and it's similar. It's key.

1454
01:25:17,151 --> 01:25:21,530
You could kick back and sort of, it's,
you're engaged. But it's nothing crazy.

1455
01:25:21,531 --> 01:25:25,970
And it's also kind of stimulating
in an intellectual way or, yeah,

1456
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,470
it's different than
politics. Yes, yes, yes.

1457
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:31,530
Like on weekends when people, you
know, like my mom will, you know,

1458
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:35,100
I want to talk to me about politics
and I'm just like, I did this all week,

1459
01:25:35,101 --> 01:25:38,550
mom and your mom watch your show.
She does.

1460
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:41,280
And she watches other shows and my family,
super political,

1461
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:43,590
so real and so on the weekends,
if it's Saturday,

1462
01:25:43,591 --> 01:25:46,560
I'm right in the middle of my break
period because they left wing. Oh yeah.

1463
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:51,060
Thank God. Yeah. I imagine,
could you imagine some

1464
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,000
mean dad calling you up? What the
fuck is wrong with you, David?

1465
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:58,950
I might've had to de fu.
Ah, de fu. Mm. Yeah, yeah.

1466
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,750
Anyway. Anyway, indeed. Um,

1467
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:06,190
I think that there's more opportunity
as her saying, to descend,

1468
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:09,140
to disagree with people,
more opportunity to argue.

1469
01:26:09,141 --> 01:26:13,910
And in those more opportunities
you're seeing more conflict.

1470
01:26:13,911 --> 01:26:16,970
And I think more polarization.
And I think, again,

1471
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:20,210
the social media algorithms and
all the other nonsense that gets,

1472
01:26:20,211 --> 01:26:23,930
I think there's, I really do believe
that the, the feeling that I get,

1473
01:26:23,931 --> 01:26:27,770
but it also might be because a big part
of my job is being on the Internet.

1474
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:29,570
So maybe I'm more engaged with it.

1475
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:34,000
RV folks skews it a little bit. Yeah.
But I think, so in practice it, Matt,

1476
01:26:34,001 --> 01:26:37,480
let's imagine that the disagreements
are equal to what they've always been,

1477
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:42,250
but there's more opportunities to
disagree and the algorithm favors more

1478
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:45,130
escalated disagreement
than rational conversation.

1479
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:50,140
The effect is that you might meet someone
with whom you have 80% in common in

1480
01:26:50,141 --> 01:26:51,340
terms of your political views,

1481
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:55,930
but the circumstances in which you engage
with that person are going to be on

1482
01:26:55,931 --> 01:26:57,190
the 20% that you don't.

1483
01:26:57,370 --> 01:27:01,750
So it makes it seem as though you just
have very little common ground with

1484
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:02,690
anybody,
right.

1485
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:07,660
Because the 80% agreement becomes
background and the social media platforms,

1486
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:12,780
the debates happening on youtube elsewhere
are focused only on like the most

1487
01:27:12,881 --> 01:27:17,020
divisive fraction of one's entire
political views. And that's,

1488
01:27:17,021 --> 01:27:18,510
I think what the problem is.
Mm.

1489
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:22,630
But it makes sense because
most people agree that,

1490
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:27,040
I don't know gas stations.
I mean just to pick something innocuous.

1491
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:31,090
Most people agree that it's good to
have a regulatory system that makes sure

1492
01:27:31,091 --> 01:27:33,910
that when you think you've
pumped five gallons of gas,

1493
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,650
you've gotten five gallons of gas,

1494
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:38,590
it's so uncontroversial that
nobody's going to talk about it.

1495
01:27:38,591 --> 01:27:41,680
Like it makes sense that the focus
is going to be on the disagreements.

1496
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,900
Where it's damaging is then when you
meet people in real life and it's hard to

1497
01:27:46,901 --> 01:27:51,250
relate or even be in the same room
because only those differences are sort of

1498
01:27:51,251 --> 01:27:51,950
like played up.
Yeah.

1499
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:56,510
Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Yeah, but
the conflict gets highlighted.

1500
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:59,630
You have conflict bias. Yeah. Yeah. I,

1501
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,910
I don't know where I see this going.

1502
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:09,380
That's one of the more interesting things
about particularly with social media

1503
01:28:09,381 --> 01:28:12,110
and like things when you come
to this crowd or situation,

1504
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,610
I don't know where this is going cause I
didn't know this was ever going to be a

1505
01:28:16,611 --> 01:28:21,110
thing. I had never really considered that
there was going to be some digital town

1506
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:22,670
square that we're all
going to be enjoying.

1507
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,460
Whether it's Twitter or
youtube or whatever it is

1508
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,520
that might even need,
right.

1509
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:31,510
Yeah. That might even need regulation.
But getting back to the Crowder thing,

1510
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:35,540
um,
the issue that you,

1511
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:40,650
so you agree with it in the sense that
he was mocking this person's sexual

1512
01:28:42,431 --> 01:28:43,870
orientation and appearance.

1513
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:49,260
I agree with the assertion that Youtube's
terms of service as written were

1514
01:28:49,781 --> 01:28:54,760
violated on the basis that he was
singling out an individual and the

1515
01:28:54,761 --> 01:28:59,260
characteristics that that
individual was being, uh,

1516
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:02,510
targeted with or spoken were,
uh,

1517
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:07,200
sexual orientation in
terms that, that, um, uh,

1518
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:10,290
the terms of service say is not allowed.

1519
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:15,520
Is that different in your opinion than
someone singling something out for what

1520
01:29:15,521 --> 01:29:18,400
you believe is their mental incompetency?

1521
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:22,940
Well, the mental and comp,
do you mean that they are in
marketing or that they're,

1522
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,150
that they're mentally ill
or cognitively limited,

1523
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:30,030
cognitively limited, mocking their ability
to think, walking their intelligence,

1524
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,030
mocking their decisions, mocking
their, the way they talk,

1525
01:29:33,031 --> 01:29:35,940
and then encouraging other
people to do the same thing.

1526
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:39,210
And then that person gets harassed
based on their intelligence,

1527
01:29:39,211 --> 01:29:43,230
based on their performance on particular
youtube videos and conversations.

1528
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:46,530
And there's active harassers,
there's people that do that.

1529
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:50,360
Is there a difference between,
say what Sam Cedar does to Dave Rubin?

1530
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:55,560
What does Sam do to Dave Ruben? He has,
I don't know that I seen that video.

1531
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,590
Dozens of videos.
Don't say that video.

1532
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:02,820
He has dozens of videos where
he's just dunking on Dave Rubin.

1533
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,260
So I, I mean I, I have some
as well. I believe that they
are substantive. That's my,

1534
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,170
my view is that my video is about
Dave Rubin or substantive. I really,

1535
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:14,850
I don't really watch any left wing stuff
because I want to try to isolate myself

1536
01:30:14,851 --> 01:30:18,240
enough to make sure that what I'm saying
are my id is unique and that I'm not

1537
01:30:18,241 --> 01:30:21,870
taking them. So I know Sam's a friend
of mine and I, oh, that's interesting.

1538
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:23,580
And a comics do though.
I don't know.

1539
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:27,780
But if there some specific examples
we could comment about them. But, um,

1540
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:32,040
I think that there too, to your first
question, there is a difference, uh,

1541
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:35,400
between going after someone
for sexual orientation, right.

1542
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:39,240
Then going after them for the fact that
they say things that are wrong or don't

1543
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:44,241
know stuff until you're making fun of
someone who has an actual handicap of some

1544
01:30:44,911 --> 01:30:46,710
kind, some kind of, you know, uh,

1545
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:50,280
limited cognitive limitation that
would be a disability of some kind.

1546
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,490
Then you are mocking
someone for a decision.

1547
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:57,250
The resulting effect of the harassment.
The,

1548
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,400
see this is what I was getting
at before with Crowder.

1549
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:01,620
Like what Crowder said was one thing,

1550
01:31:01,621 --> 01:31:05,760
but one of the things that Carlos Mesa
was discussing was what the people that

1551
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:07,980
had watch Crowder,
what they were doing,

1552
01:31:07,981 --> 01:31:11,940
how they were going after him as if
see that and that is a real discussion.

1553
01:31:11,941 --> 01:31:12,774
Like what,

1554
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:17,930
what happens when you say something about
someone and then your fans agree and

1555
01:31:18,421 --> 01:31:19,620
then they take action.

1556
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:24,960
Which I didn't see that in the Steven
Crowder decision that the reaction was

1557
01:31:27,341 --> 01:31:30,490
part of youtube evaluation.
Now I may just have missed that,

1558
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:35,260
but I didn't see youtube say that part
of the calculation had to do with what

1559
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,273
other people were.

1560
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:38,330
I don't think they did say that
and I don't think they would,

1561
01:31:38,630 --> 01:31:41,690
but I think Carlos Mesa did say that
it was one of the things that he was

1562
01:31:41,691 --> 01:31:45,290
talking about this endless assault.
He's experienced.

1563
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:50,440
Well he's right to, uh,
call it deplorable. I think
we would agree with that.

1564
01:31:50,441 --> 01:31:53,770
I think your question is
more about whether you choose
who's responsible for it,

1565
01:31:53,771 --> 01:31:54,790
where is responsible for it.
Yeah.

1566
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:55,631
He's anonymous.

1567
01:31:55,631 --> 01:31:59,980
People that can just lash out at someone
and insult them out of ultimately

1568
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,970
they are responsible. Those people
respond. People tend to agree. However,

1569
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:07,540
um,
so there's this term stochastic terrorism,

1570
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:10,150
I dunno if you're familiar
with the Catholic terrorism,

1571
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:15,100
is the idea that if you have
a big enough audience, um,

1572
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:20,220
and you go and every day you're talking
about someone should really do something

1573
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:25,900
about a particular politician,
you're doing it every day.
You're doing every day,

1574
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,700
uh,
at a certain point,

1575
01:32:27,701 --> 01:32:30,160
given a large enough audience
and enough repetition of that.

1576
01:32:30,161 --> 01:32:33,670
And the fact that there's like a
distribution of people's emotional states,

1577
01:32:33,671 --> 01:32:35,350
cognitive capacity,
et Cetera,

1578
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:41,340
it is statistically probable that someone
from that audience is going to go and

1579
01:32:41,801 --> 01:32:45,220
try to do something about whoever
it is that you're targeting.

1580
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:50,970
That individual who has the show and is
hammering on this person day after day

1581
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:51,904
after day,

1582
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:56,830
they're not going to be
legally responsible for that
person from their audience

1583
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,390
who went and did something.

1584
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:01,510
There's no way that you're going to
hold them legally responsible under the

1585
01:33:01,511 --> 01:33:02,920
current legal system that we have,

1586
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:08,430
but you could argue that
it is irresponsible in some
way not to understand that

1587
01:33:09,131 --> 01:33:11,260
your consequences have actions.
Of course,

1588
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:15,460
the person who goes and does the
violent act is the primary person who is

1589
01:33:15,461 --> 01:33:19,330
responsible, right? But as long as
you're not calling out for that act,

1590
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:24,460
how do we make this distinction that
someone is encouraging that act or someone

1591
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:28,630
is at least inspiring that their
judgment calls? I mean, listen,

1592
01:33:28,631 --> 01:33:33,220
I can go on my show and I can speak
in vague terminology or specific

1593
01:33:33,221 --> 01:33:36,310
terminology. You know,
imagine that there's a local
business that I don't like.

1594
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:41,440
I could go on my show and I could
say this business did this and I need

1595
01:33:41,441 --> 01:33:46,441
everybody in my audience to show up
there and to make it impossible to get in

1596
01:33:46,451 --> 01:33:50,680
and patronize that business. That's very
clearly on one side of the gray area.

1597
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,540
I could instead say, you know, uh,

1598
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:58,240
there's a business and I could say the
type of business, but I not, not name it.

1599
01:33:58,241 --> 01:33:59,590
If it's a small enough town,

1600
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:03,040
people would know exactly what business
I'm talking about and I really don't

1601
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:04,450
like the way I was treated there.

1602
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:08,500
And if only there was some way that
someone could do something about it,

1603
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:10,710
the effect could be the exact same on it.
Right.

1604
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:13,850
I don't know how you measure when it's
on one side and yeah. It's like, yeah,

1605
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:17,380
right.
You could somehow or another remove your,

1606
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,820
you're, you could somehow or
another make it so that it's, yeah,

1607
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:28,400
I'm agreeing with you.
Yeah. You can remove your
responsibility for their actions.

1608
01:34:28,401 --> 01:34:32,250
Some sort of what was just got
interesting. Uh, um, I was just,

1609
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:36,900
I was trying to find a tweet from Mazda
about him sending or asking people to

1610
01:34:36,901 --> 01:34:38,430
flag Crowder's videos.

1611
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:41,880
Did you get the one where he asked people
to go assault people with milkshakes?

1612
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:46,220
So he ate them at every turn you
to tweet it an hour ago or yeah,

1613
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:50,730
1230 that to clarify, this is
responding to Carlos Mazda to clarify.

1614
01:34:50,731 --> 01:34:52,800
In order to restate
monetization on his channel,

1615
01:34:52,801 --> 01:34:57,590
he will need to remove the link to his
t shirts. Oh, so it's the figs t shirt?

1616
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:58,453
Yeah.

1617
01:34:58,490 --> 01:34:59,900
Oh well that's all he has to do.

1618
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:02,150
He specifically asked about
that and then they respond.

1619
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,970
That's why I have to do wow.
That's well using. That's pretty,

1620
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:08,120
pretty straightforward. It's pretty
straight forward. Yeah. The shirts stupid.

1621
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:11,660
But you know, he's a comedian.
I mean that's a crowd is doing.

1622
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:16,370
And his doing the thing about Mesa,
he's mocking him for his appearance.

1623
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:21,400
But Carlos Mesa specifically encouraged
people to throw milkshakes at people

1624
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:28,030
that disagree with him and to harass
them publicly and humiliate them.

1625
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:30,960
So one thing that does not justify
the other, no, it doesn't have that.

1626
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:33,350
But that is more egregious.

1627
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:38,270
How fast can people to assault people
and asking people to physically humiliate

1628
01:35:38,271 --> 01:35:42,050
people in person, in my
opinion, is more egregious.

1629
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:47,120
I don't agree with mocking his physical
a p well as physical appearances.

1630
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:52,610
That's just what it is, you know? But
the sexual orientation aspect of it,

1631
01:35:52,611 --> 01:35:56,360
it's like, yeah, I get it, I get it. It's
not, it's not nice. How far do you think,

1632
01:35:56,361 --> 01:35:57,020
sorry,

1633
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:01,520
this is just a comedian thing goes
because I hear that a lot in just excusing

1634
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,600
things that are said. He's trying to do
comedy, right? So He's trying to make fun.

1635
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:06,920
Izzy yell,
hold on,

1636
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:09,920
but make comedy and making fun of
someone are two different things.

1637
01:36:09,921 --> 01:36:13,170
Like I don't do comedy, but
I will sometimes make fun
of things people say. Right.

1638
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:14,960
But he's doing it to be funny.

1639
01:36:14,961 --> 01:36:18,980
He's making fun of things specifically
to be funny. And sometimes you know,

1640
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,970
when you do that, you go
too far, you cross lines.

1641
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:26,540
I genuinely did not realize that Crowder
does a comedy show. Oh yeah, yeah.

1642
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:31,190
He's so when he, so when show is a comedy
show. Wow. Yeah. A lot of it is funny.

1643
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:33,470
He does some funny shit.
He really does.

1644
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:36,350
Whether you agree with them or disagree
with them. He's done some hilarious bits.

1645
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:40,850
I genuinely, I'm, I'm reacting
in real time because I had
no idea. He has his spit.

1646
01:36:40,851 --> 01:36:42,410
He does about this French socialists.

1647
01:36:42,411 --> 01:36:44,840
He puts on a wig and pretends
to be this different person.

1648
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:48,140
He's pretending to be a
transgender person is pretended to.

1649
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:51,220
He's done a bunch of these
infiltration videos. We'll,

1650
01:36:51,221 --> 01:36:54,500
he'll go into these ridiculous
organizations and ask them questions,

1651
01:36:54,501 --> 01:36:59,060
but it's very much a comedy show
dressing up like a trans person's funny.

1652
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:03,680
It is. If you're funny at
it, if you could, I mean, Mrs
Doubtfire isn't that funny?

1653
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:06,110
And that's what he was doing.
He was dressing up as a woman.

1654
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,090
He was dressing up as a woman,
right.

1655
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,610
He was dressing up as a woman
and that's a great movie.

1656
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:12,950
I agree with you there over
there's some funny shit.

1657
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:17,780
And look how many times and in living
color did they dress up like women,

1658
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:18,410
there's,

1659
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:23,410
there's some humor to someone who is
a man who's dressing up like a woman.

1660
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,160
Sure. That can, that can be an,

1661
01:37:25,161 --> 01:37:28,310
I shouldn't comment specifically on
crowd or doing it if I hadn't seen it.

1662
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,040
Now he's got some funny shit he does.
You know.

1663
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:34,890
And I'll take shit for that for saying
that. He's funny. He makes me laugh too.

1664
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:38,450
I'm staying quiet. Yeah I
know, I understand. I get it.

1665
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,370
I don't agree with him.

1666
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:44,840
You know constantly going on and on about
this guy being queer are calling them

1667
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:47,150
a lispy little queer but he's
doing it to try to be funny.

1668
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:50,060
So the question is when can
you do that to be funny?

1669
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:53,540
And apparently with youtube you can do
that and be funny as long as you were

1670
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:56,310
always on the tee shirt tee
shirt. Yeah. This is interesting

1671
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:59,880
actually. Even that's even weirder
now this is weird that they just,

1672
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:03,870
if he removes a t shirt of link, a link
to the tee shirt, oh he can still sell it.

1673
01:38:03,871 --> 01:38:06,150
He just can't link to it from Youtube.
I think that's what they're saying.

1674
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:09,620
That's so minor that it's hard to,
I mean it is what it is

1675
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:13,940
cause it's sort of an encouraging people
to buy it. And then youtube would say,

1676
01:38:13,941 --> 01:38:15,530
well,
if you have an add on that,

1677
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:20,800
then you're encouraging homophobic
behavior and we can allow that with our

1678
01:38:21,231 --> 01:38:22,370
monetization policy.

1679
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:25,960
I mean it's minor in the
context of everything else
that's wrapped up in this I

1680
01:38:25,970 --> 01:38:28,070
buy it might be an important fun,
you know,

1681
01:38:28,071 --> 01:38:32,570
revenue generating tee shirt for
I think so much of this, again,

1682
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,810
these disagreements on issues,

1683
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:37,930
it comes down to what you
and I were talking about
before that if two people are

1684
01:38:37,931 --> 01:38:40,780
in a room together,
95% of what they're talking about,

1685
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:43,600
you're going to agree on when
someone's making a video on someone.

1686
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:46,690
If they just to say like
fucking David Pakman man, I,

1687
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:50,740
here's my deal with that guy and then
you just ranting thing and is I hate his

1688
01:38:50,741 --> 01:38:53,890
fucking neck and I don't like
his shirt and his face is stupid.

1689
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,020
When people do stuff like
that, it's just, it's a,

1690
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,830
it's a terrible way to communicate
because it's, first of all,

1691
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:04,120
you would have to be a real asshole to
say most of the things that people say

1692
01:39:04,121 --> 01:39:07,090
about things and they're dunking
on them in person. You have to be,

1693
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:11,230
you used to be a bad person,
so you know the person's going to see it.

1694
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:13,930
So you're just deciding I'm
going to be a bad person,

1695
01:39:13,931 --> 01:39:17,560
but I'm pretend I'm not a bad person
because I'm going to do it in a way where

1696
01:39:17,561 --> 01:39:20,260
they're not in the room, so I'm just going
to shit all over him and give him my,

1697
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,710
my real opinion.
But it's not like a real,

1698
01:39:23,711 --> 01:39:27,780
it's not like you and I are at dinner
and you're like, you know, fuck this guy.

1699
01:39:27,781 --> 01:39:31,660
And that's, that's how people
talk. But when you're doing that,

1700
01:39:31,661 --> 01:39:33,400
but you're doing it,
you're broadcasting it.

1701
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:38,580
I think we're all learning in this process
of doing podcasts and video blogs on

1702
01:39:40,091 --> 01:39:43,750
this stuff.
We're all learning that you're not alone.

1703
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:49,300
You are doing this and you're saying it
in a way that that person's going to see

1704
01:39:49,301 --> 01:39:52,090
in the same, could be applied to, uh,

1705
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:56,710
Dave Ruben and Sam Cedar
dunking on them all the time.

1706
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:59,110
It's kind of the same thing.
And Michael Roberts as well.

1707
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:03,220
So same sort of thing there. That
that's what they're doing. Yeah.

1708
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:07,180
And they're saying things that they
wouldn't say if he was there in person.

1709
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:11,620
Right. But sure. Okay. Guilty. They were
sitting around having lunch together,

1710
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:14,410
talking shit about some stupid
thing that he said the night before.

1711
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:16,020
Yeah, that, that's
fine. And I don't think,

1712
01:40:16,021 --> 01:40:20,640
I mean whether or not you
would say something in person
doesn't tell us whether

1713
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:22,920
it's a fair or unfair critique.
True.

1714
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:27,360
I think it's fair to say I try to avoid
strict ad hominems I will, I mean listen,

1715
01:40:27,361 --> 01:40:30,390
we're all trying to get,
build an audience, right?
So at a certain point, yes.

1716
01:40:30,391 --> 01:40:33,360
Like I will pick titles that I think
are the most interesting titles to get

1717
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:36,360
people to watch the thing or whatever.

1718
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:39,360
Or I'll use vocabulary that
I might not use in person,

1719
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:43,440
but at least what I'm trying to do is
make it as substantive as possible and to

1720
01:40:43,441 --> 01:40:47,790
sort of like justify how I came to
my conclusions. That part of it in,

1721
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:52,791
in person conversations usually will
not lend itself to like screaming or

1722
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:55,510
violence or whatever.
If that part is the focus.

1723
01:40:55,511 --> 01:40:57,520
I I completely agree with you on that.

1724
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:01,150
Yeah. I think we'd be better off
if we did try to communicate with,

1725
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:04,510
but when you're doing comedy
that goes out the window.

1726
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:06,440
It does.
But Co even comedy aside,

1727
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:11,330
I agree with the principal communicate
battle of ideas, a marketplace of ideas,

1728
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:11,871
very,

1729
01:41:11,871 --> 01:41:15,170
very big ideas we all want to hear about
and what are the best ideas and let's

1730
01:41:15,171 --> 01:41:16,004
rank the ideas.

1731
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:21,640
There are people whose views
are so extreme that you
can't really bring them to

1732
01:41:21,711 --> 01:41:26,480
the table as reasonable
negotiating partners for
figuring something out. Right?

1733
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:30,170
Like Richard Spencer. Oh sure.
Or, or even, I mean, okay.

1734
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:34,940
Imagine Farah Khan, uh, Louis Farrakhan
who I've spoken out about, uh, many times.

1735
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:37,490
Imagine that we want to figure
out what the tax rate should be.

1736
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,550
Something that politicians
have to do all the time.

1737
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:45,860
If you have a group of people who
believe that we need a 25% flat tax and a

1738
01:41:45,861 --> 01:41:47,090
group of people who want,
you know,

1739
01:41:47,091 --> 01:41:50,780
like an escalating progressive tax
that gets as high as 70% on income,

1740
01:41:50,781 --> 01:41:53,000
over 10 million, whatever,
right? Like Philadel all,

1741
01:41:53,001 --> 01:41:56,000
then all those people are going
to be able to have a conversation.

1742
01:41:56,570 --> 01:42:01,570
If someone comes in who says any taxes
that the government collects are a form

1743
01:42:01,701 --> 01:42:02,534
of slavery,

1744
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:07,010
how do you integrate that into the
conversation about how to set tax rates?

1745
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:09,953
Hmm.

1746
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:15,190
You can't, right? Yeah. So
all of this stuff, you know,

1747
01:42:15,191 --> 01:42:16,480
there's this new movement now,

1748
01:42:16,481 --> 01:42:21,481
which I think is great about long
form conversations going in depth,

1749
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,880
figuring out what our disagreements
are like. I'm for all of it.

1750
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:28,800
I'm absolutely for all of it. I think you
do it. I do it, I do it, and I'm sure,

1751
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:29,703
okay.

1752
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:34,860
But where I do think that there's like
a lack of of pragmatic reality to it is

1753
01:42:35,290 --> 01:42:39,340
some people's ideas are so extreme
that they can't in any sensible way,

1754
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:43,390
be incorporated into an actual good
faith discussion of how society should be

1755
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:44,630
organized.
That is the,

1756
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:47,400
the problem with having
conversations and scale, right?

1757
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:50,010
And that's the problem with Twitter and
with youtube that you're dealing with

1758
01:42:50,011 --> 01:42:52,470
millions and millions and
millions of human beings.

1759
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:55,170
And when you have that
broad spectrum of humans,

1760
01:42:55,171 --> 01:42:57,690
you're going to have people
on the far ends of both sides.

1761
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:59,880
And at a certain point they're a decision.

1762
01:42:59,881 --> 01:43:04,650
Has to be made about who actually gets
to participate in the decision making

1763
01:43:04,651 --> 01:43:05,400
conversations,
right?

1764
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:08,100
It's great for everybody to have
a voice on taxation on Twitter.

1765
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:11,640
But imagine if there was a
significant portion of the,

1766
01:43:11,641 --> 01:43:15,060
of our elected officials who
straight up think taxes are slavery.

1767
01:43:15,061 --> 01:43:18,600
Like I just don't know how that becomes
integrated into a decision about tax

1768
01:43:18,601 --> 01:43:19,434
policy.

1769
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,333
Right?
Um,

1770
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:25,340
I think the argument would be that bad
ideas should be combated with good ideas,

1771
01:43:26,521 --> 01:43:29,910
not with silencing someone.
And that when you do silence someone,

1772
01:43:29,911 --> 01:43:34,470
you just sort of create this blockade
where the idea of builds up behind it and

1773
01:43:34,471 --> 01:43:38,550
then the opposition to your perspective
builds up and then people start picking

1774
01:43:38,551 --> 01:43:40,020
teams and picking sides.
And,

1775
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,650
and I honestly think that that's something
that's going to be going on right now

1776
01:43:43,651 --> 01:43:46,080
with the sole Crowder Crowder,
vox thing.

1777
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:49,410
I think people are going to pick
sides and they fucking love it.

1778
01:43:49,650 --> 01:43:51,980
People love a good to get into.
There's

1779
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:56,870
a lot of people in the cubicles right now
that are weighing in and firing up and

1780
01:43:56,871 --> 01:44:00,350
there's people that want to dock him
again and these people want to infiltrate

1781
01:44:00,351 --> 01:44:03,870
as Facebook and it's Twitter. That's what
people do. And you're dealing with milk.

1782
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,940
I mean the car, what does
the crowd or have 3.5, 3.8
million, something like that.

1783
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:08,361
I mean,

1784
01:44:08,361 --> 01:44:13,190
I think what you have to also remember
is it's not just the reactions that are,

1785
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:18,350
uh, sort of like tailored to continue
the escalation. I mean, in the end,

1786
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:23,180
maybe Crowder personally in his personal
life does refer to people he perceives

1787
01:44:23,181 --> 01:44:26,360
to be gay or who are gay as
queers. I don't know. I don't,

1788
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:30,020
or he uses the word fags. I have no
idea. Well, he didn't use that word.

1789
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:34,250
The t shirt. It has the asterisk I get,
it's a goof. It's actually as a fig.

1790
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:39,500
It doesn't have an asterisk.
The okay. Or an ae is a fig.

1791
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:44,060
Okay. For figs. It's the
idea. It's an, I got it. Okay.

1792
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:48,840
It's a goofy joke. Fair. My point
is, um, I don't know, you know,

1793
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:53,890
any sensible person who lives in the
west and has access to media like Steven

1794
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:59,140
Crowder or whoever knows that the use of
that language has a very specific path,

1795
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:05,420
that and set of reactions that it's
going to trigger you. Specifically the,

1796
01:45:05,421 --> 01:45:06,254
that shirt,

1797
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:11,360
the shirt and honoring to Carlos
Mazda as a young queer Mexican or,

1798
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:12,790
or whatever the phrase is.

1799
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:18,430
That's a w one w the queer one is a weird
one because it's what it's with Lbgtq.

1800
01:45:19,371 --> 01:45:21,380
Like what is like,
here's a good one, right?

1801
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:25,610
National Association for the advancement
of colored people. Okay. Naacp.

1802
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:27,860
You can't call people colored people.
Sure.

1803
01:45:27,861 --> 01:45:31,530
But that organization was
named a long time ago. It's,

1804
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:35,510
it's more acronyms than anything else
at this point, Sam. But it's not right.

1805
01:45:35,511 --> 01:45:36,080
You both,

1806
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:41,080
we both know what the acronym with the
individual letters or words in that

1807
01:45:41,721 --> 01:45:43,250
acronym are.

1808
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:47,840
I think the word queer
is not a derogatory word,

1809
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:53,210
but it is, or it cannot be,
depending on how it's, Yo,
you fucking queer. Yeah, sure.

1810
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:57,050
I mean, listen, it's the same way with
Jew. Right, right, right, right, right.

1811
01:45:57,051 --> 01:46:00,230
I'm in a family thing and it's
a bunch of Jews or whatever.

1812
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:04,910
That's a word that can be used in
a way that if someone shows up,

1813
01:46:04,911 --> 01:46:09,620
if Richard Spencer shows up or one of
his followers and goes to a bar Mitzvah

1814
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:12,470
and talks about this room full of Jews,

1815
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,990
the word is the same root word less.

1816
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:17,630
We're talking about two very
different things. That's a good point.

1817
01:46:17,631 --> 01:46:21,230
But should he be allowed to say this
room full of Jews allowed? I mean,

1818
01:46:21,231 --> 01:46:24,890
it's not illegal. No, it's not illegal.
He wasn't allowed. He is allowed,

1819
01:46:24,891 --> 01:46:29,810
but where does it like this room full
of w where does it get toxic? Well,

1820
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,520
if Richard Spencer shows up at a,

1821
01:46:31,521 --> 01:46:35,090
at a bar Mitzvah and yells about
this room full of Jews, I think, uh,

1822
01:46:35,091 --> 01:46:36,070
it's gotten toxic.
Yeah.

1823
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:40,730
That's a good subject to break this
stalemate of this subject, not steal me,

1824
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:45,530
but just sort of end this antisemitism,
right.

1825
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:50,070
Seems to be ridiculously on the
rise and that, that's stunning to

1826
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:54,360
me. That shocked me when I
lie because of the Internet,

1827
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:58,260
the Internet sort of exposed antisemitism
that I didn't necessarily know existed.

1828
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,560
I see at the levels that existed at,
I knew there was antisemites,

1829
01:47:01,561 --> 01:47:03,840
but I didn't even know there
were so brazen in over.

1830
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:08,940
Well, they've gotten brazen
since January of 2017. Oh,

1831
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:09,620
okay.

1832
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:13,970
I don't know that Donald
Trump has created antisemites.

1833
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:18,020
In fact, he probably hasn't, well his
son in law's choose son-in-laws Jewish,

1834
01:47:18,021 --> 01:47:20,910
his daughter converted to Judaism,
etc. Uh,

1835
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:24,020
but I think that Richard Spencer told me,

1836
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:28,790
we know that Trump is not literally a
white nationalist who is going to talk

1837
01:47:28,791 --> 01:47:30,830
about let's take control
back from the Jews.

1838
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:35,180
But we see him as the closest
thing to what we would like.

1839
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:38,240
He talks about people from Mexico,

1840
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:42,020
he talks about shithole
countries, et cetera. Um,

1841
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:46,730
so it's just emboldened the movement.
It doesn't necessarily create

1842
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:51,380
people from Mexico and should hold
countries that doesn't necessarily really

1843
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:52,790
equate with Israel.

1844
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:56,450
No. Well, antisemitism in Israel also
are two totally separate thing. I mean,

1845
01:47:56,530 --> 01:47:57,360
think it's just a,

1846
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:02,360
you could be against the current Israeli
administration as I am like Benjamin

1847
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:06,180
Netanyahu and still call out antisemitism
against Jews in the short states,

1848
01:48:06,181 --> 01:48:08,700
for example, or whatever. I see
what you're saying. It doesn't,

1849
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:11,130
one is not directly linked to the other,

1850
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:16,490
but if you're a group that already has
these views and then you see a guy who

1851
01:48:16,981 --> 01:48:21,420
opens his campaign talking about, um,
they're sending rapists and criminals,

1852
01:48:21,421 --> 01:48:24,660
but some I'm sure are good people and
I don't want people coming here from

1853
01:48:24,661 --> 01:48:28,050
shithole countries. What about Norwegians?
Whatever. Right. It's a signal.

1854
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:30,990
It's a signal.
And I've spoken to former KKK people,

1855
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:36,020
some of whom are really interesting people
to talk to and they know exactly why

1856
01:48:37,201 --> 01:48:40,680
it's appealing because they see the
signals and the vocabulary and the dog

1857
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:44,220
whistling. So I think it's just
brought it out into the forefront.

1858
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:48,030
I don't know that new antisemitism
has necessarily been generated,

1859
01:48:48,031 --> 01:48:52,050
although it being in the
forefront probably does
start to get some people kind

1860
01:48:52,051 --> 01:48:54,810
of curious like, oh, maybe
all the problems are because
of the Jews. I don't know.

1861
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:57,920
Mm.
It's just a,

1862
01:48:57,921 --> 01:49:02,450
I guess they find groups of like minded
folks and they join along. Right?

1863
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:05,200
Is that the antisemites? Yeah. The,

1864
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:09,800
they find them online and then you can
stumble into it where you ordinarily

1865
01:49:09,801 --> 01:49:11,840
wouldn't be around people that
are having those discussions

1866
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:12,881
that can happen.

1867
01:49:12,881 --> 01:49:16,870
And a lot of the people that I've talked
to that got into those beliefs and then

1868
01:49:16,871 --> 01:49:21,760
out of them said that they got
in usually on a community level,

1869
01:49:21,790 --> 01:49:25,960
there was something about the community
that was appealing to like gangs, gangs,

1870
01:49:25,961 --> 01:49:30,550
or in the case of KKK and white
supremacy, people that, um,

1871
01:49:30,551 --> 01:49:34,150
had a bad home situation and they
found a group that would accept them.

1872
01:49:34,151 --> 01:49:37,930
Like partially they would accept them
because they were white. Right. Um,

1873
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:41,550
and then they got pulled into
the beliefs and eventually they,

1874
01:49:41,551 --> 01:49:43,100
they sort of got out of them.
Yeah.

1875
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,470
It's just a,

1876
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:50,560
so you think the rise of in
2017 there's more antisemitism,

1877
01:49:50,561 --> 01:49:52,260
or do you think it's more or for overt,

1878
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:56,860
I believe it's moreover because Trump was
the president. Yeah. Hmm. And you know,

1879
01:49:56,861 --> 01:50:00,760
groups that track these,
uh, incidents like the Anti
Defamation League and others,

1880
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:03,700
they have the data and
there have been increases.

1881
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:07,710
Hmm. Yeah. It's, it's
stunning to me. You know, you,

1882
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:11,720
you see it online so many different places
now and I just don't remember seeing

1883
01:50:11,721 --> 01:50:15,900
it before or not like that.
Not that's you'd run into it.

1884
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:18,590
So often are people calling
people design is shills.

1885
01:50:19,130 --> 01:50:21,860
Yeah. I mean that's an important
thing to talk about. I mean,

1886
01:50:21,861 --> 01:50:26,210
people call me that all the
time. Mm. And, um, you know,

1887
01:50:26,211 --> 01:50:30,140
I feel like that is an
issue where I try to speak,

1888
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:34,730
I mean she'll to me suggests
that you're saying one thing,

1889
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:40,280
but with some kind of other agenda
that you're trying to push in some way.

1890
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:42,320
In other words,
you are,

1891
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:47,240
you are being in some way deceptive about
your actual intentions in what you say.

1892
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:49,250
So I think when people
call me a Zionist shill,

1893
01:50:49,251 --> 01:50:54,251
what they mean is I'm talking about one
thing with the secret goal or below the

1894
01:50:55,851 --> 01:51:00,230
surface goal of actually promoting
some action by the state of Israel.

1895
01:51:01,010 --> 01:51:05,060
I think that's the idea of a shill.
Um, but you know, I mean, I, I,

1896
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:09,110
I'm opposed to the current
prime minister in Israel. Uh,

1897
01:51:09,111 --> 01:51:12,230
I've made clear that isn't in
trouble right now. Uh, yeah.

1898
01:51:12,231 --> 01:51:15,020
I mean he's been in tentative
trouble for a long time.

1899
01:51:15,021 --> 01:51:19,880
His wife is in trouble as well,
I believe. Um, but that, I mean,

1900
01:51:19,881 --> 01:51:23,390
the problem is, and I know that there
are people on the left and right,

1901
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:25,430
that when I say this will,
I'm gonna,

1902
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,410
I mean I'm going to get crushed
from what I'm about to say.

1903
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:31,160
Sometimes when someone says Zionist Shill,

1904
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:35,210
it's related to your view on the
Israeli Palestinian conflict.

1905
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:37,070
Sometimes when someone's has sinus shell,

1906
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:40,500
it's covered for just wanting to
insult someone for being Jewish or for

1907
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:43,520
antisemitism. You gotta look
at every instance one by one.

1908
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:47,930
Yeah. And sometimes people just
like saying things too. Yeah. Yeah.

1909
01:51:47,931 --> 01:51:50,840
It's a popular thing to say, especially
if they find out that you're Jewish.

1910
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:52,570
Absolutely. It's like a thing. Yeah.

1911
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:56,570
It's a thing to say it's a little
weapon to use. It absolutely is.

1912
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:01,670
Do you find,
this is sort of an abstract question,

1913
01:52:01,671 --> 01:52:05,440
but overall like doing this show and,
uh,

1914
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:10,190
and having this increased ever
increased exposure, do you,

1915
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:12,110
do you enjoy it?
Are you,

1916
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:15,200
are you weirded out by the
interactions with all the people?

1917
01:52:15,201 --> 01:52:18,260
Do you feel pressure by all
the comments and the, the,

1918
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:22,960
do you feel like a little bit of anxiety
from all the social media aspect of it?

1919
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:25,880
I, I do. Um, so I,

1920
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:31,040
I enjoy the idea that people are listening
to my ideas and either agreeing or

1921
01:52:31,131 --> 01:52:31,821
disagreeing,

1922
01:52:31,821 --> 01:52:35,510
but they're considering them and then
integrating it into how they figure out

1923
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:38,300
what they think about the world
around them. That's awesome.

1924
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:43,250
I do get weirded out
by sort of like safety,

1925
01:52:43,251 --> 01:52:46,700
security stuff that sometimes comes up,

1926
01:52:46,730 --> 01:52:50,510
which I try not to even like put too
much attention on because I feel like it

1927
01:52:50,511 --> 01:52:54,770
just feeds,
it gives people ideas and um,

1928
01:52:55,460 --> 01:52:58,640
people who, you know,
come up to me and I mean,

1929
01:52:58,641 --> 01:53:01,310
I'm more curious to actually hear
your thoughts about this. Uh,

1930
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:02,690
come up to me and you know,

1931
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:07,400
they may not necessarily see the world
the way I see it and I'm unsure sort of

1932
01:53:07,401 --> 01:53:09,830
like what are their intentions
type of thing. I mean, I,

1933
01:53:09,831 --> 01:53:14,180
it gives me anxiety and it gives people
that are close to me. Anxiety for sure.

1934
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:18,030
Yeah, because your profiles, just if you
keep doing this, you're very good at it.

1935
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:20,910
Thank you. You're going to continue
to get more and more popular.

1936
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:24,930
Yeah. And I mean I guess it's a double
edged sword. I mean, I don't know.

1937
01:53:24,931 --> 01:53:28,230
Like when when you do a
comedy show afterwards,

1938
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,350
is it kind of like a free for all where
people can come up and chat with you

1939
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:35,710
sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. And do you
get skiddish? No. You don't know.

1940
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:40,060
Most people are nice. I agree.
The vast majority of people
are nice. I agree. They,

1941
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:41,380
they come to see you.
They're there.

1942
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:45,310
They're usually fans and they just
want to take pictures of say what's up.

1943
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:48,840
Yeah. I guess it's a little different when
what you do is like overtly political.

1944
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:53,070
Yes. Versus other areas. Like if you're
an actor, comedian doing the right things,

1945
01:53:53,130 --> 01:53:53,970
race, car driver. Yeah.

1946
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:58,440
Right. You are in a much more
conflict driven profession. Yeah.

1947
01:53:58,530 --> 01:54:03,400
In a sense. Yeah. I mean I,
I have political people on
like you, but um, you know,

1948
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:06,390
I'm not entirely engaged in
politics like you guys are,

1949
01:54:06,490 --> 01:54:08,830
right? Yeah. I don't know. I mean,

1950
01:54:08,831 --> 01:54:13,831
I do worry that no matter what
happens in the next few elections,

1951
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:18,200
I don't know how we reverse the,
uh,

1952
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:22,660
radicalization polarization effects of
the social media echo chambers that we've

1953
01:54:22,661 --> 01:54:26,920
been talking about. And I only
see that as further. I mean,

1954
01:54:26,921 --> 01:54:29,320
we could still accomplish good
things while that's going on.

1955
01:54:29,321 --> 01:54:32,110
Like I think if we elect the right people,
maybe we can get good things done.

1956
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:35,830
But in parallel,
there is this like hyper radicalized,

1957
01:54:35,831 --> 01:54:37,930
polarized narrative that's going on.

1958
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:40,600
And I don't see any way that
that's going to turn around.

1959
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:44,470
I wonder myself. I do.
I, and, and I'm very,

1960
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:50,100
very confused by it because I don't see
any longterm solution for this other

1961
01:54:51,701 --> 01:54:54,730
than some radical change in the way
human beings communicate with each other.

1962
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:58,590
And now that I've contemplated
that and hypothesized,

1963
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:03,660
theorized and I really think that if what
has changed the way we communicate as

1964
01:55:04,901 --> 01:55:06,690
technology and this,
um,

1965
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:09,760
the immersive immersive aspect
of social media technology,

1966
01:55:09,761 --> 01:55:12,790
the fact that we carry these devices
with us all the time that allow us to

1967
01:55:12,791 --> 01:55:16,040
communicate and allowed us to read
other people's communications and,

1968
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:17,800
or watch or the people's communications.

1969
01:55:18,340 --> 01:55:23,340
And I have a concern that this
is going to escalate with each x,

1970
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:30,800
each expansion and each innovation
in terms of like what I,

1971
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:33,910
and I don't know what it would be
because no one saw the internet coming.

1972
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:35,530
If you go back 30 years ago,

1973
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:38,740
no one ever thought anything was going
to be anything like it is now. Well,

1974
01:55:38,741 --> 01:55:43,410
Al Gore did. Ha, I bet
he did. Um, but if you,

1975
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:48,210
but if you go 30 years from now, I mean,
what are we really looking at? What, what,

1976
01:55:48,211 --> 01:55:52,260
what, what, what is this world going to
be? I don't think anybody has an idea.

1977
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:55,620
I think we have no idea. And I think it's
going to be, if you look at the trend,

1978
01:55:55,650 --> 01:56:00,650
the trend is not towards calming
people down and giving people space and

1979
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:04,290
allowing people to meditate more and know
that the trend is to get more and more

1980
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:05,190
immersed.
Right?

1981
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:09,090
The trend is for us to get closer and
closer to each other to remove boundaries,

1982
01:56:09,091 --> 01:56:14,091
room boundaries for information
and ideas and even in longterm,

1983
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:19,230
um, contemplations of this, I've
often thought that everything right,

1984
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:23,940
all of our communication is basically
ones and Zeros. It's all information.

1985
01:56:23,941 --> 01:56:27,840
It's all words and thoughts and
videos and now you're getting into

1986
01:56:27,841 --> 01:56:31,800
cryptocurrency now. Crypto currencies,
essentially ones and Zeros.

1987
01:56:31,801 --> 01:56:34,710
It's all digital.
Everything is digital and the bottlenecks,

1988
01:56:34,711 --> 01:56:36,450
if any bottlenecks are there at all.

1989
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:41,190
The bottlenecks are slowly but
surely getting removed. This, the,

1990
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:43,380
the Bot,
the blockades and the walls.

1991
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:49,260
I think we're going to
probably experienced some
sort of a level of immersive

1992
01:56:49,261 --> 01:56:53,430
technology in our lifetimes that's
going to change the way human beings

1993
01:56:53,431 --> 01:56:57,060
communicate period. And that we're going
to look back at this time like, Huh,

1994
01:56:57,240 --> 01:57:00,480
I remember when we thought that like
social media arguments where like the big

1995
01:57:00,481 --> 01:57:01,314
deal. Yeah. Yeah.

1996
01:57:01,970 --> 01:57:04,220
I um,
I was a recent,

1997
01:57:04,221 --> 01:57:09,221
I used to have more of like a techno
Utopian view and it started to sort of

1998
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:15,180
change partially because of some of
the Psi Phi I read [inaudible] and

1999
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:17,330
everything.
But most recently,

2000
01:57:17,331 --> 01:57:22,310
so like 15 years ago I read the Richard
Came Oregon book altered carbon.

2001
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:25,940
Uh, and at the time I was like,
this has to be made into something.

2002
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:29,090
That's the one that's on Netflix now.
And then like a year ago,

2003
01:57:29,091 --> 01:57:31,940
Joel Kinnaman was in the
series and it was just awesome.

2004
01:57:31,941 --> 01:57:35,330
And the series is quite good
as yours is quite good. Yeah.

2005
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:38,120
And I really liked Joel Kinnaman and
I, you know, Richard came Morgan,

2006
01:57:38,121 --> 01:57:39,770
I interviewed who wrote
the book years ago,

2007
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:45,040
but that genre started to move me away
from techno utopianism and technology's

2008
01:57:46,461 --> 01:57:50,630
just going to solve so many problems
because it also is going to create new

2009
01:57:50,631 --> 01:57:55,160
problems that we don't even
yet know about. So as an
example, I went all the back,

2010
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:59,810
all the way back to the beginning when
humans went from hunter gatherers and

2011
01:57:59,811 --> 01:58:02,150
figured out we can domesticate some crops,

2012
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:05,810
we can start agriculture and
settle and be in one place.

2013
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:10,880
That was the acceleration of what
we know of as wealth ownership.

2014
01:58:10,881 --> 01:58:13,220
What it was like the start,
right. So much of what we had,

2015
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:17,990
I mean agriculture allowed people to
be able to live and do stuff other than

2016
01:58:17,991 --> 01:58:21,830
find food which developed
specialists who created technology,

2017
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:25,310
which created armies like it all
came from agriculture in that way,

2018
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:28,520
but tons of bad stuff came
from it as well. Right.

2019
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,240
The beginning of the concept of a
sedentary lifestyle came from agriculture

2020
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:37,610
diseases that we got from animals and
then that we brought other places and they

2021
01:58:37,611 --> 01:58:41,680
killed tons of people. So I've kind of
adopted that view to technology, which is,

2022
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:42,100
yeah,
all

2023
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:46,060
the cool stuff we can imagine and
improvements. I'm sure we'll be there,

2024
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:49,510
but problems we aren't even aware of
yet are also going to be there. Yeah,

2025
01:58:49,511 --> 01:58:53,800
I agree with you 100% that's what I meant
by looking back at this social media

2026
01:58:53,801 --> 01:58:57,490
problem. I think we're going to have a
far more invasive problem. I think the,

2027
01:58:57,820 --> 01:59:01,210
I think we're going to probably have
some sort of a wearable thing that allows

2028
01:59:01,211 --> 01:59:04,780
us to communicate through thoughts.
Sure. Well thoughts would be a next step,

2029
01:59:04,781 --> 01:59:08,020
but at minimum, I mean replacing, you
don't need the screen on your phone.

2030
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:11,530
You have contacts that are connected
to something and everything is just

2031
01:59:11,531 --> 01:59:13,780
displayed. I mean
there'll be steps, Jamie,

2032
01:59:13,781 --> 01:59:16,390
whatever happened with that Microsoft
thing that we were looking at.

2033
01:59:16,391 --> 01:59:18,970
Remember when they had like the little
mouse that was dancing in your hand or

2034
01:59:18,971 --> 01:59:20,470
the elephant that was
dancing in your hand?

2035
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:23,800
That is a micro segmented. Yes.
That wasn't available. It wasn't.

2036
01:59:23,801 --> 01:59:26,110
My Microsoft has hollow Lens
and they're on a Hololens to,

2037
01:59:26,111 --> 01:59:28,270
but they've moved more towards like a,
uh,

2038
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:33,300
commercial applications for it as
opposed to like consumer availability.

2039
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,060
There are consumer availability,
ar things coming out right now.

2040
01:59:37,580 --> 01:59:39,640
They're what apple just showed up there.

2041
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:44,290
A WWDC event this month or
actually on Monday is really cool.

2042
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:47,110
[inaudible] it's still just like
watching a, through that phone though.

2043
01:59:47,111 --> 01:59:47,620
They're not,

2044
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:52,620
I don't think anyone's made the device
like a glasses type ar thing yet because

2045
01:59:52,631 --> 01:59:57,400
the uh, field of view isn't right
to haven't mastered that either.

2046
01:59:58,090 --> 02:00:01,390
A projecting light into your eye,
which is what magic leap does,

2047
02:00:01,391 --> 02:00:03,430
are projecting onto the glass
that you're then looking at,

2048
02:00:03,431 --> 02:00:07,290
which is where I think hollow Lens and
the other thing does that sort of figured

2049
02:00:07,291 --> 02:00:10,990
it out yet. Beta Max versus VHS race
to see who figures things. So yeah,

2050
02:00:10,991 --> 02:00:12,370
but like the oculus quest,

2051
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:17,371
which is different just also just came
out is really cool and there's so close,

2052
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:18,420
so much closer.

2053
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:21,040
There could be within a year or two or
something good come out at the end of

2054
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:23,200
this year that hasn't been announced.
We're very close.

2055
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:26,620
Question is like how much is that
going to affect daily life, right.

2056
02:00:26,621 --> 02:00:29,560
With augmented reality.
Yeah.

2057
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:30,550
Yeah.

2058
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:35,550
The other one that relates to that also
is right now you at least can put your

2059
02:00:36,281 --> 02:00:37,114
phone away.

2060
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:43,530
That's what happens when the line between
the technology and the body is a bit

2061
02:00:43,571 --> 02:00:47,120
about it. Um, I'm very concerned.
I really am. I'm just a,

2062
02:00:47,210 --> 02:00:52,210
I think we're giving up
agency to something that has
no feelings for us at all.

2063
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:55,300
Well, there's no, I mean I think
the problems people have, uh,

2064
02:00:55,330 --> 02:00:58,330
in practice often are
different than the ones.

2065
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:02,230
I mean there's no transparency with a
lot of the companies that are developing

2066
02:01:02,231 --> 02:01:06,740
these technologies and setting up
the algorithms and whatever. Um,

2067
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:10,480
there's really no transparency
about what it is that's going on,

2068
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:14,650
what the end goals are, what the broader
effects on society are going to be. Um,

2069
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:17,470
I know you've had Jonathan Heit
on who was talked a lot about the

2070
02:01:17,471 --> 02:01:21,370
disproportionate effect of
social media on suicidality,

2071
02:01:21,371 --> 02:01:25,130
particularly in young
girls, relative to boys. Um,

2072
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:28,390
it's been years now that this stuff
has been around and we're now kind of

2073
02:01:28,391 --> 02:01:29,530
figuring that out.

2074
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:34,560
So it's inevitably we're behind always
and figuring out what the effects are

2075
02:01:34,751 --> 02:01:38,620
because you need time to measure it and
that as things advance more and more

2076
02:01:38,621 --> 02:01:40,520
quickly,
whatever damage

2077
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:42,650
is potentially going to be
done will happen even faster.

2078
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:44,530
Yes. Yeah. That's what the concern is,

2079
02:01:44,531 --> 02:01:49,210
that we are always behind and that it's
sneaking into our lives before we have

2080
02:01:49,211 --> 02:01:51,550
any idea of how dangerous it is.

2081
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:53,720
Sure. I mean, this happened
with, you know, the food,

2082
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:58,750
the canned and processed food revolution
of the fifties and sixties it was

2083
02:01:59,031 --> 02:01:59,864
slower,

2084
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:04,190
but it was the same type of thing where
all of these advancements and being able

2085
02:02:04,191 --> 02:02:07,760
to make food last longer via
how it was processed and stored.

2086
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:10,550
It all sounded awesome at a time
when food would just go bad.

2087
02:02:10,850 --> 02:02:14,570
Then we started learning about all
that things that come with it. Exactly.

2088
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:17,890
Yeah. Uh, anything more for rabbit up?

2089
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:21,080
I think that's it. Oh, I w so two
things I wanted to mention. One,

2090
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,450
when I announced that I was
going to be on the show,

2091
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:28,440
companies started contacting me saying,
we will give you money if you work hour,

2092
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:32,720
a name our product into the conversation.
What's the product?

2093
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:37,360
I'm not going to say, but I do want to
talk about car insurance briefly. Um,

2094
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:39,740
have you heard that that's
happened to other guests?

2095
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:44,580
No. You haven't? Interesting. That's
interesting. Yeah. Wow. That's a weird,

2096
02:02:44,581 --> 02:02:49,530
sneaky thing. Yeah. And no one's ever
paid me to do that. No one's paid you.

2097
02:02:49,590 --> 02:02:53,670
No, no, no one's ever paid
me to uh, to have an like a,

2098
02:02:53,671 --> 02:02:56,970
a conversation on a podcast. Oh. Um,

2099
02:02:57,030 --> 02:03:02,030
but one company did want to advertise
and they wanted their CEO to come on the

2100
02:03:03,991 --> 02:03:08,340
podcast and discuss their
product and I was like,

2101
02:03:08,341 --> 02:03:11,130
give me like an infomercial. I
was like, no. And they were like,

2102
02:03:11,131 --> 02:03:14,160
well you've talked about people before
that have had products before. I go, yeah.

2103
02:03:14,161 --> 02:03:17,870
Because I liked their product and I
think what they're doing is cool. Right.

2104
02:03:17,910 --> 02:03:21,470
I is zero financial investment
in their product. Right.

2105
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:23,370
Only did it because I like it.

2106
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:25,100
Sure. Well, I mean, peep,

2107
02:03:25,110 --> 02:03:30,090
my audience knows that we do sponsored
stuff like adding whatever I disclose it.

2108
02:03:30,091 --> 02:03:33,810
I'm clear and my approaches,
I'm super upfront with my audience,

2109
02:03:33,811 --> 02:03:37,380
which is listen me to only like half
a percent of you are paying for a

2110
02:03:37,381 --> 02:03:39,870
membership.
The memberships are six bucks a month.

2111
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:43,860
I know like 80% of you can afford it.
Only like half a percent are doing it.

2112
02:03:44,010 --> 02:03:46,020
That's fine.
I'm going to keep doing the show,

2113
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:49,470
but I'm going to put some sponsored
content up. You don't have to watch it.

2114
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:50,970
I'm in a market as such period.

2115
02:03:50,971 --> 02:03:53,860
And I feel like for the most part we have
kind of an understanding of how it all,

2116
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:57,600
there's nothing wrong with it as long
as this products that you actually enjoy

2117
02:03:57,630 --> 02:04:01,560
and again, that you maintain
that transparency and honesty.

2118
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:04,920
There's nothing wrong with that.
If I don't have that with the audience,

2119
02:04:04,921 --> 02:04:09,780
I don't have anything. Right. And, and I,
I've asked, been asked to compromise it.

2120
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:14,850
You hadn't? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. It's
just flick. It would be worth so much,

2121
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:15,800
you know?

2122
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:16,190
Yeah.

2123
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:19,790
I mean there's this moral hazard sort
of situation that exists with insurance

2124
02:04:19,791 --> 02:04:22,160
where the people who don't really need
the insurance are the ones that the

2125
02:04:22,161 --> 02:04:23,920
insurance companies want to insure.

2126
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:26,660
And the people that are more
likely to use the insurance,

2127
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:27,980
the insurance companies are like,

2128
02:04:27,981 --> 02:04:30,200
we're going to have to charge you
six times as much type of thing.

2129
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:35,620
It's easier to get the sponsorship money
from stuff that's less interesting or

2130
02:04:35,961 --> 02:04:38,190
less aligned or whatever.

2131
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:40,890
And I don't know. I mean,
it's an ongoing battle.

2132
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:43,020
I don't talk to any of our advertisers.

2133
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:47,190
Like we have a team that handles
all of that and that is great. Um,

2134
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:48,450
but they're,
you know,

2135
02:04:48,451 --> 02:04:51,330
there are still calls to make about
like what is on this side of the line,

2136
02:04:51,331 --> 02:04:54,780
what's on that side of the line. I
tried to make the right calls. No,

2137
02:04:54,781 --> 02:04:58,230
I think you're doing a great
job. I appreciate your show.
I appreciate your time.

2138
02:04:58,280 --> 02:05:00,900
Thanks for coming down here and tell
everybody where they can find you.

2139
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:05,280
D pacman on Pa k man on,

2140
