00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.008
Man 1: "We hold these
truths to be self-evident,

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.147
"that all men are created equal,

00:00:05.147 --> 00:00:06.813
"that they are endowed by their Creator

00:00:06.813 --> 00:00:09.607
"with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are

00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:12.480
"Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of Happiness."

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.337
It's this amazing second sentence

00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:17.072
of the Declaration of
Independence that Jefferson

00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:20.900
and Adams and Franklin
wrote as part of a committee

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.981
and we were looking at that sentence.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.896
Let's go on to look at that
phrase, "they are endowed

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:29.071
"by their Creator."

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.146
It's interesting, they don't
really mention Jesus Christ

00:00:33.146 --> 00:00:34.271
and not even God.

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:37.897
They talk about the laws of
nature and of nature's god

00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:39.145
and a creator.

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:43.003
These are deists, people
who believe in the notion

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.603
that there's some grand
creator of the universe,

00:00:45.603 --> 00:00:49.202
but they don't get into the
specifics of any particular

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:51.311
religious dogma.

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:54.545
The other thing is they're
balancing where do our rights

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:55.667
come from?

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.211
In an earlier draft, and
we'll talk about how they edit

00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:02.404
the earlier drafts in a later
video, but in an earlier draft

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:04.212
it just says they're endowed

00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:06.736
with certain unalienable
rights and you see

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:08.963
that John Adams, probably,
is the one who wants

00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:12.734
to insert the phrase "their
Creator" and that was

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.669
because they started the sentence

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:16.467
with "We hold these truths to be sacred,"

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:18.533
but they changed that to "self-evident."

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.796
They're trying to say to
what extent is it rationality

00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:23.932
that gives us these rights, to what extent

00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:26.932
are these rights endowed by God

00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:29.431
and I think what they
finally come down to is

00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:35.264
that we all had a creator
and that creator made us all.

00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:38.535
So, to a certain sync,
we're created equal.

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:41.850
Our creator must love us
all, we are all created

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.799
by the same creator, therefore
there's a certain equality

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.800
that we have and in
creating us, he gave us

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.599
certain unalienable rights.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.682
Man 2: Unalienable just
means can't be taken away.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.266
It can't be separated.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.932
Man 1: It can't be separated.

00:01:58.932 --> 00:02:00.850
You can't take these rights away.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.431
The king can't take these rights away.

00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:06.266
In other words, it's not
as if we could give up

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:09.849
these rights and in
particular, they are talking

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.535
about this theory of
government that John Locke had,

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:16.068
who was one of the
philosophers that they read,

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:18.538
an English philosopher of that period,

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.599
who said that when you created government

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.801
or there is a government, you give up some

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:23.766
of your rights.

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:25.597
For example, if we all
agree that we're part

00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:28.514
of a government, we may give up our right

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:33.847
to take somebody else's
property or whatever it may be.

00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:35.719
These are rights you can give up,

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.784
but there are certain
rights that are unalienable,

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:44.390
that you just can't give up or
the king can't take it away.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.519
Once again, you've got to
look at Thomas Jefferson,

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.765
who actually owned slaves at this point

00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:52.514
and he's saying among
those unalienable rights

00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:55.590
are life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.847
There's this inherent conflict
still, between rights,

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:03.014
such as liberty, that you
can't take away from a person

00:03:03.014 --> 00:03:05.597
and yet, Jefferson's writing this phrase

00:03:05.597 --> 00:03:08.618
when he owns slaves.

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:11.847
The phrase "Life, Liberty,
and the pursuit of Happiness"

00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:14.597
is also something that
derives from John Locke

00:03:14.597 --> 00:03:17.097
and these philosophers
of the Enlightenment

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:18.784
that were writing in England.

00:03:18.784 --> 00:03:22.184
At one point, John Locke uses
the phrase "Life, Liberty,

00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:26.852
"and the pursuit of property,"
because Locke believed

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:31.719
that owning property was
an important right you had

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:32.931
and the government couldn't just take

00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:35.346
your property away.

00:03:35.346 --> 00:03:37.785
However, you can see that they change it

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:42.847
to a more elevated phrase
(laughter) that we each get

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:45.847
to pursue our own notion
of what we want to do

00:03:45.847 --> 00:03:48.428
in our lives, our happiness.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:51.118
I don't think they just
mean happiness like joy

00:03:51.118 --> 00:03:52.430
and frivolity.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.186
I think they mean pursuit
of meaning in life,

00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:56.784
what gives our life meaning

00:03:56.784 --> 00:04:00.719
and these are the unalienable rights.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.775
Then they go on and this gets

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.792
to what's called the contract
notion of government,

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:09.025
is that why do we have governments?

00:04:09.025 --> 00:04:11.691
Whether it's John Locke
or the other philosophers

00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:14.282
we've talked about, they say the reason

00:04:14.282 --> 00:04:18.538
we have government is that
we all had these rights,

00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:21.616
but we decided to get together.

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:23.924
We instituted governments.

00:04:23.924 --> 00:04:27.124
Governments are instituted and the reason

00:04:27.124 --> 00:04:29.701
those governments have
their power is because

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:31.656
of the consent of the governed.

00:04:31.656 --> 00:04:34.616
It's like if you and I
and 20 people got together

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:38.283
and formed a group and we
said, "We're going to form

00:04:38.283 --> 00:04:40.533
"a group, we'll give
up some of our rights,

00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:43.457
"because the group itself
will have certain powers,

00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:45.392
"but we're consenting to do that."

00:04:45.392 --> 00:04:47.993
It's not because of the
divine right of kings.

00:04:47.993 --> 00:04:50.458
It's the consent of the governed.

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:53.616
The consent of the people
says we will institute

00:04:53.616 --> 00:04:56.389
a government amongst ourselves

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.125
and that's not to take away our rights,

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:01.391
that's to secure our rights.

00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:02.057
Man 2: Right.

00:05:02.057 --> 00:05:02.950
I might ...

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.865
The 20 of us might give up
our right to enforce things,

00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:11.116
police each other, to the government,

00:05:11.116 --> 00:05:12.923
so that we could have our life, liberty,

00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:13.723
and pursuit of happiness.

00:05:13.723 --> 00:05:15.723
We're more likely to have it secured.

00:05:15.723 --> 00:05:18.700
Man 1: Once you get to that
theory, you have to say,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.965
"What are the type of
rights we would give up?"

00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:24.594
Such as, maybe, the right
to decide the traffic laws

00:05:24.594 --> 00:05:28.058
or the policing of the thing,
or how property contracts

00:05:28.058 --> 00:05:30.206
are made, but there are
certain things that,

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:33.057
no matter what you did,
if you were instituting

00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:35.994
a government among men,
you would not give up

00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:38.873
the right to life, you
would not give up the right

00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:41.790
to liberty, and you would not
say, "I'm going to give up

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.788
"my right to pursue my own life ends,

00:05:45.788 --> 00:05:47.123
"my own happiness."

00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:49.871
You would say, "We want
to secure those rights.

00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:53.023
"We're not going to give
those up to government."
