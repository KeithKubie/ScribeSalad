00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Often we find in reality that the margin of error is wrong.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Which of these reasons could make us understate the true margin of error?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If the poll is taken before the election at a different time, does that change the margin of error?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If some voters are under-represented in our sample, could that increase error?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Similarly, if some in our sample are less likely to vote than others, does that affect our error?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, assume that we haven't somehow perfectly matched up the frequency of voting

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and their relative representation in sample.

00:00:44.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And if the responses differ from what someone intends to actually do, could that cause more error?
