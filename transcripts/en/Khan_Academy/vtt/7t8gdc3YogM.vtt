00:00:00.398 --> 00:00:01.677
Voiceover: What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.677 --> 00:00:03.782
is think about a fairly
traditional business.

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:06.316
I am going into the orange juice business.

00:00:06.316 --> 00:00:07.276
Right over here,

00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:09.536
I've written the gallons of orange juice

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:11.776
I am going to produce each week,

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:14.276
so all of this is going
to be in a per week basis.

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:15.413
This is my fixed cost,

00:00:15.413 --> 00:00:17.743
so I'm assuming this is
going to cost me $1,000,

00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:19.006
and let's say that that's the rent

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.693
for this super robotic orange juicer

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:23.442
that I bought that can really,

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.873
and through that for
the sake of simplicity,

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:26.971
we're assuming that we can put

00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.366
as much orange juice as we want,

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.681
or at least any of the amounts

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:31.469
that I've listed right over here,

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.395
and it also takes into the cost

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:35.413
of maybe some employees

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:36.609
who are spending some of their time

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.393
operating this super orange juice mixer.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:41.379
I'm assuming all of those are fixed cost,

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.944
and I can't get out of
them or buy them overnight,

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:44.940
that I've decided,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.752
I've plunked down the
cost for the machine,

00:00:46.752 --> 00:00:48.858
and I've given these employees,

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:50.001
let's say I've given them already

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.399
a one-year contract.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.457
These are going to be fixed,

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:54.085
at least for the next year.

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:55.404
Now, my variable costs, here,

00:00:55.404 --> 00:00:56.655
these are going to be given

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:58.826
the amount of juice I want to produce.

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:00.801
This is going to be the
cost of the oranges,

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.454
and I guess we can also say the cost of

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:04.198
transporting the oranges,

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:05.467
and so we see here,

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:06.814
obviously if we produce no oranges,

00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:08.596
we have no variable cost.

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:10.614
If we produce 1,000 oranges,

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:12.190
then our cost of the oranges

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.991
and transporting them is $500.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.221
If we produce 2,000, it's 850,

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:18.663
and something interesting happened.

00:01:18.663 --> 00:01:21.847
Our incremental variable
cost right over here

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:24.183
was only $350.

00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:26.408
The first 1,000 oranges was 500,

00:01:26.408 --> 00:01:27.660
and then the next 1,000,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.651
it was only 350.

00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:30.866
So what's happening here is

00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.396
I've probably got some economies ...

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:34.891
I've probably got some
negotiating power now

00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:36.864
with some of these suppliers.

00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:39.864
I'm like, "Look, I'm buying
a lot more oranges now.

00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:41.650
"Let me negotiate the price down,"

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.157
and also maybe with some of the people

00:01:43.157 --> 00:01:44.596
who are doing my shipping,

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:45.489
my transportation.

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:46.874
"Look, I'm shipping a lot.

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:49.356
"Now, why don't you
give me a better deal?"

00:01:49.356 --> 00:01:51.262
We see the deal got even better.

00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:54.543
The incremental from
this to this is only 250.

00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:56.998
Then it starts getting
more expensive again.

00:01:56.998 --> 00:01:58.340
What's probably happening is,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.645
as I start buying more and more oranges

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:01.764
from the local distributors,

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:03.193
I get a better, better deal.

00:02:03.193 --> 00:02:05.293
They view me as a bigger
and bigger customer,

00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:07.192
but once I tap them out,

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:08.858
then I have to go
further and further away.

00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:10.945
Maybe it's costing more to transport them,

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:12.551
or maybe these other suppliers

00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:13.688
don't take me as seriously

00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:16.032
or I go to slightly
more expensive suppliers

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:18.858
because I've tapped out
all of the cheap ones,

00:02:18.858 --> 00:02:21.064
and so my incremental variable costs

00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:23.287
for the next 1,000, and
we'll think about that later,

00:02:23.287 --> 00:02:25.293
keeps going up and up and up.

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:26.537
The total costs, obviously,

00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:28.465
are just the sum of my fixed costs

00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:29.661
and my variable costs.

00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:30.859
So, if I want to produce

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.385
9,000 gallons of orange juice,

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:36.851
it's going to cost me $4,360.

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:38.501
Let's calculate using,

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.235
and I'm just using Excel, here.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.594
Let's calculate the average fixed cost,

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:45.705
so we don't want to divide by zero.

00:02:45.705 --> 00:02:47.115
Remember, the average cost,

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.199
the average fixed and the average variable

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.566
and the average total cost,

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.266
these are each of those costs divided by

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:55.956
the total amount of
juice that I'm producing.

00:02:55.956 --> 00:02:58.854
You can kind of view them
as the cost per gallon.

00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:00.017
So that we're thinking of

00:03:00.017 --> 00:03:01.911
the average fixed cost per gallon,

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:02.745
so what we're going to do,

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.599
so I'm writing equal to let Excel know

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.270
that I'm doing a formula now,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.845
this is going to be equal to my fixed cost

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:12.793
divided by, so divided by,

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:15.579
divided by my gallons,

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.752
and you can see that's G8 divided by F8,

00:03:17.752 --> 00:03:19.665
and actually, I guess you
can't see my Gs and Fs,

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:21.104
but this is the 8th row.

00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:23.323
That's that right over there,

00:03:23.323 --> 00:03:24.966
so that is $1.

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:27.223
If I want my average variable costs,

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:30.097
that's going to be my variable costs

00:03:30.097 --> 00:03:31.478
divided by,

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:35.105
divided by my total number of gallons,

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:36.334
so that's 50 cents,

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:39.068
so that's the first 1,000 gallons

00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:40.360
to produce the orange juice,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.088
the orange juice for ...

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:43.045
to produce a gallon,

00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:45.544
it costs me about 50
cents worth of oranges.

00:03:45.544 --> 00:03:47.886
That includes the transportation cost.

00:03:47.886 --> 00:03:50.829
Then the total is just the
sum of these two things.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.230
Or, we could have done it another way.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.825
We could have taken this right ...

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:56.552
We could have said that
this is just equal to,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.422
this is just equal to our total cost,

00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:04.332
our total cost divided by
the total number of gallons.

00:04:04.332 --> 00:04:05.334
Either way, you'll get the same thing,

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:07.533
and maybe I'll do a video mathematically

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:08.129
on why that is,

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.506
or maybe you should explore that yourself.

00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:12.642
Now, the marginal cost.

00:04:12.642 --> 00:04:16.311
This is equal to our change in cost,

00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:17.771
our change in total cost

00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:21.182
divided by our change in gallons of juice.

00:04:21.182 --> 00:04:23.220
Our change in total costs

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.291
is going to be 1,500 minus 1,000.

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.403
That's our change in total cost

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:32.026
divided by our change in gallons,

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:35.753
divided by 1,000 minus 0,

00:04:35.753 --> 00:04:37.491
our change in gallons,

00:04:37.491 --> 00:04:39.336
and that give us 50 cents.

00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:41.466
Now, this is the fun
thing about spreadsheets,

00:04:41.466 --> 00:04:43.662
one of the many fun
things of spreadsheets,

00:04:43.662 --> 00:04:45.605
is now I can select all of these

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:48.659
and fill in all of the things below it.

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.298
They will use the same
relative calculations.

00:04:52.298 --> 00:04:53.196
Let me just ...

00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:55.110
I'm going to fill without formatting.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.857
Now, what was neat here,

00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:57.544
and I already set up
this chart ahead of time,

00:04:57.544 --> 00:05:00.541
is to plot these things right over here,

00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:02.138
and so we see what's going on.

00:05:02.138 --> 00:05:04.065
This is a plot that we
looked at in the last video,

00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:06.797
when we thought about software developers.

00:05:06.797 --> 00:05:08.480
This was our fixed cost,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.824
our variable costs go up

00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:11.188
as we produce more and more.

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:13.358
Our total cost is just a sum of the two,

00:05:13.358 --> 00:05:15.005
so you just take your variable costs,

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:17.640
and you add the $1,000
from the fixed costs,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.123
and you get this curve right over here.

00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:20.891
What we've done here

00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:22.345
is we've plotted all of this stuff.

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:23.806
The average fixed costs,

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:25.092
or actually the marginal costs,

00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:26.084
the average variable costs

00:05:26.084 --> 00:05:27.250
and the average total costs.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.996
I haven't plotted the
average fixed cost here,

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:30.801
but it's really just
the difference between

00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:33.603
the total and the variable costs.

00:05:33.603 --> 00:05:36.095
Now, let's think about what's happening.

00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:37.688
First, let's look at the average,

00:05:37.688 --> 00:05:38.888
the marginal.

00:05:38.888 --> 00:05:40.435
Actually, let's look at
the marginal costs first,

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:41.341
because this is interesting,

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.487
and this kind of goes in with
this narrative of at first,

00:05:44.487 --> 00:05:46.542
those first oranges that we bought

00:05:46.542 --> 00:05:47.289
were expensive.

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.924
We weren't a major producer,

00:05:48.924 --> 00:05:49.793
but incrementally,

00:05:49.793 --> 00:05:53.009
incrementally, as we
produce those next oranges,

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.298
so as we go from 1,000 oranges,

00:05:55.298 --> 00:05:58.568
as we go from the oranges
needed for 1,000 gallons

00:05:58.568 --> 00:06:00.896
to the oranges needed for 2,000 gallons,

00:06:00.896 --> 00:06:03.222
all of a sudden, our
marginal cost went down.

00:06:03.222 --> 00:06:04.706
We're now a bigger buyer.

00:06:04.706 --> 00:06:06.756
We can now, those incremental oranges

00:06:06.756 --> 00:06:08.160
are now cheaper to us.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.420
As we get even more,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.365
as we go to 3,000
gallons worth of oranges,

00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:14.523
those incremental oranges
get even cheaper for us.

00:06:14.523 --> 00:06:15.991
Then we have to go and buy oranges

00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:17.236
from the outside,

00:06:17.236 --> 00:06:19.868
so those incremental
oranges get more and more

00:06:19.868 --> 00:06:22.074
and more and more expensive.

00:06:22.074 --> 00:06:24.067
That's most clear in
this marginal cost curve,

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:25.835
and it's somewhat clear in the average,

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:28.081
the average variable cost.

00:06:28.081 --> 00:06:29.604
In the average variable cost,

00:06:29.604 --> 00:06:31.366
it gets muffled to a certain degree,

00:06:31.366 --> 00:06:33.165
because remember the average variable cost

00:06:33.165 --> 00:06:34.191
at any one of these points,

00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:36.674
and we calculated it
already several times.

00:06:36.674 --> 00:06:38.504
The average variable cost
at any of these points

00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:39.773
is equal to,

00:06:40.496 --> 00:06:43.045
is equal to your variable costs divided by

00:06:43.045 --> 00:06:44.460
the gallons of juice.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.806
So another way to think about it,

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:47.187
referring to the last video,

00:06:47.494 --> 00:06:48.898
if you're taking any one of these points,

00:06:48.898 --> 00:06:50.736
your average variable cost

00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:53.601
is the slope between that
point and the origin,

00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:55.715
while the marginal cost is the slope

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:58.137
between that point and the previous point,

00:06:58.137 --> 00:06:59.889
so the marginal cost is really showing

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:02.231
how much are those next
incremental oranges

00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:02.873
costing you,

00:07:02.873 --> 00:07:05.001
not just how much are all of the oranges

00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:06.744
on average costing you.

00:07:06.744 --> 00:07:09.027
That's why the marginal
cost curve captures,

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:10.401
captures how much those

00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:13.732
that very next set of 1,000
gallons worth of oranges,

00:07:13.732 --> 00:07:15.854
how much that is costing you.

00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:17.888
Obviously, your average total cost,

00:07:17.888 --> 00:07:19.555
at first you have your fixed cost,

00:07:19.555 --> 00:07:21.343
aren't being spread out too much,

00:07:21.343 --> 00:07:23.883
but then as you get more and more

00:07:23.883 --> 00:07:25.341
gallons of orange juice produced,

00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:27.110
your fixed cost gets spread out

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.343
more and more and more,

00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:30.008
and so you actually have this gap,

00:07:30.008 --> 00:07:32.262
this gap between the green curve

00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:33.243
and the orange curve,

00:07:33.243 --> 00:07:34.599
which is really just
your average fixed cost.

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:38.760
That becomes lower and lower and lower.
