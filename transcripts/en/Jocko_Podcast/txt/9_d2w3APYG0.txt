Speaker 1:          00:00          There are no bad teams, only bad leaders. Do you think there are exceptions to this? If so, how do you know you're apart of the exception? That is a quote from the book, extreme ownership written by myself on my brother Leif Babin. And it is a quote that I don't want to say we stole, but we stole. We appropriated from David Hackworth who said there's no bad, I think you said no bad officers, no bad unit's only bad officers. And Napoleon who said there is no bad regimens, only bad kernels. And we said there's no bad teams, only bad leaders. And the question is, is there an exception to this? And how do you know if you're part of the exception? Well, actually there is, there's a big exception to this and the exception is that there are bad leaders with good teams. That is true. That can happen.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Sometimes you get a bad leader that is running a really, really good team. So that's an exception. I guess it's an exception to this rule. Maybe that's the way I took it. Uh, so you get a team that's so good that they just continue to perform. Even though they have a horrible leader, they perform despite their bad leader. Gotcha. Now what this doesn't, this does not prove, you know, I always say leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. This doesn't disprove that statement. You'd think maybe it does because oh well you've got a bad leader and you've got a good team. Then maybe leadership hasn't been important. That's wrong. Actually what it proves is that leadership can come from any level inside the organization. That's what improves. And it proves that because I've seen that over and over again. And when I was running the training for the seal platoons, eventually I didn't care where the leadership in the platoon was because I realized that it was a real, it was a real hard thing to hope for that you had the person that was in the leadership positions like the platoon commander or the platoon chief to to assume or to figure that they were going to be the leader that you wanted them to be, was a big assumption to make.

Speaker 1:          02:16          And so what I realized after training for awhile, it was like even though I wanted the leaders to be those senior guys who were supposed to be taking leadership, eventually I realized as I didn't care where that leadership came from, as long as there was a couple of good leaders, you would end up with a good seal platoon and a platoon would be on track. Now maybe the question is what this person is hinting at the exception being, is there an exception that if there is a bad team, maybe that team is just so filled with bad people that they can't get the job done. That's the kind of accepting you talk about or failing because the team is so bad. Even though the leader's good, even though the leaders good, but the team is so bad that that's an exception to the, oh well guess what?

Speaker 1:          03:03          Who's responsible for the people on the team? Who's responsible for training the people on the team so that they can get good at their job and they can perform with excellence or who's in charge of getting rid of the people that are sub par so that the team steps up their performance. Well, by answered all those questions is the leader. So if you're on a bad team and you're leading the team, it's your fault. And there's no exceptions to that. Yeah, zero. Yeah, I'm over here trying to think of the exception, but just what you said is like, Eh, kind of, yeah. Kind of mitigates any, hey, this, this, let's take a real, a real simple example of like a sports team, right? Oh, this sports team got dealt a bad hand and now the people on the team, well, what are you gonna do?

Speaker 1:          03:50          You're going to train those people who's responsible? I'm not saying you're going to press start performing right now, but you can get on the trajectory will, you'll be good eventually. Now if you just blame, hey, I got a bad team. Well guess what? Then you don't put an effort. Guess what? You're going to continue to be a loser. The exception. Yeah, but my team, my team is just so bad. You can't train your people. I'm not saying you're a miracle worker. I'm not saying you can. You can take people that don't have any skills and instantly through your leadership turned them into incredible performers. No, that's not going to happen. But guess what? As a leader, you go out and you bring people into your team that are good. Go. You do train the people that you do have up to the best of their abilities and the people that can't perform the way they need to perform. You get rid of them. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:35          Yeah. That's it. No real exceptions other than, yeah, you can have a good team with bad leaders. Yeah. If only because there's a good leader somewhere in there. You know, the exceptions thing, I think it's healthy, in my opinion. None didn't go through this. And most other things where if, if I or we start thinking that we're the exception, so we don't have to put in like, I don't know, like the work or whatever, and not necessarily work with the, you know, how like, okay, we'll take this on. No bad teams don't leave badly. Leaders. Ah, you know, if I say I might be the exception to this cause my team is so bad, it's Kinda like, yeah, aren't you kind of do a little cop out there kind of thing. 100%

Speaker 1:          05:15          our bottom line is if you don't take ownership of what's going on, then you're not going to perform well. If you just blame your genetics, then that means, okay, well then I'm not going to get in any kind of shape whatsoever. Then guess what? Guess what kind of shape you're being junk, substandard, substandard.
