00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.429
I'm sure many of you have had this
experience it's late at night and you

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.690
start browsing Netflix looking for
something to watch you scroll through

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.240
different titles you even read a few
reviews but you just can't commit to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.400
watching any given movie suddenly it's
been 30 minutes and you're still stuck

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.429
in infinite browsing mode so you just
give up you're too tired to watch

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.960
anything now so you cut your losses and
fall asleep I've come to believe that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.850
this is the defining characteristic of
our generation let's call it keeping our

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.559
options open there's this philosopher
Zygmunt Bauman he calls it liquid

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.829
modernity we never want to commit to any
one identity or place or community so we

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.060
remain like liquid in a state that can
adapt to fit any future shape liquid

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.720
modernity is infinite browsing mode but
for everything in our lives I've been

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.369
thinking about this recently because
leaving home and coming here is a lot

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.130
like entering a long hallway you walk
out of the room in which you grew up and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.470
into this place with thousands of
different doors to infinitely browse and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.250
throughout my time here I've I've seen
all the good that can come from having

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.740
so many new options I've seen the joy a
person feels when they find a room more

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.509
fitting for their authentic self I've
seen big decisions become less painful

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.070
because you can always quit you can
always move you can always break up in

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.590
the hallway will always be there and
mostly I've seen all the fun folks have

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.119
had experiencing more novelty than any
generation in history ever experienced

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:07.170
but as I've grown older here I've also
started seeing the downsides of having

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.900
so many open doors nobody wants to be
stuck behind a locked door but nobody

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.470
wants to live
in a hallway either it's great to have

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.850
options when you lose interest in
something but I've learned here that the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.730
more times I do this the less satisfied
I am with any given option and lately

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.960
the experiences I crave are less the
rushes of novelty and more those perfect

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.850
Tuesday nights when you eat dinner with
the friends who you have known for a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.730
long time who you've made a commitment
to and who won't quit you because they

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.200
found someone better I've discovered in
my time here that the people who inspire

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.880
me the most are those who have left the
hallway shut the door behind them and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.440
settled in I think of Fred Rogers
recording episode 895 of Mister Rogers

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.420
neighborhood because he was committed to
advancing a humane model of moral

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.390
education I think of Dorothy Day sitting
with the same outcast folks night after

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.770
night after night because it was
important that someone is committed to

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.080
them I think of Martin Luther King but
not just the Martin Luther King who

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.530
confronted the fire hoses in 1963 but
the Martin Luther King who hosted his

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:40.170
thousandth tedious planning meeting in
1967 when Hollywood tells tales of

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.420
courage they usually take the form of
slaying the dragon it's all about the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.320
big brave moments but I've been learning
from these heroes that the most menacing

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.630
dragons that stand in the way of
reforming the system or repairing the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.840
breach or the everyday boredom and
distraction and uncertainty that can

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.110
erode our ability to commit to anything
for the long haul it's why I love that

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.820
the word dedicate has two meanings first
it means to make something holy second

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.590
it means to stick at something for a
long time I don't think this is a

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.930
coincidence we do something holy when we
choose to commit

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.750
to something and in the most dedicated
people I have met I have witnessed how

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:42.199
that pursuit of holiness comes with a
side effect of immense joy we may have

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.960
come here to help keep our options open
but I leave believing that the most

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.500
radical act we can take is to make a
commitment to a particular thing to a

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:04.910
place to a profession to a cause to a
community to a person to show our love

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.810
for something by working at it for a
long time and to close doors and forgo

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:21.320
options for its sake we often assume
that some acute and looming threat be it

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.979
a foreign invader or a domestic
demagogue will be our downfall but if we

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.740
were to end that end is just as likely
to come from something far less dramatic

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.900
our failure to sustain the work it is
not only the bomb or the bully that

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.710
should keep us up at night it is also
the garden untilled and the newcomer

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:57.220
unwelcomed the neighbor unhoused and the
prisoner unheard the voice of the public

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:05.110
unheeded and the long simmering calamity
unhaulted and the dream of equal justice

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.110
unrealized

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:22.010
but we need not be afraid for we have in
our possession

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:31.370
the antidote to our dread our time free
to be dedicated to the slow but

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:38.830
necessary work of turning visions into
projects values into practices and

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:49.460
strangers into neighbors that is why in
this age of liquid modernity we should

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:57.400
rebel and join up with a counterculture
of commitment consisting of solid people

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.340
that is why in this age of infinite
browsing mode we should pick a damn

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.590
movie and see it all the way through

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.920
before we fall asleep let's get to work

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.440
