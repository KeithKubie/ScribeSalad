00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.270
- Good morning, I hope you're, oh,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.060
it's a wet morning, it
just rained all night long.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.040
Ah, but good morning, it's Mark Wiens,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.160
I'm in Trat, Thailand and this is day five

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.200
of our eastern provinces of Thailand

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.390
food and travel tour.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.967
Today we are gonna be in Trat, the town,

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:21.730
we're gonna be exploring the food and so

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.410
we're gonna go on a food
tour and I'm gonna share

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.773
all the food with you today.

00:00:24.773 --> 00:00:28.273
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.660
This is a great market, you'll find.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.610
It's a really friendly
market, you'll find some very

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.090
unique ingredients that are
specific to this region,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.923
to Trat.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.160
There's lots of seafood,
there're some giant fish,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.190
people are very friendly here.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.779
It's not that busy, it
has a calm feel to it

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:53.862
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.090
- To be honest, the morning
market is a great place

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.360
to walk around and to get a feel for Trat

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.780
and the ingredients that are available.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.380
But there's really not
much going on in terms

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.870
of pre-cooked food to eat.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.530
So we've decided to go check out,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.920
it's just down the road, a
place that's known for its

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.280
noodles and rice with
a variety of seafood.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.530
The restaurant is located
just behind the market

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.370
but you now are starting
to get into the charming,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.810
old wooden houses, the
heritage area of Trat.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:32.828
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.820
- It's a classic, old-school
legendary restaurant

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.890
in Trat, and they have
both all sorts of different

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.380
types of noodles that you can order

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.970
as well as different toppings
on rice but specifically

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.416
seafood, especially crab and especially

00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:49.249
(speaking in foreign language),

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.860
which is mantis prawns,
and so since I've already

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.750
actually in Chanthaburi,
I had a couple bowls

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.210
of mantis prawns with
noodles, I decided to try

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.630
a couple rice dishes here.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.800
This is one of those
restaurants in Thailand that

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.410
is not only a restaurant,
but it's a museum

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.030
so if you&amp; look around there
are photos of famous people

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.510
along the walls, it's completely
decked out in decoration.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.100
And I ordered a couple of
different unique dishes.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.439
The first dish that we have
to begin with is called

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.180
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.370
And these are crab eggs,
so female crab eggs

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.150
stir-fried with chilies
and I think, garlic.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.230
And there's some fish sauce
and chilies on the side,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.530
but just look, look at that.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.303
That looks potently delicious.

00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:42.080
Mmm-hmm.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.970
The crab eggs are like yolk, egg yolk,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.563
but more, more starchy, more condensed.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.610
That's definitely a unique
dish, and very tasty.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.750
Another dish that I'm very
looking forward to trying.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.424
This one is (speaking in
foreign language), with

00:03:00.424 --> 00:03:01.257
(speaking in foreign language) and

00:03:01.257 --> 00:03:02.090
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.200
is stir-fried holy basil.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.930
You can get your choice of meat.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.840
This one, though, is with mantis prawn,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.860
so you can see these are mantis prawns.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.870
She added in garlic, she
added in some onions,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.220
she added in banana peppers.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.610
I've had (speaking in foreign language)

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.490
in almost every variation,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.163
but this will be a first
for me with mantis prawns.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.520
You've got those mantis prawns.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.690
They're like crayfish,
they're similar to shrimp.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.800
Then you've got that holy basil,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.230
you've got the chilies in there.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.510
Mmm, that salty, balance
of sweetness, and then just

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.573
that shrimpiness.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.810
All right, that was pretty decently good.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.170
Definitely some unique

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.940
versions of (speaking in foreign language)

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.350
but they also have a full noodle selection

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.240
with a mix of seafood that's worth a stop.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.490
It's a pretty legendary
place to eat in Trat.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.100
Now if you ask any local in Trat

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.710
which is one of the best places to eat

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.640
many will recommend this one
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.440
restaurant which is rice
and curry, which is located

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.113
at a gas station, a petrol station.

00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:20.178
(upbeat techno music)

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.710
This is the spot, it's located
behind the Shell gas station.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.091
I didn't know this ever but
it's Khao Gaeng San Toong,

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:42.820
and San Toong is a small
town that we passed through

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.910
driving from Chanthaburi to Trat.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.823
It's in Trat, but they're
known for their food.

00:04:48.818 --> 00:04:52.180
It's like one of those
cities that everybody knows

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.858
has spicy curries.

00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:57.941
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.983
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:04:59.983 --> 00:05:00.816
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:04.899
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.100
- This is one of those
restaurants where it's

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.110
way too easy to get way
too excited and just

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.110
start pointing and choosing
and before you know it

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.450
you have a table full of food.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.160
The portion sizes aren't huge,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.970
so we can definitely handle this.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.820
Wow, the food looks insanely delicious.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.956
This is the type of food,

00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:30.320
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.780
which in Thai means rice and curry.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.720
You'll find it all over
Thailand, it's one of

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.180
my favorite styles of eating.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.030
They have all the dishes prepared.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.940
Usually a bunch of different
curries, but all sorts of

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.200
variety of different dishes.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.612
This one is some type of
bird, um, she called it

00:05:43.612 --> 00:05:44.700
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.890
or something like that, and
I think this is the bird one.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.270
Yeah, you can see those
chili seeds in there.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.520
Oh, that looks masterful.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.560
Oh, what a dish!

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.720
Yeah, uh, that one has a
little bit of heat to it.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.930
It's some type of bird that
you can eat all the bones,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.070
so you can crunch right through the bones,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.700
I mean, they do have
quite a crunch to them

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.730
and you better chew them well,

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.860
but you can eat all of the bones.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.470
It's almost like, the meat
is almost like duck-tasting.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.460
This one is (speaking in foreign language)

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.990
which is a sour curry, which
is made all over Thailand

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.990
but very different in
many different places.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.680
This, there's fish in here,
and lots of pineapple.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.330
It almost looks like a tomato
sauce but that's chili.

00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:31.470
Mmm.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.590
Some of the dishes can be
on the sweet side, in Trat,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.860
generally speaking, but
what I love is sweet dishes.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.960
Well, sweet and spicy dishes
that are sweetened with fruit,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.793
like pineapple.

00:06:42.793 --> 00:06:47.240
That gives it a, I mean that
fruity sweetness, the pineapple

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.170
comes in here so nicely, but
it's salty at the same time.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.930
There's chilies in there
so it's a little spicy.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.030
Moving right down the line,
I think this one is the

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.863
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:54.863 --> 00:06:57.710
which is a jungle pig, a wild boar,

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.410
fried with a similar curry
paste, all the seeds in there,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.593
the Kaffir lime leaves.

00:07:05.712 --> 00:07:07.077
Mmm-mmm.

00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:10.330
Mmm.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.600
Oh, what I can taste
that's different in that

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.603
is the black pepper.

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:16.660
Oh, there's a lot of black
pepper going on in there.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.840
I just went up to the
front, I asked them what

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.085
the dishes are stir-fried.

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:24.630
They're all included with
the, most of the curry dishes,

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.113
and they said they're all

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.350
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.170
which is the pineapple
crown, very common ingredient

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.290
that you will find throughout Trat.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.770
It always goes with spicy curries,

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.240
and it goes so well
because it has this amazing

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.220
crunch that's similar to bamboo shoots.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.960
But at the same time it has a little more

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.310
of an acidic flavor.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.470
What an ingredient.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.620
And that brings us
directly to our next dish,

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.394
which this is probably
my favorite dish of Trat.

00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:52.227
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:52.227 --> 00:07:53.672
Which is a deer curry, again with

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:55.070
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.310
the pineapple shoots.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.880
When you have that many
chili seeds per bite,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.867
plus the pineapple crown, plus deer,

00:08:01.867 --> 00:08:04.500
there's just no way it
cannot be a flavor explosion

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.333
in your mouth.

00:08:13.939 --> 00:08:14.772
Whoa.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.000
What a dish.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.833
What a dish.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.830
Oh, that's ultimate.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.760
That's so unbelievably good.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.330
It's spicy, it's balanced
in flavor, there's a little

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.230
bit of citrusy acidicness
in there, and that meat

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.063
is very, very tender.

00:08:30.063 --> 00:08:33.260
That deer is, it's tender.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.923
It's delicious, it's
absolutely sensational.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.371
The final dish is the

00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:42.290
(speaking foreign language)
and (speaking foreign language)

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:43.123
are the leaves.

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:46.063
This is a very popular dish
in this region of Thailand.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.660
It's always a very sweet dish,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.360
usually a little too sweet for me.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.110
It's good, but it does have that real

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.130
sweet-and-sour flavor to it.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.440
The pork is tender.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.920
I do love the leaves, though.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.290
It's like one of those
leaves that remains,

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.920
that holds its shape and remains crunchy

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.650
even if you cook it for a long time.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.420
But yeah, for me it just
doesn't quite compare

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.900
to all the spicier curries.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.190
Everything is good,
but definitely the deer

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.100
and the bird, those are
my two favorite dishes.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.773
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna double
back for some of that bird.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.860
That's awesome.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.310
And that crunch of the bones.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:38.446
(upbeat techno music)

00:09:42.607 --> 00:09:44.899
(sighs)

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:47.610
Oh, that was just one of
those utterly satisfying

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.640
meals in Thailand.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.540
This is a gas station that
you're gonna wanna come to,

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.700
not to fill up your car,
but to fill up your stomach

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.790
and it, you're gonna experience
ultimate satisfaction.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.010
That was so good, my
mouth is still tingling

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.800
from all those flavors and those chilies.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.280
From here, we're gonna walk
around and just explore

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.200
a little bit of the downtown,
old town area of Trat.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.470
And then later on this
evening for dinner we have

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.611
a big seafood feast coming up.

00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:17.778
(upbeat techno music)

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.010
After that much good food,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.370
I need to walk around a little bit.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.450
I made it to Wat Phai Lom,
and this is the central

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.490
Buddhist temple of Trat town.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.730
And you enter, there's quite a lot

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.463
of roosters running around.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.025
It is quite a unique stupa structure

00:10:38.025 --> 00:10:41.850
unlike anything I've seen in Thailand.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.482
But I think the real beauty, I think

00:10:43.482 --> 00:10:45.560
it's actually closed
right now, I can't get in,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.266
but the real beauty around
here are the gardens.

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:50.630
If you're quiet you can
hear the birds chirping,

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.880
all sorts of different
birds, there are flowers.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.651
Gotta move on to the
Trat history museum now.

00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:58.520
(rooster crowing)

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.240
For sure, one of the
architectural masterpieces

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.390
and buildings of preservation is the Trat

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.490
history museum, and it's
housed in the old city hall.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.693
It's a beautifully
restored wooden building.

00:11:13.952 --> 00:11:14.785
Trat.

00:11:14.785 --> 00:11:17.370
Half a hundred islands, precious rubies,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.860
sweet zalaccas, high quality
ridgeback dogs, Koh Chang

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.053
naval battle, it's the very
eastern side of Thailand.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.440
I was the only one at the museum,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.850
and it's really nicely done, actually.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.610
Really nice and quiet,
it walks you through

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.374
the history of Trat all the
way from the natural resources

00:11:42.374 --> 00:11:45.480
to when the Chinese came and
when it was an important,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.090
very important seaport and trade center.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.760
And the building itself is a highlight.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.340
It's worth checking out on its own.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.780
Everything is located
pretty close within Trat,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.460
but just down the road from the museum

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.650
is the (speaking foreign
language) community,

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.380
which is one of the old
canal-side communities.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.290
I'm just gonna take a
little stroll through here

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.430
and see what we can find.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.880
There are old houses, they're,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.450
now they're lots of guest houses.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.620
There're some cafes.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.728
It's pretty, pretty peaceful area.

00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:17.895
(upbeat techno music)

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.050
And within the community,
one of the things

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.223
I wanted to check out is
this walkway along the canal.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.130
It's pretty cool, you can
walk along the waterway

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.470
and it gives you a different
perspective on the community.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:45.377
You can see the houses, you
can see the jungle growth

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.503
and it's so unique and so peaceful.

00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:52.670
(upbeat techno music)

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.540
It looks like it's gonna
rain this afternoon

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.720
so I'm gonna go back to the
hotel, stay for a few hours,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.830
rest this afternoon and
rest for the seafood

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.990
dinner that's coming up.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.570
There was a nice rainstorm this
afternoon and we had a nice

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.820
rest back at the hotel.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.120
Now it's cleared up,
it's the late afternoon,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.660
we're on our way to a seafood restaurant,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.621
and it's about a 25 minute drive away.

00:13:21.621 --> 00:13:24.788
(upbeat techno music)

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.370
That was about a 25
minute drive but it was

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.299
a gorgeous ride, it was, it's so lush here

00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:38.860
and we followed the
signs towards Laem Sok,

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.630
but this is Laem Tieng
which is a cape south of

00:13:42.507 --> 00:13:46.270
Trat town, and this looks like
a little fishing community.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.100
The (speaking in foreign
language) who owns the restaurant,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.980
he literally walked outta the
restaurant to come meet us

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.060
at our car and this is
gonna be outstanding.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.540
This is the next level of laid-back

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.847
seafood family restaurant.

00:13:59.847 --> 00:14:03.847
- (speaking in foreign language

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.450
- He has all of the seafood
live in swimming pool tanks.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.360
He was showing us the
mantis shrimp, which are,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.875
I mean they look like aliens.

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:20.580
They look like a combination
of a praying mantis

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.751
and a massive prawn, massive shrimp.

00:14:23.751 --> 00:14:27.183
We're gonna have some alien
mantis shrimp tonight.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.030
The main dining room section is upstairs

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.670
so you have a view of the ocean.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.873
Wow, this is a, this is a
beautiful home seafood restaurant.

00:14:36.873 --> 00:14:37.886
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:14:37.886 --> 00:14:41.969
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:14:56.487 --> 00:15:00.180
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.430
(laughing)

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.200
- So we told Uncle just to
hook us up with a set menu,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.370
and so he is like, shopping
at an aquarium for us,

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.086
just with baskets gathering seafood.

00:15:13.086 --> 00:15:17.169
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:15:18.743 --> 00:15:22.240
- Ying and I are not eating
this seafood feast alone.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.518
We are hanging out with

00:15:23.518 --> 00:15:25.470
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.036
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:15:27.036 --> 00:15:27.869
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:15:27.869 --> 00:15:29.945
- And they are from, as
you can see their t-shirts

00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:31.810
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:32.720
- Yeah!

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.160
- Which means like, what
to eat, the food in Trat.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.050
And so they have a Facebook,
they blog about food

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.410
in Trat and so it's gonna be an honor

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.930
to hang out with them and eat
this seafood feast tonight.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.770
We are getting special permission
from the chef and owner,

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.470
the (speaking foreign
language), the uncle himself

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.580
to come back in the kitchen.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.010
I mean everything's incredibly fresh,

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.450
everything's gonna be awesome,

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.674
but those mantis alien shrimp.

00:15:55.674 --> 00:15:56.683
Wow.

00:15:58.951 --> 00:16:00.290
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.290
- They took all of that fresh
seafood, they put it into

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.110
a giant wok of bubbling water,
so that's the first step

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.680
is just boiling it,
especially the crab and the,

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.780
those things are huge!

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:15.352
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:21.382 --> 00:16:23.350
- He's just trimmin' them
up right now, cutting the,

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.460
those are some really
really sharp tentacles

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.720
and claws that they have.

00:16:34.886 --> 00:16:37.469
(sizzling oil)

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.870
The mantis shrimp go
straight into the hot oil

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.690
and they're gonna deep
fry and then they're gonna

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:43.853
combine it with garlic.

00:16:57.089 --> 00:17:00.256
(upbeat techno music)

00:17:05.096 --> 00:17:06.840
I think most of the dishes
are ready, I'm running back

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.990
up to the table, it's
time to start eating.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.020
By the way, do not get too
excited and hit your head,

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:13.853
whoa, like that.

00:17:13.853 --> 00:17:16.263
Do not hit your head, that
could hurt really bad.

00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:21.016
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:17:21.016 --> 00:17:25.760
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.843
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:17:34.347 --> 00:17:35.513
- Hey!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:36.813
- Hey.

00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:37.646
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:17:37.646 --> 00:17:39.896
(laughter)

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.910
- It's almost time to eat
but he is actually cracking

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.360
the crab and preparing it for us.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.240
Whoa, amazing service,
he's absolutely awesome.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.290
This seafood looks, we
got like, the biggest

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.450
of all types of seafood
that I've ever seen.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.621
Show us how to open (speaking
in foreign language).

00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:10.013
- [Diner] Expert, expert.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.356
- [Second Diner] Pick up.

00:18:15.356 --> 00:18:18.163
- [Third Diner] (speaking
in foreign language)

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:20.371
- [Mark] Wow.

00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:21.204
Wow.

00:18:22.786 --> 00:18:24.770
I'm gonna grab one of these gigantic,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.028
seriously extraterrestrial,

00:18:27.028 --> 00:18:29.563
look at that amount of garlic on top, too.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.450
The best. It is like armor.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.450
It's like a shrimp but way harder.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.910
It almost feels like plastic.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.610
Oh, look at all that
flesh underneath there.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.627
Oh, look at that.

00:18:39.627 --> 00:18:41.877
(laughter)

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:44.920
That's like a muscle.

00:18:46.272 --> 00:18:47.105
- Mmmm.

00:18:53.884 --> 00:18:54.717
- Wow.

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:55.550
- Wow.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.660
- Wow.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.980
- Look at it.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.960
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.793
- Lucky man!

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.360
- The lucky one with all the eggs in it!

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.590
It's just insane, it's like
shrimp but it's more juicy,

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.130
more tender, more sweet.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.319
It almost is, it almost tastes like crab.

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.030
A cross between shrimp and crab.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.703
And you can also really taste
that garlic on there, too.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.723
That is, that's absolute insanity.

00:19:28.604 --> 00:19:29.750
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.875
- No more talking.

00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:31.708
(laughter)

00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:32.610
Time to eat.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.670
- [Mark] This is one
thing, once you pick it up

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.240
and start eating, you will not,

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.833
you will not set it back down.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.210
That was one of the
greatest things I think

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.130
I've ever eaten in my entire life.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.900
It's time to move on
to the gigantic shrimp.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.240
And there should be
some tomalley in there.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.000
Some, oh look at all those juices,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.190
okay, we will save this head, oh man.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.233
Look at that.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.223
- Wow
- Wow.

00:19:58.223 --> 00:20:00.270
- [Second Diner] That's good.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.640
- If you were to spread this
out, it's curled right now,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.409
it would definitely be as
long, as tall as my face.

00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:08.000
(laughter)

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.929
And for this, we are all
gonna dip into that sauce.

00:20:10.929 --> 00:20:13.596
(happy moaning)

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:21.913
- Very yummy.

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:28.300
- Crazy good.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:33.133
It's so ridiculously
muscular and firm and sweet.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.890
It's insane.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.250
I'm gonna grab a little
bit a chili action,

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.290
I'm gonna put this right, right onto that.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.390
Oh, that's gonna be the ultimate bite.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.600
I've already taken one
bite, but you can like,

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.700
you can balance things on it, it's so big.

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:52.364
- [Diner] Wow.

00:20:52.364 --> 00:20:55.447
(scattered applause)

00:20:56.874 --> 00:20:59.207
- (mumbles)

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.760
Okay, we're moving in
for the crab, we're going

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.963
for those claws first.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.948
Peeled perfectly, and the owner,

00:21:06.948 --> 00:21:09.080
(speaking in foreign language),
he peeled them for us.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.450
It doesn't get better if you get

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.959
giant crab that's peeled for you.

00:21:13.959 --> 00:21:16.358
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:17.191
- Okay, okay.

00:21:17.191 --> 00:21:19.810
So two bites, the first bite no sauce,

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.110
the second bite we'll dip.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.420
Candy bar.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.040
It's like a candy bar.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.873
Next bite, seafood sauce.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.697
There's nothing better you
could put in your mouth.

00:21:45.697 --> 00:21:48.430
(laughter)

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.300
- [Diner] That's true.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.133
- Next up are the (speaking
in foreign language)

00:21:50.133 --> 00:21:52.220
which are the blood cockles,
and these are by far

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.783
the biggest blood cockles
I've ever seen in my life.

00:21:59.954 --> 00:22:00.787
Mmm.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.090
Oh, that's amazing too!

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.237
Oh, you can taste the salt water in them.

00:22:05.237 --> 00:22:07.927
It almost has an oyster texture, but mmm.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.060
Wow, those are succulent.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.310
Crazy succulent.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.495
Okay and you've gotta eat this with the

00:22:13.495 --> 00:22:14.863
(speaking in foreign language) seafood.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.530
Yeah, is definitely better
with the seafood sauce.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:28.337
Um, I mean that kinda masks
like, the fishiness of it

00:22:28.337 --> 00:22:30.392
and that just burns your lips going down.

00:22:30.392 --> 00:22:35.142
- [Diner] (speaking in foreign language)

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.610
- Okay so it's called
(speaking in foreign language)

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:42.120
which is fried rice
with crab, and it's just

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.200
loaded with crab, you gotta
add some prik nam pla,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.200
which is fish sauce and chilies to that.

00:22:55.003 --> 00:22:57.100
It's absolutely insane.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.780
That's like the type of fried
rice you could possibly eat.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.050
It's loaded with crab.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.423
It's like equal portions
of crab and rice in that.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.630
Next up are that grouper,
that fresh grouper.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.480
What he, they'd made two dishes out of it.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.280
One is a soup that they
made with the head,

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.150
and then the other they
deep-fried the tail,

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.750
they deep fried and put on some kind of a

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.583
sweet chili sauce on it.

00:23:20.583 --> 00:23:22.540
Check out the soup here,
let's try that fish,

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.380
that fish does not get
any fresher than that.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.620
It's, it would be impossible.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.370
Look at how that just flakes apart.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.180
I think it's (speaking
in foreign language),

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.830
lots of lemongrass in
there, it's nice and sour.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.139
That fish is unbelievably firm.

00:23:40.139 --> 00:23:44.889
- [Diner] (speaking in foreign language)

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.770
- I think this is the final
dish, which is the fried

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:54.373
grouper with sauce, and there's
also some pickled shallots.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.361
Oh, spectacular as well.

00:24:01.361 --> 00:24:02.883
Mmm, there's shallots.

00:24:03.958 --> 00:24:07.173
Mmm, the pickled shallots,
the fresh fish, it's crunchy.

00:24:08.365 --> 00:24:09.730
Everything is insanely good.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.897
(upbeat techno music)

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.550
For sure, one of the most
spectacular seafood meals

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:28.000
I've ever had in my life.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.780
I'm on my way to go wash my hands

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.670
and you've gotta check out the sinks.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.000
The sinks are on this balcony outside,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.980
and it just kinda goes off the ledge here.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.860
Oh, I think that's the kitchen down there.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.910
And then, you've got a,
the soaps right here,

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.660
be careful not to knock
the soaps off the ledge,

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.120
which could very easily happen.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.120
Or, oh there's a random crab claw squeezer

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.131
right there and a mallet.

00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:50.060
(laughter)

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.260
You don't wanna bump that off the wall,

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.093
that's for sure.

00:24:52.093 --> 00:24:53.940
Great handwashing facility.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.900
Oh, I love it.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.733
Perfect.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.281
Can't even find my shoes, there's,

00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:05.000
for one thing there's a
lot of people eating now,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.040
but I am definitely under the influence of

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.943
that seafood.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.350
It just looks like a blur of shoes to me.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:15.300
It was an absolutely
spectacular seafood feast,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.934
and there's nothing better
than eating with friends.

00:25:17.934 --> 00:25:18.767
- Yeah.

00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:19.600
- Yes.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.430
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.340
- And again, (speaking
in foreign language).

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.720
That's their Facebook
page, I'll have the links

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.900
in the description box.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.990
Check them out, they're just cool,

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.295
they're fun to eat with.

00:25:32.295 --> 00:25:33.194
- Yo, bye bye.

00:25:33.194 --> 00:25:34.450
- Bye bye.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.074
- Again I wanna say a huge thank you to

00:25:36.074 --> 00:25:38.230
(speaking in foreign
language) and his friends

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.990
for joining us for
dinner and this is their

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.384
favorite seafood restaurant,
for them showing us this spot.

00:25:43.384 --> 00:25:46.521
And again, they are from
(speaking in foreign language).

00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:48.910
I'll leave their links in
the description box below.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.600
But this is such an unassuming restaurant,

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.660
I mean it looks like a
shed from the outside,

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.040
the (speaking in foreign
language), the uncle here,

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.020
he is an amazing man, he
serves up fresh seafood.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.120
The total bill for everything that we ate,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.280
all of that gigantic
seafood, was THB 3,300.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.918
Which seriously anywhere else in Thailand

00:26:07.918 --> 00:26:09.950
that you eat that amount of seafood,

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.317
and that quality of seafood,
it's gonna be double the price.

00:26:13.317 --> 00:26:18.317
That, really a great
value, incredibly fresh,

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.940
incredibly delicious
the way they cooked it.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.890
That was one of the better
seafood meals of my life.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.780
Right here in Trat, a
beautiful location, I love it.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.130
It's like you're eating in his home.
