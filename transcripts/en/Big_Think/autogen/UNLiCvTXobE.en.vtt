lab in our Institute what we mean is the

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830
lab in our Institute what we mean is the
 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.300
lab in our Institute what we mean is the
special quality of mind and the special

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.310
special quality of mind and the special
 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.910
special quality of mind and the special
features that exist in the mind that

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920
features that exist in the mind that
 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.029
features that exist in the mind that
permit us to know for example that we

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039
permit us to know for example that we
 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.819
permit us to know for example that we
ourselves exist and that things exist

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829
ourselves exist and that things exist
 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.149
ourselves exist and that things exist
around us and there is something more

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:25.159
around us and there is something more
 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.779
around us and there is something more
than just mind you know mind allows us

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789
than just mind you know mind allows us
 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.390
than just mind you know mind allows us
to portray in different sensory

name it what we are like and what the

name it what we are like and what the
 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.470
name it what we are like and what the
world is like but this very very

world is like but this very very
 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.010
world is like but this very very
important quality of subjectivity this

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020
important quality of subjectivity this
 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.970
important quality of subjectivity this
quality that allows us to take a distant

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980
quality that allows us to take a distant
 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.340
quality that allows us to take a distant
view and say I am here I exist I have a

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350
view and say I am here I exist I have a
 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.010

life and there are things around me that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020

refer to me that meanness M II - that is
what really constitutes consciousness in

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049
what really constitutes consciousness in
 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.580
what really constitutes consciousness in
the heart of consciousness is

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590
the heart of consciousness is
 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.860
the heart of consciousness is
subjectivity this sense of having a self

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870
subjectivity this sense of having a self
 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.710
subjectivity this sense of having a self
that observes one's own organism and the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720
that observes one's own organism and the
 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.660
that observes one's own organism and the
world around that organism that is

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670
world around that organism that is
 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.200
world around that organism that is
really the heart of consciousness and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210
really the heart of consciousness and
 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.270
really the heart of consciousness and
it's very interesting to think about the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280
it's very interesting to think about the
 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.190
it's very interesting to think about the
distinction with mind which are just

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200
distinction with mind which are just
 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.580
distinction with mind which are just
made in very general terms but it can be

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590
made in very general terms but it can be
 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.820
made in very general terms but it can be
made more profound when we think that

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830
made more profound when we think that
 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.480
made more profound when we think that
there are many species many creatures on

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490
there are many species many creatures on
 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.200
there are many species many creatures on
earth that are very likely to have a

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210
earth that are very likely to have a
 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.649
earth that are very likely to have a
mind but are very unlikely to have a

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659
mind but are very unlikely to have a
 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.780
mind but are very unlikely to have a
consciousness in the sense that you and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790
consciousness in the sense that you and
 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.530
consciousness in the sense that you and
I have there is a self that is very

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540
I have there is a self that is very
 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.750
I have there is a self that is very
robust that has many many levels of

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760
robust that has many many levels of
 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.060
robust that has many many levels of
organization from simple to complex and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070
organization from simple to complex and
 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.960
organization from simple to complex and
that functions as a sort of witness to

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970
that functions as a sort of witness to
 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.770
that functions as a sort of witness to
what is going on in our organisms that

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780
what is going on in our organisms that
 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.589
what is going on in our organisms that
kind of process is very interesting

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599
kind of process is very interesting
 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.990
kind of process is very interesting
because I believe that it is made out of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000
because I believe that it is made out of
 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.050
because I believe that it is made out of
the same cloth of mind but it is an

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060
the same cloth of mind but it is an
 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.070
the same cloth of mind but it is an
add-on

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080
add-on
 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.550
add-on
it is something that was specialized to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560
it is something that was specialized to
 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.090
it is something that was specialized to
create what we call the self and and it

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100
create what we call the self and and it
 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.880
create what we call the self and and it
exists for very special purposes and it

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890
exists for very special purposes and it
 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.430
exists for very special purposes and it
has very special and I think by and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440
has very special and I think by and
 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440
has very special and I think by and
large good consequences although not

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
large good consequences although not
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.120
large good consequences although not
only good consequences

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130
 
 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.760
 
I think it's possible to a certain

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
I think it's possible to a certain
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.590
I think it's possible to a certain
extent to make those comparisons that

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600
extent to make those comparisons that
 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.680
extent to make those comparisons that
the problem is the detail with which the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
the problem is the detail with which the
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.010
the problem is the detail with which the
comparison can be made of course the the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020
comparison can be made of course the the
 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.500
comparison can be made of course the the
first pass to make such a comparison

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
first pass to make such a comparison
 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.080
first pass to make such a comparison
would be to ask for a testimony from

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090
would be to ask for a testimony from
 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.750
would be to ask for a testimony from
different people and have people report

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
different people and have people report
 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.390
different people and have people report
on what they experienced now of course

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
on what they experienced now of course
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.900
on what they experienced now of course
if the report is going to be about the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
if the report is going to be about the
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.490
if the report is going to be about the
quality of sound that one and another

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500
quality of sound that one and another
 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.250
quality of sound that one and another
have it's going to be pretty tough to

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260
have it's going to be pretty tough to
 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.590
have it's going to be pretty tough to
just go on report even the descriptions

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600
just go on report even the descriptions
 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.810
just go on report even the descriptions
are very precise you you really can't go

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820
are very precise you you really can't go
 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.810
are very precise you you really can't go
very far now there are ways that in

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820
very far now there are ways that in
 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.460
very far now there are ways that in
which you can make that distinction

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470
which you can make that distinction
 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.460
which you can make that distinction
objective to a certain degree for

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470
objective to a certain degree for
 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.650
objective to a certain degree for
example by looking at responses that

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660
example by looking at responses that
 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.380
example by looking at responses that
could be generated in the brain -

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390
could be generated in the brain -
 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.540
could be generated in the brain -
exactly the same stimulus and there

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550
exactly the same stimulus and there
 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.270
exactly the same stimulus and there
could be differences there but there we

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
could be differences there but there we
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.790
could be differences there but there we
remove ourselves from the experience

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800
remove ourselves from the experience
 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.120
remove ourselves from the experience
itself - a surrogate of the experience

which is whatever measure you take from

which is whatever measure you take from
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.090
which is whatever measure you take from
the brain be it

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100

magnetic resonance so it's pretty tough

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970
magnetic resonance so it's pretty tough

to make those comparisons one thing that

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
to make those comparisons one thing that
 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.430
to make those comparisons one thing that
is for sure though is that when you look

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440
is for sure though is that when you look
 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.640
is for sure though is that when you look
at people that say are from the same

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650
at people that say are from the same
 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.000
at people that say are from the same
culture roughly the same age in not very

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
culture roughly the same age in not very
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.020
culture roughly the same age in not very
different intelligence and you make a

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030
different intelligence and you make a
 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.540
different intelligence and you make a
lot of detailed questions about the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550
lot of detailed questions about the
 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.020
lot of detailed questions about the
experiences of say colors situations and

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030
experiences of say colors situations and
 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.570
experiences of say colors situations and
so on you get very similar answers so I

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580
so on you get very similar answers so I
 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.860
so on you get very similar answers so I
think it's it's reasonable to say that

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870
think it's it's reasonable to say that
 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.900
think it's it's reasonable to say that
even though in all likelihood we have

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910
even though in all likelihood we have
 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.630
even though in all likelihood we have
slightly different experiences of

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640
slightly different experiences of
 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.170
slightly different experiences of
reality they are similar enough for us

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180
reality they are similar enough for us
 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.530
reality they are similar enough for us
not to clash in other words I'm not it's

not to clash in other words I'm not it's
very unlikely in fact let's say

very unlikely in fact let's say
 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.230
very unlikely in fact let's say
impossible for you to see the situation

impossible for you to see the situation
 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.880
impossible for you to see the situation
in which you and I are in right now

conception of the situation and so for
 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.140
conception of the situation and so for

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.860
all the purposes we are operating with a

than the other you have different

than the other you have different
degrees of the cuteness of the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670
degrees of the cuteness of the
 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.420
degrees of the cuteness of the
experience and that has to do with the

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430
experience and that has to do with the
