 I don't know if you have heard of it -- or seen it -- 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.800
 It is said that you can trap your cat in a frame surrounded by tape. 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.260
 Use tape to enclose any shape on the ground, your cat will theoretically be attracted to it 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.900
 Based on the fact that there are now fifteen cats in my house, 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.400
 I decided that I have to at least experiment to see if this can be successful.

 ( ́•̥̥̥ω•̥̥̥` ) 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.780
 The cats don’t have this simple shape of birds at all. 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.440
 Hey...so we guessed...you know...maybe these cats have seen big winds and waves 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.300
 Maybe they like a complicated shape. 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.360
 It seems that the result is that this thing is completely unworkable. 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.400
 I don’t know any of my 15 cats. They don’t like it. 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.220
 Tell you honestly, we try to put some cats into the frame. 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.640
 And they really want to be inside 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.460
 But I guess they just think it’s annoying to get caught in the middle of the tape... 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.580
 So...that's it, I am Anna Akana. 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.340
 ...this trick does not work.
