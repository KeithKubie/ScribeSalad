00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.470
Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter,
more succinctly known as Daft Punk, are arguably

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.660
two of the most famous and easily recognisable
musicians on Earth, having won countless major

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.630
awards including six Grammys and even managed
a “Best Original Score” award for the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.750
absolutely amazing Tron: Legacy soundtrack.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.850
Despite their extreme success, exceptionally
few of their millions of fans actually know

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.990
what the duo look like.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.700
You see, the pair have spent the last decade
or so carefully constructing their robotic

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.290
public alter egos, which begs the question,
why?

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.120
Though today the pair almost never grant interviews
and go to rather absurd levels to hide their

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.390
faces both on stage and in interviews, when
they made their first foray into the world

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.190
of music, they had no such reservations.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.579
Prior to Daft Punk both Guy-Man and Thomas
made up two thirds of a rock trio called,

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.020
Darlin’ which had lacklustre “success”
from 1992 to 1993.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
The band, in which Guy-Man played guitar and
Thomas played bass, released a grand total

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.779
of four songs over their brief, six month
long career, two of which appeared on a vinyl

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:13.029
compilation album titled, Shimmies in Super
8.

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:17.590
The album, of which only about 800 copies
were made, is notable for a review it inspired

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.630
by Dave Jennings of Melody Maker magazine
who referred to the band’s sound as “daft

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.719
punky thrash” (not “a load of daft punk”
as many sources suggest).

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.810
This review was read by the duo who subsequently
went on to make it the name of their new band

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.349
as they reportedly thought it was funny.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.939
As mentioned, while performing as Darlin’,
neither Guy-Man nor Thomas made any attempt

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.249
to obscure their faces.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.529
Although it should be noted that they only
had two real gigs.

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:49.409
They likewise did not try to hide their visages
when they initially formed Daft Punk in 1993

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.289
following the break-up of Darlin’.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.289
This all changed in 1996 (a year before the
release of their debut album Homework) when

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.979
the band began adamantly refusing to be photographed
or filmed without obscuring their appearance

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.279
in some way.

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:02.299
Initially the duo used whatever they had on
hand at that moment to hide their faces during

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.719
interviews, such as shaving cream, swimming
goggles and on at least one occasion, a pair

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.060
of black cloth bags.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.819
They also would typically wear Halloween masks
for shows.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.290
In 1999, while the pair were in the middle
of recording Discovery, they began to discuss

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.540
the idea of constructing alternative identities
that “matched the direction of their music”

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.730
and settled on the idea of quite literally
becoming humanoid robots.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.739
To accomplish this goal, Daft Punk approached
two artist friends, Alexandre Courtes and

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.230
Martin Fougerol, who created the initial concept
art for what would become Daft Punk’s new

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.909
robo alter egos.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.590
They then took this art to renowned special
effects guru Tony Gardner of Alterian Inc,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.709
who began the long process of turning it into
an actual costume.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.970
GortAccording to Gardner, the design of Thomas’
silver helmet was chiefly inspired by the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.691
look of Gort from the 1951 film, The Day The
Earth Stood Still whereas Guy-Man’s helmet

00:02:55.691 --> 00:03:00.430
was initially supposed to be entirely gold,
not dissimilar from, to quote Gardner, “a

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.549
spaceman’s helmet” before the decision
was made to include the now iconic LED display.

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.579
The inclusion of so many LED lights in the
helmet caused a number of issues during the

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.140
early phases of construction, forcing Alterian
to bring in the guy who designed the Jumbotron.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.439
To supply power to the helmets, both of which
featured a number of features, such as displaying

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.519
text and a variety of patterns (controlled
by a console located on each of their arms),

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.849
Guy-Man and Thomas had to wear bulky backpacks
containing a power supply and circuitry, from

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.599
which countless wires could clearly be seen
entering the back of the helmet; this added

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.530
to the effect, giving the appearance of a
slick of robotic hair.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.769
Speaking of which, up until literally the
last minute, both helmets originally had wigs,

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.400
which fit with the early concept art provided
by Alex and Martin.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.109
However, just before arriving at the photoshoot
to unveil their new robotic personas in 2001,

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.319
the duo decided to remove the wigs, feeling
that it made them look “sleeker”.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.950
Another issue with the earliest models of
the helmets was how hot it got inside them,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.390
but this was later solved by adding various
ventilators.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.060
Upon unveiling their new look, Daft Punk were
surprisingly coy about exactly why they’d

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.689
made the decision to suddenly don robot helmets
and gloves.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.060
When directly asked, Thomas jokingly responded:
“We did not choose to become robots.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.250
There was an accident in our studio.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.490
We were working on our sampler, and at exactly
9:09 am on September 9, 1999, it exploded.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.340
When we regained consciousness, we discovered
that we had become robots.”

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.160
When asked if the duo were going to wear the
costumes on stage, Guy-Man doubled down, stating:

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.699
“We are robots now.”

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.300
Prompting Thomas to add, presumably with a
smirk under that helmet: “We don’t wear

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.280
helmets; everything’s real.”

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.169
Over the years as the band has softened somewhat
on their stance on interviews, other pieces

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.780
of information about why they chose to don
the suits has come to light.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.700
For example, in a 2013 interview with Rolling
Stone, the duo clarified that the robot masks

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.740
were not originally for marketing purposes
or to sell records, but to explore the “line

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.930
between fiction and reality” and create
“fictional personas that exist in real life.”

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.060
Further noting that they thought of the helmets
as “sci-fi glam”, in that they represent

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.430
an obviously exaggerated persona that is distinctly
not them.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.400
That said, in the same interview, the duo
noted that the robot personas had become an

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.830
unmistakable part of their draw, quipping:
“We’re not performers, we’re not models

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.710
– it would not be enjoyable for humanity
to see our features, but the robots are exciting

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.710
to people.”

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.360
Finally getting to the heart of the original
motivation for the masks, they stated,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.639
We’re trying to separate the private side
and the public side.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.490
It’s just that we’re a little bit embarrassed
by the whole thing.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.419
We don’t want to play this star… thing.

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.420
We don’t want to get recognised in the streets…

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.080
On that note, a huge benefit of the robot
persona is that, despite their superstardom,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.520
it’s easy for the pair to go about their
daily lives without Daft Punk fans constantly

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.360
hounding them for autographs or otherwise,
as Thomas noted, “reminding me of what I

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.360
do…

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.319
It’s nice to be able to forget.”

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:03.639
And for the curious, yes, despite the pair’s
sincerest efforts to remain masked, there

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.050
are plenty of photos out there of Daft Punk
without their helmets, though none of which

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.449
we personally have the rights to publish here.

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.870
So we’ll just leave you with these links.

look a lot cooler in robotic form ;-)): Thomas
