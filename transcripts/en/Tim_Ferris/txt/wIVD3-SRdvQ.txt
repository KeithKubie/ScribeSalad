Speaker 1:          00:00          I used to drink coffee every morning and I still love coffee, but I prefer a new cocktail and the ingredients are black and green tape blended coconut oil and butter from grass fed cows. My favorite teas are polarity, which is an aged black tea from China has some critical applications for fat loss among other things. Then that comes in these large bricks that are typically uh, air dried. You can also get embers, but they're very, very hard to find and green tea from Japan. Could we say sentia, K B U s C. Sencha. The way I'm going to make this team because I have a canister tea basket full of the who error in green team. I'm going to pour hot water over that and it can really, you can really beat the hell out of it who Eric can tolerate. Very high temperature especially. Typically what I like to do with this too is I will let this steep the first steep for about 30 to 60 seconds.

Speaker 1:          01:03          If you ever want to decaffeinate your t here's a, here's a tip. You steep it really quickly and hot water. I mean say 180 degrees or hotter, I mean I'd let it, let it cool off from boiling for a few minutes and then pour out the first Stephen, that'll get rid of 70 80% of the caffeine from the leaves themselves. So let that sit and then we're going to do the same thing in another because I'm actually gonna use this to drink the tea and there are many different ways to do this. This is one that's, that's helpful for doing it on the road. So I'm gonna let this steep for about two minutes. In the meantime I'm going to do is get my butter and I'm going to put in a tablespoon for me to intestinal comfort.

Speaker 1:          01:49          One tablespoon of coconut oil, which is about 40 to 60% medium chain triglyceride by weight. That's why you putting it in there, MCTs, and then you're going to let him out. You watch it all. You can stirred up all that fatty deliciousness coming to the top. We'll take our second bit of tea. Now put an m. And what I found through experimentation is that you can certainly blend this and I actually travel with a small pocket size blender for that purpose, but just as easily you can grab a couple of mixing sticks or spinning and mixed up and you're in good shape. If you want to head on it like a Guinness. Then she uses the blender is delicious.
