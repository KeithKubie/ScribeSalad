about many of you will have read about
 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.290
about many of you will have read about
by a physicist named Richard Muller who

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300
by a physicist named Richard Muller who
 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.150
by a physicist named Richard Muller who
is a very distinguished physicist who's

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
is a very distinguished physicist who's
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.890
is a very distinguished physicist who's
always taken a sort of a different

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
always taken a sort of a different
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.140
always taken a sort of a different
position on various scientific topics

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
position on various scientific topics
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.130
position on various scientific topics
and two or three years ago he began to

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140
and two or three years ago he began to
 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.099
and two or three years ago he began to
say critical things about the science

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
say critical things about the science
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.670
say critical things about the science
behind global warming and he decided

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
behind global warming and he decided
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.130
behind global warming and he decided
that in order to find out where the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
that in order to find out where the
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.370
that in order to find out where the
earth was warming he would do a study

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
earth was warming he would do a study
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.799
earth was warming he would do a study
himself many members of the denier

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
himself many members of the denier
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.350
himself many members of the denier
community said well whatever Muller

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
community said well whatever Muller
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.150
community said well whatever Muller
comes up with we're going to trust that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
comes up with we're going to trust that
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.850
comes up with we're going to trust that
so Muller did his study and he reported

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
so Muller did his study and he reported
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530
so Muller did his study and he reported
out about three or four weeks ago well

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
out about three or four weeks ago well
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.479
out about three or four weeks ago well
lo and behold he said the earth is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
lo and behold he said the earth is
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.750
lo and behold he said the earth is
warming and if you look at a chart of

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
warming and if you look at a chart of
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.619
warming and if you look at a chart of
his study compared to the other major

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
his study compared to the other major
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.979
his study compared to the other major
studies they lie right on top of each

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
studies they lie right on top of each
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.720
studies they lie right on top of each
other you can't tell one study from

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
other you can't tell one study from
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.860
other you can't tell one study from
another I think the deniers picked up on

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870
another I think the deniers picked up on
 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.520
another I think the deniers picked up on
Muller's work and unwisely in retrospect

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
Muller's work and unwisely in retrospect
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.410
Muller's work and unwisely in retrospect
agreed to accept whatever he said

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
agreed to accept whatever he said
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300
agreed to accept whatever he said
because he had been very critical of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
because he had been very critical of
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.390
because he had been very critical of
global warming and so I think there was

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
global warming and so I think there was
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.929
global warming and so I think there was
a leap of faith you might say or a leap

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
a leap of faith you might say or a leap
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.149
a leap of faith you might say or a leap
of hope on the denier community that

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
of hope on the denier community that
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.980
of hope on the denier community that
here's a very distinguished physicist

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
here's a very distinguished physicist
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.690
here's a very distinguished physicist
who's finally going to say that we're

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
who's finally going to say that we're
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.999
who's finally going to say that we're
right and the scientists are wrong I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
right and the scientists are wrong I
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.730
right and the scientists are wrong I
think what we could learn from the case

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
think what we could learn from the case
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.880
think what we could learn from the case
study that Muller did is that he should

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
study that Muller did is that he should
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.030
study that Muller did is that he should
have trusted the other scientists and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
have trusted the other scientists and
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.580
have trusted the other scientists and

process which had produced the data that

process which had produced the data that

he said two years ago everyone should

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
he said two years ago everyone should
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.749

have been a skeptic well two years ago

was no reason to question that data and
it was a little offensive at least I

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
it was a little offensive at least I
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.420
it was a little offensive at least I
feel it's rather it was rather offensive

and arrogant of Muller to simply say

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920
and arrogant of Muller to simply say
 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.339
and arrogant of Muller to simply say
