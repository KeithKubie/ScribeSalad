00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.840
As far as icon are concerned, state chart compromise between the rectangles that

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.019
we saw in the ovals to a thing called round-tangles, rounded cornered

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.140
rectangles. They can, they can have labels indicating state name.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.295
They can have arcs connecting them which is a,

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:23.088
a directed arc that is there's going to be an arrowhead at one end.

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:28.490
And the arch's themselves can be labeled with the event causing the transition,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.470
possibly with a slash and the action taken when the the event occurs.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.400
Also, there's a way to indicate what the default or initial state is.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.790
In the case of state charts this is having a small circle that's filled in.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.580
You know blackened. And the final state in this case, the final state is one in

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.030
which there is a concentric outer ring around a filled in a filled in circle.
