00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.820
Three, two, one. Hey, I'm Jeff. I'm Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

2
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:07.980
And today while we're still on the subject of worth,

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:09.690
but this is a totally different take. Yeah.

4
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:13.200
And this is comes from our producer Matt Kielty. So next,

5
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.270
a a slightly different story about worth a story that rather than being about

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.340
how much we value our own lives, it's about how much we value someone else's.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.300
Right. And it starts with buzzfeed writer, Gregory Johnson. So, okay.

8
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:31.140
Maybe you should start with, um, what does now become sort of the infamous uh,

9
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:32.670
wedding wedding drone strike? Is that,

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.950
was that sort of where it started for you? Yeah,

11
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.030
so this strike happens in a very rugged part of the Yemen where there are no

12
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.450
paved roads, no electricity, there's no running water. It's,

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.330
there's the mornings, September 12th,

14
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.900
2013 and early that morning in a small village, a group of guys,

15
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.800
roughly 50 to 60 people hooting as soon to be married,

16
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.880
man pile into a bunch of cars and they start driving. This is the convoy,

17
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.500
the wedding convoy. Now in the lead car. This convoy was this man,

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.400
his name is Abdula Mohammed LTEC.

19
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.570
We spoke to him through an interpreter in Yemen and

20
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.360
Abdula told me it was his neighbor who was the groom to be married that day

21
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.070
and so they were all driving up to the bride's village and said they got there a

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.930
little before noon, ate lunch, recited wedding poems.

23
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.130
After lunch they grabbed the bride and just a few of her bridal attendants,

24
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:29.964
a few females,

25
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.090
and they start driving back to the groom's village for the actual wedding

26
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:35.670
ceremony. Now,

27
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.950
Abuelas said that ever since they'd left that morning through lunch all day

28
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:45.210
long, they heard this humming.

29
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.630
It's sort of metallic worrying. This metallic thumping overhead.

30
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.050
No one in the conflict could see it, but they knew what it was. A drone

31
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.280
Samsung hearing all day.

32
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.610
It's nothing new for people in rural parts of Yemen by this point.

33
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:02.400
They don't think anything of it. It's common to hear those sounds

34
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.410
so you keep driving basically,

35
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:10.860
if you can imagine it there sort of winding through these Wattis,

36
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.630
these desert mountainous places

37
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.760
and it's mountainous. They're all strung out on this,

38
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:21.420
rotted out little dirt track. 11 cars, single file.

39
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.490
Finally they reached this little clearing

40
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.680
up near the top of this cliff where they all slowed down and started to bunch

41
00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:33.910
together because apparently [inaudible] one of the cars that got in a flat,

42
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.440
some guys got out, fixed it, got back in their cars,

43
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.760
didn't right at that moment. The sound shifts somehow.

44
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.660
And then the missiles star,

45
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.990
four of them in quick succession.

46
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.210
The shrapnel is just flying everywhere and it blink and sober.

47
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.430
People are trying to figure out what has happened. All the screaming,

48
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.010
there's fires that are burning and Abdula

49
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.150
[inaudible] his car was torn up. He had shrapnel in his face, in his face,

50
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.870
one in a human release area in the right hand,

51
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.850
left fi one on in the back and outage get done under Afghanistan.

52
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.150
And he says that once he saw there was smoke and his first thought was,

53
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.140
where's my son? And how did you have to get done? My African, uh, he was,

54
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.210
he was a local for his son. His son was there. Yeah.

55
00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:31.580
A young man who had been a few cars back from my son,

56
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.820
had the fourth car on combines, and he was married with two boys and run.

57
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:38.950
Doctor [inaudible] said he could move.

58
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.090
So he got out of his car and stumbled back toward the fourth car.

59
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.130
[inaudible] I can to find his son. Yeah.

60
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.440
He said they found him just next door

61
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.363
<v 2>to the car</v>

62
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.490
<v 0>before. Yes. He,</v>

63
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.273
<v 2>he died.</v>

64
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.910
<v 0>It's [inaudible]. No, not for long time. No, he didn't talk to him.</v>

65
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:02.270
Just he looked at him and

66
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.530
<v 2>just to pass away.</v>

67
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.150
<v 0>So it turns out that there are 12 dead.</v>

68
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.530
And typically what happens in Yemen is that as soon as someone is killed,

69
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:19.870
they're buried very, very shortly thereafter.

70
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.060
What happens here is something different.

71
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.170
The people in the convoy take the bodies of the dead and they take them back to

72
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.710
read though this big town near where the drone strike occurred.

73
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.440
There's a video I have. That's what you're hearing,

74
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.150
where you see some men take these 12 dead bodies and they line them up in the

75
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:45.320
street on this bright blue tarp and they sort of wrap them in these cheap

76
00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:46.154
blankets.

77
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.880
And so there's this huge crowd that just gathers around to stare at these dead

78
00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:55.880
bodies who are laid out in the street and at a certain point,

79
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.280
this very tiny village, very leathery,

80
00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:02.480
all the emoney who sort of holding onto the back of the pickup with one arm,

81
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.640
he stands over the dead sort of swaying over the bodies and just lecturing the

82
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:10.460
crowd on what happened. He's just screaming at them. And so

83
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.120
you can hear his voice start to go hoarse

84
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.940
and he's screaming in American drone killed these. It was a massacre.

85
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.630
These people are on their way to wedding. Why did this happen?

86
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.890
Why were they killed?

87
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.133
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

88
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.690
<v 0>why did they target this, this convoy? Well, according to the u s government,</v>

89
00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:49.691
they had received Intel that on that day in this convoy was an al Qaeda

90
00:05:49.821 --> 00:05:52.460
operative named Shockey all bad Dani,

91
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.330
who apparently had been planning attacks against the u s that's why they took

92
00:05:56.331 --> 00:05:59.330
the shot. And in fact they say that he was wounded in this,

93
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.700
in this wedding convoys strike.

94
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.780
And do we have any reason to believe that?

95
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.920
I have no reason to believe it. Greg spent weeks in Yemen,

96
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.100
talked to survivors of the drone, stray, talked to people who were there.

97
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.100
No one knows this guy and Greg says the guy isn't really a member of either of

98
00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:18.680
the tribes that were involved in the wedding.

99
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.280
And so to him it makes no sense that he would be there.

100
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.740
To him this was a terrible mistake

101
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:26.890
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

102
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.890
<v 0>but what really got me interested in Greg's reporting,</v>

103
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.650
which you can read on buzzfeed.com highly recommend it,

104
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.950
is that he goes really deep into the question of like what the u s did next.

105
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.530
Cause the question is like, what do you do in this case?

106
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.460
How do you repair something like this when you have two totally different

107
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:47.320
cultures with two different traditions?

108
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.460
How do you find a way to try to make this right?

109
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.790
<v 1>Mm.</v>

110
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.200
<v 0>[inaudible] key cans and can, you know, I mean, historically,</v>

111
00:06:56.201 --> 00:07:01.120
do soldiers have an obligation to repair damage? They do. No,

112
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.300
there's no obligation. But a,

113
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.970
what's happened is we've actually created an obligation for ourselves and

114
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.520
Americans have, yeah. Yeah. This has a really long history. A history that's um,

115
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.910
immediately legal. Legally. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Illegal history really.

116
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.590
And there's a, there's a great, uh, law professor at Yale. What's his name? Uh,

117
00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:25.210
his last name is w his wit. It's John Witt. Um, that's me. Uh,

118
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.420
we ended up tracking down John Witt a jet. How are you?

119
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.320
Let's talk about how the u s first started to try to write the wrongs in war.

120
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.380
<v 3>So what is the foundation story of all this?</v>

121
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.380
That starts with general Pershing in World War One?

122
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:40.680
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

123
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.880
<v 0>so 1917. All right. Guys called to wow. It's a great war. Ramps up.</v>

124
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.170
So we start shipping young men, millions more to pop over to Europe.

125
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.870
<v 1>Well [inaudible]</v>

126
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.740
<v 0>with the France and in charge of these men was a man named John j,</v>

127
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.560
<v 3>the commander of American forces on the western front, stern man,</v>

128
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.990
handsome mustache, bit of a maverick general person whose, you know,

129
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.330
nickname was, was black jack. And uh,

130
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.690
when he first arrived in France with his troops general black Jack Pershing,

131
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.640
he's got this problem, which is that he has g

132
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.890
<v 1>spilled in America, ship to France and man by our map.</v>

133
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.800
<v 3>So World War One is the first war in which the u s um,</v>

134
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.620
is shipping a lot of automobiles,

135
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.700
more than a hundred thousand for the soldiers to drive cars, trucks,

136
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.940
jeeps and jeeps are really great. They get his men from one place to another.

137
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.360
<v 0>Patty, Damion to, I don't know, messy,</v>

138
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.800
<v 3>but they also run into French farmers, chickens and cows, children,</v>

139
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:41.210
sometimes just the farmers themselves with these random collisions or with there

140
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:43.940
no roads. I'm going to bet there was some of everything.

141
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.860
Sometimes it was probably just ordinary car accidents and sometimes no doubt a

142
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:52.160
little French wine was involved. So this is Pershing's problem.

143
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.130
He's trying to run a war overseas. And it wasn't any good for him

144
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.010
<v 0>to have grumpy civilians at his rear.</v>

145
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.420
And so Pershing has an idea which he actually borrows from the bridge and that

146
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:08.360
is he will use cash money to write our wrongs one.

147
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.300
So he goes to Congress and begs for a statute and congress obliges really

148
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.670
quickly there no sign. This is a controversial thing,

149
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.510
but it was a genuinely new thing because for the first time in a history of war,

150
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.320
as far as we could tell you had a state compensating individuals.

151
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.760
Usually it's state to state.

152
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:27.300
Here you have state to individuals and said the u s government starts

153
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.710
systematically paying money for the loss of a non American life and war.

154
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.690
How much cheese? I don't know.

155
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.570
It's actually surprisingly hard to find documentation.

156
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.410
I'm mentioning specific amounts, but whatever the amounts were,

157
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.513
it seems to afford

158
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:45.820
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

159
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.020
<v 0>Christian wrote in his biography that the swift and prompt settlement of claims</v>

160
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.240
had a great effect upon the people.

161
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.020
So it seemed to work really well.

162
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.960
And is this amuse the idea here that like this is what we would do with the

163
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:01.740
drone strike victims. We talked about that we'd pay them money. Well,

164
00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:02.580
it's actually, it's uh,

165
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.210
it's a bit trickier than that because the thing that Pershing got in world war

166
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:07.044
one,

167
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:12.380
it came with a catch and that is that there's a combat exclusion in case you

168
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:16.410
just walked in. That's Gregory Johnson. And what he means is that this law,

169
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.100
basically what it said is that we'll pay your claims if it didn't happen on the

170
00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:22.440
field of battle. And it wasn't a combat situation.

171
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.400
If it was combat and it was on the field of battle, then tough luck.

172
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.690
That's just war.

173
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.690
So if US soldiers were driving to a fight and they ran their car into somebody

174
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.170
and they damage that car, killed that person,

175
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.170
those people would not be able to get compensation.

176
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:44.370
Whereas if the U s soldiers were driving to a bar and got in an accident,

177
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:48.360
they would be able to get compensation. But the problem is

178
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.370
<v 5>once we get into these counterinsurgency wars,</v>

179
00:10:51.371 --> 00:10:54.800
civilians are suddenly in the middle of the Great John Goes,

180
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.520
<v 4>I've been made that troops. Carol does money goes 567.</v>

181
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.020
The South Vietnamese civilians during the sweep.

182
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.300
<v 5>This is in a way the story of modern warfare.</v>

183
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.250
Sirens are beginning to sound over back that President Karzai says he's

184
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:12.780
delivering his final warning to the u s after u s air strike accidentally killed

185
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.990
more than a dozen mothers and children by the time we get to Afghanistan. Right.

186
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.910
<v 0>The fighting is happening in the cities,</v>

187
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.120
so there's no difference really between the battlefield and where people live.

188
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.440
And so the line between what's combat related and what's not combat related,

189
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.690
it starts to get

190
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.950
<v 6>blurry. And so in 2003 and Iraq,</v>

191
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:34.460
what happened was there were actually people lining up, you know,

192
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:37.370
there were civilian military operations centers.

193
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.720
People started lining up outside of the saying, my family has been harmed.

194
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.630
I want help. How many people do you remember? If I had to guess,

195
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:49.370
it was maybe around 80 people or so. Um, that's a ton of people.

196
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.140
Yeah, that's John Tracy.

197
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:55.780
He was a military lawyer in Iraq in two three and before him, Marla Keenan,

198
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.080
I'm managing director of center for civilians in conflict.

199
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.640
So when they came with a complaint,

200
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:04.700
what sort is it like you ran over my chicken or you knocked out my window? No,

201
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.130
no, no. Much more serious.

202
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.560
<v 0>I mean, I think of cluster bombs during the shock and awe campaign.</v>

203
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.830
One of the types of bombs that we were using or the air force was using what

204
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.250
they call cluster munitions.

205
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.150
Basically John says air force planes would fly over these targets and drop a

206
00:12:20.151 --> 00:12:23.880
hundreds and hundreds of these tiny little bombs smaller than a coke can.

207
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.630
And a lot of them would land in maybe a parking lot or a field and they wouldn't

208
00:12:27.631 --> 00:12:31.980
explode. So on a number of occasions you'd have mostly it was kids, right?

209
00:12:31.981 --> 00:12:36.030
Because the kids would see it and they didn't know any better.

210
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.200
It would just run over and kick it and then that's when it would explode.

211
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.240
That's when I'm right. Huh?

212
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.770
I had a lot of those close to a dozen and so that was, uh,

213
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.050
that was a difficult one because, well,

214
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.210
it's combat because the air force dropped it because they were, you know,

215
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.070
bombing the city. Right. But at the same time, days, weeks,

216
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.550
even months have gone by and this thing is just sitting in the ground.

217
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.220
Couldn't we say it's not combat?

218
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.100
And this was a real question that John had to ask his boss.

219
00:13:08.101 --> 00:13:09.930
And then his boss asked his boss,

220
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.740
they eventually sent the question up to the army claims service and they said,

221
00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:14.910
no, it, it's combat,

222
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.590
<v 6>meaning they're not gonna pay basically like we are in an in an armed conflict.</v>

223
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.840
And this was an unfortunate incident,

224
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.280
but an incident that happened during a lawful combat operation and therefore

225
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.380
we're sorry. And that's basically it. So I said no to a lot of people.

226
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.830
And so like in World War One with general Pershing military officers,

227
00:13:34.831 --> 00:13:38.760
they started lobbying their bosses for an expanded systems so they could start

228
00:13:38.761 --> 00:13:42.900
making more payments and eventually the military does expand it. In fact, um,

229
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:47.000
I talked to one of the militaries, top lawyers, regular General Richard C.

230
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.990
Gross. I go by rich.

231
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.350
I'm the legal counsel to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

232
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.560
He told me that around 2006 pain out these kinds of condolence payments actually

233
00:13:56.561 --> 00:13:59.830
became sort of a key part of military strategy. Absolutely.

234
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.830
Even had its own acronym Maus,

235
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.030
m a w s its money as a weapon system,

236
00:14:06.031 --> 00:14:10.650
which you know, I'm not sure that title resonates with everybody,

237
00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:13.580
but it's an interesting phrase for sure. Yeah, exactly. But it's,

238
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.430
it's the idea that money can be used to,

239
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.060
to win hearts and minds that help bring the population over.

240
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.800
And it just got me wondering how much money makes a good weapon.

241
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.760
Well, I haven't liked the u s military hasn't given me access to a database or

242
00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:32.760
anything like that, but three or four years and, and, and interviews,

243
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:34.590
I've seen different numbers.

244
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.270
Marla says that in 2006 the ACLU filed a foyer request and eventually got their

245
00:14:39.271 --> 00:14:42.720
hands on hundreds of claims files. And in those files,

246
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:44.130
what you see are a bunch of different numbers,

247
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:49.320
but one that comes up again and again, $2,500 2,500 by and large.

248
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.920
Hmm. Now someone like John could have paid more,

249
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.130
but that meant they'd have to run the claim up the chain of command. Exactly.

250
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.060
So it was almost like there were these ceilings, 2,500 for a life,

251
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.610
1500 for property damage,

252
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.350
and then eventually the property damage amount got raised to 2,500 is as well.

253
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.150
And that,

254
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.200
that didn't make any sense to me that somebody could get so much for a Toyota

255
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:15.980
Corolla but you weren't, you were just going to get the same amount, uh,

256
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:18.410
for lost life. Like I can't get over,

257
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.650
I mean 2,500 seems like just such an [inaudible] a nominal amount and the

258
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:25.790
practicality of that money of like if you were to kill someone who is the

259
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.360
breadwinner of a family, that $2,500 would,

260
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.900
would not be able to support this family in any way. Right.

261
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.470
But we're not actually trying to pay full compensation. Right? Like,

262
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:37.520
we're not trying to say,

263
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.590
we think if this 20 year old man had lived to be the average age in Afghanistan,

264
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.660
then he, you know, that it would have been $60,843.

265
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.660
Right? Like that's not the thing. It's you ever, you know,

266
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.140
we had people who were killed here in an attack.

267
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:58.130
The federal government is one step closer to cutting its first checks,

268
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:03.290
two families of those killed and injured on September 11th and those people have

269
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:04.210
been compensated.

270
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.220
Yet the levels of compensation to the New York victims is, is pretty good.

271
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.410
Strap up. Hi.

272
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.410
The range of payments for death claim ranged anywhere from $250,000 to just

273
00:16:16.261 --> 00:16:20.880
under $7 million. You noticed that? I do.

274
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.550
Um, I do,

275
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.110
but it is to a large degree comparing apples and oranges. That's general gross.

276
00:16:28.111 --> 00:16:29.610
Again, because you're talking about a,

277
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:34.910
a legal system where a country is paying their own victims versus condolences in

278
00:16:37.051 --> 00:16:37.231
a,

279
00:16:37.231 --> 00:16:41.190
in an area where there's no legal obligation to make those payments in the first

280
00:16:41.191 --> 00:16:45.690
place. So that's a very different type of monetary payment. Well,

281
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:50.310
yes and no. I'm essentially, it's a person's life and yeah,

282
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:55.290
I mean I think there's an argument to be made that there's an empathy in the

283
00:16:55.291 --> 00:16:59.190
number that you come up with and the amount that you pay for someone's life.

284
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.630
I totally get what you're saying.

285
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.410
The $2,500 I think it's any amount of money.

286
00:17:04.411 --> 00:17:06.360
If I told you 10 would you feel better about it?

287
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.750
I mean you get a little bit better. I think so. Ken,

288
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.530
what does it get you though in the end?

289
00:17:10.531 --> 00:17:14.100
$10,000 doesn't buy anything more back than what you lost.

290
00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:16.170
I don't know what 10 doesn't get to you exactly in Afghanistan,

291
00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:21.171
but my assumption is that it gets you a lot more than 2,500 and but does that

292
00:17:21.211 --> 00:17:24.990
really help you? Is that really what you want? Is the money unimportant to you?

293
00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:28.230
Really? It sounds like the money's really, I'm not a victim,

294
00:17:28.231 --> 00:17:31.800
so I don't know that I can answer that to me if it happened at this point.

295
00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:35.280
Marla told us this story about how before she got into this line of work,

296
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.800
I had several friends who are journalists.

297
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.080
One of those friends was a man named Chris Hondros. Yeah.

298
00:17:40.081 --> 00:17:43.620
He's a photo journalist. He was a photo journalist. And back in 2011,

299
00:17:43.621 --> 00:17:47.460
Chris was on assignment and Libya moving with a rebel group when they were fired

300
00:17:47.461 --> 00:17:51.720
upon. And Chris was. Yeah. Um, and Marla says,

301
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.340
when she found out that it happened,

302
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.700
I wanted someone to explain to me why that happened.

303
00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.400
<v 7>I mean, sorry,</v>

304
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.610
<v 6>I just want to turn to explain. I think even like,</v>

305
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.470
I knew his family wasn't going to get any money.

306
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:10.650
I knew that these guys that shot a rocket propelled grenade at him.

307
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.220
We're going to care. No one was going to explain, but I wanted that.

308
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.390
And the money then becomes an occasion for you say like, not just,

309
00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:23.690
I'm sorry, but here's what happened. It's the, here's what happened part.

310
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.460
I think it's the token that's given with the apology and with the explanation,

311
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.420
but it's the apology and the explanation that mattered to you. Yeah.

312
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.030
That's why we call it a men's making amends.

313
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:45.730
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

314
00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:50.440
<v 8>one of the things that, um, is true of money damages generally is there.</v>

315
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.680
There are desperate effort to find some common language between the,

316
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.040
the party paying and the, and the victim.

317
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:05.130
Some Esperanto for communicating the meaning of what's happened in a language

318
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:10.530
that the other side knows matters. That's how John Whip puts it because we,

319
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.990
we see it everywhere we look, we see a part, not just apologies,

320
00:19:13.991 --> 00:19:18.070
sometimes not apologies at all, but we see the, the Almighty dollar,

321
00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:22.180
which is both distressing and also we know it's meaningful.

322
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.050
But the problem is in order for that Esperanto to work,

323
00:19:26.051 --> 00:19:30.600
it has to stay the same meaning to both sides. Which for John Tracy lawyer,

324
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.690
the claim wasn't really about the money at all or not just about the money.

325
00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.100
It was as much about the envelope that the money was in or that there was a real

326
00:19:39.101 --> 00:19:39.510
person

327
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.300
<v 6>there to hand it to them. I wasn't the one who rated their house.</v>

328
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:46.740
I wasn't the one who killed their daughter, but most of them,

329
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.850
they, you know, just wanted to look at somebody who's in a uniform and say,

330
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.250
you really messed with my life.

331
00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:54.560
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

332
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.420
<v 6>And that opportunity is exactly what Abdula LTC</v>

333
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.170
[inaudible] we'll never get to that. I love that too.

334
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:07.410
That his son was killed by a drone. He never saw operated by a man.

335
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.910
He'll never meet on behalf of the country.

336
00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:11.190
That still doesn't admit it was a mistake.

337
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:16.500
And so the money he got Kinda the Anti Bill [inaudible] Ah, come on. Ha.

338
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.550
My America feud,

339
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.970
which in the end he says was the equivalent of 30,000 US dollars.

340
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:24.450
Way more than anyone got in Iraq or Afghanistan. Still.

341
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:29.150
All he can do without anything else to go on is just compare it mountains.

342
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.910
[inaudible] or he can accept that only if, if, if,

343
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.440
if he gets, you know, the like the payment equal to those,

344
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:48.140
you know, [inaudible]

345
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.990
<v 10>do leg in America. How you can be, say someone. Yeah.</v>

346
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.130
<v 9>Oh, Ooh.</v>

347
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:56.480
<v 10>Lost his son, for example, killed if the payment was, if the payment was equal.</v>

348
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.463
Yeah.

349
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.793
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

350
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.860
