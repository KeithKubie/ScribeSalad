and synthetic biology and when anybody

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
and synthetic biology and when anybody
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.660
and synthetic biology and when anybody
can do it it means that a lot of the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
can do it it means that a lot of the
 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.789
can do it it means that a lot of the
illegal trades right the bottoms just

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
illegal trades right the bottoms just
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.679
illegal trades right the bottoms just
fallen out and what happens then we have

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
fallen out and what happens then we have
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.370

foreign dignitaries so the United States

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
foreign dignitaries so the United States
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.229
foreign dignitaries so the United States
is already on the offense when it comes

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239
is already on the offense when it comes
 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.180

to genetics I'd be very very surprised

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
to genetics I'd be very very surprised
 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.580
to genetics I'd be very very surprised
if other countries weren't doing the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590
if other countries weren't doing the
 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.580
if other countries weren't doing the
same back at us and it's going to become

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590
same back at us and it's going to become
 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.000
same back at us and it's going to become
more more of an issue so you know right

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
more more of an issue so you know right
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.890
more more of an issue so you know right
now we have to worry about all kinds of

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
now we have to worry about all kinds of
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.229
now we have to worry about all kinds of
assassinations by bullets and by bombs

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239
assassinations by bullets and by bombs
 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.180
assassinations by bullets and by bombs
and things along those lines

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
and things along those lines
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.880
and things along those lines
with what's coming I can make a disease

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
with what's coming I can make a disease
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.860
with what's coming I can make a disease
I can make a disease that I spray into

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870
I can make a disease that I spray into
 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.800
I can make a disease that I spray into
the air you pass through it nobody else

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810
the air you pass through it nobody else
 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.449
the air you pass through it nobody else
gets sick and you get a slow

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459
gets sick and you get a slow
 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.160
gets sick and you get a slow
neurodegenerative disease say that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
neurodegenerative disease say that
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.690
neurodegenerative disease say that
unfolds over a couple years

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
unfolds over a couple years
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.250
unfolds over a couple years
nobody even knows you've been attacked

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260
nobody even knows you've been attacked
 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.319
nobody even knows you've been attacked
right they think you've just gotten sick

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329
right they think you've just gotten sick
 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.069
right they think you've just gotten sick
so we're looking at a whole new kind of

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079
so we're looking at a whole new kind of
 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.599
so we're looking at a whole new kind of
assassination and to think that you know

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609
assassination and to think that you know
 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.160
assassination and to think that you know
terrorists aren't going to be interested

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170
terrorists aren't going to be interested
 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.410
terrorists aren't going to be interested
in this technology is ridiculous every

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
in this technology is ridiculous every
 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.520
in this technology is ridiculous every
time there's a new technology criminals

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530
time there's a new technology criminals
 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.990
time there's a new technology criminals
immediately take advantage of it and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000
immediately take advantage of it and
 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.449
immediately take advantage of it and
this is the next technology so we're
