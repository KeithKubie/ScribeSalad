00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.440
- I never wanted to do an episodic sitcom.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.860
In fact, it's a secret
that has finally come out.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.450
I was asked to play the role of Frasier.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.120
I turned it down 'cause I
didn't want to do a sitcom.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.950
Then along came this pitch meeting

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.593
for 3rd Rock From The Sun.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.700
Bonnie and Terry Turner,
this husband-and-wife

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.430
comedy writing team who created 3rd Rock,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.430
they had been on the writing
staff of Saturday Night Live

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.830
two of the three times I was
a guest host in the 1980s.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.210
So they wrote comic revue
material that I performed,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.573
and they saw me as a comic,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.020
and they became very good friends.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.467
My agent called me one day and said,

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:48.287
"Your friends from New York,
Bonnie and Terry Turner,

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:50.400
"want to have breakfast with you."

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.724
And I thought, great!

00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:52.640
(audience laughing)

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.120
I'd love to see them!

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.430
So I went off thinking this
was a social engagement,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.090
and there were Bonnie and Terry

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.980
and Carsey and Werner and Caryn Mandabach,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.480
all these big-shot Hollywood
television producers

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.650
at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.918
And I thought, oh my
god, I've been ambushed.

00:01:11.918 --> 00:01:12.980
(audience laughing)

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.493
This is a pitch.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.140
Course, they got around to saying

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.530
what they wanted at breakfast about.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.957
They said, "Terry, why
don't you tell him?"

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.927
"Well, we're developing this series

00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:26.896
"about these four aliens."

00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:29.400
(audience laughing)

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.107
And I thought, "How am I just gonna say no

00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:36.020
"as graciously as I can
and get out of here?"

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.210
Within five minutes, he persuaded me

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.590
to be in 3rd Rock From The Sun,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.220
because, just exactly what you said,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.730
it was an opportunity to surprise people

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.580
and be far, far more than any one thing,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.500
even though it's only one character.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.810
These were aliens who
were trying to figure out

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.533
how to be humans, so they kept
trying different approaches,

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:02.790
and trying to plumb the depths
of different human mysteries.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.800
Well, that's what we're all doing,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.440
and doing it in this
hilarious comedy context

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.980
with this great premise that allowed me,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.353
a character actor, to just
do everything, week by week.
