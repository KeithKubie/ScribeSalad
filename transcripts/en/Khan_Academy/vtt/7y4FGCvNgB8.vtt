00:00:00.343 --> 00:00:03.122
- [Instructor] We are
told that triangle ABC,

00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:07.407
which is right over here,
is reflected across line l,

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:10.417
so it's reflected across
line l right over here,

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:13.933
to get to triangle A
prime B prime C prime.

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.995
Fair enough.

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:18.062
So based on that, they're
going to ask us some questions.

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:19.435
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:21.448
and see if you can figure out
the answers to these questions

00:00:21.448 --> 00:00:24.132
on your own before I work through them.

00:00:24.132 --> 00:00:25.368
So the first question they say

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:27.658
is well, what's A prime C prime?

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:31.284
This is really what's the length
of segment A prime C prime?

00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:35.092
So they want the length
of this right over here.

00:00:35.092 --> 00:00:37.174
How do we figure that out?

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:40.741
Well, the key realization
here is a reflection

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.908
is a rigid transformation.

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:48.049
Rigid transformation,
which is a very fancy word.

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.227
But it's really just saying
that it's a transformation

00:00:51.227 --> 00:00:56.155
where the length between
corresponding points don't change.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:58.923
If we're talking about
a shape like a triangle,

00:00:58.923 --> 00:01:01.442
the angle measures won't change,

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:05.015
the perimeter won't change,
and the area won't change.

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:07.702
So we're gonna use the
fact that the length

00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:10.140
between corresponding points won't change.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.293
So the length between A prime and C prime

00:01:12.293 --> 00:01:16.274
is gonna be the same as
the length between A and C.

00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:20.527
So A prime C prime is
going to be equal to AC,

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:23.030
which is equal to they
tell us right over there.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.443
That's this corresponding
side of the triangle.

00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:27.237
That has a length of three.

00:01:27.237 --> 00:01:28.696
So we answered the first question.

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:30.027
And maybe that gave you a good clue.

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:32.582
And so I encourage you
to keep pausing the video

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:34.919
when you feel like you
can have a go at it.

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:36.793
Alright, the next question is

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:39.404
what is the measure of angle B prime?

00:01:39.404 --> 00:01:41.471
So that's this angle right over here.

00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:44.280
And we're gonna use the
exact same property.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.349
Angle B prime corresponds to angle B.

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:51.152
It underwent a rigid
transformation of a reflection.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.812
This would also be true
if we had a translation,

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:56.420
or if we had a rotation.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.231
And so right over here, the
measure of angle B prime

00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:01.785
would be the same as
the measure of angle B.

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:03.901
But what is that going to be equal to?

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.584
Well, we can use the fact
that if we call that measure,

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:08.479
let's just call that X.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.893
X plus 53 degrees, we'll
do it all in degrees,

00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:16.266
plus 90 degrees, this right angle here.

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:18.212
Well, the sum of the
interior angles of a triangle

00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:20.674
add up to 180 degrees.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:21.689
And so what do we have?

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.430
We could subtract, let's
see, 53 plus 90 is X,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.847
plus 143 degrees is equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:34.026
And so subtract 143
degrees from both sides.

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:36.939
You will get X is equal to, let's see,

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.022
180 minus 40 would be 40.

00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:43.820
80 minus 43 would be 37 degrees.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.643
X is equal to 37 degrees,
so that is 37 degrees.

00:02:47.643 --> 00:02:49.172
If that's 37 degrees,

00:02:49.172 --> 00:02:52.167
then this is also going to be 37 degrees.

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:56.334
Next, they ask us what is
the area of triangle ABC?

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.110
ABC.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.338
Well, it's gonna have the same area

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:02.449
as A prime B prime C prime.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.855
And so a couple of ways
we could think about it.

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:07.866
We could try to find the area
of A prime B prime C prime

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:09.084
based on the fact that we already know

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:12.238
that this length is three
and this is a right triangle.

00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:14.507
Or we can use the fact that

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:18.110
this length right over here,
four, from A prime to B prime

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.468
is gonna be the same thing as
this length right over here,

00:03:20.468 --> 00:03:23.464
from A prime to B prime, which is four.

00:03:23.464 --> 00:03:24.559
And so the area of this triangle,

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:25.680
especially this is a right triangle,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.715
it's quite straightforward,

00:03:26.715 --> 00:03:29.843
it's the base times the height times 1/2.

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:34.771
So this area is gonna be
1/2 times the base, four,

00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:39.164
times the height, three,
which is equal to 1/2 of 12,

00:03:39.164 --> 00:03:42.376
which is equal to six square units.

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:43.628
And then last but not least,

00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:48.276
what's the perimeter of triangle
A prime B prime C prime?

00:03:48.276 --> 00:03:50.200
Well, here we just used
the Pythagorean Theorem

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.103
to figure out the length
of this hypotenuse.

00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:56.441
And we know that this is a length of three

00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:58.679
based on the whole rigid transformation

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:00.249
and lengths are preserved.

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:02.270
And so you might immediately recognize

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.117
that if you have a right triangle

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:05.456
where one side is three
and the other side is four,

00:04:05.456 --> 00:04:07.405
that the hypotenuse is five.

00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:09.014
Three four five triangles.

00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:10.593
Or you could just the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:13.926
You say three squared plus four squared,

00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:18.020
four squared is equal to let's just say

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.937
the hypotenuse squared.

00:04:21.384 --> 00:04:24.927
Well, three squared plus four
squared, that's nine plus 16.

00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:28.094
25 is equal to the hypotenuse squared.

00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:33.172
And so the hypotenuse right
over here will be equal to five.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.304
And so they're not asking us
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:36.453
They wanna know the perimeter.

00:04:36.453 --> 00:04:39.659
So it's gonna be four
plus three plus five,

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.904
which is equal to 12.

00:04:41.904 --> 00:04:43.911
The perimeter of either
of those triangles,

00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:45.814
because it's just one's
the image of the other

00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:47.263
under a rigid transformation.

00:04:47.263 --> 00:04:49.456
They're gonna have the same
perimeter, the same area.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.472
The perimeter of either
of the triangles is 12.

00:04:51.472 --> 00:04:54.343
The area of either of
the triangles is six.

00:04:54.343 --> 00:04:55.593
And we're done.
