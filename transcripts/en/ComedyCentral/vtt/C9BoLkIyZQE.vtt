she would screw up my stomach.

I used to get diarrhea
when she would look at me,

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:29.015
or she would twirl her hair,
or smile at me.

And on Monday--Monday,
Wednesday, Fridays,

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:48.201
we would pick up Katie, and on
Tuesdays and Thursdays,

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:50.369
they would pick me up, and we
would go to school together,

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:53.406
Angel Elementary School,
and I remember one day

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.875
she was looking really cute,
and we picked her up

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:58.377
in our red Chevy Lumina, and
she got in--

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.414
she got into the van, and I had
to go diarrhea right then,

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:06.319
so I went--I went into her
house and had diarrhea

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:08.354

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.523

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.828
She was just very sweet.

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:18.097
She was very nice.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.533
I remember her mom was just a
bigger Katie.

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:24.170
She had this big laugh, and she
was very generous and kind.

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.039
She would drive 25 minutes to
the Asian market,

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:30.076
and she would get these amazing
wasabi peas

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.446
and sesame crackers, and Katie
would always offer me

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.549
some of the sesame crackers,
and one day she handed me

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.417
a whole bag, and I took one,
and I handed it back.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.253
She said, "No, this is from my
mother and I.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:41.687
This is--we just want you to
have your own bag."

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.556
And why do I remember this?

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:47.059
This was--this was 27 years
ago,

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:48.794
and it affected me so much.

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:51.030

Nothing was my own.

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:53.566
If you're from a big family,
nothing is yours.

My winter jacket was, like, 23
years old by the time I got it.

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:02.041
There was other--six cousins
and every sibling.

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:05.311
There was other things in the
pockets when I got my jacket.

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:09.215
And I remember that she gave me
my own bag of sesame crackers.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:12.251
This is how--this is how sweet
she was.

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:15.821
And...
Saturdays, I played soccer.

00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:18.591
Now,
I'm a very competitive person.

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.293
I've been fortunate
athletically.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.261
I played professional tennis
for four years.

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:24.230
I'm not telling you this to
sound like an asshole.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.833
I'm telling you this because it
relates to the story.

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:29.502
Sports is something I was good
at.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:32.905
And Katie shows up to
my soccer game with her mom.

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:34.674
Saturday morning.
Here comes Katie.

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:37.677
Here comes her mom.
This is--this is it.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.078
Here's the girl I like,

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:42.448
and here's the thing
I'm good at.

00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:44.684
I scored six goals that day.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.453
I scored one goal as a goalie,
okay?

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:48.954
Now...

00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:50.856
do you know how selfish
you have to be

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.825
with the ball

00:04:52.858 --> 00:04:57.029
to score as a goalie?

00:04:57.062 --> 00:05:01.300
My father asked the coach to
take me out of the game.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:04.303
Dads ask the coach to put their
son in the game.

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:06.005
But this was...you know,

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:08.474
I was trying to impress Katie,
okay?

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:12.178
Now, in my house, my mom
invented this thing

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.714
called the special plate, okay?

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:16.315
The special plate is a real
plate

00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:19.552
that you eat off of when you
achieve something

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.687
or you have success.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.457
This is not a fucking joke.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.025
[laughter]

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:28.627
It's a plate.
It has balloons on it.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.197
It say, "Hip, hip, hooray.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.733
We're proud of you for being in
our family."

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.802
This is a real thing.

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:38.838
And when you score six goals,
one as a goalie,

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:41.173
you get to eat off the special
plate, okay?

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:42.908
If you got an A on your
spelling test,

00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:44.977
you got to eat off the special
plate.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.980
And, you know, it sounds great,
but as you get older

00:05:48.013 --> 00:05:50.716
and you experience therapy, you
go,

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.151
"Oh, this was kind of fucked
up."

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:54.019
This was all outcome-based.

00:05:54.052 --> 00:05:57.723
This was all achievement and
success-based, right?

00:05:57.756 --> 00:05:59.158
And my dad used to just give
himself

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:01.527
the special plate sometimes.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.730
Like, "Oh, work was tough,"
special plate.

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:07.933
No, you can't just...

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:10.503
Anyways, I scored six, one as a
goalie,

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:13.739
and...

00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:15.841
did you guys hear that it was
six, one as a goalie,

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:18.744
back here?

00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:22.114
And--hold on.
My mouth is dry.

00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:24.917
Talking about Katie affects me
physically.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.788
[laughter]

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.623
So, Monday comes around,
school,

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.057
and guess
who doesn't give a shit

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.094
that I did six goals,
one as a goalie?

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:36.762
Katie's not impressed.

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:39.064
Didn't even realize it,
I don't think.

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:41.066
You know, and this baffles me.

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.303
I mean, as someone that's
coming from a family

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:47.106
that's very focused on result
and outcome,

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.241
it frustrated me, but now, you
know, you understand it.

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:50.976
That wasn't what
her family was into.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.412
Her mom would go adopt the dogs

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:55.748
and bring kids to the
children's hospital.

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:57.650
This wasn't, like,

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:00.252
their big focus.

00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:01.921
And I was bummed
that she wasn't into it.

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:03.989
It was, you know, her loss,
as I saw it.

00:07:04.022 --> 00:07:07.960
And...now, science projects
were coming up.

00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:09.562
And this was--this was big,

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:13.599
because I sat next diagonally
from Katie T.

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:14.800
in Mrs. Kelce's fourth grade.

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:16.769
Anyone else have Mrs. Kelce?

00:07:16.802 --> 00:07:17.770
[light cheering, laughter]

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:20.005
Yeah.
And...

00:07:20.038 --> 00:07:21.574
Mrs. Kelce would pair you up

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.509
with your science project
partner diagonally.

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:25.478
That's just how
she always did it, okay?

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.446
It was no guarantee, but I
felt like it was gonna happen,

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.248
so once I got paired
with Katie,

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:31.083
we'd have ample time together,
that's great.

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:33.519
Now, I had weird Josh Barter
sitting to my right

00:07:33.552 --> 00:07:36.789
and then annoying Lindsay was
across from me, okay?

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:38.424
And Mrs. Kelce says,

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:39.959
"Someone has to make
an announcement in class."

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:42.461
And Katie sheepishly walks

00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:45.297
up to the front of the class
and she says--

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.966
she starts to talk,
but she can't talk.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.667
She's crying.
She's too sad.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.636
And she runs to Mrs. Kelce,
and Mrs. Kelce hugs her

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:53.005
and says, "Katie's mom is sick,

00:07:53.038 --> 00:07:54.540
"and she's in the hospital,

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:56.308
and Katie's gonna be
missing some school."

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:57.943
And it was very sad.
And we were all sad.

00:07:57.976 --> 00:08:00.179
And we made
one of those giant cards

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:01.647
that you make, you know--

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.115
well, the Asian kid designs it,

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:06.118
and then everyone else
kinda...signs it.

00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:08.988
And we sent it off
to Katie's mom.

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:11.156
And...so the next day,

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.659
Mrs. Kelce's assigning science
projects,

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:15.294
but there's a wrinkle, okay?

00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:18.063
Weird Josh Barter isn't there,
okay?

00:08:18.096 --> 00:08:19.565
Turns out he left.

00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:21.367
Do you remember the kid that
just left...

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.168
[laughter]

00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:24.336
And nobody gave a shit?

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:26.639
There was--there was no cake.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.073
There was no card.

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:29.542
And he was weird, Josh.

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.477
He--one time I looked in his
backpack,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.579
and there was, like, a shotgun
shell in there,

00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:34.847
and you're like...

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.082
So he's gone, so now what
happens?

00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:39.184
I--I should still be paired up
with Katie T.,

00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:41.020
but who's with annoying
Lindsay, right?

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:42.555
Nobody.

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:46.358
So Mrs. Kelce starts pairing
us off, okay?

00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:48.360
And she's doing it diagonally,
thank God.

00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:51.096
So this is gonna get me some
ample time with Katie T.

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:53.699
Maybe I can figure out the
whole diarrhea thing.

00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:57.403
And she gets to Katie,

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:59.271
and maybe it's 'cause
Katie's mom is sick--

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:02.575
I don't know what it was--
but she says to Katie,

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:04.543
"Katie, you can pick
who you wanna--

00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:06.879
you wanna be with Lindsay,
you wanna be with Michael."

00:09:06.912 --> 00:09:09.214
You know, and I'm like,
well, that's--that's...

00:09:09.247 --> 00:09:11.550
you know, pretty bullshit,
but...

00:09:11.583 --> 00:09:13.085
[laughter]

00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:15.721
But I'm still--
I'm still confident.

00:09:15.754 --> 00:09:18.724
You know, I scored six goals,
one as a goalie.

00:09:18.757 --> 00:09:23.395
Like, why would she not--
why would she not pick me?

00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:25.230
I'm from--I'm a Kosta.
Kostas are winners.

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:28.133
That's how we've been--you
know.

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:33.138
We'll eat off the special plate
together.

00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:37.076
And Katie--Katie is...

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:38.444
very happy that she gets to
pick,

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.878
'caused nobody else get to
pick.

00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:44.883
And she picks...
Lindsay.

00:09:44.916 --> 00:09:48.621
She picks fuckin' Lindsay...

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.055
[laughter]

00:09:50.088 --> 00:09:52.925
To be
her science project partner.

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.593
Annoying...

00:09:54.626 --> 00:09:57.796
short...

00:09:57.829 --> 00:10:00.065
fat Lindsay,
and you can't--

00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:01.834
you could say that then.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:05.270
This was 27 years ago, where
you were allowed to fat shame,

00:10:05.303 --> 00:10:06.939
so don't think of it from this
year.

00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:10.743
Put it through '89.

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:13.112
And I was--I was broken.

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:16.849
I mean, I...I can
actually feel it right now.

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:18.851
And this is crazy to me, right,

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.953
but it--it hurt.

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:22.855
It--I felt vulnerable.

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:26.258
I didn't even know what that
word meant, and I felt that.

00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:27.826
I felt a loss.

00:10:27.859 --> 00:10:29.294
I don't lose, you know.

00:10:29.327 --> 00:10:30.963
I scored six,
one as a goalie, and...

00:10:30.996 --> 00:10:32.965
[laughter]

00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:34.633
I didn't know what to do.

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:35.768
I'm ten also.

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.469
Don't forget that.

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:40.105
I'm ten, and I'm feeling
rejected, and I'm feeling hurt.

00:10:40.138 --> 00:10:43.342
And I took that pain

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:45.144
and I took that rejection

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:46.679
and I took that feeling
that I did not like

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:48.981
and was uncomfortable with
and I spoke.

00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:52.284
And I said as loud as I could
to her and everyone,

00:10:52.317 --> 00:10:54.887
I said, "I hope your mom dies
in the hospital."

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.891
[crowd oohs]

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:02.194
[laughter]

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:06.832
Now...

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:09.001
this...

00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:11.070
now...

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:14.073
[laughter]

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:18.043
Now I know,
but--but then,

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:20.846
this was the first
of many times

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:23.649
where my mouth would
get me in a lot of trouble.

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.250
Okay?

00:11:25.283 --> 00:11:27.252
I mean, here I am at a strip
club telling a story

00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:31.223
to strangers, so...

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:33.258
And it was
a terrible thing to say,

00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:36.361
and as soon as I
said it, Katie withered.

00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:39.098
And she became a speck.

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:41.033
She--she started crying.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:44.937
She had--I had never seen
somebody so physically hurt.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.005
And...

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:50.542
Mrs. Kelce sent her down to
the nurse's office.

00:11:50.575 --> 00:11:52.377
I was sent down to the
principal's office.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.681
I walked real slow down there.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:57.883
You know, now it makes me think
of when I tell my dog

00:11:57.916 --> 00:12:00.119
to go into the cage, and he
kind of, like....

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:03.255
[laughter]

00:12:03.288 --> 00:12:05.557
You know, and we all remember
walking down to

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.560
the principal's office, and
even I at ten

00:12:08.593 --> 00:12:11.697
remember thinking, like, "God,
that was--that was dick."

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.534
You know?

00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:17.402
And I sat in the principal's
office,

00:12:17.435 --> 00:12:19.805
and I saw Katie with the nurse,
and she was broken.

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:21.607
I had--I had broken her.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.577
I had taken my pain, and I had
multiplied it by a thousand,

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.412
and I had dumped it on her,

00:12:27.445 --> 00:12:30.916
and it--
it's worse than that.

00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:33.552
Because three days later,
Katie's mother dies

00:12:33.585 --> 00:12:35.287
in the hospital.
[crowd groans]

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.289
This is not a joke.
This is not written.

00:12:37.322 --> 00:12:38.791
This is real.

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:41.293
This is a real story.

00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:43.896
And I have not spoken

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:45.931
to Katie since then.

00:12:45.964 --> 00:12:48.634
I regret that I said that.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:51.603
I've never apologized to her
or her family.

00:12:51.636 --> 00:12:53.839
And I realize
it's a little self-indulgent

00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:55.307
to put pain on someone

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.776
and then use it
as a performance piece...

00:12:57.809 --> 00:12:59.411
[laughter]

00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:03.015
To advance my comedy career.

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:04.616
But that's not what this is.

00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:07.352
I'm publicly here to say
to Katie that I'm sorry,

00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:08.687
and to her family, I'm sorry.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.355
and I regret that
I ever said that.

00:13:10.388 --> 00:13:12.624
Thank you very much.

00:13:12.657 --> 00:13:15.427
- Michael Kosta, everybody.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.130
[cheers and applause]
