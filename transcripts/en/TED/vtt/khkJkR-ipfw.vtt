00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:15.437
So, 2014 was a big year for me.

00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:16.627
Do you ever have that,

00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:18.896
just like a big year, like a banner year?

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:20.635
For me, it went like this:

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.958
October 3, I lost my second pregnancy.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:27.077
And then October 8, my dad died of cancer.

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:29.871
And then on November 25,
my husband Aaron died

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.673
after three years
with stage-four glioblastoma,

00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:35.132
which is just a fancy word
for brain cancer.

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:37.972
So, I'm fun.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.012
(Laughter)

00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:43.877
People love to invite me out all the time.

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:45.307
Packed social life.

00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:48.395
Usually, when I talk
about this period of my life,

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:51.633
the reaction I get is essentially:

00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:53.592
(Sighs)

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:55.476
"I can't -- I can't imagine."

00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:58.595
But I do think you can.

00:00:59.696 --> 00:01:00.847
I think you can.

00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:02.238
And I think that you should

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.879
because, someday,
it's going to happen to you.

00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:09.561
Maybe not these specific losses
in this specific order or at this speed,

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:10.975
but like I said, I'm very fun

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:14.696
and the research
that I have seen will stun you:

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.330
everyone you love has
a 100 percent chance of dying.

00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:20.950
(Laughter)

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:22.545
And that's why you came to TED.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.631
(Laughter)

00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:27.967
(Applause)

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:30.022
So, since all of this loss happened,

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:34.339
I've made it a career
to talk about death and loss,

00:01:34.363 --> 00:01:36.783
not just my own,
because it's pretty easy to recap,

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:40.853
but the losses and tragedies
that other people have experienced.

00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:43.216
It's a niche, I have to say.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.981
(Laughter)

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.104
It's a small niche,
and I wish I made more money, but ...

00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:49.458
(Laughter)

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:52.593
I've written some very uplifting books,

00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:56.310
host a very uplifting podcast,
I started a little nonprofit.

00:01:56.334 --> 00:01:57.934
I'm just trying to do what I can

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.482
to make more people comfortable
with the uncomfortable,

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:03.640
and grief is so uncomfortable.

00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:07.831
It's so uncomfortable,
especially if it's someone else's grief.

00:02:09.323 --> 00:02:13.545
So part of that work is this group
that I started with my friend Moe,

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.791
who is also a widow;

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:17.350
we call it the Hot Young Widows Club.

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:18.748
(Laughter)

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:21.247
And it's real, we have membership cards

00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:22.644
and T-shirts.

00:02:23.272 --> 00:02:26.952
And when your person dies,
your husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend,

00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:28.967
literally don't care if you were married,

00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:31.742
your friends and your family
are just going to look around

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:34.122
through friends of friends
of friends of friends

00:02:34.146 --> 00:02:37.010
until they find someone
who's gone through something similar,

00:02:37.034 --> 00:02:39.395
and then they'll push you
towards each other

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.786
so you can talk amongst yourselves
and not get your sad on other people.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.969
(Laughter)

00:02:45.993 --> 00:02:47.394
So that's what we do.

00:02:47.418 --> 00:02:50.910
It's just a series of small groups,

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:54.483
where men, women, gay, straight,
married, partnered,

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:58.776
can talk about their dead person,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.046
and say the things

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.789
that the other people in their lives
aren't ready or willing to hear yet.

00:03:03.813 --> 00:03:06.291
Huge range of conversations.

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:08.103
Like, "My husband died two weeks ago,

00:03:08.127 --> 00:03:10.445
I can't stop thinking
about sex, is that normal?"

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:11.623
Yeah.

00:03:11.647 --> 00:03:13.696
"What if it's one
of the Property Brothers?"

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.266
Less normal, but I'll accept it.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.424
(Laughter)

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.751
Things like, "Look, when I'm out in public
and I see old people holding hands,

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:25.361
couples who have clearly
been together for decades,

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:27.712
and then I look at them and I imagine

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:29.982
all of the things they've been
through together,

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:31.545
the good things, the bad things,

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.640
the arguments they've had
over who should take out the trash ...

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:37.696
I just find my heart filled with rage."

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.721
(Laughter)

00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:40.552
And that example is personal to me.

00:03:42.077 --> 00:03:45.228
Most of the conversations
that we have in the group

00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:47.229
can and will just stay amongst ourselves,

00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:49.172
but there are things that we talk about

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:52.379
that the rest of the world --
the world that is grief-adjacent

00:03:52.403 --> 00:03:53.917
but not yet grief-stricken --

00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:55.847
could really benefit from hearing.

00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:57.149
And if you can't tell,

00:03:57.173 --> 00:04:01.553
I'm only interested in / capable
of unscientific studies,

00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:03.951
so what I did was go to
The Hot Young Widows Club

00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:08.585
and say, "Hello, friends, remember
when your person died?" They did.

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.094
"Do you remember all the things
people said to you?"

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:12.289
"Oh, yeah."

00:04:12.313 --> 00:04:14.076
"Which ones did you hate the most?"

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.307
I got a lot of comments, lot of answers,
people say a lot of things,

00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:19.931
but two rose to the top pretty quickly.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.140
"Moving on."

00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:26.171
Now, since 2014,

00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:30.243
I will tell you I have remarried
a very handsome man named Matthew,

00:04:30.267 --> 00:04:33.370
we have four children
in our blended family,

00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:36.887
we live in the suburbs
of Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:38.331
We have a rescue dog.

00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:39.662
(Laughter)

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:41.098
I drive a minivan,

00:04:41.122 --> 00:04:43.938
like the kind where doors open
and I don't even touch them.

00:04:43.962 --> 00:04:45.146
(Laughter)

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.363
Like, by any "mezhure," life is good.

00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:51.459
I've also never said "mezhure,"
I've never once said it that way.

00:04:51.483 --> 00:04:56.762
(Laughter)

00:04:56.786 --> 00:04:58.437
I don't know where that came from.

00:04:58.461 --> 00:05:00.222
(Laughter)

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:02.521
I've never heard
anyone else say it that way.

00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:04.522
It looks like it should be said that way,

00:05:04.546 --> 00:05:07.103
and that's why the English
language is trash, so ...

00:05:07.127 --> 00:05:08.181
(Laughter)

00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:10.331
So impressed with anyone
who, like, speaks it

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:13.228
in addition to a language
that makes sense -- good job.

00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:15.244
(Laughter)

00:05:15.268 --> 00:05:16.704
But by any measure ...

00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:18.228
(Laughter)

00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:23.402
By any measure, life is really,
really good, but I haven't "moved on."

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:27.109
I haven't moved on,
and I hate that phrase so much,

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:28.924
and I understand why other people do.

00:05:28.948 --> 00:05:30.098
Because what it says

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:34.710
is that Aaron's life and death
and love are just moments

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:38.537
that I can leave behind me --
and that I probably should.

00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:42.791
And when I talk about Aaron,
I slip so easily into the present tense,

00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:45.371
and I've always thought
that made we weird.

00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:47.819
And then I noticed that everybody does it.

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:52.762
And it's not because we are in denial
or because we're forgetful,

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:55.047
it's because the people
we love, who we've lost,

00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:57.229
are still so present for us.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.400
So, when I say, "Oh, Aaron is ..."

00:06:02.276 --> 00:06:04.521
It's because Aaron still is.

00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:07.871
And it's not in the way
that he was before,

00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:09.078
which was much better,

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:12.744
and it's not in the way that churchy
people try to tell me that he would be.

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:16.447
It's just that he's indelible,

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:20.047
and so he is present for me.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.760
Here,

00:06:21.784 --> 00:06:24.043
he's present for me in the work that I do,

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:26.675
in the child that we had together,

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.754
in these three other children I'm raising,

00:06:28.778 --> 00:06:31.564
who never met him,
who share none of his DNA,

00:06:31.588 --> 00:06:35.453
but who are only in my life
because I had Aaron

00:06:35.477 --> 00:06:37.143
and because I lost Aaron.

00:06:38.302 --> 00:06:40.653
He's present in my marriage to Matthew,

00:06:40.677 --> 00:06:43.882
because Aaron's life and love and death

00:06:43.906 --> 00:06:46.572
made me the person
that Matthew wanted to marry.

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:50.829
So I've not moved on from Aaron,

00:06:50.853 --> 00:06:53.694
I've moved forward with him.

00:06:56.925 --> 00:07:02.574
(Applause)

00:07:02.995 --> 00:07:07.662
We spread Aaron's ashes
in his favorite river in Minnesota,

00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:09.193
and when the bag was empty --

00:07:09.217 --> 00:07:13.938
because when you're cremated,
you fit into a plastic bag --

00:07:13.962 --> 00:07:16.882
there were still ashes
stuck to my fingers.

00:07:16.906 --> 00:07:19.993
And I could have just put my hands
in the water and rinsed them,

00:07:20.017 --> 00:07:22.823
but instead, I licked my hands clean,

00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:27.339
because I was so afraid of losing more
than I had already lost,

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:31.426
and I was so desperate to make sure
that he would always be a part of me.

00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:34.104
But of course he would be.

00:07:34.878 --> 00:07:39.339
Because when you watch your person
fill himself with poison for three years,

00:07:39.363 --> 00:07:42.023
just so he can stay alive
a little bit longer with you,

00:07:42.047 --> 00:07:43.791
that stays with you.

00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:49.846
When you watch him fade from the healthy
person he was the night you met

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.453
to nothing, that stays with you.

00:07:51.477 --> 00:07:54.314
When you watch your son,
who isn't even two years old yet,

00:07:54.338 --> 00:07:57.029
walk up to his father's bed
on the last day of his life,

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:59.323
like he knows what's coming
in a few hours,

00:07:59.347 --> 00:08:04.363
and say, "I love you. All done. Bye, bye."

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:07.751
That stays with you.

00:08:09.347 --> 00:08:14.037
Just like when you fall in love,
finally, like really fall in love

00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:16.403
with someone who gets you and sees you

00:08:16.427 --> 00:08:19.524
and you even see, "Oh, my God,
I've been wrong this entire time.

00:08:19.548 --> 00:08:24.332
Love is not a contest
or a reality show -- it's so quiet,

00:08:24.356 --> 00:08:28.045
it's this invisible thread of calm
that connects the two of us

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:29.837
even when everything is chaos,

00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:32.787
when things are falling apart,
even when he's gone."

00:08:34.474 --> 00:08:36.743
That stays with you.

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.329
We used to do this thing --

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.988
because my hands are always
freezing and he's so warm,

00:08:43.012 --> 00:08:46.424
where I would take my ice-cold hands
and shove them up his shirt ...

00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:48.895
press them against his hot bod.

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:50.982
(Laughter)

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:53.920
And he hated it so much,

00:08:53.944 --> 00:08:54.965
(Laughter)

00:08:54.989 --> 00:08:56.347
but he loved me,

00:08:56.371 --> 00:09:01.228
and after he died,
I laid in bed with Aaron

00:09:01.252 --> 00:09:03.656
and I put my hands underneath him

00:09:05.355 --> 00:09:07.845
and I felt his warmth.

00:09:10.374 --> 00:09:13.881
And I can't even tell you
if my hands were cold,

00:09:13.905 --> 00:09:15.461
but I can tell you

00:09:15.485 --> 00:09:18.413
that I knew it was the last time
I would ever do that.

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:23.409
And that that memory
is always going to be sad.

00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:25.666
That memory will always hurt.

00:09:26.051 --> 00:09:28.895
Even when I'm 600 years old
and I'm just a hologram.

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:31.196
(Laughter)

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:37.897
Just like the memory of meeting him
is always going to make me laugh.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.654
Grief doesn't happen in this vacuum,

00:09:41.678 --> 00:09:48.146
it happens alongside of and mixed in
with all of these other emotions.

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:54.572
So, I met Matthew, my current husband --

00:09:54.596 --> 00:09:56.468
who doesn't love that title,

00:09:56.492 --> 00:10:00.270
(Laughter)

00:10:00.713 --> 00:10:02.189
but it's so accurate.

00:10:02.213 --> 00:10:04.823
(Laughter)

00:10:05.935 --> 00:10:08.283
I met Matthew, and ...

00:10:09.577 --> 00:10:12.908
there was this audible sigh of relief
among the people who love me,

00:10:12.932 --> 00:10:15.354
like, "It's over!

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.830
She did it.

00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:21.537
She got a happy ending,
we can all go home.

00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:23.562
And we did good."

00:10:23.586 --> 00:10:26.609
And that narrative
is so appealing even to me,

00:10:26.633 --> 00:10:30.475
and I thought maybe
I had gotten that, too, but I didn't.

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:33.037
I got another chapter.

00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:37.006
And it's such a good chapter --
I love you, honey --

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.775
it's such a good chapter.

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:43.280
But especially at the beginning,
it was like an alternate universe,

00:10:43.304 --> 00:10:46.462
or one of those old "choose your
own adventure" books from the '80s

00:10:46.486 --> 00:10:48.414
where there are two parallel plot lines.

00:10:48.438 --> 00:10:50.032
So I opened my heart to Matthew,

00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:53.820
and my brain was like,
"Would you like to think about Aaron?

00:10:54.409 --> 00:10:58.409
Like, the past, the present, future,
just get in there," and I did.

00:10:59.052 --> 00:11:02.141
And all of a sudden,
those two plots were unfurling at once,

00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:05.752
and falling in love with Matthew
really helped me realize the enormity

00:11:05.776 --> 00:11:07.842
of what I lost when Aaron died.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.843
And just as importantly,

00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:14.617
it helped me realize
that my love for Aaron

00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:16.752
and my grief for Aaron,

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:21.307
and my love for Matthew,
are not opposing forces.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.480
They are just strands to the same thread.

00:11:26.111 --> 00:11:27.644
They're the same stuff.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.246
I'm ... what would my parents say?

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.809
I'm not special.

00:11:35.645 --> 00:11:36.660
(Laughter)

00:11:36.684 --> 00:11:39.220
They had four kids,
they were like ... frankly.

00:11:39.244 --> 00:11:41.029
(Laughter)

00:11:41.053 --> 00:11:42.821
But I'm not, I'm not special.

00:11:42.845 --> 00:11:44.903
I know that, I'm fully aware

00:11:44.927 --> 00:11:47.434
that all day, every day,
all around the world,

00:11:47.458 --> 00:11:49.236
terrible things are happening.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.411
All the time.

00:11:50.435 --> 00:11:52.180
Like I said, fun person.

00:11:52.204 --> 00:11:54.690
But terrible things are happening,

00:11:54.714 --> 00:12:01.108
people are experiencing deeply formative
and traumatic losses every day.

00:12:01.132 --> 00:12:03.720
And as part of my job,

00:12:03.744 --> 00:12:05.426
this weird podcast that I have,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.698
I sometimes talk to people

00:12:06.722 --> 00:12:09.706
about the worst thing
that's ever happened to them.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.761
And sometimes, that's the loss
of someone they love,

00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:17.475
sometimes days ago or weeks ago,
years ago, even decades ago.

00:12:18.373 --> 00:12:20.903
And these people that I interview,

00:12:20.927 --> 00:12:23.235
they haven't closed themselves
around this loss

00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:25.609
and made it the center of their lives.

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:30.212
They've lived, their worlds
have kept spinning.

00:12:31.478 --> 00:12:34.620
But they're talking to me,
a total stranger,

00:12:34.644 --> 00:12:36.579
about the person they love who has died,

00:12:36.603 --> 00:12:39.743
because these are the experiences

00:12:39.767 --> 00:12:44.854
that mark us and make us
just as much as the joyful ones.

00:12:45.355 --> 00:12:47.212
And just as permanently.

00:12:48.895 --> 00:12:51.466
Long after you get your last sympathy card

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.957
or your last hot dish.

00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:55.577
Like, we don't look
at the people around us

00:12:55.601 --> 00:13:00.100
experiencing life's joys and wonders
and tell them to "move on," do we?

00:13:00.124 --> 00:13:03.680
We don't send a card that's like,
"Congratulations on your beautiful baby,"

00:13:03.704 --> 00:13:07.395
and then, five years later, think like,
"Another birthday party? Get over it."

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.085
(Laughter)

00:13:09.109 --> 00:13:10.768
Yeah, we get it, he's five.

00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:12.220
(Laughter)

00:13:12.244 --> 00:13:13.418
Wow.

00:13:13.442 --> 00:13:14.592
(Laughter)

00:13:16.148 --> 00:13:18.164
But grief is kind of one of those things,

00:13:18.188 --> 00:13:21.967
like, falling in love or having a baby
or watching "The Wire" on HBO,

00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:26.073
where you don't get it
until you get it, until you do it.

00:13:27.219 --> 00:13:32.522
And once you do it,
once it's your love or your baby,

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:37.736
once it's your grief
and your front row at the funeral,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.910
you get it.

00:13:39.315 --> 00:13:43.451
You understand what you're experiencing
is not a moment in time,

00:13:43.475 --> 00:13:45.417
it's not a bone that will reset,

00:13:45.441 --> 00:13:48.307
but that you've been touched
by something chronic.

00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:50.117
Something incurable.

00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:52.997
It's not fatal, but sometimes
grief feels like it could be.

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:58.848
And if we can't prevent it in one another,

00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:00.189
what can we do?

00:14:02.554 --> 00:14:06.874
What can we do other than try
to remind one another

00:14:06.898 --> 00:14:09.604
that some things can't be fixed,

00:14:10.136 --> 00:14:13.318
and not all wounds are meant to heal?

00:14:14.493 --> 00:14:17.684
We need each other to remember,

00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:19.470
to help each other remember,

00:14:19.494 --> 00:14:22.263
that grief is this multitasking emotion.

00:14:22.287 --> 00:14:28.084
That you can and will be sad, and happy;
you'll be grieving, and able to love

00:14:28.108 --> 00:14:31.347
in the same year or week, the same breath.

00:14:32.982 --> 00:14:38.704
We need to remember that a grieving person
is going to laugh again and smile again.

00:14:39.498 --> 00:14:42.698
If they're lucky,
they'll even find love again.

00:14:43.697 --> 00:14:47.163
But yes, absolutely,
they're going to move forward.

00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:51.071
But that doesn't mean
that they've moved on.

00:14:52.253 --> 00:14:53.412
Thank you.

00:14:53.436 --> 00:15:00.078
(Applause)
