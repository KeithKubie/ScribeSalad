00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.919
in any one point in this conflict, 
how many people are pregnant

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:10.270
what happens when they're displaces, what happens to them 
and to their pregnancies? it's estimated that 25- 30% of women

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.610
and then what happens to...
what kind of care do they have access to?

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.239
women who are attacked, what happens to their family structure, 
what happens in their communities, what happens to them physically

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:22.390
and I just couldnâ€™t just stop thinking about it

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.090
I just wanted to figure out a way to help 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.589
or contribute in some way to the work that was being done

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.360
the hospital had various

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.330
forms in various ways of keeping records but
starting in about 2004, 2005 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.930
their records became more consistent

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.030
and their data collection became more consistent

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.380
and the forms that we looked at were the psycho-social intake forms

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.010
and 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.050
when a woman comes to Panzi hospital to
seek care for

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.720
herself after enduring sexual violence

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.000
she meets with a social worker

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.820
who does the intake form

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.400
some of it includes quantitative data, was the woman
married, demographics, widowed or abandoned, how many children,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.480
how old was she, level of education

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.610
and then there's more data about the incident
itself.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.150
what was the date of the incident

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.760
how many assailants

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.760
were involved

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.670
what time of day did this occur

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.440
where did this happen

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.500
and then following that information is a narrative
and that is

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.680
written down

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.060
in the words of the woman who's being interviewed

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.149
and then there is a psycho-social assessment

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.570
and so an assessment of the level of trauma
that the woman has experienced

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.040
there were 1,021 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.650
charts from 2006

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.650
for the past few months I've been

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.299
analyzing the data

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.469
and understanding more the relationships between

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.450
where did the attacks occur

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.259
what characteristics make

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.380
certain women more vulnerable

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.270
and a lot of information has come from the
study which has been useful

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.609
for directing programs and policy

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:13.270
we came back with the intention to the analyze
2005, 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.509
2007 and 2008

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.189
and so

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.300
we met with three Congolese

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.669
residents who have

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.999
experience with data entry and

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.629
are currently training them to enter in the
data.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.059
We looked at the charts for 2005
today and counted them

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:34.609
and there were

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.829
approximately 1200 charts just from 2005

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.239
so I'm suspecting it'll be about the same for
each year, 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.029
it's about probably about 35-3600

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.959
and those are just the women who came to Panzi,

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.789
and what about the women that can't reach Panzi,

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.439
have they sought care somewhere else, are they still at home

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:58.449
too ashamed or too

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.799
too upset to come in and

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.049
seek care

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.879
we only seeing the ones who have the means to be able to get to Panzi hospital
