1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,953
Yeah.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,860
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:05,790
just before Friday,

4
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:10,791
Monday morning podcast and
ahhh just checking in on you.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,670
How are you?
How was your week going?

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,690
What are you paying attention to when
the news that's causing you to yell at

7
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:23,350
people you don't know
online? Huh? What's going on?

8
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:25,150
Did you hear about this?

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,590
Somebody did this and
then someone said that,

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,410
and the results may surprise
you all fucking day. You know,

11
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:38,920
I walked through the God Damn airport
and I'm just looking at all these fucking

12
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:42,340
people looking on their phones
and you know what I see, I see me.

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,290
That's what I see. I'm
like, I'm doing that.

14
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,410
I'm just sitting there
staring at my fucking phone,

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,980
looking at somebody's flipping
a fucking water bottle.

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,090
Somebody fucking Duncan a basketball and
everybody running away like the world

17
00:00:57,161 --> 00:01:01,420
just ended somebody fucking
playing the drums. What am I doing?

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,733
You know,

19
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,220
I'd sit there and read a book,
you know, so I look smart,

20
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:11,990
but no one would even notice. They're
all fucking staring at their phone.

21
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:14,890
So what is the point of reading in public?

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,010
If other people can't even see you're
doing it because that's why you're doing

23
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,510
it, right. Nobody reads in public.

24
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,460
You what kind of a fuck you some fucking
asshole walking down the street with a

25
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,030
book. You know, you're just
across the street like we get it,

26
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:29,864
you're smart.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,090
MMM.
Well maybe you do read in public.

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,140
Maybe that's what you're supposed to do.

29
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,900
You read in public so you get
credit for it's everybody.

30
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,800
It's like that time back on the Seinfeld
episode with Jason Alexander wanted to

31
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,590
get credit for tipping. They didn't
seem so he reached back in to do it.

32
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,210
Then they thought he was stealing.

33
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,260
I think it's like the literary version
of that or maybe it isn't or maybe it is.

34
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,250
Um, anyways, I have something
to promote here. Um,

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,030
all things comedy network. I need you
guys to get behind this, you know,

36
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:07,120
if you feel like it and no pressure here.
Alright,

37
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,070
10 Alexandra has a new
special out that you can,

38
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,840
you can actually stream
it right now. Um, at uh,

39
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,240
ATC specials.com.

40
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,930
It's called a senior class of earth.

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,540
And Ted is just one of
those guys, man, I sweated.

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,820
He's just one of those comics
that every comic loves and uh,

43
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,510
but you know, you know,
this business is for awhile.

44
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,930
They like this person,
then they want this person.

45
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,020
And he just was never that person,
which I can relate to.

46
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,580
This industry was never looking for
a bald, redheaded mail, you know,

47
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,050
so I, I had to carve out
my own path. You're like,

48
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:50,290
how making his special about me and
my struggles. You know why that is?

49
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,820
Because I'm on social media all the time
and it's fucking frying my brain. Um,

50
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,720
do you guys could go on and check out
his special, it would be a be great.

51
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,060
You'd see. Great. There's

52
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,600
actually this fucking killer clip of one
of his jokes where he compares the fact

53
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,560
that he's in his late forties and his
girlfriend's in our early thirties and was

54
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:12,870
saying that, um, he was comparing
his sex drive versus hers,

55
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:16,950
which is in the prime to when Shaq
played on the Celtics where it was still

56
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,750
shack,
but it didn't look like Shaq anymore.

57
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,060
It took them like half the game
to warm up all of that stuff.

58
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:25,080
It's such a fucking killer joke.
And, uh, when you watch it,

59
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:30,081
what I love about Ted is
there's no wasted words.

60
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,250
And even like,

61
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,280
even like the physicality of his jokes
propels you towards the punchline. He's a,

62
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:42,180
he's an absolute master. So, uh,
please check that out. And with that,

63
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,720
and with that, did anybody watch
the Monday night football game bad?

64
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,283
Put it up,

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,360
put it over the Kansas City chiefs
against the fucking Denver Broncos

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,990
and um,
Jesus Christ.

67
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,680
I thought that announcer
was going to fucking faint.

68
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,000
I have never heard an announcer. So God
damn excited about a regular season game,

69
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,420
but that my home's,
he's like shove type Blah homes.

70
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,580
Captain Comeback.
Fuck something else.

71
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,780
Mo did everything that he did, like when
he was rolling. I'm not saying that guys,

72
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,810
and good, he's not going to be a fucking
star. One of the guys said, you know,

73
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:28,890
he came into the game as a legend.
He's been playing for a month.

74
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,163
Right?

75
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,340
Everybody flipping the fuck out. I know
why it's a God damn business. Right?

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,110
You know, Brady's fucking older than
dirt. This other fucking guy is like,

77
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:44,620
you know, uh, drew Brees. It's like
a year or two younger than Brady.

78
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,130
Yeah.
Peyton manning fucking were top so old.

79
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,150
I can't even get through these fucking
names without on a Peyton manning fucking

80
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:55,350
retired. They need new people. All right,

81
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,980
how many yards are these new people going
to throw for when you can't even like

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,510
start the hug them and then stop and do
the, you know, you know the me too thing.

83
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,560
Now we go to hug a friend of
yours and you start saying, oh,

84
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,050
well you get all fucking nervous.
You know,

85
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,520
that's the way defensive lineman grab
quarterbacks now and they still get a

86
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:15,270
fleck.
So anyways,

87
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:18,800
the guy fucking rolls out.
He's a right handed quarterbacks.

88
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,180
He rolls out to his left,
this guys breathing down his neck.

89
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:25,350
He dives at his ankles and right
before, uh, my home's goes down,

90
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,460
he switched the ball to his left
hand and threw it like four yards in.

91
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:33,120
This guy caught it, which I, I've
saw Brett Farve too, that I've seen.

92
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,370
[inaudible] I've seen people do
that before on this guys, I gone,

93
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,000
I hope you realize what you just saw here.

94
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,730
I think the NFL game, uh,
he'll like, listen man,

95
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,890
you got to hype this fucking Kiddo.
Okay.

96
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,210
You gonna have to hype this fucking
kid up. And as always, you know, I'm,

97
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:53,760
I'm the fucking Grinch.
A sports don't ever listen to me.

98
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:56,550
I'm always telling everybody to
fucking relax and not be excited.

99
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,920
I'm taken all the fun out of it.
But Kansas City, as of right now,

100
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,650
he has the worst defense in all of
football and everybody's freaking the fuck

101
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,030
out.
I mean,

102
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,760
they should be freaking out cause my
homes is looking like the real deal,

103
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:14,600
but it's just like you're not, you
don't, if you don't fix that problem,

104
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,250
you're not going to do shit in January.

105
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,880
Yeah.

106
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,970
So I dunno what all this
screaming and yelling is about.

107
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,200
I hope you guys realize what part,
what I just said here on this podcast.

109
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,350
People go,

110
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,530
that was like one of the greatest Monday
night football games of all it is like

111
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:37,100
was it seemed like what happens every
time I sit down to watch a game,

112
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,670
somebody up by 10 and then goes into
a fucking shit, I don't know what.

113
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:44,990
And then they lose the game when I
was a kid. Like that didn't happen.

114
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,640
Like it happens all the fucking time.

115
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,630
One of the greatest
modern guides of all time.

116
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,520
It reminded me of three regular season
games I saw the day before. You know,

117
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,181
if that was,

118
00:06:56,181 --> 00:07:00,200
what about the fucking Bengals falcons
like that wasn't I guess cause it didn't

119
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:04,800
happen on Monday. I Dunno.
Why am I such a jerk?

120
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,390
I have no idea. Um,
anyways, well, you know,

121
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,400

fucking insane Chinese food, uh,

135

I started acting like I'm 22 years old.
The way I'm eating,

141
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,490
which somehow back in the day,
you know,

142
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,600
you'd go out and drink a 12 pack and then
hit Mcdonald's at the end of the night

143
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:33,600
and go home and the next morning
just wake up and go unload trucks.

144
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,840
His stomach was flat, you know, you
just shook it off back then. You know,

145
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,740
it's like doing your first burnout in
a brand new car, like the car getting,

146
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,840
you know, probably wished you didn't
do it. Probably not happy it did it,

147
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,760
but it can shake it off. It's
still looks new, you know,

148
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,070
now I tried to do that shit. There's
like fucking parts left in the road.

149
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,120
Um,

150
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,953
anyways,

151
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,260
so it's so Ba October and
I wasn't going to do it,

152
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,650
but now I'm going to do it.
Oh, well fuck it, do it.

153
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,270
You know, I'm a binge drinker. I
gotta stop with this shit. You know,

154
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,040
I'll do it. So now I'm on the wagon,
a lump date, but they [inaudible] do,

155
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,950
you know,
it's funny as peep,

156
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,510
there's like two different ways of saying
you're on the wagon. There's like, um,

157
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,370
you know, like, uh, you're on the
party wagon or your, your your,

158
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,320
whenever I'm, the way I say
it, if I'm on the wagon,

159
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,150
that always meant like you're not on,
you're not party. He fell off the wagon,

160
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,750
meant you started partying again.
But then other people call the wagon,

161
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:46,920
the party wagon. So I dunno, it's
just one of those things, you know,

162
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,850
it's kind of like that word
cock with white people.

163
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,480
It met Dick and with book black, older
black people, I should say it meant pussy.

164
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,660
You know, just a complete inverse. I mean,

165
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,440
it's sort of an extreme example,
but

166
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,920
I remember saying that
in the writer's room

167
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,630
and an f is for family and they
were like, that's not true, is it?

168
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:13,620
And then they end up having this fucking
snoop Dogg song from the early nineties

169
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,700
where you first do a
woman's pussy as his cock.

170
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:24,090
So fucking weird. Oh, people, people
have different ways of saying things,

171
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:27,450
don't they? That was sort of my
Mr. Rogers moment of the podcast.

172
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,520
I know there's a bunch of people
right now fucking Google in that.

173
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:36,100
Go ahead and Google it. Go
ahead and go. You know what?
I'll fucking go, Glenn, I'll,

174
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:37,890
I'll read, I'll read it to
you right now. This could be,

175
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:41,940
so maybe this could be something
interesting. Um, by the way,

176
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,390
have you guys been following anybody
like I told you, have you followed,

177
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,980
been following anybody
sarcastically on Twitter,

178
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,960
watching them make all of these news
events about themselves, you know,

179
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:55,680
telling you how difficult it is to
be beautiful, you know? All right,

180
00:10:55,681 --> 00:11:00,270
let me see here. Cock. Oh,
Jesus Christ. What fucking,

181
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,550
this is going to be on my search engine.
Alright. Cock a doodle. Cockroach.

182
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,510
Cox, spar cockroaches. Cockapoo alright,

183
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,940
cock meaning
posy.

184
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,960
Thank you. I'm 50 years old. I
just searched that. All right,

185
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:20,890
let's see what happens.

186
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,700
We'll the FBI show up at my door and
we're waiting and we're waiting because

187
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:31,600
bill has the worst Internet
service and there we go. Uh,

188
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,790
cock means vagina. Let us explain. La
Weekly wrote an article about this. Uh,

189
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,990
let me see here. Okay, now this is the
one coc meeting vagina. Let us explained.

190
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,560
Now I don't want his fucking
subscribe to the La Weekly. Okay.

191
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,830
Rodney Carmichael's early high school
years were awkward. Like many young men.

192
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,510
He wasn't sure how to talk to girls.

193
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,410
This less of a problem for a
stepbrother who gives a shit.

194
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,810
Okay. All right. He
never met a grown person,

195
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,220
but recalls that his stepbrother
promise she was cute. Even better.

196
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,270
She'd seen comical from afar and
thought the same thing about him.

197
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,220
So their phone calls slowly.

198
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:15,520
Miranda meandered from
getting to know you phase too.

199
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,190
Clumsy Highschool attempts at flirtation.

200
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,920
Then she asked a question that stopped
him in his tracks. Do you eat cock?

201
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,470
Wait, that's not a fucking clumsy
flirtation. That's fucking direct.

202
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,410
It's like a fucking military
due. Cocked for private. Alright.

203
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,330
Carmichael was confused,
uh, to the young black man.

204
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:41,650
Everything to that point had suggested a
typical teenage heterosexual courtship.

205
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,430
But the question threw him for a loop.
He's like,

206
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,130
I didn't know if she was talking
about minor Hersey. He remembers.

207
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,340
It was kind of nerve wracking.
His confusion was understandable.

208
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:53,950
He didn't use the word cock much himself,

209
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,890
but he had heard it by white
folks in the media, Hbo,

210
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:01,260
old playboy who was slang for penis when
it was used by some of his famous rap

211
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,710
Fay favorite rappers. However, it meant
something else entirely. Take Miami Rep,

212
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,000
act two live crew.

213
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,920
That group obsessed equally with
bass and female anatomy, uh,

214
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,260
and most famously by most famous hit me.

215
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:19,261
So horny also had a song called
HPC in which they chanted head,

216
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:23,350
booty and cock. Uh, what
you like, Foote, fellows,

217
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:27,080
head booty and cock.
Oh Jesus Christ.

218
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,390
I don't remember that song. And two live
crew. Jesus Christ. What? Okay, snoop dog.

219
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:35,540
When I bust my ass up,
I'm raising up off the cock.

220
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,040
Snoop Dogg wraps in his
iconic 1993 hit gin and juice.

221
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,123
Yeah.

222
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,090
MMM. All right. So we've
got enough exam examples.

223
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,860
So no surprise that flooding caught
courtship quickly wound down nobody's cock

224
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:54,710
was ever eaten, but comic definitely
wasn't alone in this confusion.

225
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,550
There were surely many casualties in,
in an era when hip hop,

226
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:02,930
sudden popularity forced this old bit
of slang into a head on collision.

227
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:06,830
With the broader culture for one
group of people cock preferred to male

228
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:10,730
genitalia for the other referred
to female day. We go, ah,

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,850
and that's one to grow on.
See everybody, you know,

230
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,920
every once in a while
you learn something here

231
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,510
on the fucking Thursday afternoon podcast.
What do you think about that? Huh?

232
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,541
All right.

233
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:28,541
So you gotta be asking yourself the New
England patriots or play in the fucking

234
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,740
Indianapolis Colts.
A rivalry.

235
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,790
Arguably the biggest rivalry in the NFL
during the Peyton manning was there.

236
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:42,770
Maybe, you know, I always thought
the Steelers ravens was a good one.

237
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,560
Yeah. Who the fuck knows? Anyways, it was,
it was a big driver, but now, you know,

238
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:51,650
it's a different time. Andrew Luck, you
know, took a year off getting healthy.

239
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:52,130
Now he's

240
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,780
back. Who knows what happens. I love
what the Patriots did on Sunday. Oh,

241
00:14:56,781 --> 00:15:00,740
by the way, I did I fucking call the
fucking Broncos at what they covered.

242
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,960
They still blow the fucking game,
but they,

243
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,400
I was so hoping they were actually
going to win the game. Um, but anyways,

244
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,240
uh, the Patriots did so
well against the dolphins.

245
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,130
That's the team that I want
to show up on Thursday.

246
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:15,800
But these Thursday games a weird cause.
Everybody's fucking tired.

247
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,570
They usually sloppy shit.

248
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,460
And um,

249
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,060
I dunno,
I keep,

250
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,880
I keep hearing Edelman is going to be
back and then other people say isn't going

251
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,840
to be back. I don't know.
But if he's back, you know,
we got that dude, you know,

252
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:31,320
who likes to party like
me. Um, in from Cleveland,

253
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,160
it help our defense can get a little
pressure on the quarterback. Something.

254
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:37,980
I don't know if we've got a shot.
We got a shot to go on a little run here.

255
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:40,170
We'll see.
We shall see what happens.

256
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,193
MMM.

257
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,370
So I went to the gym today,
right.

258
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,093
And uh,

259
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,880
I forgot my headphones.

260
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,503
Okay.

261
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,200
And um, you know, so the plane, you
don't gym music and shit. Right.

262
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,583
Okay.

263
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,600
And Dude, I got to say at my fucking
gym, it is so funny. It's such like a,

264
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,250
like I've, I've, I haven't been
in a gym in like 11 or 12 years.

265
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,600
I always worked out in my garage,

266
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,500
but now cause I need to do the lat pull
downs to finally build strength up in my

267
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,190
shoulder so I can finally
do a pull up again.

268
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:18,230
So I don't lose like 200 bucks when I
turned 70, cause I can't do 10 pull ups.

269
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,080
That's the bet. Um, with
Virginia that I have. And um,

270
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,620
so I joined this gym and I
haven't been in the gym so long.

271
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:29,060
Like there is just so many different
fucking workouts, Eh, cause you know,

272
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:31,440
back in the day they used to be,
I'd go to a gym and I'd be like,

273
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,950
that guy doesn't know what
the fuck he's doing. You know?

274
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,170
And that person really
knows what they're doing.

275
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:38,750
I should ask them for some
tips on how to work out.

276
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,940
But now I haven't been in there so long
and there's just so many. I mean when it,

277
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,900
last time I was a member of a gym,

278
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:47,750
like I don't think there
was even kettle balls.

279
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,410
Forget about all of this other shit where
people stand on things like trying to,

280
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,663
uh,

281
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,380
you know,

282
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,960
it's like they've got half a beach
ball that they're standing on it while

283
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:03,400
they're doing curls and they're also
working their core. I mean, I don't know.

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,850
So then I see people doing other
shit and it's just like, okay,

285
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,770
so is that a legit exercise or is
that person just fucking weird?

286
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,440
I saw a guy on, on, you know, instead
of doing dips, he lifted himself up,

287
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:18,700
he locked his arms out

288
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,310
and then he was just like
scissor kicking side to side.

289
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,170
Like he was running in the air and
I was like, is that for your ankles?

290
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:34,690
Like what is, what does that, I
imagine that's something for your core.

291
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,240
He wasn't bringing his legs up though.

292
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,430
It was like he was just
sort of running in the air.

293
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,120
Like you know those douchebags who do
pull ups and they act like they're walking

294
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:46,190
upstairs, you know,
like one person did it,

295
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,700
it was cool and then 40,000 people did it.

296
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,070
And that just immediately became
Douchey, like rollerblading. Um,

297
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,650
okay.

298
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,860
Oh, what did I hear this guy say
today at the gym? It was a self,

299
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,260
I was going to fucking write it down.
I forgot.

300
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,330
He was just talking about a show
that he liked and I was just going,

301
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:10,810
there's no way that wasF is for family.
He said,

302
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:13,390
I just thought that they were really
delicate with the, some sort of,

303
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:17,200
something sort of subject.
This was a guy talking.

304
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,830
I liked that show because they're really,
uh, they cherish something, blah, blah,

305
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:25,291
blah, blah, blah.

306
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,750
I don't know if he was hitting on the
woman he was talking to or whatever.

307
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,310
Tronic like we was fucking sensitive,
you know,

308
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,310
but I know they weren't
talking aboutF is for family.

309
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,890
And speaking of F is for family.
Uh,

310
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:38,820
Netflix put out their first bit of
social media about a season three,

311
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:41,610
which I'm very excited about it.
Um,

312
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,950
it, uh, dropped I think 11:00 AM or
something. I guess it's the next day.

313
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:49,780
So you guys probably already
saw it if you haven't seen it.

314
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,860
Vince Vaughn is doing a
voice to season and um,

315
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,270
it's probably the most
fun I've had in the, uh,

316
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,930
in the recording booth was
somebody, he, that guy is like,

317
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,980
he's completely in his own lane.
He is a fucking monster.

318
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,280
How funny that guy is.
And um,

319
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,090
I did my best to try to keep up with them,
which I don't think I did,

320
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:15,850
but I'm once again just another,
you know,

321
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,460
huge person to add to the cast
and obviously added the funny,

322
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:21,280
that's why I think this
is our best season and um,

323
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:24,700
and it's obviously his
production, um, company,

324
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:28,360
wild west fill that whole fucking reason
that the show exists to begin with.

325
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,110
So a, I want to thank Kim and
I want to thank all you guys.

326
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,150
If you're even thinking of watching it,

327
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:37,210
hopefully you will watch it and then
we will get to do it all over again.

328
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,080
And hopefully this time next year
I'll be talking about a season four,

329
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:45,130
but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
The Yankees,

330
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,180
I don't know what happened.

331
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,080
It's,
it's the fucking day before.

332
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,630
Oh No, it's today. It's happening today.
Maybe there are they playing right now?

333
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,620
They're playing the Oakland A's and
I have no feeling about this game.

334
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,860
I have no idea who's gonna
win this fucking one. But, uh,

335
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,950
I'd like to fucking check in here.
What do we got yanked

336
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,203
the,
is

337
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,750
the Yankees,
are they going to play tonight?

338
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,730
What time?
It's on TBS.

339
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,530
All right, I'll have to check
this out. No, you know what?

340
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,480
I'll actually be going to the fucking
airport so I'm going to miss it.

341
00:20:20,481 --> 00:20:23,780
Maybe I'll watch it on the plane.
Should be some Yankee fans on there,

342
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:28,760
right flying to wherever the fuck
I'm flying to. Um, do you anyways?

343
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:32,120
I got some ad reads to read here,
but I don't have them with me,

344
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,460
so I'm just going to say I have them and
then I'm gonna I guess we'll drop it in

345
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:39,440
through the magic of fucking,

346
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,700
I don't know what magic of editing.

347
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,500
Yeah. So I'm definitely gonna do the, uh,
the sober October thing. I gotta do it,

348
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:55,210
man. I, I don't know what
my deal is. What is it?

349
00:20:55,211 --> 00:21:00,100
When if you drink,
you just fucking take it to the end,

350
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,380
but you can also just stop.
Where did,

351
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:09,310
where does that exist on, like
addiction, you know what I mean?

352
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,410
Like, I can literally just stop
drinking and I let have alcohol sitting.

353
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,550
I just walk by it everyday.
I don't even fucking see it.

354
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,940
But then when I get back on,
then I just fucking, I dunno,

355
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,050
just slamming them, man. I'm thinking.

356
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:30,060
I used to be my last one. This will be
my last one. And I'm just like, I'm,

357
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,920
I'm still not, maybe it's my tolerance.
It's like I don't feel anything.

358
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,160
And then the next day I wake up, I'm
like, oh my God, I feel like Shit. Whoa.

359
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:39,890
I was way drunker than I thought.
Um,

360
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm always amazed at those people
that can just sip, you know,

361
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,240
maybe it's just how I'm wired.
Like if I'm playing drums,

362
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:53,770
I'm gonna fucking play drums.
If I'm going to go do a tour,

363
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,320
it's going to be really fucking long or
some shit. And if I'm going to drink,

364
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:58,340
I'm gonna drink.
So

365
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,610
I dunno. I'm just too
fucking old for it. And, uh,

366
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:03,640
okay.

367
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,970
I Dunno, but this is what always happens.
Now I'll, I'll stop for awhile, month,

368
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:10,180
two months, a fucking year or whatever,
and then I just, I just get bored.

369
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,383
MMM.

370
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,360
There's gotta be like a,

371
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,283
okay.

372
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,300
It's gotta be a hobby.
They can come up with dude.

373
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,840
These fucking people like chasing
you around the fucking Internet.

374
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:29,160
Look at this art deco bar cabinet.
I looked up maybe getting an art deco bar.

375
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:30,510
Hilarious.
As I'm sitting there talking about,

376
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,710
I'm not going to fucking drink anymore.

377
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,980
I looked that up like fucking six
months ago and they just keep,

378
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,520
no, I just clicked on it just
to talk to you guys about,

379
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,770
and this will just never leave.

380
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't give a shit what I w I could be
looking up something about platypuses

381
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,040
and in the side of my fucking thing,

382
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:52,650
it's going to say art deco bars
look at d sinks. Oh my God. They are

383
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,420
beautiful. Expensive as shit
though. Jesus. Fuck you.

384
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,270
Why are you paying all of that?
My God.

385
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,510
Oh, but they are beautiful.
That's my favorite shit.

386
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:09,610
I think also because I grew up watching
bugs bunny that I like art deco shit is

387
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:12,470
if you watch bugs bunny, there's a lot
of all the buildings and stuff. You know,

388
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,250
which people you know really hate it.
To be honest with you.

389
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,680
When they first came out,
they didn't like art deco.

390
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:23,510
They never liked the new shit. You know,
like me, I never liked the new shit.

391
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:25,640
What did I just bitching about?
Bitching about fucking Patrick.

392
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,990
My homes wasn't even veteran about him.
I think he's fucking great, but she that,

393
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,290
that announced it. My God, I, I,
there was a couple of times like,

394
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,480
I think this guy's going to faint.

395
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,450
I let him think he's going to
fucking pass out if this guy,

396
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:39,120
if he like hands off the ball,
then they're given case keen.

397
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,060
I'm no fucking respect whatsoever.
That guy,

398
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:46,340
I only went to the fucking NFC
championship last year, right.

399
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,870
Only beat the saints in the last
play of the fucking game. Right.

400
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,770
Granted that was the saints
fucking up. Oh. Speaking of which,

401
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:57,890
that guy plays on the
colts now, I believe. Um,

402
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,030
but uh, I don't know. Yeah, I guess
when that Shit first came out,

403
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:08,080
people just did not like it on any
level. A look at that one. Jeez,

404
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:08,831
look at this other thing.

405
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:11,920
You can't fucking see unique
art deco whiskey bar cabinet.

406
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:16,921
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to not
drink when there's bars like this that

407
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:24,320
I can buy? Well what makes this a
whiskey bar bill? Well you know what,

408
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,030
you put whiskey than,
Oh there you go.

409
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,400
Yeah,

410
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,710
he has little fucking holes in it.
What?

411
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,650
He reached down and you get the bottle
like that comes up like Michael Jackson

412
00:24:31,651 --> 00:24:35,850
used to come up out of the stage.
I don't know.

413
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,940
I don't like shopping online.
I'll tell you what I need man.

414
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:42,870
I need a fucking fly swatter
and mosquitoes. It just
off the hook right now.

415
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,870
Did I say off the hook that I
say they're raising the roof?

416
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,120
Did I used to watch fucking Arsenio Hall
talk show back in the [inaudible] they,

417
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,410
I think I did. I think I did. Um,

418
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,970
yeah, these things are like, they are
not taking any prisoners. This is a,

419
00:24:57,971 --> 00:24:59,980
this is special forces mosquitoes.

420
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,530
I got like welts on me and shit
and they are fast as shit. Oh my,

421
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,020
my hand eye coordination
isn't what it used to be. Um,

422
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,750
but [inaudible] really makes the
flyswatter is, is the holes in it.

423
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,540
You know what I mean? So as it's
moving through the air, it's like,

424
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,240
it's like the stealth bomber.
Nobody can here, you know,

425
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:24,090
even though it's got a fucking jet engine,
uh, sounding again here, it's that data.

426
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,120
They can't pick it up on radar.
Is that what it is? I don't know.

427
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:30,550
I bet they can know.
You know,

428
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:33,730
we don't admit it because he
spent so much money was like,

429
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,040
oh we can't find that thing. And
then they, they take pictures of it.

430
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:39,610
Oh that's what it is.
Okay. It looks like a, uh,

431
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,820
it looks like if someone
was going to carve a cock,

432
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,440
meaning a dick in a life and they didn't
quite finish that in quite rounded off.

433
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,790
Um, but anyways, the fly swatter
cause it has all those holes.

434
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,660
It's like a Prius when it first
starts off. You know, you can't even,

435
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:02,640
like if someone's trying to
run you down with the Prius,

436
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,610
when they first left the curb,
you wouldn't hear it.

437
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:08,910
By the time you really hear that engine
fucking turned on, it will be too late.

438
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,190
That's what it is. The flyswatter
is the Prius of, um, of fly killers.

439
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,733
Okay.

440
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:20,490
I think right. Cause what else you got?
You got that tape and you hang down. Um,

441
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,920
I always thought that that
was just brutal. That fucking,

442
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:26,620
that's like that mouse thing because you
just go into the glue trap and they're

443
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:31,000
like fucking ripping themselves
apart, trying to get out of it. Um,

444
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,460
there's no need for that.
All right. Just get a cat,

445
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,710
those creepy ass fucking things.

446
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,473
MMM.

447
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,820
Yep. You get a feeling like somebody's
stealing from you. You know,

448
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,830
you got just tells you I
don't trust this person.

449
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,630
I've always felt that way about cats.

450
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,640
I don't fucking trust those things as far
as I can throw on and I would throw in

451
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:57,150
because it's going to land on its
paws anyways. Right. Um, anyways,

452
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,160
I have a plane to catch everybody.

453
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,580
This had gotta be the biggest bunch of
nonsense I've ever said in my fucking

454
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:07,490
life. Um, I'm going to be at the, uh,

455
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,880
Boston Garden on Friday night and I'm
getting together with some friends I used

456
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:15,480
to play with back in the day to gym
during the day in the arena. This time,

457
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:18,780
unlike the forum, I will not
be going for fucking, you know,

458
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,680
three and a half hours. Uh, I, I'm,

459
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,420
I'm going to do with like 90
minutes or something, get in there,

460
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,770
have a good time and then just fucking,
you know, leave them wanting more. So,

461
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,200
um, I want to thank everybody. Boston.

462
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:34,260
I sold more tickets than I've ever
sold in my life. I can't believe it.

463
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm actually in denial about it so I can
fucking mentally get through it. And um,

464
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,180
it's really going to be crazy because
I actually started my standup career at

465
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:49,170
Nick's comedy. Stop on
Warren Street, March 2nd,

466
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,970
1992 and 26 and a half
fucking years later, you know,

467
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,860
to be right down the streets. Pretty
cool man. Pretty fucking cool. Um,

468
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,690
but it ain't going to be cool for
freckles. Has a bad show. So, uh,

469
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,700
I will be making sure.

470
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,730
Well that's good now cause now it's sober
October and now I said it to you guys,

471
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,530

and I love that Rogan does that shit cause
it makes me want to fucking do it. Um,

473
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,630
so if you guys can come up with a good
rhyme for me, maybe I'll go for November.

474
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,560
You know, remember
sober, remember November?

475
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,610
No, it doesn't have a good
ring to it. What would have,

476
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:32,480
I'll let you guys come up with a semi semi
your pitches and I'll see if it works.

477
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,590
And if it doesn't, I'll blame
my binge drinking on you
guys. All right. That is it.

underwear. Feel free to improvise. Well,

578
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,870
you know,
my balls used to be sad and you know,

579
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:49,750
feeling like they weren't respected
as they were shaped when they were up

580
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:51,640
against cotton.
You know,

581
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,970

hey,
what's going on?

602
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:38,950
This is built bar and this is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

603
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:43,810
October 4th, 2010 and I'm
doing it really, really late,

604
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,980
super late, super, super late.

605
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,300
Like that whore you banged a
freshman year of fucking high school.

606
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:57,350
You know, we'll stop stressing out about
it. That's what's making it not happen.

607
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,930
You're not fucking pregnant. And was that
girl, everybody had that girl, right?

608
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,100
The one girl who gets fucking pregnant
like eighth grade, ninth grade, you know,

609
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:09,550
you go back for your 10 year high school
reunion and she's standing there with a

610
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:13,270
22 year old you like look at you.
Good for you. Why you still got it?

611
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,720
Actually that's my son.
Um,

612
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:21,861
that's right.

613
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:24,680
She's standing there with their three
kids and they all have like beards and

614
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:28,520
mustaches are a full rack of titties.
Um,

615
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,690
anyways, I'm super late because, um,

616
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,140
I hung around for an extra
day in buffalo and uh,

617
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,700
consumed about 9,000 calories.
I went to a,

618
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:43,540
the buffalo bills New York jets
game and then afterwards I went to

619
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,140
the Buffalo Sabre Philadelphia
flyers game. And uh,

620
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:53,570
I just had a fucking
awesome time out there, man.

621
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,510
I'm the first night actually
worked in Albany, New York.

622
00:37:56,511 --> 00:37:59,930
I was working the egg and I want to
thank everybody who showed up. Man.

623
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:03,560
I had a great turnout for both
shows. It's my first little, uh,

624
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:08,330
my first little dip into the theater
market. Stuck my little toe in there.

625
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,780
You know? Yeah. MMM. But
I gotta tell you, man,

626
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:16,920
I had the scariest fucking flight I've
had in like 10 years flying in from

627
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:20,990
Chicago to Albany, right. I live out here
on the fucking west coast now. So yeah,

628
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,270
for some goddamn reason,
Los Angeles is this international airport.

629
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:29,350
But well that's not true.
It's because it's the other
side of the country. I mean,

630
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:33,820
I can get a fucking direct
flight. So like, uh,

631
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,350
I dunno Bakersfield, I'm trying to pick
some fucking obscure city, but whatever,

632
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,720
to get to Albany, I got to fly into
Chicago and then I that which was,

633
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,720
which was no problem.

634
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,920
Then I flew from Chicago to Albany
and when we came in on final approach,

635
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,490
I don't know what happened,
the guys like,

636
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,670
we're coming in for final approach and we
just was, we were in this fucking soup,

637
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:59,740
we were in this chop or whatever the
pilots call and we're just going up 500

638
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:03,910
feet down 600 backups,
seven and we're just in this shit.

639
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,560
And, uh, as I, as I've stated
before here on the podcast,

640
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,790
I don't mind turbulence when
I'm way up in the fucking air,

641
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:17,230
I don't give a shit drop a thousand feet
worth 30,000 off the fucking ground.

642
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,030
I don't care.
Right.

643
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,340
But when you're like coming in on final
approach, all of a sudden drop in five,

644
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:29,110
600 feet, you know, you start hitting
TV and tennis like back in the day,

645
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,230
like Fred Flintstone when he didn't want
to get busted for whatever the fuck he

646
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:35,560
was doing. Right. And he started
driving around the neighborhood last.

647
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:40,180
So in the end tennis, what that was
he doing? Was He cheating on Wilma?

648
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:45,760
Am I doing some, some stand up
comedy material from the 1980s?

649
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:49,080
Is that, is that what I'm
doing? Who was the deal?

650
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,633
Um,

651
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,590
so we're just in this shit and this
guy says we're in final approach. Okay.

652
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,020
And like 15 fucking
minutes later, I'm, I'm,

653
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,920
I'm just looking out the
window doing what I always do.

654
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:03,940
Go and give me some lights.

655
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,260
Let me see some fucking lights of the
city so I can figure out how high up we

656
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:11,620
are so I can figure out how
much I need to be freaking out.

657
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,280
And we just kept flying through
this shit and it was like really,

658
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:19,090
really bad to the point I was actually
feeling a little bit queasy, right?

659
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:23,380
And this guy's not saying shit and I'm
thinking, fuck, we're flying into Albany,

660
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,090
who flies into Albany, you
know, is that the the fucking,

661
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,680
is that Tom Brady flying that
plane or do we got the backup?

662
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,920
Why don't we know his fucking
name? Albany. The studs.

663
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,540
They fly into JFK, they fly into
Laguardia, they fly in to Newark.

664
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:42,280
They don't fly into Albany.
Right.

665
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,960
So I'm sitting there freaking the
fuck out going out. God, we've got,

666
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,970
we got the fucking backup to the backup.

667
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:54,250
We've got Trent Dilfer is backup pliant
flying the Goddamn plane. And uh,

668
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:58,450
so I did some, I haven't done in awhile.
I started praying to God, Huh? Oh Gee.

669
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:02,800
He h that's how bad it was. Either fucking
hedge my bets going, hey, you know,

670
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:06,760
I been talking a lot of trash about
you on the Monday morning podcast.

671
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:10,360
Wait a minute, do I even need to explain
it considering you know everything?

672
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,390
Um, now, seriously. I was like, all right,
all right, sorry for this. Sorry for that.

673
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,710
Sorry for my ceds.

674
00:41:17,711 --> 00:41:21,790
And I'm really starting to get nervous
because we're still fucking, you know,

675
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,310
people's stomachs to drop in
and I'm really fucking praying.

676
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,330
And then all of a sudden
I heard this woman, uh,

677
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,350
puke like 10 rows back,
right?

678
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,920
Everybody is like visibly nervous and no
one has let out the bitchy scream yet.

679
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:41,120
And then I just hear this lady
like 12 rows back here, right?

680
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:45,380
So I start laughing my fucking ass off.
It's exactly what I need.

681
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:49,850
A little bit of humor so I can just
completely pave over any sort of emotion

682
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,600
that I'm feeling. And then we were
back in the fucking chop again.

683
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,300
And then the pilot finally
comes on and says, yeah,

684
00:41:56,301 --> 00:42:00,080
they have us in a holding pattern
because you can see there's a storm.

685
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,340
And what I didn't get was,

686
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:06,320
why didn't you fly up above it or fly
east of the shit or get away from it?

687
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,580
We just stayed in it.

688
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,960
We were flying in circles in
this fucking storm and we would,

689
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:15,560
we would get to the point where it was
sort of tolerable and then go back into

690
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:17,690
it again.
And uh,

691
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,510
it was really getting bad and I was
trying to read a magazine and made me like

692
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:23,810
car sick, which I guess is air sick when
you're up there, but it's the same shit.

693
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,060
And uh, and then I heard this guy
like two rows behind me, you know,

694
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,540
he let out this really bitchy like,
Ooh,

695
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,840
as we were going over the thing and I
actually made me fucking angry, you know,

696
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,170
Christ's sake hold you
fucking get yourself together.

697
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,900
Fucking start making those noises,
making everybody scared you asshole.

698
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,850
So we did that, but that's what
it was for fucking 40 minutes.

699
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,720
We were in this shit
and people were puking.

700
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:57,230
People will make an woo woo,

701
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,950
like literally like that and a,

702
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:04,220
and I'm sitting there trying to fucking
remember what prayers you're suppose to

703
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:08,270
say from back in the days when
I was an altar boy. Right?

704
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,220
You're fucking rang the bells.

705
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,820
And on the third day he said,

706
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,630
this is what I've done for you.

707
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,320
I can't remember how
to say this is my body,

708
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,940
which will be given up for
you. That's right. You ring
it. Dang it. Dang it. Dang.

709
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:29,690
With the fucking the bells there. At
least that's how we did it. You know?

710
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:34,870
That's the only lame attempt at my church
we made to try to fucking compete with

711
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,360
whatever was going on fucking
in the inner city. Right?

712
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,390
They probably had Aretha Franklin
headline in or some shit.

713
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,750
You just had me looking like a
young fucking oop Cunningham,

714
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:52,340
whatever the fucking goddamn dude's
name was. I never watched that show.

715
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,210
The Andy Griffith show.

716
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:57,500
I always found it depressing watching
those broke ass southern people that town

717
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:01,130
drunk, who's never
funny to me. So anyways,

718
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:05,900
we finally fucking land and everything
was good and go to Albany. I do the Gig.

719
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:08,510
Everything's fucking great.
Then I go out to buffalo,

720
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,000
driving across the state in New York.
Absolutely gorgeous day. And this second,

721
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,300
I even get within the facility,
first of all,

722
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:19,400
every time he was a
fucking five hour drive,

723
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:23,720
six hour drive from Albany to
buffalo. What? Uh, I dunno, I dunno.

724
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,340
I Dunno how people drive, but a,
you can go a lot faster than that.

725
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,220
Three hours and 50 minutes you pussies.

726
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,430
So I go in there and the second I
get into buffalo, it's like fucking

727
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,910
pouring down rain. I'm sorry. I
thought I hit the stop on here.

728
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,590
It just immediately was the most
miserable fucking weather. And uh,

729
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:49,850
I ended up doing my show and
I don't know what's going on.

730
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:52,310
I'm fucking tired and I
lost interest in this story.

731
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,300
What do you think about that?

732
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:54,760
Yeah,

733
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,300
how do I regroup here? You don't fuck me
up cause I thought I stop my recorder.

734
00:44:58,301 --> 00:44:59,350
God dammit.

735
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,910
This is why I don't do my podcasts on
the same day that I fly is because I'm so

736
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:08,050
fucking sleepy that I,
I can't, I can't focus.

737
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:12,810
I keep trying to fucking keep
the momentum going and I,

738
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,120
I just can't do it. I just
can't fucking do it. Let's,

739
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:17,880
let's just try to hit the highlights.
I get to Buffalo,

740
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:23,140
I do the Goddamn show. I
have a great time. And uh,

741
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,600
the other comedian I'm working
with, me and Paul Versey,
we're like, well, you know,

742
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:31,150
this is buffalo. They are known for their
wings. They're always talked and shit,

743
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:35,960
right? Philly cheese steak. You go to
Philly, you get a cheese steak, right?

744
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,790
You go to fucking Atlantic City,
you get you, you get fucking,

745
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:42,440
you get your dick suck in the alley.

746
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,270
Right behind the fucking blue
and beige Trump casino. You do.

747
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:51,740
You, you do what the Ryan when in Rome,
you do what the Romans do. So fuck it.

748
00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:54,120
We're in Buffalo.
Let's go get some goddamn buffalo wings.

749
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,680
Let's go get some wings. So a, there's
two places to go. You either go to Tufts,

750
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,820
he got to anchor bar and Tufts was right
down the street. So we said, fuck it.

751
00:46:01,821 --> 00:46:04,130
Let's go there.
And I gotta tell you,

752
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:08,430
you want to talk about living up to the
hype. Best fucking wings I ever had.

753
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,030
All right.
[inaudible] had a crunchy outside.

754
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,400
You don't like when people don't know
how to make the wings around the rest of

755
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:20,520
the country. When the crunch, the
outside is crunchy, that means a,

756
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:24,780
as my dad would say, Christ, you're
cooked. They shit out of that.

757
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,910
Um, yeah. Usually that means
somebody over cooked it. Oh,

758
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,790
is my debt eloquently puts it.
Cook the shit out of it.

759
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,960
That's what he's always here. Christ,
you're cooked his shit out of it.

760
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:46,310
Um, face all twisted up. Anyways,

761
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,550
that's back when you could curse in
restaurants, you know, tell you it's so,

762
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:53,690
we lost so many rights after nine 11,
I swear to God.

763
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:57,170
Remember you used to be able to walk
into Mcdonald's and you get your French

764
00:46:57,171 --> 00:47:00,200
fries and they would call and he
could just yell at the manager, Hey,

765
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:05,150
hey fucking dude. Yeah.
Yeah. What the f well,

766
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,240
they're fucking cold. I'm sorry sir.
Let me get you some other ones. Yeah,

767
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,074
you do that.

768
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:11,070
Okay.

769
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,920
Right. Isn't that what you were able
to do or those my drinking years,

770
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:18,690
I can't remember. That's how I, that's
how I did it. So anyways, once again,

771
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:21,640
I've lost my train of thought.
I don't know where I am. Yeah.

772
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:23,410
So we go in there and,
and, and they're literally,

773
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,690
they're fucking crunchy on
the outside and they're,

774
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,190
they're juicy on the inside and
they got unbelievable sauce.

775
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,170
Then we got the duff beer. It
was the shit. Now, evidently
when Obama went there,

776
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,630
there's, there's another place.
It's a place called anchor bar.

777
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,550
And I guess when Obama went there,
he flipped a coin. He went to duff.

778
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:45,330
So we went to the same place the president
went to. But then afterwards, um,

779
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:51,310
ah, fuck it. I got to tell
that part of the store out.
Jesus. You know what this is?

780
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:54,130
This is like, uh, the
first draft of a script,

781
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:58,210
except this is all I got budget for.
This is [inaudible] be like a fucking

782
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,990
Edward Movie Cut. That was perfect.
Moving on. So the next day I go to the,

783
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:06,520
the bills game. All right.
And I'm, I'm, I'm uh,

784
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,680
I'm doing my little hundred dollar bet.

785
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:11,200
I'm picking three games
against the spread. Once again,

786
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:15,220
this week I went one and two. I went one
and two last week. So I'm two and four,

787
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,690
a pitiful two and four.
Even if I teased my teams last week,

788
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:22,200
I still would have lost with the fucking,
uh,

789
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,530
falcons beaten the saints and over
time. So this week, who did I have?

790
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,970
First of all, dumbest get you can do
as a gambler is I bet with my heart.

791
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,030
So I'm sitting there going,
right, the bills are getting five.

792
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:38,530
I know every football fan and out there
right now is going, oh gee. She said,

793
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,630
that's cause you know the fucking final
result. All right? I'm thinking all right.

794
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,170
The jets had been playing great.

795
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,000
They should go in and absolutely destroy
this team. It's fucking raining hour.

796
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,460
It's a divisional Ravelry.
This is the exam.

797
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,280
They got a couple of
injuries in their secondary,

798
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,790
these exact kind of a fucking game that
goes the exact opposite way, right?

799
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,790
And plus I hate the jet. So I say,
fuck it, I'm taking the pills.

800
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,390
And then I also took the Bengals
against Cleveland. I lost that one.

801
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:07,090
And there was one other one that I took.
I pick the fucking ravens.

802
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,520
I got to stick with the Ravens.
Man.

803
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:12,010
The Ravens had been good
to me and solve the lions,

804
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,210
but I think the cat's out of the bag that
the lions can actually hang so then it

805
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,300
can be getting fucking 13 point
spreads anymore. But anyways,

806
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,860
um, so I show up there, right?
And I'm walking into the stadium.

807
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,360
It's fucking rain and out. Ah, Jesus.

808
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:32,140
I fucked this part of the story up
to you know what? Fuck this podcast.

809
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:36,880
Great. She had cooked
the shit out of it. Um,

810
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,610
yeah,
it was fucking raining on.

811
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,290
This is one thing I've learned that when
you go to a football game and you're

812
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,120
dealing with the elements,

813
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,160
this is the more of a douchebag you
look like the warmer you're going to be.

814
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,420
All right. I saw the rain
and I said, fuck this.

815
00:49:58,421 --> 00:50:02,350
And we went right to Dick's sporting goods
and I'm like, I'm buying that fucking,

816
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:06,280
I'm going to buy a raincoat with
the matching raincoats slacks.

817
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,480
I don't give a fuck.

818
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,430
I bought a pair of a wool
socks and I was good to go.

819
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:18,220
So I'm with Versie and you know they
only had like two raincoats left and they

820
00:50:18,221 --> 00:50:22,690
were the exact same color.
This fucking grapes,

821
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:24,250
slush puppy purple.

822
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,210
So we both have matching
extra large fucking,

823
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:34,140
we got the jackets and the pants like
we're working at a fucking airport and

824
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:37,340
what green we're bringing in
the fucking soul plane. Right.

825
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:39,800
That was a purple airplane.
Right. That's what we look like.

826
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,110
So we show up to the game,
right.

827
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:46,820
Neither one of us is comfortable because
neither one of us is a jets or a bills

828
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:51,260
fan. So we're in enemy territory and
a, it's fucking drizzling it out.

829
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:55,910
It's fucking cold. So I proceed to put
on this Barney the dinosaur outfit,

830
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,080
right? And right off the
bat, Versie starts pumping
outgoing, man, I'm just gonna.

831
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:02,210
I'm just gonna wear that.
I'm just going to wear the top.

832
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,690
I'm just going to wear the top, trying to
act like it's not raining out that bed.

833
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,400
The reality is, is he didn't want to go
through the hazing that he would have to,

834
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:15,401
if the two of us walked in with our purple
on Purple fucking raincoats times two

835
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:19,720
, we would've got a ton of shit. And
I was prepared to take it. I had,

836
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,750
I had a whole fucking silly walk I was
going to be doing. I don't give a fuck.

837
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:29,060
So he punked out. So, uh, we ended up
walking in and put my head's cold, right?

838
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:32,780
All I have is a baseball cap on. So
I'm like, fuck, I gotta buy a head.

839
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:34,420
Can I buy a bills?
Who gives a fuck there?

840
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,560
And last pace being owned by a
bill's head. And then I saw this,

841
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:40,130
this one with the Patriot logo on
it. I said, fuck it. I'll get that.

842
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,510
Once I put that one on, I'm nice
and warm. We go to, we'll call,

843
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,620
we pick up our tickets.

844
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:50,030
We go into that high school football
stadium that they have out there that I

845
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:53,420
actually love. It looks like
an old school football stadium.

846
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:55,160
You know what I like about
that football stadium?

847
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:59,450
That's about the size of a football
stadium that holds real fans.

848
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,070
You know what I mean?
All these,

849
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:03,620
these new ones that hold
like 100,000 fucking pets,

850
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:07,400
all the bandwagon shitheads you know
when you're all in for the real fucking

851
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:08,870
fans show up. Oh and three, right?

852
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,580
So we walk into the Goddamn
stadium with love and life, right?

853
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,700
I'm already laughing at [inaudible] cause
I know damn well what's gonna Happen?

854
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,990
He's going to walk out there.

855
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:21,680
There's going to be some shitty little
plastic seat that's going to be covered

856
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:25,970
in fucking water and the only way he's
going to be able to absorb it is through

857
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:28,850
his God damn jeans and his fucking bbds.

858
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:33,200
And he's going to be sitting there with
a wrinkled up nut sack that's going to

859
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:36,890
be getting hypothermia by second quarter.
Why do I know this?

860
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:40,910
Because I've been there.
So we get a couple of beers,

861
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:44,360
we get this fucking beef on a stick
or whatever the fuck they call it.

862
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,630
We're good to go. We
go in there, sit down.

863
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:52,580
He sits basically down in
a fucking puddle. He tried
to stick a newspaper down,

864
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:56,420
which is a very absorbent and uh,
I don't know,

865
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:00,140
we sat there and I had hope for about
eight seconds in that game and the jets

866
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:04,190
came down and just fucking Jew.
They just kicked the shit out of him.

867
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,290
Christ.
They kicked the shit out of 'em and uh,

868
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,220
it was just over. So we'd, so immediately,

869
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:17,360
our solution is just to start drinking
the way we drank at the masters.

870
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,670
We're like, fuck it, let's, let's,
let's get going here. Right?

871
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:24,350
So we'll make a trip after trip and all
of a sudden I gotta take a Piss. Right?

872
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,270
So I go and I'm standing in
line and all of a sudden this,

873
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:34,580
this fucking six foot five
goofy looking jackass,

874
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,490
one of those guys who's like six foot
five, but you still think he can take him,

875
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,340
cause he's just covered in baby fat.
You know,

876
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:46,030
he's got a couple of whiskers on his
chin and his cheeks are rosier than Saint

877
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:50,250
Nick. Right? And he's got this
Jersey on and this big stupid,

878
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,420
I'm a buffalo bills fan with the
horns on it. The stuff, you know,

879
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:59,040
he's the Wacky Guy, so I'm
not even thinking shit, right.

880
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,510
This is bill's jets. I don't have a dog
in this fight. I'm not talking any shit.

881
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,660
I'm fine.
I forgot I was wearing my patriots hat.

882
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,830
And all of a sudden this big goofy jackass
starts going, well, what's what? Yeah,

883
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:16,560
were you're a patriots fan. He liked
the rats. We got to ran away the rats.

884
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:21,360
He likes to fucking read this shit,
right? And I'm like, yeah, you know,

885
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:24,420
whatever. He starts giving me shit.
I start giving them shit back.

886
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,400
Then the weirdest fucking thing happened.

887
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,500
By the time I get in to
the actual men's room,

888
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:36,600
I've talked, I've given these people
so much fucking shit that actually,

889
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,560
there's bills and jets fans
at a bills and jets game.

890
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:41,670
They're playing each other.

891
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,940
They stopped giving each other shit
and they teamed up together and started

892
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:51,330
giving me shit. Right. And then I just
said, I don't know what I was thinking.

893
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,040
I felt like I was on stage cause it was
like a crowd. I wasn't thinking like, Hey,

894
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:56,820
you know what bill?

895
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:00,660
You really haven't had a fight outside
of your family since maybe playing

896
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,830
fucking street hockey in the sixth grade.
If I didn't give a fuck,

897
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:09,030
I'm in a goddamn bathroom waiting to take
a piss in a goddamn trough by the way.

898
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,110
And uh, and then they just started
giving up fucking this one dude.

899
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,860
Such go on Tom Brady Sucks Dick.
He Sucks Dick.

900
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:21,210
And he's like miming it like ridiculously
well. So I'm like, Hey, you know, buddy,

901
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,340
you do that real well because I learned
it by watching Tom Brady or Michael.

902
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,400
Yeah. Did you rent that porno? You
fucking fag gets a little uglier.

903
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,100
Gets a little uglier than this other dude.
What the fuck are you doing?

904
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,600
I came up with the hell he was saying
to me and I just said, look, I'm sorry.

905
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:39,780
You guys have never won a super bowl,
you know,

906
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,970
then the jets fan pipes in.
I go,

907
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,130
do you realize the last time
you guys won a Superbowl,

908
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:47,160
Charlie Chaplin was still alive?
Do you understand that?

909
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:52,140
Do you know what cars look like the
last time you won? You fucking morons.

910
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,220
And then, uh, then this other guy got
the two, we've won three super bowls,

911
00:55:56,221 --> 00:55:59,730
I'm sorry. Right? And then the guy goes,
well, you didn't play in the games. I go,

912
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:03,960
neither did you. Then he's just standing
there with this dumb look on his face.

913
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,450
I go, that's right. I keep staring
forward. You've got nothing

914
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,750
forgetting that I don't know how to fight.

915
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,300
So all of a sudden it's my turn to Piss.
I take my dick out, I'm ready to Piss.

916
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:20,280
And one of these fucking pussies pushed
me in the back hoping that I was pissing

917
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:23,290
at the time. Fortunately I
wasn't. So I turn around,

918
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:26,880
I put my dick away cause I'm a
gentleman. I said, well Gee, I go,

919
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,890
is that how you guys do
it out here? Really? I go,

920
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:33,100
which one do you guys pushed me like I'm
gonna fuck like I'm fucking Jackie Chan.

921
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,610
And for some reason none
of them said anything.

922
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:42,230
I don't know if it was my purple on
purple rain coat or the look of fire in my

923
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:46,760
eye, but I'm a fucking 42 year old
balding redhead talk and Shit in there.

924
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:49,460
And none of them said anything.
So now it's kind of funny to me.

925
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:54,200
I felt like I was in like the world
series of poker and I went all in and I

926
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,640
didn't have a hand whatsoever.
So I don't know who the fuck pushed me,

927
00:56:57,641 --> 00:57:01,930
but that's what I mean. Come on.
Bitchy is move with the fucking week.

928
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,360
How do you do that? How do
you do that? How do you,

929
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:07,690
how do you push another man when he's
got his Goddamn Dick out trying to piss

930
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:10,090
into a fucking trough? I mean,
how do you get lower than that?

931
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:12,470
Do you guys have any ideas?
How'd he get lower than that?

932
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:16,670
So then after none of them said anything,
I go back and I started taking a piss.

933
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:21,671
And then that other dude who was miming
somebody's sucking a dick unbelievably

934
00:57:21,751 --> 00:57:25,760
well right next to me.
Well,

935
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:30,340
one of those stupid hats that has the
toggles on the side and he's still trying

936
00:57:30,341 --> 00:57:32,440
to give me shit and I'm
gonna go fuck yourself.

937
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:34,720
And then he just starts
screaming over and over again.

938
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:36,460
Are you looking at my deck?

939
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:40,360
Are you looking at my
deck like maniacally,

940
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,690
like five times.
I just sort of stared at him like,

941
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:49,310
why do you keep going this, this gay
angle? Like why is there always a,

942
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,290
I dunno.
I think he was one of those guys.

943
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:55,630
He was kind of in the closet and then,
uh,

944
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:00,510
so he just goes to football games and
he gets really drunk trying to just kill

945
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:03,380
the families. I think he liked
me. That's what I'm saying.

946
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,120
So if he's listening to
this, I'm sorry. Uh, I'm,

947
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:10,530
I'm spoken for you fucking pants.
You fucking believe that.

948
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:16,120
First of all, what's wrong with me? I
really replay it, all of that in my head.

949
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,460
Cause once I got out of there I was like,
I really started thinking like, what?

950
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,190
What did you think you
were going to do in there?

951
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:26,870
They're not Clint Eastwood yet saying
things. Clint Eastwood would say, what?

952
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,800
What the fuck is wrong with you dude?
Like,

953
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,760
I don't know if I've said
this before in a podcast,

954
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:35,500
a public bathroom is the worst fucking
place to ever get into a fight.

955
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:38,350
There is nothing soft.

956
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:43,530
There's everything is porcelain pipes
that concrete floor and then it has a mist

957
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:48,820
of piss and shit. It's just the fuck it
is the worst. So the worst place ever,

958
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,013
you know,

959
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:55,360
not to mention it usually starts evidently
when one person has begun the pissing

960
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:56,763
process.

961
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,980
So, uh, you know, older little bit wiser.

962
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,970
So then I'm standing in line to go get
some more alcohol cause God knows that's

963
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:10,740
what you need after an incident like that.

964
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,900
And I was just kinda just sitting
there thinking like, all right,

965
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:17,790
now how should I have played that

966
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:24,080
w it should have ended when the dude
with the water buffalo hat started giving

967
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:26,780
me shit.
What I should've done was roll with it.

968
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,400
I Shit you liked the Patriots.
I should've been like, hey,

969
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:33,730
you know you guys scored 30 on his last
week, man. You guys look great man.

970
00:59:33,731 --> 00:59:37,070
I bet the jets,
I mean I bet against the jets.

971
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:41,050
I hope you guys should have just
ended it with that and did it. I've,

972
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,800
I sh I should have,
I should have extended an olive branch.

973
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:46,390
That's what I should've
done in the future.

974
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:49,920
That's what the fuck I'm
going to do because, uh,

975
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:55,120
that was a, a, that was a potentially
ugly situation, but fortunately,

976
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:59,830
mmm. Yeah. I think the people
who are doing it, you know,

977
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:04,960
had jobs and no one wanted to get sued
and no one was willing to take it to that

978
01:00:04,961 --> 01:00:08,670
level. Uh, and when I say fortunately,

979
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,470
I mean for me and my face,

980
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,020
yeah.

981
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:16,471
Oh,

982
01:00:16,471 --> 01:00:20,310
do you know how bad that would have been
to get stomped in that fucking purple

983
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:25,270
on purple rain coat laying there
with my dirty fucking patriots hat

984
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,730
and my team wasn't even playing.
I, I would've lost the lawsuit.

985
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,430
They would've been like, let me get
this straight. You're a patriots fan,

986
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:39,120
you're a patriots hat to a bill's jets
game and you somehow manage to get the

987
01:00:39,121 --> 01:00:42,770
shit kicked out of you. What
the fuck did you say? You know,

988
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:46,070
that's one of the great things about
being a guy is you actually have to take

989
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:49,250
responsibility for your, for your
actions. See, what would it be like?

990
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,800
There's no excuse. There's no reason.
I don't care what happened, you know,

991
01:00:53,801 --> 01:00:57,560
and he had a girl, which is true,
you don't in a fucking girl,

992
01:00:57,561 --> 01:01:01,820
but there's no learning in that.
There's no lesson. Okay. You know,

993
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,990
even my best friends would have been like,
yeah,

994
01:01:04,991 --> 01:01:06,970
those guys are fucking assholes in the,
but you know,

995
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,920
they wouldn't have been an awkward
pause and it would have been like, dude,

996
01:01:08,921 --> 01:01:13,921
what the fuck he talking shit for by
yourself at a game when your team isn't

997
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:17,590
even fucking play. What's wrong
with you? You're 42 years old,

998
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:21,840
get your shit together. And they
would have been right. So anyways,

999
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:27,100
fortunately the bills, uh,
are smart enough to stop
serving alcohol at halftime.

1000
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,780
So when I went to go get
more beer, um, there, there,

1001
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,540
there wasn't any to be had.

1002
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,820
So I walked back there and I'm laughing
my ass off telling Versie the fucking

1003
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:42,821
story and he informed me that fucking
Sanchez threw a bomb to that fucking drunk

1004
01:01:42,921 --> 01:01:47,830
driver there. And um,
and I was just like, God,

1005
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:50,660
Jesus, here we go. Here we
go with the fucking patriots,

1006
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:52,580
let up 30 points to this fucking team.

1007
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:55,220
And the jets are raping them like
this other patriots that bad.

1008
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,220
I say we were in [inaudible] nine and 17.

1009
01:01:57,221 --> 01:02:01,510
Now I'm thinking fucking seven and nine,
so,

1010
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,650
uh, whatever. So that was rough.

1011
01:02:04,651 --> 01:02:08,280
And then I ended up getting into it with
some other jet Fan. I'm just a dick.

1012
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,110
I'm a Dick when I'm sober.

1013
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:14,690
And then you add alcohol and that goes
to the next level. And then I don't,

1014
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,960
when I go to a sporting event,
I become another person entirely.

1015
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:23,490
I don't know what it is. I just,
uh, I don't know. I love it.

1016
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,410
I love being at the game.
I met the stadium,

1017
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:28,800
I get excited and then
I'm a dick and I say,

1018
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:30,720
I say things that I shouldn't be saying.

1019
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:37,280
And I just started giving this lady shit
and she was bragging about the jets and

1020
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:42,510
I just kept asking her over and over
again, what is it like to share a stadium?

1021
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:48,840
You know,

1022
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,960
why couldn't she just sit there and
enjoy the fact that she was winning?

1023
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:53,250
Why did I have to ruin it?

1024
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,560
Why is my level of hatred for
all New York teams to that,

1025
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:02,520
to that level? It's pathetic. It's
really pathetic, but it is what it is.

1026
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:07,110
So anyways, most people would call it
a day after that point, but not me.

1027
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,310
Not for Z, not us. Fuck Dad.

1028
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:15,660
We're going to the sabers
flyers game after this,
there's more bears to be drank.

1029
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,041
So,

1030
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:22,041
and we got to check out
this fucking anchor bar to
compare their wings to Duff's

1031
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:25,440
. Right. We're fucking doing
buffalo up. That's what you do.

1032
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:30,180
You sit out in the fucking shit.
Uh, whether you watch the bills,

1033
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,140
get their ass kicked,

1034
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:34,170
you almost get beat down with your
dick out in the fucking bathroom.

1035
01:03:34,171 --> 01:03:37,410
And then you go get some wings and
hit the Sabres game afterwards.

1036
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:41,690
If there's something else to do out
there. I didn't see it. Alright.

1037
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:46,500
Nagra falls. What am I
fucking honeymoon anyways?

1038
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:48,930
Who goes to Niagara Falls
for their honeymoon? Huh?

1039
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:54,000
How far back into this staples
warehouse are you working that,

1040
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:58,320
that's where you go. That's what
I want to know. So anyways, uh,

1041
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,220
fucking cruise back to the hotel.
Get Out of our fucking, uh,

1042
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:08,490
uh, Barney the dinosaur
fucking raincoats and uh,

1043
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:14,040
I had to get directions. We fucking
flew down to the, the Sabres game.

1044
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:17,250
This is what kills me. We, we go
to, we go to anchor bar first.

1045
01:04:17,251 --> 01:04:21,210
I was thinking the game was at seven and
eight. Turns out it's at fucking six.

1046
01:04:21,211 --> 01:04:24,540
So we're pulling into anchor
bar at a quarter to six,

1047
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,750
getting ready to have some fucking wings.
We're still,

1048
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,080
we're just having a great time doing,
I can just put the windows down.

1049
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,270
I could smell him. This is going
to be the shit right? Just lit.

1050
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,700
I literally gained like 20 pounds
yesterday. So right as we pull in,

1051
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:40,260
the radio comes on and says,
you know,

1052
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:44,100
the Sabres sabers already dropped the
puck and 15 minutes. So we're like fuck.

1053
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,730
And we start driving really fast,

1054
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:52,920
not knowing where we were going to go
because the plan was to get wings and then

1055
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:57,630
you know, with sauce on a face, beer,
woo shavers play. That's that. That was,

1056
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,530
that was the game plan.

1057
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:03,210
But now we have to fucking start driving
and we ended up pulling over and uh,

1058
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:08,670
these three black dudes walking across
the street roll down the window. A,

1059
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,000
do you have any idea where the sabers,

1060
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,860
ah, look at me breaking down stereotypes
and it turns out, uh, the dude,

1061
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,740
we're after actually African
or we go where, you know,

1062
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:28,390
how do we get to the HSBC us as
see fucking arena. And he's like,

1063
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:32,650
oh dude, he's very far
[inaudible] I carry,

1064
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:33,970
I can't do an African accent,

1065
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:37,000
but I could just tell the way he was
rolling his eyes that it was really far.

1066
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:40,960
But I was thinking, wait a minute, this
guy's walking. Does he mean by bus?

1067
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:45,670
Who the fuck knows? Whatever. Long story
short, we ended up getting up there.

1068
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:48,070
So we just think we're going to walk up.
It's a preseason game.

1069
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:52,160
We're just going to buy tickets
at the booth. No can do.

1070
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,870
I think I bought a bad pack of batteries.

1071
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,660
They said fucking Duracell on him.

1072
01:06:01,661 --> 01:06:03,640
I think they will bootleg
these God damn things.

1073
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:05,770
They're only good for a half
a fucking hour. All right,

1074
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:09,400
let's pick up the pace with the damn
story again. So we walk up there, it's a,

1075
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,470
it's a preseason game and we go up
to buy tickets and they're sold out.

1076
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,790
Unbelievable for the Sabres
flyers that were like, fuck,

1077
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,790
they're going to drop the
puck in five minutes. We go,

1078
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:25,300
we got to go scout some tickets and I
didn't see anybody selling near the arena.

1079
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,110
And I came walking out and I see this
nerdy looking white dude with a sweater

1080
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:33,040
walking up and I just yelled,
who's got tickets? And he's girls.

1081
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:34,120
I got two right here.

1082
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:39,790
I got two right here and then we'll
fucking bottom off 60 bucks a whack.

1083
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:44,020
Sat right on the club level.
They've got everything from Sushi to,

1084
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:46,030
I don't think I have Sushi,
but they had like ice cream,

1085
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:48,610
which is really fucking
ridiculous at a hockey game.

1086
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,360
Maybe you get an ice cream sandwich,
but they had like, it looked like a,

1087
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:56,290
what's that Italian rest? That
restaurant? The Italian uh,

1088
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,240
ice cream. That's dish gelato.
They get like that level ice cream.

1089
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,050
You know, are you really going to come
back with that on a cone licking a cone?

1090
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:10,020
As you watch two people beat the shit
out of each other. Um, so anyways,

1091
01:07:10,021 --> 01:07:13,060
so then we get,
it's just first of all,

1092
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:18,370
the sabers arena is this shit.
All right.

1093
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:22,030
For the exact opposite reason.
Reason that I love the buffalo.

1094
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:25,600
I love the Buffalo Bills Stadium
because it reminds me it's white.

1095
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,120
It's what football stadiums
look like when I was a kid.

1096
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:32,320
And I'm not insulting you guys out
there. I think it's the shit. I like it.

1097
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:36,880
I hate those brand new fucking stadiums
that are the size of a god Damn Mountain

1098
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,940
. I hate him. I can't stand them.
They're too fucking expensive.

1099
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:44,770
They rape you in the ass for four tickets
because they gotta pay for the Fat Fox

1100
01:07:44,771 --> 01:07:46,120
who sit in the luxury boxes,

1101
01:07:46,121 --> 01:07:49,570
who don't even give a shit about the
damn team and they want to sit inside and

1102
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:54,400
watch your game. Fuck all those
places. So, but the Sabres,

1103
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:59,110
as far as a new arena, man
that's right up there with, uh,

1104
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,560
as far as the new arenas,
girl was the best one I've seen.

1105
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:07,060
I like the Minnesota wild.
The Phoenix coyotes had a really nice one.

1106
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,880
And the worst one I've been
to was the Boston Bruins.

1107
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,950
We have the worst brand new fucking
arena you are ever going to go to.

1108
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,080
It's like a bomb shelter.
They went out,

1109
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:22,070
they went down to the fucking Grossman's
hardware and they bought up all the

1110
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:24,290
cinder blocks in the state.
That's what they did.

1111
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:28,370
And then they just glued them together
and painted them yellow and fucking black.

1112
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:30,920
There you go.
There you go.

1113
01:08:30,921 --> 01:08:35,060
That's where we can put the Bruins
and the 17 time world champion,

1114
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:39,800
Boston Celtics. There you go. Give you
some yellow plastic seats. Have Fun.

1115
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:44,480
Everybody put the sabers arena, man.
It was, it was, it was beautiful.

1116
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:50,080
Scoreboard was to shit. And they had
the, uh, the sabers head hang on.

1117
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:51,370
That was fucking awesome.
And it,

1118
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:56,300
when the game was nine to two Sabres
kicked the shit out of him. And, uh,

1119
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,291
you know,

1120
01:08:57,291 --> 01:09:02,270
I was made fun of those people who listen
to the radio when they a watch a game,

1121
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,090
like what? You can't see what
the fuck's going on? Well,

1122
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:10,060
evidently I couldn't because I
saw what I thought was uh, uh,

1123
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,670
Daniel Carsello getting
beaten down to the ice.

1124
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:18,500
I saw this saber and this flyer go at
it and they appeared to both drop the

1125
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:22,160
gloves and the Saber guy
went, what? Dash where?

1126
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,950
Dash twice straight in this guy's face.

1127
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:29,210
And by the second one the guy was
falling backwards to the ice and he did,

1128
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:32,720
you know that final UFC,
you're not knocked out enough.

1129
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:35,670
I'm going to punch you as
you're on the ground overhand,

1130
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:39,620
right where [inaudible] to his
fucking face. And I was like, wow.

1131
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:45,920
Wow. Who was that? Who did that?
And who was that? Who got fucked up?

1132
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:50,090
And then five minutes later Carsello
was over by the penalty box and he got a

1133
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:53,930
game is conduct. I go, did he do that
to Carsello and was he embarrassed?

1134
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:56,810
So he came out and he tried to do a
handsome brother thing and fight him.

1135
01:09:56,811 --> 01:10:00,290
The second the dude came out and,
uh, turned out it wasn't him,

1136
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,950
it was somebody else. And I heard
he didn't even drop the gloves,

1137
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:08,360
which is explain why.
What does we're dodge would doge happened.

1138
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:09,861
How do you do that?

1139
01:10:09,861 --> 01:10:12,200
How do you not drop the gloves
when someone else drops the gloves?

1140
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,060
Even if you don't want to fight,

1141
01:10:14,061 --> 01:10:19,061
can't you just fucking dropped the gloves
to hang on and turn the other way and

1142
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:20,450
give up the back of your head?

1143
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,040
How I would have fought in
that bathroom. Oh, the noise.

1144
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:30,500
Can you imagine the noise
of five people trampling me?

1145
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:34,700
The echoing the perfect acoustics
of a fucking goddamn men's room.

1146
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:40,070
Um, anyways, so, uh, and then we end
the night, the end of the night we, uh,

1147
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:42,290
we saw a great God damn game,

1148
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:48,530
saw that six 48 psychopath that I
want to see Chara fight on defense.

1149
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,330
And then we went,
uh,

1150
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:55,360
we left and going down to anchor bar and
we show up and get this for the third

1151
01:10:55,581 --> 01:10:58,640
time in the history of that place,
they ran out of wings.

1152
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,260
They ran out of winks. Like,
are you fucking kidding me?

1153
01:11:03,261 --> 01:11:08,000
Went down there to watch the giants game
versus a big giants fan.

1154
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:13,350
Right. So we go, fuck it,
we'll stay here anyways.

1155
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,420
And uh, I dunno, ask Paul about there.

1156
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,970
I don't want to trash the place
cause I know which legendary,

1157
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:25,971
but go on Paul's Facebook page and ask
him how he enjoyed the mixed drinks there

1158
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,420
because, uh, he had a little issue.
He had a little bit of an issue there.

1159
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:34,530
You know what I mean? You
know the deal a, let me get,

1160
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,120
let me get absolute, uh, on the rocks
and the, Eh, absolutely. You know,

1161
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,360
and then you just see them pouring it
out of a fucking jelly jar and you're

1162
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:49,110
like, what? What kind of absolute
is that? Eh, ah, absolutely.

1163
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,650
Uh, my friends, vodka daddy
makes down the street.

1164
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:56,850
You fucking pricks. So we actually
didn't have a good time and anchor bar.

1165
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,050
We showed up and uh,

1166
01:11:58,051 --> 01:12:01,320
they were out of wings and then
they tried to pass off some shit.

1167
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:04,710
Vodka is the real thing.
Is that how they do it at the anchor bar?

1168
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,850
I'm still going to go back
there and try their wings.

1169
01:12:08,851 --> 01:12:11,430
I gotta I gotta check it out. I
mean, I liked everything inside.

1170
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:14,580
You go inside there and they had like
fucking, it was like a motorcycle museum,

1171
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,010
like real motorcycles above it.

1172
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:22,220
They had license plates everywhere
from like Hawaii to like the northwest

1173
01:12:22,651 --> 01:12:27,210
territories. They like license
plate shaped like a bear in there.

1174
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:32,160
That's how far north these fucking ice
road truckers come to calm down and get

1175
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:36,390
the MCL, some fucking buffalo
wings. So we did it up.

1176
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,600
We did Buffalo,
you know,

1177
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:42,240
actually if I got into a fight and
lost but didn't really get hurt,

1178
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:43,800
that really would have made,
that would have been great.

1179
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:48,210
A little bit of blood in my purple fucking
raincoat. The fuck is wrong with me,

1180
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:52,410
but let's get to the questions this week
everybody. This is actually a really a,

1181
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,030
considering that that happened. And, um,

1182
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,470
I let me, I just, I had
somebody sent me a great

1183
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:07,980
podcast question about
that under the new topic,

1184
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,520
sports cuts. Um, and by the way,

1185
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:14,030
I'm going to get out of the sports
talk after a while, cause like,

1186
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:17,040
remember when I went real hardcore
conspiracy theory and talked about banks

1187
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:18,480
every week and then that got boring.
Well,

1188
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:21,110
the sports thing is only going to be
interesting for so fucking long, but uh,

1189
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,810
we are, we're really in the throes of
it right now. I know for a lot of you,

1190
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:29,990
this is like during the soprano's when
Tony was in that fucking a out of body

1191
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:34,110
state where he walked around, didn't talk
like Tony Soprano. Remember that shit?

1192
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,970
Do you, okay. Um, let me adjust the levels
here. Hope these aren't too loud. Okay.

1193
01:13:38,971 --> 01:13:43,500
So here you go. Sports
cuts a bill. Um, all right.

1194
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,333
Anyway,
uh,

1195
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:48,540
all of your jets hating
made me want to email you a,

1196
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:52,560
I went to the jets pats game for week two.
I'm a patriots fan by the way,

1197
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:54,630
and I love to hear you.
Uh,

1198
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,190
your take on fans who attend football
games, it's fucking incredible.

1199
01:13:59,191 --> 01:14:02,190
I went with my girlfriend who
was wearing a Brady Jersey.

1200
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:06,210
Now know that this is an
away game. Everybody, okay.

1201
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:11,270
They went to New Jersey to watch the
New York jets play in giants stadium.

1202
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:17,980
It's [inaudible] which
fucking middlish shut up. Um,

1203
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:22,330
we pull into the parking lot and every
and people were literally moving their

1204
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:25,720
chairs into the open
parking open parking space,

1205
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:30,160
not letting me park saying
patriots aren't allowed here.

1206
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,840
And He, the guy writes, ha ha ha,
I get it now. Can you please move?

1207
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:40,030
No one would fucking move. It's amazing.
It's like, okay, I fucking get it.

1208
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:42,850
You hate the patch now. Get the
fuck out of my way and let me park.

1209
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:47,920
So they finally move and we get out
and start walking towards the stadium.

1210
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,280
Uh, he goes, these people
start following us,

1211
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:56,050
calling us every name you can think of.
Um,

1212
01:14:56,170 --> 01:15:00,880
and he's like, like, really?
Do you have a f? Do you, what?

1213
01:15:00,881 --> 01:15:05,320
Do you have a fucking family or anything
else in your life? You take this game,

1214
01:15:05,321 --> 01:15:10,150
this seriously? I would've said something,
but there were like nine guys. Well, Hey,

1215
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,930
welcome to my world. Welcome
the Meyer with. He's just thank,

1216
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:17,290
thank God you weren't taking
a piss at that time. Uh,

1217
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,280
but they were like nine guys in
like six girls calling me up,

1218
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,820
patriots loving faggot. Then
he writes faggot. Really?

1219
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:29,590
So we keep walking and pass some normal
people who heckle in the right way.

1220
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:34,450
You're going down, Brady sucks.
I get that. Ha Ha. It's fine. Um,

1221
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:39,100
best come back by the way is just to
keep walking through the parking lot,

1222
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,110
responding with 1969.

1223
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,890
They hate that, but I only pull
that card in response. Okay.

1224
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:49,330
So now we're going up the escalator.

1225
01:15:49,331 --> 01:15:54,331
Some guys going the other way on the
escalator and starts screaming you Rhombus

1226
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:58,630
is ugly as that fucking
Brady Jersey you have on. Oh,

1227
01:15:58,631 --> 01:16:01,780
they're saying that to your
girlfriend. Wow. Go Back to Boston.

1228
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:05,200
You faggot a what the fuck?
Uh,

1229
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,890
then at our seats there was a fucking Jew.

1230
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:12,970
Stupp roid head screaming his
fucking face off, turning red,

1231
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:16,150
punching the shit out of the seats,
screaming the entire game.

1232
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,800
There was a fucking dad and his 12
year old daughter in front of us.

1233
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:26,650
Anyway, I just love to hear your take on
these fucking lunatics. Like I get it.

1234
01:16:26,651 --> 01:16:27,940
You love football,
but really,

1235
01:16:27,941 --> 01:16:32,200
is there nothing else in your
life that you take this seriously?

1236
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:36,880
Um, all right. Um,

1237
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,970
while you're talking to a guy who's
been on boats, I've never gone,

1238
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,070
I've never called someone a
faggot and I never do that.

1239
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:45,310
There's more of us than you.
So I'm to try to intimidate you thing.

1240
01:16:45,311 --> 01:16:46,540
I'm more of the,
uh,

1241
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,130
loan wise ass talking shit to someone
who can beat the shit out of me.

1242
01:16:51,131 --> 01:16:53,500
But this is what you got to understand.
All right?

1243
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:58,540
Just to avoid these
situations as sports fans,

1244
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:04,120
um, this is, this is what I've found.
You can, all right, first of all,

1245
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:08,710
if you're going to go into
another person's stadium, okay.

1246
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:13,340
And not only were the other team's Jersey,

1247
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,520
but the Jersey of a team that is
literally kicked the shit out of the other

1248
01:17:20,331 --> 01:17:21,320
team.
I mean,

1249
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:26,690
the Patriots since 2001 have basically
kicked the shit out of the jets twice a

1250
01:17:26,691 --> 01:17:30,680
year. Every fucking year for
almost 10 years, or the very least,

1251
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:34,790
we've won like 80% of the fucking games.
Um,

1252
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:39,610
so that jersey, it's like, you know,
you got to understand that you're,

1253
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:43,730
you're bringing up a lot of bad
memories. Um, and I'm, yeah,

1254
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,490
those people who actually
don't let you park there. Yeah,

1255
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:50,540
they are taking it too far.
There's a little bit on both sides,

1256
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:55,250
you know what I mean?
It's like you kind of,

1257
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,890
you know,
you know,

1258
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:02,090
slicing your leg and then jumping in a
shark infested water and then getting

1259
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:06,950
upset that you get your
fucking leg bid off. I mean,

1260
01:18:06,951 --> 01:18:11,480
I think it's bullshit. Uh, I don't know,

1261
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:15,500
but I do get it. Like people
should get shit. Okay.

1262
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:19,400
That roided out guys. Who, who's
punching the back of the seats? Like the,

1263
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:23,150
I mean that's, that's kind of par
for the course. I hate to say it,

1264
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:25,700
it is par for the course.
Like the eagles fans really get,

1265
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:30,740
our Philly fans get way too much
credit for psychos. They kind of act,

1266
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:34,160
it's kind of like racism, how they act
like it's only white people in the south.

1267
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,180
You know,

1268
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:40,180
like that's where it is and it's Kinda
like Philly gets all the shit or credit

1269
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:45,191
depending if you're proud of it and not
that like only moron asshole fans are in

1270
01:18:45,711 --> 01:18:48,770
Philly. I mean, I've been to
games in Philly, the word,

1271
01:18:48,771 --> 01:18:50,840
one of the worst experiences I had was uh,

1272
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:55,130
going to a San Diego chargers game once
again with my Patriot fucking hat on

1273
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:59,600
like an asshole. You'd think
I learned from that. Um,

1274
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,100
yeah, my take on that is,
yeah, you know, there should be

1275
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:10,640
this fun talking shit and then there's
the talk and shit where it's not fun.

1276
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,300
Like someone pushes you away trying to
take a piss or they start, you know,

1277
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:17,690
seeing your girlfriend's ugly or whatever
the fuck they were trying to say there.

1278
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:23,000
Um, but you know, if you wear the
Jersey of the o team, you walk in,

1279
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:28,001
you got to expect that someone's going
to call you a pussy or probably throw the

1280
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:34,340
last bite of their hotdog at you. What's
going to happen? People are drinking and,

1281
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:36,530
uh, you know, a lot of people
don't like their lives.

1282
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:40,940
They don't like who they're married to.
Maybe they don't like their job. Um,

1283
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,310
or maybe they're just a
Dick, who knows? But, uh,

1284
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,360
you gotta understand that basically,
you know,

1285
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:53,390
you wore the Jersey of a team that's
won three Superbowls into the stadium.

1286
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:56,030
Have a team that,
like I said,

1287
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:59,600
Charlie Chaplin was alive the
last time that jets wanting, okay,

1288
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,880
Harry Truman was alive.

1289
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:07,860
Dwight d Eisenhower was alive the
last time. The jets wanting all right.

1290
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,810
And I'm not trying to give the judge Shit,
I'm just,

1291
01:20:09,811 --> 01:20:11,250
I'm just trying to show compassion here.

1292
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:15,840
Brett Farve wasn't even alive the
last time the jets wanted. Okay,

1293
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:21,120
so you gotta, you gotta be a little more
compassionate to the jets fan. I mean,

1294
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:25,770
like the Dallas cowboys were considered
bridesmaids could always get to the big

1295
01:20:25,771 --> 01:20:30,540
dance, but could never win it. The
last time the jets, when the Superbowl,

1296
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:34,890
you know,
Richard Nixon was president.

1297
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,250
Spiro Agnew was vice president.

1298
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:46,950
Cost of a new home was $27,500.
That was the average price.

1299
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:51,120
Average cost of a new car was $3,270.

1300
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,110
The last time that Jay,

1301
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:58,050
I'm not giving the judge Shit here by
bringing out these staggering facts.

1302
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,240
I'm just trying to say, you know, you
gotta, you gotta show a little compassion.

1303
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:07,650
You have to understand that these poor
bastards, the last time they won it,

1304
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:11,340
the population of this country
was only at 202 million.

1305
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,620
Do you want to stand that
they have one in a long fucking time.

1306
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,220
Price of gas was 35 fucking sense.

1307
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:24,330
Do you really think that you're going to
walk in with the Jersey of a guy who's

1308
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:28,350
created them so much fucking misery,
who was a haircut that they can't stand?

1309
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,410
Who's banging the hottest fucking
broad in the planet right now?

1310
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,890
You don't live in the life that
they want to live, but can't,

1311
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,350
you know as they strain in the upper deck
to try to figure out what the fuck is

1312
01:21:40,351 --> 01:21:44,790
going on? Yes. You're going to get
called a faggot. Do I think it's right?

1313
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,730
No.
I wish there was friendlier ball busting.

1314
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:52,200
I really wish that more people knew how
to break balls and including myself.

1315
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:57,300
More people knew when to shut
the fuck up like me, you know,

1316
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:02,520
like I should have, I should have
tapped out buddy and I didn't. So, uh,

1317
01:22:02,521 --> 01:22:04,420
anybody have any odd, bad sporty, uh,

1318
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:08,310
what's your worst experience as a fan?

1319
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:10,770
Like I could tell you,
like back in the day,

1320
01:22:10,771 --> 01:22:15,771
I would wear like a red sox
hat to a Yankees game in
Yankee stadium before 2004,

1321
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,440
I would do it because,
you know,

1322
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:21,691
we had,

1323
01:22:21,691 --> 01:22:26,400
what did we do to them
except blow leads and lose.

1324
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:30,120
But once we fucking hung the biggest
choke and professional sports history

1325
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:33,390
around their goddamn next,
then it became a different thing.

1326
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:34,440
And then we won it again.

1327
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,890
And then all of a sudden I noticed it
started getting hostile. I was like,

1328
01:22:37,891 --> 01:22:41,350
all right, this isn't cool
anymore. This isn't being taken as,

1329
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,380
this isn't a funny thing anymore.
This I'm not the fucking, uh,

1330
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:47,970
the fucking happy go lucky kid
who's just hoping to see it once.

1331
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:50,630
I've seen it twice since
the last time they won it.

1332
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:53,670
And I notice simply
got ugly this same way.

1333
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,440
The Patriot's stadium went from a,

1334
01:22:56,441 --> 01:23:00,480
an absolute fucking zoo to being this,

1335
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:04,620
this sort of classier place to go see
a Goddamn game when we were winning.

1336
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:08,810
And that was the thing. Anybody can be
classy when they're winning, but you know,

1337
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,040
you see who your fans really are
when you're fucking losing. Yeah.

1338
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:13,660
Like when the Patriots,
I mean,

1339
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:16,960
red sox finally beat the Yankees and
that they didn't like when a rod slap the

1340
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:19,150
ball down. They didn't like
that. They didn't get that call.

1341
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,870
Like they had been so many other
fucking years. That goddamn fans,

1342
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,920
Poland routine fly balls into
the fucking stands for home runs,

1343
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,740
Reggie Jackson leaning into the ball.

1344
01:23:29,741 --> 01:23:32,530
They always get those calls and all of
a sudden they didn't get and they threw

1345
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:36,160
fucking tamper tantrum started
littering the field. Right.

1346
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:40,840
The classy Manhattan nights that
they are. So, I dunno. Yeah.

1347
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,760
Um, yes. Basically all sports fans,

1348
01:23:44,761 --> 01:23:48,630
behavior needs to be a needs to improve.
And uh,

1349
01:23:48,631 --> 01:23:52,950
it starts with me just like
that Michael Jackson Song. Huh?

1350
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:56,520
Starting with the man in the mirror.
Um,

1351
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:01,420
no one did. They push me purple on purple
rain coat. I wasn't even fucking ticket,

1352
01:24:01,421 --> 01:24:04,600
I would have pushed me too. All
right. Question of the week. Uh,

1353
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:08,690
somebody wrote bill, why do
you hate stoners? Oh yeah.

1354
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:12,500
Cause last week I was making fun of my
stone, a friend. Uh, I don't hate stoners.

1355
01:24:12,501 --> 01:24:13,011
I was,
I'm,

1356
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:17,990
I don't like stoners who call me up and
trash my life because they don't like

1357
01:24:17,991 --> 01:24:22,090
their own. All right. Stop making it
about yourself. All right. And uh,

1358
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:25,530
this person actually wrote and thought
that I smoked weed, which is a,

1359
01:24:25,531 --> 01:24:29,100
that's one of the things that is a known
unknowing about stoners is after they

1360
01:24:29,101 --> 01:24:30,360
smoke long enough,

1361
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:35,750
they think that the only way to have
creative thought is to be sucking the Dick

1362
01:24:36,211 --> 01:24:37,170
of that plant.

1363
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,213
Okay.

1364
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:47,240
Well I just lost my stone or
pop. I just don't, uh, um, I
don't, you know what it is.

1365
01:24:47,241 --> 01:24:52,210
I don't like the fucking, I don't like
putting smoke in my lungs. Yeah. I just,

1366
01:24:52,211 --> 01:24:54,520
you know, there's two things.
You don't want your lungs, okay.

1367
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:56,410
You don't want smoke and
you don't want water.

1368
01:24:56,870 --> 01:25:01,580
So I wouldn't slowly inhale
a glass of water, you know,

1369
01:25:01,581 --> 01:25:05,140
and slowly drown myself over 60 years.
I wouldn't do that either. But, uh,

1370
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:09,350
I have to admit I've tried
weed a couple of times.

1371
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:13,140
I didn't try it till I was like
37 to how hilarious is that?

1372
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,340
And then I finally tried it and it
was exactly what I was afraid of was I

1373
01:25:17,341 --> 01:25:21,610
fucking loved it. But, uh, I just
can't, I just can't get that,

1374
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:25,370
that image of that person smoking through
the hole in their throat. I just, yeah,

1375
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:28,360
I don't want lung cancer, so
I don't fuck with it. But uh,

1376
01:25:28,361 --> 01:25:32,440
it's a lot harder to see your
liver shriveling up as you booze.

1377
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,220
MMM. Anyways. Hey Bill,
have you seen the uh,

1378
01:25:36,221 --> 01:25:41,100
the infomercial for the I renew bracelet?
I'm sure you have.

1379
01:25:41,101 --> 01:25:45,270
It's this magic bracelet that makes you
have better balance, strength, endurance,

1380
01:25:45,271 --> 01:25:49,620
and sleep better. Hell, you might even
be wearing one right now to bring up,

1381
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:52,170
to bring the funny out in you.
Uh,

1382
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:56,610
it's a little piece of rubber with a shiny
piece of metal on it probably cost $2

1383
01:25:56,611 --> 01:26:01,520
to make a hundred of them. Yeah. Um, it
channels your body's energy or some shit.

1384
01:26:01,521 --> 01:26:04,250
Maybe it works. I don't
know. You know what's crazy?

1385
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:07,100
People are buying these
things for $20 a pop.

1386
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,380
Someone's getting rich off this gimmick.

1387
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:13,490
God bless them for finding an
angle to make some dough. Uh,

1388
01:26:13,491 --> 01:26:17,930
I think it's in the same category
as the $50 gold coins for 10 bucks.

1389
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,080
Yeah,
it's exactly at,

1390
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:25,120
I think whoever came up with that as a
genius and those really bad actors where

1391
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:27,500
they,
they act like they can't stand upright.

1392
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:32,300
Yet somehow they were able to make it
to the mall to go on film with those

1393
01:26:32,301 --> 01:26:35,450
stupid braces. And the second they put
the bracelet on, oh my God. It's amazing.

1394
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:40,040
Like I can't believe it. Um, yeah.
Bracelets are a great way to go.

1395
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,200
You know what you do make a
bracelet that actually says a,

1396
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:49,760
it'll make your dick bigger or give
you a flat tummy for the ladies.

1397
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:54,620
You know, something like that. I
Dunno. I'm getting sleepy again.

1398
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,140
I told you some good stories here,
haven't I?

1399
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:00,650
You know the last time that
jet's won the Superbowl,

1400
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:05,680
Jim Brown was the all time Russia leading
rusher and behind him was Joe Perry,

1401
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:11,890
not from Smith.
Joe Perry from 1948 or so.

1402
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:15,170
I don't even all the fuck he played
for the top three would Jim Brown,

1403
01:27:15,171 --> 01:27:18,080
Joe Perry and Jim Taylor.
Okay.

1404
01:27:18,081 --> 01:27:23,081
The guy from fucking Smith was
second behind Jim Brown in rushing.

1405
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,140
That's how long it's been since
the jets have wanted. So yeah,

1406
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:32,141
you can't wear a Tom Brady
Jersey down there by the way.

1407
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:37,630
Thank God my patriots fucking one tonight.

1408
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:42,590
Jesus Christ. And I'll tell you as
much as the score was, uh, you know,

1409
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:45,980
lopsided there. Jeez,
there's a lot of water.

1410
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:50,600
There's a lot of water leaking
into that ship. Jesus Christ,

1411
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:53,840
I don't know what the
fuck is with our defense,

1412
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:57,680
but so much of the game we look like we're
in a proven, it's fucking ridiculous.

1413
01:27:57,681 --> 01:28:01,790
So my big prediction this
week, now, my big prediction,

1414
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:05,450
my big question this week is if
Ben Roethlisberger comes back,

1415
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:11,110
doesn't miss a goddamn step and just
plays the way that guy can play and that

1416
01:28:13,011 --> 01:28:17,570
defense plays the way it's been
playing, uh, I put them on top,

1417
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,940
the AFC, I would say that they, they are,

1418
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:24,710
they are the team to beat the fact that
they went three and one with a third

1419
01:28:24,711 --> 01:28:27,500
string fucking quarterback
and basically all, I mean

1420
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,150
we're what they lost in like the last
play of the game. They will, they will,

1421
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:37,010
they were that close to going for and oh,
that's how good their fucking defenses.

1422
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:40,880
And then not only that, that third string
quarterback got all that experience.

1423
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:43,850
I'll tell you, big Ben comes in, right?

1424
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:46,460
And just kicks ass.

1425
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:50,990
And then they just stick them in an
armored car and they drive him past all

1426
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:52,760
those Hooters and just get them home.

1427
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:56,360
I think the Steelers might
be going for number seven.

1428
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:01,770
How fucking Badass would that be? That
would be that. That would something.

1429
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:06,030
Um, all right, here we go. I
remember a couple of years ago,

1430
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:08,130
we will want Superbowl behind
them. I'm like, here we go,

1431
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:12,570
Steelers and next we're going to catch
them. And then what happened? Nothing.

1432
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,290
Then they want to more so we're
fucking in the dust again.

1433
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,030
All right asshole friends.

1434
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:21,570
I asked you guys for some stories about
asshole friends. Here's one for you. Uh,

1435
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:25,500
just wanting to, so, uh, put
up the right off the bed. Okay.

1436
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,830
Where do I start this?
Fuck you guys. I'm tired.

1437
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:30,570
Why don't I just start at the beginning?

1438
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:33,030
Just wanted to say I know exactly what
it's like to have a buddy who always

1439
01:29:33,031 --> 01:29:37,080
seems to have shit in his diaper and
just has that puppy dog look in his eye

1440
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:41,820
that says, hey bro, can you deal
with my shit before I get a rash? Uh,

1441
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,840
last night I was at a local bar just
relaxing and enjoying a couple of beers

1442
01:29:45,841 --> 01:29:50,220
with the girl I'd been talking to and
a buddy I hadn't seen in about a year.

1443
01:29:50,221 --> 01:29:52,950
Moseys on over. I'm excited. You know,

1444
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:57,930
he's an old high school buddy and I'm
expecting to have a good couple of good

1445
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:02,700
lasts with this guy right off the
bat. I asked him how he's doing, uh,

1446
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:06,330
just expecting them to say, you know,
say something like, good, how about you?

1447
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:11,700
Like any normal icebreaking human
being. Right? But he says, I say,

1448
01:30:11,701 --> 01:30:15,420
how are you doing? Uh, he just size

1449
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,990
and looks at his beer and then do
his feet. And I'm just like, Gad,

1450
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:25,890
damn it. Here we go. He
goes on about, I was,

1451
01:30:25,891 --> 01:30:30,270
mommy kicked him out of the House that
he's got something wrong with his neck,

1452
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:34,140
that a heat pad won't get out.
Something about a Dui.

1453
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,620
Then he has the nerve to complain
how he got turned down for government

1454
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:42,270
assistant checks. It's like, if, have
you ever heard of AIDS in Africa,

1455
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,390
motherfucker of Jesus. You went all
the way to the end with that one. Uh,

1456
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:49,470
needless to say, I'm getting annoyed
at this point and I say, well shit man,

1457
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:53,100
you know, we all got to grow
up. What a great fucking line.

1458
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:57,480
Then I offered to talk to my boss to
try and get this guy a job so he can get

1459
01:30:57,481 --> 01:31:00,300
back on his feet.
He then looks offended,

1460
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:05,670
pissed off that I didn't rub his belly
wipe is bubbling lips and tell him

1461
01:31:05,671 --> 01:31:08,880
everything was going to be just fine
and throw a couple of quarters into his

1462
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:13,710
Little Tin Cup. Exactly,
exactly. How old are you?

1463
01:31:13,711 --> 01:31:17,790
Fucking move on and get a
Goddamn job, you bum. Um,

1464
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:21,930
so anyways, the guy announces when
he, after the kids said, uh, you know,

1465
01:31:21,931 --> 01:31:23,460
we all got to grow up sometime he,

1466
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:27,330
and he announces I wasn't
born to be a slave dude.

1467
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:31,830
Fuck that noise. And
I'm just thinking, yeah,

1468
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:36,210
maybe you shouldn't have been born at all.
As I turned back to my lady,

1469
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,920
I know that's a harsh thought,

1470
01:31:37,921 --> 01:31:41,460
but when you're born with the fully
functioning brain in a nice area,

1471
01:31:41,461 --> 01:31:46,050
with a good educational system, with every
opportunity in the world to not suck,

1472
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:49,560
and you still apply for
government assistance, it's like,

1473
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:56,000
do us tax rape victims of favor and do
a triple Lindy Rodney Dangerfield style

1474
01:31:57,271 --> 01:32:01,780
down a flight of fucking
unforgiving. All right. Uh, yeah.

1475
01:32:01,781 --> 01:32:06,520
I have to go with you on that
one. Um, yeah, those guys,

1476
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:09,880
they're the fucking worst. I love that
you said that to them too. While you know,

1477
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:11,110
we all got to grow up sometime.

1478
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:17,230
I wasn't put on this earth
to be his slave marriage.

1479
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:20,500
What are you fucking King?

1480
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:23,320
You're just going to sit around and
have other people bring wealth to ya.

1481
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,460
I Dunno. I got no comeback for
him. I'm fucking exhausted.

1482
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:31,390
I'm going to wrap this up then I shut it
off again. No, I did not know. All right.

1483
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:32,890
Let's wrap it up. A little. Overrated,

1484
01:32:32,891 --> 01:32:36,610
underrated and some youtube
videos for the week. Um,

1485
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:42,490
overrated. Uh, popular rap
and hip hop music since 1994.

1486
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:48,250
Um, if a six month old song is considered
dated and dead than it wasn't good to

1487
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:53,170
begin with. No one listens to jar
rule or Nelly or 50 cent anymore,

1488
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:57,160
just like no one will listen to Kanye
West or little Wayne in five years.

1489
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:01,360
If music we're a food than modern
mainstream rap would be Mcdonald's.

1490
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:02,860
It's on every corner.

1491
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:07,060
Easy to put together and it
gives grownups horrible diarrhea.

1492
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:11,530
All right. I don't know much about hip
hop, but you know, think little Wayne

1493
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:17,890
50 cent now, uh, since 1994.

1494
01:33:17,891 --> 01:33:19,840
What about Biggie?
You didn't like any of this shit.

1495
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:25,100
There's a couple of guys I know wasn't
Nas illmatic wasn't around then.

1496
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:28,090
I don't know about that album,
but everybody says that is unbelievable.

1497
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:33,340
I know what you're saying though. All
these auto tune fucking songs out there.

1498
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:35,020
I get it. I get it. All right. Underrated.

1499
01:33:35,021 --> 01:33:39,080
Not going out every weekend and
spending $100 at a bar or a club. Yeah,

1500
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:42,820
I'm 21 and I'm supposed to get out there
and have fun, meet New People and Shit.

1501
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:43,991
But like you said,

1502
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:46,930
it's hard to meet girls when it sounds
like you've got a bass drum chilling in

1503
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:51,520
your ear. Just not, just not
in a way, it's some broad,
you know, you won't sleep,

1504
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,210
you know, won't sleep. What?

1505
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,270
Just nodding away at some broad,
you know,

1506
01:33:58,271 --> 01:34:01,240
you won't sleep with and
you're just hoping to,

1507
01:34:01,241 --> 01:34:05,350
God she didn't just ask you a
question that requires an answer.

1508
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,930
Call me lame,
but I'd rather hang out on a porch.

1509
01:34:07,931 --> 01:34:10,900
On a nice night with some good friends,
sweet girls.

1510
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:12,670
Just fucking drinking a good beer.

1511
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:18,090
You ran a country song here hanging
out on the front porch with some good

1512
01:34:18,401 --> 01:34:23,401
friends is a sweet girls drinking some
fucking good bear with the game on me and

1513
01:34:25,301 --> 01:34:29,290
a good conversation and rock
and roll in a CD player.

1514
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:30,550
I'm not writing these lyrics.

1515
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:35,980
Maybe you won't wake up with a hole
in your pocket and bleed nears.

1516
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:41,460
Let's do it for America. Keep
it up, mother fucker. Yeah.

1517
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,770
All right. Youtube videos. Yeah, I hear
what you're saying dude. Yo Chill at home.

1518
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,350
Fucking try to bang the girl next
door. There you go. Save your money.

1519
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:52,780
And with that I am with that.
I got a a underrated, uh,

1520
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:57,130
not having a bunch of dumb dumb whores
with their tits and ass is hanging,

1521
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:59,450
run out on a football
field during halftime.

1522
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,930
I want the old fucking school
bands to come back out again.

1523
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:04,190
Did you see that horse shit tonight?

1524
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:09,080
You know Kelly Rowland up
in the stands said, oh,

1525
01:35:09,081 --> 01:35:12,350
it was the girl from Destiny's
child. We am I survive. Is

1526
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:18,440
it
gives a fuck.

1527
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:21,110
Who gives up and she's up on the stand,

1528
01:35:21,111 --> 01:35:25,850
like the desperately trying to make
music without a band. Interesting.

1529
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:30,440
I'm sick of it. I want musicians
to come back, you know,

1530
01:35:30,441 --> 01:35:34,950
and I want them to play
in musical fucking, uh,

1531
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:38,840
atmospheres. I don't want to
see it. A fucking football game.

1532
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:43,190
Get a goddamn hundred men marching
band to come out there. Right.

1533
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:49,600
Just play the old school songs. But I
have it up. Bam, Bam, Bam and Amsterdam.

1534
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:52,220
Bam, Bam, Bam and eminent.
Yeah, but that's shit.

1535
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:56,630
You fucking come out there with you God
damn shit. Talking about breast cancer.

1536
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:58,070
I understand. I know. It's a problem.

1537
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,590
You didn't write your fucking
song for breast cancer.

1538
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:08,600
You're trying to use breast cancer now
to, to, to sell some more fucking cds.

1539
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,010
Huh? Because that other one with the
awful voice is selling more than you.

1540
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:13,963
Is that what you're doing?

1541
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:21,170
How was that less offensive than Janet
Jackson's titty coming out is fucking

1542
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:23,660
beyond me.
Tell you that right now.

1543
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:28,720
You know all those fucking whores walking
around with their fucking asses and

1544
01:36:29,261 --> 01:36:33,830
titties, hanging out. You know, why
don't you fucking get a Goddamn job?

1545
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,680
You'd dumb whores, Jesus. Fuck.

1546
01:36:36,681 --> 01:36:39,980
What would you be doing if he didn't
have half your goods hanging out of your

1547
01:36:39,981 --> 01:36:44,630
fucking shorts? You know? Do you
have any fucking talent whatsoever?

1548
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:48,590
You can do a split. Great, fantastic.

1549
01:36:48,591 --> 01:36:52,250
Does that mean you got to put on some
cowboy boots and get stuck to the goddamn

1550
01:36:52,251 --> 01:36:56,150
astro turf turf in front of 80,000
fucking people on Monday night football?

1551
01:36:56,151 --> 01:36:58,850
I don't think it does.
I don't think it means that at all.

1552
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:04,940
I think that's,
that's a sign that you suck as a musician.

1553
01:37:04,941 --> 01:37:07,880
If you sing at halftime
at a football game,

1554
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:12,830
that pretty much means either you suck
your music socks or you've completely

1555
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:16,790
sold out as a goddamn musician.
All right,

1556
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:19,100
and that goes to those fucking
kids who play the Superbowl too.

1557
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:24,130
I don't give a shit fucking Bruce
Springsteen screaming about dip and then

1558
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:28,970
sliding around on his fucking knees
like he's not 60 Jesus Christ.

1559
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:34,760
He got some good plastic surgery,
right? That guy was like 35,

1560
01:37:34,761 --> 01:37:39,761
(455) 055-0640 one he's 41 again,

1561
01:37:40,131 --> 01:37:41,240
I don't know how the fuck he did it.

1562
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:45,410
He got his face yanked back and it
actually looks good. You know why?

1563
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:49,550
Cause they practiced on all those real
housewives of fucking New Jersey in

1564
01:37:49,551 --> 01:37:51,620
Orange County and all that shit.
That's what they did.

1565
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:56,340
They practiced on their faces and they
want to go look, let's not do that again.

1566
01:37:56,570 --> 01:38:01,410
All right, let's scratch that technique
of the list. Let's, let's try this.

1567
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,160
That's a little bit better.
She only looks like half a lizard.

1568
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:11,400
That's what you gotta do. Like I
said, it's like fucking hair plugs.

1569
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:15,990
Hair plugs in the goddamn nineties looked
horrific. And now I've got to tell you,

1570
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:18,600
these guys swimming around the pools,
you know,

1571
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:22,710
aside from the psychotic look in
their eye, like, do I look okay?

1572
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,910
Other than that they're their hairline.
I mean, I, I can't tell. All right.

1573
01:38:26,911 --> 01:38:31,800
Youtube videos for the week. I was
talking about those free videos, free,

1574
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:35,670
uh, climbers or jumpers or whatever
the fuck it was. Free runners.

1575
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,860
I wanted to see a chase
scene and somebody said, ah,

1576
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,570
here's a video district be 13 chasing.

1577
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:47,880
Um, I have, these are actually,
I have more, these are just
weird videos this week.

1578
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:52,710
Okay, that's actually a cool
one. Here's a weird one,

1579
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:56,190
a proper possum,
pedicure,

1580
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:02,310
search that. Um, and then
this is one, I swear to God,

1581
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:05,190
I didn't even think it was real,
but look up,

1582
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:10,790
look up sweet home Alabama and
there's some lady singing it.

1583
01:39:12,511 --> 01:39:17,220
Just scroll down past all the Leonard
Skinner and just look for the fat woman

1584
01:39:17,221 --> 01:39:20,280
with one tooth.
And uh,

1585
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:25,260
for some reason I don't think that she
realized that it got a million and a half

1586
01:39:25,261 --> 01:39:29,370
hits. Um, and here's another one.

1587
01:39:29,371 --> 01:39:32,880
Look up fake rapture prank.
This is all one word,

1588
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:37,950
fake rapture, Ra, p. T. U.
R. E, prank, all one word.

1589
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,800
It's basically,
do you guys know what the rapture is?

1590
01:39:40,801 --> 01:39:43,650
Oji Do you know what that is?

1591
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:49,590
That's basically when Jesus, right
before Jesus comes back. Now,

1592
01:39:49,591 --> 01:39:52,710
correct me if I'm wrong.
People in Florida,

1593
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,710
um,
I guess right before he comes back,

1594
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:01,110
like people who are going
to come to go to heaven,

1595
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:05,190
like they're going to be sitting
across from you, like fucking absent.

1596
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:08,370
Mindedly like picking their nose,
thinking about,

1597
01:40:08,371 --> 01:40:10,260
you know what they're
going to do that evening,

1598
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:12,810
and then all of a sudden they're
just not going to be there,

1599
01:40:12,811 --> 01:40:17,700
but their clothes will be there because
evidently you have to be naked to go to

1600
01:40:17,701 --> 01:40:22,020
heaven, right? So your clothes are
going to be there just left behind.

1601
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:26,880
And then everybody who's not
going to have an gets left behind,

1602
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:31,710
and then, uh, the whole
world turns into like the,

1603
01:40:31,711 --> 01:40:36,120
that island on survivor where I think
there's only one person's gonna win.

1604
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:39,330
I don't know what you can
try to do to redeem yourself,

1605
01:40:39,331 --> 01:40:44,331
but basically Jesus is coming back and
this time he's not asking any questions.

1606
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:46,530
There'll be no miracles,

1607
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:51,030
no fucking seven o'clock show where he
does the fish trick with the basket.

1608
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:53,770
No walking on water.
None that horse shit.

1609
01:40:53,771 --> 01:40:58,630
He's coming back like fucking Paul
Kurzy. Right? Is that the name?

1610
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:01,450
Is that fuck Charles Bronson's
name and the death wish movies.

1611
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:05,890
He's coming back to fucking kick the
shit out of all the centers make,

1612
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:10,000
he's coming back to slap
me around a little bit and
then throw me into the fiery

1613
01:41:10,001 --> 01:41:12,160
pits of hell. So, uh,

1614
01:41:12,161 --> 01:41:16,000
they found this Jesus Freak girl and
these Jesus Freak people thought it would

1615
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:20,700
be funny to fake the rapture and make
this fucking Jesus freak chick think that

1616
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:23,410
she got left behind.
And uh,

1617
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:28,411
the fact that this girl is an adult and
gets this freaked out is really the sad

1618
01:41:30,101 --> 01:41:32,380
state of,
uh,

1619
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:37,270
of what organized religion does to
somebody that somebody this old could,

1620
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:41,790
could get freaked out by something
like this is fucking beyond me. And um,

1621
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:47,440
it's tragic. I would speak of that.
Somebody, I can't find where it was.

1622
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:51,760
Somebody wanted me to ask me about
that story where those college kids,

1623
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:53,680
uh,

1624
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:58,680
these college kids taped this other kid
either having sex or fooling around this

1625
01:42:00,851 --> 01:42:04,510
other college kid and it turned
out he was with another dude.

1626
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:10,290
So then the kid was so humiliated because
I guess he wasn't out that he went to

1627
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:14,920
the George Washington bridge
and killed himself. And,

1628
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:19,390
uh, I guess somebody wanted me to
comment on that. That's obviously a,

1629
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:23,650
yeah, that's one of those
fucking things where it's like,

1630
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:29,530
even though they're adults,
they're still kids. And, uh,

1631
01:42:29,531 --> 01:42:32,560
I don't think that they,
they don't think that people understand.

1632
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,420
And even at that age,

1633
01:42:34,421 --> 01:42:38,740
I just don't think that a lot of people
understand the ramifications of what

1634
01:42:38,741 --> 01:42:41,740
they're doing sometimes.
Like how, first of all,

1635
01:42:41,741 --> 01:42:46,741
how fucked up it is to film somebody
the invasion of privacy that that is.

1636
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:51,370
And then when you discover
this about this person,

1637
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:55,180
just the level of humiliation that I
don't know why you would do that to

1638
01:42:55,181 --> 01:42:58,210
somebody. Uh, but

1639
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:04,960
so for an unprecedented third time,
the fucking batteries die. I got,

1640
01:43:04,961 --> 01:43:06,310
I got a bootleg bag,

1641
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:11,200
a fucking thing that Duracell's here.
So let me wrap it up here. Yeah.

1642
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:15,850
Um, yeah, as a, as a
fucking free thinking adult,

1643
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:20,200
I would never, I would never do something
like that to somebody but that age,

1644
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:25,120
you know what? I had the courage to
be like, guys, this is fucking wrong.

1645
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:28,300
Don't do that. Like I, I don't
think I would have to be on,

1646
01:43:28,301 --> 01:43:29,650
I hate to say that about myself,

1647
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:33,700
but I wasn't a strong individual back
then as I think a lot of people aren't at

1648
01:43:33,701 --> 01:43:37,810
that age, which is tragically
how something like that unfolds.

1649
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:40,690
But what's going to be fucked up is the
amount of people getting on their high

1650
01:43:40,691 --> 01:43:41,524
horse,

1651
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:47,970
forgetting what you like at that age and
how so much of it is trying to keep the

1652
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:53,330
uh,
humiliation off of you.

1653
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:57,020
It's a lot of humiliation in
your teen years, actually.

1654
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:01,070
Your childhood right up through those
years to you finally just accept who the

1655
01:44:01,071 --> 01:44:05,210
fuck you are, which is what that
kid never got a chance to do,

1656
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:10,850
which is really sad thing and then freak
the fuck out and it made a really bad

1657
01:44:10,851 --> 01:44:15,710
decision. So, yeah, it's a
fucking tragic story obviously,

1658
01:44:15,711 --> 01:44:17,120
but, oh, I don't like how people,

1659
01:44:17,690 --> 01:44:21,020
once they are an adult and
they're comfortable in their
own fucking skin and who

1660
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:21,854
they are,

1661
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:25,070
we'll then turn around and they're going
to start yelling at these fucking kids

1662
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:29,000
like, uh, like they, they
would have been, you know,

1663
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:33,170
strong enough to go against
the, uh, the mob, you know,

1664
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,330
it's fucked up. All right. You're dealing
with kids who are tactically adults,

1665
01:44:38,331 --> 01:44:43,160
but mentally they don't understand,
you know,

1666
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:48,150
what are they thinking? Oh, this
is going to be funny, you know, uh,

1667
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:49,003
then,
uh,

1668
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:52,460
we'll have the most hits on our fucking
youtube page and then maybe everyone

1669
01:44:52,461 --> 01:44:55,880
will come to our house party and then
we'll get laid. Right? I mean, do they,

1670
01:44:55,910 --> 01:45:00,590
do you really think anywhere beyond
that? You don't really think that, okay,

1671
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:04,790
this is a fucking huge secret.
We just unraveled on this kid.

1672
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:10,280
His kid has family. This kid has
friends. This kid has a life.

1673
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:15,520
You don't think that shit. You
just, I dunno. What's that residual?

1674
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:20,090
A fucking playground shit.
So I don't know, man.

1675
01:45:20,150 --> 01:45:23,150
I know that's a fucking off.
What the fuck did I bring?

1676
01:45:23,151 --> 01:45:27,740
That story up in the end was already
a fucking brutal enough week.

1677
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:33,620
Um, I don't know where the fuck did
I go that route. All right, let's,

1678
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:38,330
let's fucking get off that subject. Um,
all right, that's the podcast this week.

1679
01:45:38,331 --> 01:45:42,710
My Yard DVD,
my DVD comes out,

1680
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,630
um,
comes out tomorrow,

1681
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:52,180
Tuesday the fifth in stores,
whatever stores still sell it. And a,

1682
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:54,380
it makes a great stocking
stuffer as I said,

1683
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:57,680
for someone that you have to buy a
gift for but don't particularly like,

1684
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,090
or if somebody you do like,

1685
01:45:59,091 --> 01:46:02,780
and I gotta tell you this
is really totally different
than the special that you

1686
01:46:02,781 --> 01:46:04,430
saw on TV if you've already seen it.

1687
01:46:04,730 --> 01:46:09,210
They really took out two huge bits
and then I had other bits that uh,

1688
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:13,820
we just have on there as extras and a,
I would really appreciate if you'd be,

1689
01:46:13,821 --> 01:46:18,020
if you check it out, if you buy it,
that would be a, that would be awesome.

1690
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:21,710
And da and that's it. That's the
podcast for this week. Once again,

1691
01:46:21,711 --> 01:46:25,700
thanks to everybody who came out to see
me at the egg and Albany and everybody

1692
01:46:25,701 --> 01:46:30,650
who came out to see me out in
Buffalo. And uh, that is it.

1693
01:46:30,651 --> 01:46:34,460
Everybody have a good week at a,
yeah,

1694
01:46:34,461 --> 01:46:38,150
don't be fucking video tape and
people trying to humiliate a, alright.

1695
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,030
And if you were the jealousy
where we got this weekend,

1696
01:46:41,031 --> 01:46:46,031
don't fucking wear the Jersey or the
hat of a team that kicks the shit out of

1697
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:49,260
another team and going to their Goddamn
stadium and expect that you're going to

1698
01:46:49,261 --> 01:46:53,210
be treated even remotely
human. Okay. All right, ed.

1699
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:56,770
Uh, and that's it. That's fucking it.

1700
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:02,100
How you like dead fucking jets fans will
fucking patriots are slowly coming back

1701
01:47:02,101 --> 01:47:05,790
together. I still don't, I
don't still don't believe yet.

1702
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:08,250
I still don't fucking believe you had
to still think that jets are going gonna

1703
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:11,850
win the Goddamn Division as much as,
I hate to say it, but, uh, I still,

1704
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:16,230
I think of Ben comes back there. My Hope,
because I think the culture reeling,

1705
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,570
this is how much I fucking hate the jets.

1706
01:47:18,571 --> 01:47:21,440
I'm actually gonna root for the
fucking stealers. Those cons,

1707
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:25,670
who always talk about bill Belichick
filming the other team and completely

1708
01:47:25,671 --> 01:47:30,350
ignore that the super Steelers of the
70s were fucking roided out of their

1709
01:47:30,351 --> 01:47:34,280
minds, out of their fucking
minds. You don't believe me?

1710
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:36,680
Go ask Fran Tarkington.
All right.

1711
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:40,120
That's it. Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
