00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.210
That's it.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.400
You can build a simple
covenant with just this.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.630
Stack up you convulsions, which
thankfully you don't have to implement

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.450
yourselves, then use trieds to
to reduce the dimensional ID and

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.200
increase the depth of your network,
layer after layer.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.890
And once you have a deep and
narrow representation,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.330
connect the whole thing to a few
regular fully connected layers and

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.420
you're ready to train your classifier.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.630
You might wonder what
happens to training,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.070
into the chain rule in particular,
when you use shared weights like this.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.220
Nothing really happens.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.920
The math just works.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.580
You just add up the derivates from all
of the possible locations on the image.
