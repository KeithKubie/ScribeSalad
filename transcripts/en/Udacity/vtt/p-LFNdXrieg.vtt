00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.000
So another type of report I'd like us to take a look at, is the drug

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.530
metabolism reports. because from those we can learn

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.000
how your body will react to particular drugs.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.120
&gt;&gt; So, when you say drugs, do you

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.970
mean, like, prescription drugs or, like, other things, too?

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.080
&gt;&gt; Yes, prescription drugs, but we can also learn

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.600
how we expect your body to react to substances

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.720
such as alcohol and caffeine. So why don't we

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.942
go take a look at your caffeine and metabolism results?

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:25.170
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.100
&gt;&gt; so then we go to My Results again, and then go on Drug Response.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.830
Click Drug Response and we'll see a list of reports and if we scroll down a bit

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.870
&gt;&gt; Oh caffeine metabolism.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, click on the one that says caffeine metabolism. We see here that

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.070
for the particular SNV that's important here,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.920
you have, your homozygous for the a allele.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.560
&gt;&gt; That means I'm a fast caffeine metabolizer, so if

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.580
I drink coffee it didn't increase the subjects heart attack risk.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.045
&gt;&gt; Right, And basically that means you metabolize caffeine quickly and

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:06.880
the caffeine doesn't build up in your body as, as much.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.270
&gt;&gt; It says here that I'm a fast caffeine metabolizer drinking

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.100
coffee here in the study didn't increase the subject's heart attack risk.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.520
&gt;&gt; Okay, yes you have

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.340
the A version at this SNV and that it means you

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.910
have a version the metabolizing enzyme

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.030
that breaks down the caffeine efficiently.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.480
&gt;&gt; So, if I'm a fast metabolizer of caffeine, would

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.300
the effects of caffeine last longer or shorter for me?
