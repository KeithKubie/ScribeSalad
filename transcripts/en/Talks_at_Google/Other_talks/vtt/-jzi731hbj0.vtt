00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.279
Host: Good morning, everyone, and welcome
to this new talk about

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.870
Leadership at Google. I'm extremely honored
and also grateful to receive our

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.970
guest. He was the -- the first speaker on
the first day of the [inaudible] of the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.960
program at Columbia. And, uh, 20 months later
was voted by, uh -- was nominated

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.939
by the students to be the keynote speaker
at the graduation ceremony. I think

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.020
that says something about his talent as a
speaker. His class, "High Performance

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.860
Leadership", is consistently one of the best
ranked if not the highest ranked

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.249
class at Columbia Business School. He spent
20 years at Pepsi as Chief People Officer.

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:50.690
He loves cashmere and good wine. Please welcome
Professor Feiner.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.120
[applause]

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:02.690
Michael: Hi, everybody. It's nice to be here.
It's nice to see such a large

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.440
crowd when today is opening day for the New
York Mets. Umm, uh --

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.440
[laughing]

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.270
Michael: For folks in Kirkland, or Mountain
View, or Seattle, that's a baseball

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.690
team. Uh --

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.690
[laughing]

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.280
Michael: Uh, so I wanna talk to you for a
bit about leadership and I've been

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.140
instructed to advise you that -- to hold your
questions until the end and then,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.090
uh, I will be eager to answer what I hope
are questions as provocative of some

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.420
of the comments I'm gonna make- uh, today.
Umm, I have a lot of passion for

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.090
this subject of leadership. And I would wager
that, uh, anybody who works in

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.490
organizational life has an opinion about leadership.
If you ask people to name

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.660
great leaders, often you hear the names, uh,
Churchill, for David I'll say

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:05.630
Napoleon, Martin Luther King, JFK... And that's
largely because when we think of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.560
great leaders we think of visible leaders,
uh, leaders that we've either read

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.980
about or talked about as kids, it's the way
we're socialized as children. The

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.030
fact is that leadership is really like an
iceberg. 90 percent of it is hidden

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.900
below the surface. It's the things that we
don't see day in and day out, that

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.680
determines whether people are effective in
getting things done in organizations.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.219
It's not about necessarily being a valiant,
courageous, heroic individual, the

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:48.450
way we had typically associate, uh, Napoleon,
or JFK, or Churchill, or Lincoln,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.090
or so forth. Uh, and the fact is that, uh,
we all have opinions about

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.580
leadership, uh --

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.139
Michael: -- But I think it's important to
review quickly, in my opinion, what

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:15.620
leadership is not about. Uh, I don't think
leadership is about grand strategy.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.769
That may sound surprising for an organization
like Google who I suspect is

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.040
grappling now with: What is the business model
over-- within the next five to ten

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.870
years? What is the right strategy? In fact
you've probably aware that you have

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.319
some folks from McKinsey running around trying
to help you sort that out. Now,

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.150
I think strategy's important for any business
but I think the tough part of

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.159
strategy is not formulating it, it's implementing
it. The tough part of

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:54.599
strategy is getting people-- all your Googlers,
to figure out what is the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.059
strategy; to buy into the strategy; to buy
into the strategy; to believe in the

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:04.439
strategy; to row on the ores in the same cadence
and the same rhythm. So, what

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.459
I'm suggesting here the tough part of strategy
is strategy implementation. Not

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.529
strategy formulation. Especially difficult
in an organization like Google which

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:24.060
has grown from 300 people five years ago to
20,000. I don't think leadership's

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.620
about personal charisma. I -- I -- said another
way. I think leaders come in

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.180
all shapes in sizes. Uh, some are short, some
are tall; some dress for success,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.830
some don't; some are modest and self-effacing,
some have big egos. Uh, I think

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.410
leadership practices ultimately determine
whether or not someone is charismatic,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.410
not the reverse.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:58.550
Michael: I don't think leadership is about
inspiring oratory. Uh, I haven't

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.740
seen or heard your famous three make speeches.
Eric, Larry, Sergey, I don't

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.690
know. But having been around organizational
life for many, many, years before I

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.639
started teaching, I think there's very few
people in organizational life who

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:26.241
match JFK, and Martin Luther King, or Gandhi,
or Churchill and so forth. And

00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:32.440
finally, I don't think leadership is about
technical skills. I mean, you're all

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.870
very smart. Google is famous for having very
smart people and a hiring process

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.500
that makes it foolproof that you'll be hired
only if you're very smart. But the

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.659
fact is, umm, I don't think leadership's being
the smartest man or woman in the

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:55.300
room. It's quite likely used -- you who manage
groups of people, you may have

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.849
people working for you who are more technically
expert. I -- very often

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:06.699
leadership is ant being from time to time
a curator or a conductor, as opposed to

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.180
the smartest, most technically expert, functionally
expert person. So if that's

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.539
not what leadership about -- is about then
obviously it must be about accurate

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:17.539
planning and budgeting.

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:26.861
Michael: It must be about sound organizing
and staffing; particularly important

00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:32.550
the larger and larger and organization like
Google becomes. And finally, about

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.310
effective tracking or controlling and problem
solving. That is, tracking how

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.919
you're doing against the operating plan and
then of course problem solving or

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:47.699
making adjustments on the fly, when in fact
things like the great recession beset

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:55.080
us. Now, all those things are important but,
particularly important because they

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.310
add order and consistency and predictability
to an organization, something that

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.789
I'm told Googlers fight very hard to resist.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:08.270
Michael: But the fact is, as important as
order, and consistency,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:15.370
and predictability are, it's really what management
is about. And I think

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.639
management's important for every organization.
Being well-managed is important

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:27.690
whether you're Google or AT&amp;T. But if that's
the only thing you're good at, you

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:34.300
ultimately become the Department of Motor
Vehicles. You become bureaucratic,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.220
lot of red tape, lot of policies, lot of procedures,
lot of rules, which can be

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.770
very unhealthy for any organization. So therefore
it's very important to offset

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:52.229
management-- with leadership. And what leadership
is about is really establishing

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:57.460
direction, Whether you're running a department
or not, whether, in fact, you have

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.599
a department or not. Establishing direction,
for me, is about the vision and

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:08.990
the strategies to get there. It's also about
building alliances and coalitions

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.889
so the product management people, and the
engineers, and the sale -- sales

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:17.310
people actually focus on the prize instead
of fighting with one another, which

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.770
can occur in any organization.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:25.580
Michael: And finally, day in and day out,
once you cut through the game rooms

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:31.889
and the free candy, how excited are you about
your jobs and about coming to work

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:41.500
here, and about collaborating with the people
in the next cubicle? That

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.240
motivating and inspiring is one of the hardest
things to do in organizational

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.930
life. One, for yourself to be motivated and
bring your A-game every day, and

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.500
then to make sure that you can get the people
that you're collaborating with or

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.940
in fact supervising or managing, to make sure
they bring their A-game. It's very hard

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:07.490
to do. Next to raising teenagers, which I've
done four times, motivating and

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:12.300
inspiring people every day, is very difficult.
I don't know about the people in

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.830
California or Washington, but if you take
the subway, the New York City subway to

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:23.360
work every day, which many of you do, and
you look around at the misery on the

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.450
faces of the people --

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.450
[laughing]

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.400
Michael: -- you get a sense that people aren't
terribly motivated and inspired

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.040
about going to work. It's actually quite tragic.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:45.490
Michael: Not so funny. So, if management is
about predictability, and

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.660
consistency, and order, then leadership is
about change and adaptability. An

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.860
organization like Google and the space you're
in has to be particularly

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:04.339
adaptable given the technology and how quickly
it changes in this space,

00:10:04.339 --> 00:10:12.930
adaptable to new technology, new competitors,
new regulation, new competitive

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.670
responses, new customers.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:25.949
Michael: So effective organizations are both
well-led and well-managed. Which

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:31.590
means your challenge is to be concerned about
order, and consistency, and

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.120
predictability-- more than you have been in
the past, in my opinion. But at the

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:42.220
same time, worried about vision and the strategies
to get there, and motivating

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.541
and inspiring people to bring their A-game
to work. So how do you do that?

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:56.100
Michael: I -- the thing that's particularly
important with leadership is

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.880
building "followership", particularly when
this is such a high-transaction,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:06.720
collaborative organization. Influencing people,
not relying on sanction power and

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.029
authority, requires you to influence and persuade.

00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:15.510
Michael: So leadership, in my view, is really
about building followership.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:20.870
It's really about pulling people. It's much
less about the use of power, and

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.100
much more about empowerment of others.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:35.040
Michael: It's really about taking people with
you. And all of that is about

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.139
managing relationships. It's about managing
relationships down in the

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:44.959
organization; it's about managing relationships
up in the organization, sometimes

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:52.199
with knuckle-head bosses. And particularly
important here, at Google, it's about

00:11:52.199 --> 00:12:04.080
managing collaborative peer relationships.
And all of that takes HTHC. All of

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.269
that takes hand-to-hand combat. That is, it's
all of those hundreds of

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:16.180
transactions you have every day up, down,
and across, that gets people to do what

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.930
you think they need to do. That's really what
leadership is about. Leadership

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.370
has nothing to do with your title as you know,
it has nothing to do with your

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.810
sanction, power and authority. It has to do
with influencing and persuading

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.810
people to do what you feel deeply is important
to the success of this

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:43.699
organization. That's why oratory, and strategy,
and charisma won't help here.

00:12:43.699 --> 00:12:47.800
This is why leadership is just like an iceberg,
right? 90 percent of it is

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.970
hidden below the surface.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:13:03.750
Michael: So I wanna talk to you about tactically,
very real-world setting...How do

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.060
you lead people to excel?

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:18.070
Michael: And just as context, umm, I wrote
a book several years ago called "The

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:24.709
Feiner Points of Leadership", where there
are 50 laws, or rules, or principals

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:32.259
that you could use to motivate and inspire
people every day. And, uh, I'm not

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:37.180
gonna go through 50 laws because you'd be
throwing tomatoes at me by the -- by the

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:44.310
20th. But I'd like to go over ten laws that
I think you can use immediately after

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.000
this session, and I think it would enhance
your effectiveness. Umm.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:02.329
Michael: Law No. 1. This is not a typo. This
is meant to add drama here so

00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:03.329
don't --

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:04.329
[laughing]

00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:11.350
Michael: Don't get nervous for me. My slides
are gonna -- they're okay. Uh,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:16.480
this law can best be explained by telling
you a true story. 1968 California

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.570
school district, and teachers are told that
certain third graders have scored

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:30.269
very high on a late bloomer test, and to expect
a learning spurt over the ensuing

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:36.230
school year. Lo and behold, at the end of
the school year, not only did these

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:42.320
third graders improve their performance in
the classroom, but their IQ scores

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:49.500
went up-- quite dramatically, quite unexpectedly,
their IQ scores went up.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:55.410
Surprising? There was no test. It was a ruse.
It was a ploy, it was an

00:14:55.410 --> 00:15:00.509
experiment now known as the Pygmalion Experiment
between this very well-known

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:07.471
social psychologist of the day, and this California
school district. What

00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:14.610
happened? Teachers were told to expect a learning
spurt, and so as a result gave

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:19.259
these third graders -- who reportedly scored
high on this late bloomer test --

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:23.259
they gave these third graders more time, more
attention, more focus, and more

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:24.259
feedback.

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:29.870
Michael: And these third graders, receiving
this increased focus, and

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:36.600
attention, and coaching, improved their performance
in the classroom. This is

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:44.649
what I call the "Law of Expectations". In
my parlance what that means is, when we

00:15:44.649 --> 00:15:47.230
expect people to succeed, they usually do.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:57.259
Michael: So let me say it another way. People
respond to the level of

00:15:57.259 --> 00:16:03.610
confidence you show in them. I would suspect
that in your own lives, given how

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:08.199
successful and how smart you are, this had
an enormous impact because I would

00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:10.050
suspect this was the way you were parented.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:19.290
Michael: The fact is, however, this is an
important attitude or mindset to have

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:25.970
particularly in a collaborative relationship,
where you need ultimately to expect

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.560
people to meet or exceed your expectations,
because if you have people working

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.720
for you in some cases who don't, they know
it regardless of what you tell them.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.560
It's in the ether; it's in the oxygen. So
if you have some concerns about

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.290
people's ability to meet or exceed your expectations,
you better make sure,

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.579
because you are a leader, that you provide
the teaching and enabling that's

00:16:48.579 --> 00:16:54.589
required so that in fact they do ultimately
have your confidence.

00:16:54.589 --> 00:17:04.470
Michael: "Law of Intimacy". It's always amazing
to me when I go into

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:09.410
organizations where I do a fair amount of
consulting and very often leaders will

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.270
say, you know, I'm not happy with my team
and I'd like you to talk with my

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:23.000
people to sort out how I can raise my game;
how I can groove my team. And I

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.890
talk with the people who work for this leader
and the single biggest complaint I

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:36.470
get is," My leader has no idea who I am, what
I'm about, what I stand for, what

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:44.150
my hot buttons are." So the law of intimacy
is all about yes, being focused on

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:49.770
the task, being focused on the responsibilities,
being focused on the to-do list.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.780
But to lead people effectively, you have to
know your people. That doesn't mean

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.210
just understanding the names of their spouse
or their children or their pet.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:03.990
That might be interesting-- What's more important
is sorting out how to get the

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:09.270
best out of them. Do they like a long leash,
a short leash, a lot of

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:15.659
independence, a lot of transactions? You know,
I have four children. The idea

00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:20.640
of treating them exactly the same is preposterous.
Yet, when I talk to leaders

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.140
they tell me, listen, I hear you, Mike, but
I treat -- I understand the law of

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:31.570
intimacy, because I treat everybody the same.
This is a very famous- very important

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:35.930
academic concept. You may wanna write this
down. That is the stupidest thing

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.050
I've ever heard in my life!

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.050
[laughing]

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:43.720
Michael: You ought to be treating everybody
differently, because everybody is

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:49.230
different. Particularly in a place like Google
which prides itself on being such

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.580
an iconoclastic culture.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:59.470
Michael: I mean, the fact is, it's really
important to treat people equitably,

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:04.690
but that doesn't necessarily mean you have
to treat them similarly.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:13.480
Michael: "Law of Building a Cathedral". You
all know, jobs aren't enough for

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:21.150
the soul. Everybody, especially the people
I see on the New York City subway,

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:27.990
need to feel that meaning and purpose is connected
with the work they do.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:38.650
Michael: And that's important because unless
you think you're building a

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:43.500
cathedral, you think you're chopping stone,
and no one wants to chop stone. So I

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.280
think it's important for leaders in this organization,
which means everybody who

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:53.630
works in it, to make sure they understand
whatever their role, whatever their

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:59.539
job, whether they're an engineer involved
in very nitty-gritty things or not,

00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:08.289
ultimately, connecting people is changing
the universe and that cathedral can

00:20:08.289 --> 00:20:14.429
compensate for sometimes the maybe boring
or repetitive work that people are

00:20:14.429 --> 00:20:15.929
doing.

00:20:15.929 --> 00:20:24.789
Michael: "Law of Personal Commitment". This
is real simple. Everybody knows

00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:30.080
that you, as an individual, is committed to
doing your work and meeting your

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:37.720
targets. But you have to be committed to not
just your success, your targets,

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:43.430
your to-do list, your role and your responsibilities,
it's about having some

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:50.700
share of mine for the concerns and success
of the people who work for you and/or

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:57.490
the colleagues you deal with every day. You're
gonna get a lot less trust if

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.270
people think the only thing you care about
is your success and your targets.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:07.830
This is about answering e-mails on time; this
is about doing performance reviews

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:14.590
on time, this is about actually being available
to teach when people have a

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.590
question.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.990
Michael: "Law of Accountability".

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:32.250
Michael: Yes, you have to be concerned about
your targets. But it seems to me,

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:37.690
for accountable people to own it, they have
to have a performance contract with

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:43.059
the people who they are going to depend on
to get their work done. It could be

00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:49.240
on the back of an envelope, but the -- the
performance contract needs to be very

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.690
clear and very specific about what are the
requirements that you expect people

00:21:54.690 --> 00:22:00.740
to meet for you, and what they need from you,
that can able them to satisfy your

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.740
expectations.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:11.169
Michael: But in a place like Google, when
collaborative relationships are so

00:22:11.169 --> 00:22:21.400
intense, and so multifunctional, I think it's
very important to understand the law

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:27.740
of "Pull Versus Push". Yes, you all have strong
points of view and therefore

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:33.760
it's quite normal for you to want to persuade
and influence peers to accept your

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.240
point of view --And there's nothing wrong
with that, except if that's the only

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240
technique you use.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:47.650
Michael: Ultimately, it seems to me, you need
to not only try to persuade and

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.830
influence and assert your point of view, which
all of you pride yourself on

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:59.210
doing quite openly, it seems to me you also
need to involve, and listen, and

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:06.210
engage. It might be interesting to kind of
blend with the push approach, the

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:12.610
pull approach which requires as a first question,
"Help me understand why you feel

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:21.549
that way?" And in fact, throughout your work
you ought to be using both pull and

00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:27.730
push. If you're using ultimately just push,
like I did for a good part of my

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.980
career, people know the pitch you're going
to throw, they know the technique of

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:39.549
influence, and power, and assertiveness, and
ultimately it gets to be a turn-off

00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:41.730
for 'em.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:49.470
Michael: "Law of the Mirror". Very simply:
In a high-collaborative

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:58.120
relationship, in a high-collaborative culture
like this, very often there will

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:06.970
be some conflict. Very often you can go home
at night kicking the cat,

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.309
screaming at your spouse or partner.

00:24:09.309 --> 00:24:19.279
Michael: Yelling at the remote, because those
knuckleheads at work just don't

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:29.310
get it. In those situations, I would strongly
advise you before you get to the

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:35.919
blame game, to look in the mirror and ask
yourself what you're doing that's

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:40.970
contributing to this relationship issue, that's
contributing to this issue

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:48.510
that's getting in the way of collaboration.
Because ultimately, falling into the

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:55.350
trap of concluding it's their problem, is
a losing game. It's a losing gig. In

00:24:55.350 --> 00:25:00.010
fact, usually when there's a relationship
problem, you're both contributing to it

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:04.490
or several people are contributing through
it -- to it, so I would suggest you

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:11.070
ask yourself that question, and then ask the
colleague what is it that you're

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.380
doing that's contributing to the problem.
You'd be amazed at how effective that

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.840
can be.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.770
Michael: Leading teams. Some of you lead teams,
both officially and

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:22.770
unofficially.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:30.640
Michael: And so, a good story to remember
about leading teams --

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:42.140
Michael: -- is the story first about none
of us is as smart as all of us.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:48.299
Yes, teams can take more time, teams slow
down the process sometimes-- but if you have

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:53.240
the mindset that none of us is as smart as
all of us you usually get to the

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:59.779
right outcomes. But the story that I think
is most effective in understanding

00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:03.270
teams, is the story about Michael Jordan,
the famous basketball player,

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:11.419
Michael: who was the rookie of the year in
the 1984/85 NBA season.

00:26:11.419 --> 00:26:18.399
Michael: And Michael Jordan goes onto win
the individual scoring championship,

00:26:18.399 --> 00:26:25.230
that is scoring more points than any other
player in the league in 1986, '87,

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:37.410
'88, '89, '90, '91, '92, and '93. He's not
a bad basketball player. But the

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:44.190
Chicago Bulls never won their first NBA championship
until 1991. So when an

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:49.940
Assistant Coach said to Michael Jordan in
1989 he said, "Michael, you can't do it

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:55.909
all by yourself. You can't carry this team
on your back. You will not win an

00:26:55.909 --> 00:27:01.710
NBA championship thinking you can do it single
handedly. Michael, there's no

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:08.929
"I" in the word team." And Michael Jordan
shot back in a flash, "there is in the

00:27:08.929 --> 00:27:15.779
word "win"", because to Michael Jordan winning
the individual scoring championship

00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:22.549
was just as important as winning the NBA championship.
Implications for you

00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:25.960
all, you have to, quote, "read the table".

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:33.700
Michael: That is, you have to understand the
motives and the agenda for

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:40.510
everybody that you're dealing with on your
team, or the team that in fact you're

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:46.340
interfacing with, because no one's agenda
is the same. So "reading the table" and

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:51.659
understanding what the needs, motivation,
and agenda are will ultimately

00:27:51.659 --> 00:27:57.150
determine how they play together as a team
and you need to know that. And you

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:03.590
need to know that, and you need to find that
out by watching, and listening very

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:10.260
carefully, because people's body language
ultimately can tell you a lot about

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.360
what their real motives are.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:20.100
Michael: "Law of Healthy Conflict". Too often
in organizational life conflict

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:28.299
is considered evil. But the fact is, conflict's
a lot like cholesterol. There's

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:34.149
the good kind, and the bad kind. And in organizational
life you want --

00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:41.190
Michael: -- you need to strive for debate,
and dialogue, and discussion, which I

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.309
suspect is not a problem here at-- Google.

00:28:44.309 --> 00:28:50.870
Michael: You don't want unhealthy conflict,
where people are vying for power

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:58.779
based on personality, or jealousy, or unhealthy
ambition. But you want dialogue,

00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:05.279
and debate, and discussion. This is the lifeblood
of every organization. This

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:09.730
is what didn't take place at General Motors
for about 40 years.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:22.140
Michael: "Leading Bosses". Whether you think
you have them or not, I have some

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:27.860
bad news for you. Even in this very egalitarian,
flat organization, we all have

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.860
bosses.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:45.120
Michael: And
an important story about bosses is really

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:51.220
about the Law of the
Emperor's Wardrobe. The most important book

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.960
ever written on leadership, until
2005...

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.990
[laughing]

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:03.580
Michael: You've all had this book read to
you as kids. If you have children

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:08.269
now, you have read -- read or will read it
to them. You know the story, "The

00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:12.250
Emperor's New Clothes". This book by Hans
Christian Andersen -- this fairy

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:19.470
tale, was written in 1837. 1837 -- And you
know the story about these two

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:26.169
scoundrels masquerading as tailors. And they
have this -- what they claim is this

00:30:26.169 --> 00:30:31.260
spectacularly beautiful gold thread which
they convince the very vain king to

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:36.710
buy, even though it's nonexistent, explaining
to him that only the most

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:43.020
intelligent people in the kingdom will recognize
how absolutely sartorially

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.890
splendid he will be in his new costume. And
of course he parades around the

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:52.320
town in the buff, you know the story, until
at the end of the story a child

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.500
says, "Why is the emperor naked?"

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:04.330
Michael: Well, here's the message for you
folks. From time to time, hopefully

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:09.159
not that frequently, you're all naked.

00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:17.740
Michael: And very often, even in this culture,
it's hard for people to tell you

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:23.190
that they don't agree with your agenda, your
priorities, your leadership

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:27.180
particularly if you have sanction, power and
authority and if you're senior.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:34.590
So you need to create a very safe place, a
very safe environment where you make

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:42.850
it easy, for people to tell you when in fact
you're not wearing any clothes.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:47.200
That's easier to do than the second part of
the law of the emperor's wardrobe,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:55.480
which is telling your bosses when they're
naked. In an organizational life, when

00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:01.980
people ask me what's the single most important
requirement, I often demure

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.960
'cause I'm not sure there is one. But I think
one of the most important is to

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:12.639
have intellectual courage. That is, to tell
bosses when they're naked even when

00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:14.100
they don't want to be told that.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:20.960
Michael: I think at the end of the day it
takes guts to tell people what they

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:27.890
need to know, but aren't aware of. And I think
for organizations to succeed, you

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:33.559
need a broad cross section of people in the
organization to tell people that, to

00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:39.139
tell bosses that. I mean, for years outsiders
knew that General Motors had too

00:32:39.139 --> 00:32:47.510
many cars, too many products, a bloated bureaucracy.
Everybody knew that except

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:53.480
the people in General Motors, because nobody
wanted to tell the bosses what they

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:59.450
needed to hear. And I think the future of
Google, in a space as competitive and

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:05.980
tricky, and complex, and fast moving as this
is requires people to have

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:10.649
intellectual courage to tell senior people
that there's some things they need to

00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:13.950
know about that they may not wanna hear.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:23.881
Michael: Last law. And it's the "Law of Values-based
Leadership".

00:33:23.881 --> 00:33:33.169
Michael: You know, you folks work hard despite
the game rooms and the free

00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:41.120
candy. You're expected to ship, you're expected
to meet the targets, you're

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:47.840
expected to do high-quality work but there's
nothing wrong with that kind of

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:54.880
expectation. And so it's quite likely that
throughout your career, here or

00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:01.880
anywhere, you'll ask yourself WYHA: What you
have achieved? 'Cause you're gonna

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:08.320
work hard, you have high targets to meet,
demanding targets to meet, and one

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:17.470
metric, one very appropriate metric is to
say, how am I doing? Am I successful?

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:20.540
How am I doing against my business school
classmates?

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:28.390
Michael: But in fact if that's the only metric
you use, in my view the slippery

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:29.390
slope awaits.

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:37.200
Michael: Which is why I think it's particularly
important to have another

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.200
metric.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:46.130
Michael: That you assess yourself against
just as frequently as WYHA and I

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:52.370
think WYHB, that is what you have become to
be successful, to meet the targets,

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.840
is particularly important.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:05.630
Michael: What values did you have to suspend
to be successful, is all too often

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:11.810
what ambitious people don't ask themselves.
You know, the fact is, in my

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.810
opinion --

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:19.880
Michael: -- leaders establish this followership
for two reasons: One, they're

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:24.950
competent, 'cause you wanna follow competent
people. But also it's because of

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:29.430
their character. That is, you believe in their
values, you believe in their

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:32.641
sensibilities, you can trust they're gonna
do what they say they're gonna do.

00:35:32.641 --> 00:35:40.380
'Cause in my view if -- if leadership's about
taking people with you, pulling

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:45.930
people, if leadership's about building followership,
then I think ultimately

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:51.310
values are the oxygen of followership.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:59.050
Michael: Thanks very much for listening. I
appreciate it.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:02.910
[applause]

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:08.380
Michael: So if you have questions --

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.080
Host: Please use the mic 'cause we have people
listening.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.800
Michael: Ah, use the mic. Okay. We have one
mic? Yeah.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:25.920
Michael: It's usually the first question that's
the most difficult, so I think

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.170
we should start with the second question.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.270
[laughing]

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:40.300
&gt;&gt; I'd Love to hear your advice on delegating.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.300
Michael: Yeah?

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.300
&gt;&gt; I'd Love to hear your advice on delegating.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:48.900
Michael: [inaudible] delegating, okay? Umm,
well, you know, books have

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.000
been written about delegating and, uh --

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
[laughing]

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.110
Michael: I hope you don't do that with my
book.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:01.110
[laughing]

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:08.590
Michael: Uh, I actually think it's very simple.
Uh, I think it's very -- you

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:12.390
need to be very clear about what you -- what
you're asking the other person to

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:18.070
do. The second part of that is making sure
he or she understands the reason

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:23.790
that you're asking for it. I think you need
to be very clear about the

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:30.950
timetable involved so that the person is,
uh, on the same highway as you are

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:36.220
about time frames. And I think the most important
thing to do at that point, is

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:42.170
ask that person you're delegating to, what
he or she needs from you, to enable

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:51.640
them to own it, and be accountable and meet
the target. Umm, it often falls

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.430
off the cliff, when the person says, okay,
I'll get it done but isn't

00:37:55.430 --> 00:38:00.550
understanding about why it's important, how
it connects with the cathedral

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:08.030
you're trying to build, or is unwilling to
tell you that there are several other

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:12.620
priorities that he or she has that's going
to make your timetable difficult. So

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:17.630
it's very important to get -- to get that
granular information out during the

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:21.850
discussion. So it needs to be much more than,
"You get it; I want it; it needs

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.190
to be done by Friday". That's not effective
delegation. That answer your

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.190
question?

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:42.850
&gt;&gt; Umm, I had a question about kind of, like,
can one bad apple spoil a whole bunch,

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:47.170
or can good leadership skills supersede someone
who's possibly slightly toxic to an

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:48.300
environment?

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.420
[laughing]

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:55.430
Michael: Uh, yes, I think one bad apple can
be very corrosive and toxic to a

00:38:55.430 --> 00:39:02.660
team. Uh, I think it's very important, umm,
before you wanna run them over on

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:07.300
Ninth Avenue, hiring a taxi to do so, I think
it's very important to get to the

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:16.520
source of what is it that's, uh, causing this
toxicity? Is it I don't like my

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:21.290
job; I don't like you; I don't like this culture;
I don't understand what I'm

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:26.340
supposed to do here; I don't think I fit in?
So, uh, I think -- I'm not

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.570
suggesting you need to be a psychiatrist,
but I do think you need to get to the

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:35.180
root cause of that. Some of those things are
solvable, some of those things are

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:40.850
not. So if it's something you're doing or
the team's doing that might change

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:44.860
that attitude, you outta try to do so, particularly
if the person talented, and

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:52.240
skilled, and valuable technically. There are
times where you're gonna need to

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.490
decide, you're in the wrong -- you're in the
wrong game. This is not the right

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:01.050
game to you and, umm, you need to get into
a game where you're going to be more

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:07.910
motivated, more comfortable, and a better
fit. But yes, one person can -- can

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:14.450
be, umm, can be very, uh, dysfunctional to
an organization and bring the entire

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:16.620
team down. Sure. Yes, sir?

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.460
&gt;&gt; You talked about a couple of things. You
distinguished between management and

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:24.850
leadership, which I absolutely get and absolutely
agree with. You also said that,

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:30.610
umm, motivation is -- is really a product
of leadership and I'm kind of surprised

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:35.590
about that. In one way I'm surprised about
that because I've certainly seen

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:41.500
certain -- not here -- umm, management have
immense impacts on motivation though not

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.580
positive impacts on motivation.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.040
[laughing]

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.121
&gt;&gt; And I -- I -- in my experience I'm -- in
the same sense that some people are

00:40:50.121 --> 00:40:56.360
recovering alcoholics, I'm a recovering manager.
Umm, I -- I've seen that both

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.750
motivation can come from leadership but I
really think that I've seen leadership come

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:05.040
from what you've described as management.
Now, am I -- does it -- in your experience

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.060
can it come from both? Is it really --

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:13.020
Michael: Sure. Sure it can. Sure it can. Umm,
and, you know, there's nothing

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:17.620
formulaic about being motivating and inspiring.
But motivating this gentleman

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.220
might be -- require a different set of skills
than motivating this particular

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.770
gentleman, which means you need to know who
you're trying to motivate. You gotta

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:29.540
know what's gonna ring their bell, you gotta
know what their agenda is. Umm,

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:36.240
and, uh, I think certain motivation comes
from sensible processes that prompt

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:44.110
people to conclude, gosh, this place, uh,
is reasonably well organized, it's

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:48.200
reason -- it's got its act together, doesn't
have too much freedom and too much

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.200
iconoclasm --

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.160
&gt;&gt; And consequent -- and the other way around,
from the nonsensical --

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.880
Michael: Absolutely. Or it can be so process
driven that it's the Internal

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:03.330
Revenue Service. Right. I think we're in violent
agreement actually. Yeah.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:04.330
Yeah. Sure.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:11.200
&gt;&gt; Uh, you use the example of inspiring people
to build a cathedral rather than, uh,

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.290
than cutting stone. Well, those cathedrals
took a hundred and 50 years to build or

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:21.761
more, so people were committed for life umm,
the reality is -- today is --

00:42:21.761 --> 00:42:22.800
Michael: Generations.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. But the reality for today is,
we'll hire you if you already know

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:31.410
how to cut stone and the instant we don't
need you for cutting stone anymore you're

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:38.870
gone. So in that sense -- in that sense, is
leadership in that direction a noble

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:39.870
lie?

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:40.870
Michael: Uh --

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:41.870
&gt;&gt; Or not so noble?

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.330
Michael: You know, I think that's one of the
reasons why organizations have a

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:51.080
very hard time eliciting high trust from the
people that work for them. So I --

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:59.430
I do think that's one of the dangers of working
an organizational life today is

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:06.260
that, you know, people don't have high trust
for the "institution". Umm, so I

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:11.390
agree with that. On the other hand, I think
building a cathedral is particularly

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.570
important so at the time you're building it,
however long you're there, even if

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:21.190
it's not for Larry, Sergey, and Eric, and
the other Huey, Dewey and Louies around

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:26.041
here, the fact is, you think your work is
meaningful and important and you can

00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:30.550
go home at night thinking it's making a difference.
It's -- it's beyond the

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:36.260
specific team or role you play. It's going
to, um, give you some sense of

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:42.860
meaning and purpose. Even if ultimately, umm,
organizations, uh, come to the

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.180
realization that they don't need you anymore.
For the time that you were here,

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:51.420
so long as you can feel you were doing something
important, my hunch is you

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:55.170
won't look like most of the people I see on
the New York City subway system.

00:43:55.170 --> 00:44:01.340
&gt;&gt; This is a particularly interesting time
to make that point because, uh, if in

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.720
fact you gain meaning out of your work, when
you lose the job you're in a lot of

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.720
trouble, which has happened with a lot of
people.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.210
Michael: Well, I didn't tell you to gain meaning
from the work you lose your

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.840
job. I said you gain meaning from your work
while you're doing your job.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.760
&gt;&gt; Right. But then when you lose your job
what do you have left?

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.910
Michael: Umm, the opportunity to find another
job.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:17.970
[laughing]

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:22.730
&gt;&gt; Right. Which is a severe problem for people
these days.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:28.550
Michael: Ah, it certainly is. It certainly
is.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:29.550
Michael: Yes, sir?

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.850
&gt;&gt; Umm, First of all, thank you very much
for coming here and speaking to us today.

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:34.151
Michael: My pleasure. Thank you.

00:44:34.151 --> 00:44:38.280
&gt;&gt; I think it was terrifically informative
and enjoyable and I might even buy your

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.280
book. Umm --

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.390
Michael: I have four kids so I would really
appreciate it.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:42.390
[laughing]

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.360
&gt;&gt; So I -- I understand that problem, believe
me. Umm, I've worked for a couple of

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:52.520
companies that, uh, had "naked emperors".
I think that's great advise, but that's

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:58.000
tough. And often that's tough because the
messenger gets shot. Umm, so how do you

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.040
go about building that kind of culture? How
do you go about doing that? How do

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.860
you go about if you feel that that has to
happen, carrying out that task of speaking

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.080
to the emperor, cause I think it's not trivial.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:16.050
Michael: Well, I think it's a great question.
I think most organizations don't

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:21.880
work up to their level of potential, umm,
because most organ -- in most

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:28.150
organizations, information flows down and
unfortunately not enough of it flows

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:34.000
up. It's so filtered and buffered when it
goes up that, umm, bosses ultimately

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.020
don't know when they're naked. Which is why
it's so important for an organization

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:44.200
to understand that are in fact naked or semi
naked. So you're right, it's very

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:49.100
difficult. Umm, courage is difficult, isn't
it? I mean, courage doesn't mean

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:56.080
you're fearless. Umm, fearless people are
stupid, right? I mean, going into

00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:03.660
battle in Afghanistan, Iraq, fearless, gets
you killed. So I do thing that --

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:08.610
that the -- that what's tough about, uh, courage
is two things. One, pushing

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:13.850
through the fear, but then to your point,
having the kind of granular skills and

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:18.290
emotional savvy to use the right language,
to establish the right sort of

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:24.200
covenants, so that bosses ultimately know
you're going to push back on them.

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:28.560
Umm, and, uh, there's a whole chapter in my
book, chapter ten, about how do you

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.060
push back? What words do you use? What language
do you use? I'm not

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.280
suggesting you go into a boss' office and
say, "I gotta tell you, chief, that's

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.500
really stupid." or "I gotta tell you, boss,
people think you're a moron." or "I

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.400
gotta tell you, chief, nobody agrees with
your priorities." That's not courage.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:52.240
That's stupid. But what I am suggesting is
being artful, uh, clever,

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:57.810
manipulative with the kinds of language and
the kinds of relationship-building

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:04.761
skills that ultimately allows a leader to
listen to your pushback. Great

00:47:04.761 --> 00:47:05.761
question.

00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:07.900
Michael: Yes, sir?

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.520
Host: Do we have any questions in the remote
offices? Guess not.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.630
&gt;&gt; Uh, thank you very much for coming to speak
today.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:15.630
Michael: Sure.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:21.140
&gt;&gt; I have a question -- you may have covered
earlier in your speech but I guess it

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.610
has to do a little bit about perception. I
think there are a lot of things with

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:29.570
leadership that people take the boxes and
they're supposed to do this and they're supposed

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:37.361
to do that. Umm, and I think sometimes, you
know, we talk about in [inaudible], that people

00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:42.950
confuse being liked with being seen as leaders.
So the disrespect factor. Uh, can

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:47.460
you comment on that and how -- how people
sometimes get those two confused?

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:51.570
Michael: Yeah. I think -- I think there are
a lot of reasons you need courage

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:55.410
to be a leader, one of the things is you have
to tell -- you have to sometimes give people

00:47:55.410 --> 00:48:01.350
who work for you or with you some tough love
and, umm, often not met with great

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:06.430
popularity. So I think it's -- I think it's
important for people to respect you

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:10.130
and your values. I think it's important to
treat people with dignity and

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:14.940
civility. But I don't think that's the same
thing as being popular, or well liked,

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.820
because being a leader means you sometimes
have to make some tough calls on

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:21.500
people, you have to give them some tough messages.
Now, how you give them those

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:27.220
messages I think is important but I don't
think that leadership has anything to

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:33.060
do with popularity in a sense that you asked
the question. In fact, it often

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.800
takes -- it's -- it's often as difficult to
give people -- it's often as hurtful

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.980
to tell people what they're not doing well,
as it is for the person to hear it, that

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.290
they're not doing well. So I don't think leadership's
about popularity. I'm

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:47.680
not suggesting you need to be a shrink. I'm
not suggesting you need to loan

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.700
them money. What I do think is you need to
tell people the truth. It's a great

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.320
question. Yes, sir?

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:55.440
Host: Okay. This is gonna be the last question.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:01.280
&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh, I represent the sales organization
here at Google --

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.280
Michael: Uh-huh.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.000
&gt;&gt; -- and I was sitting with a few of my colleagues
and we remarked that, umm,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:12.220
except for one or two, very few members of
the sales leadership organization actually

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.230
came for this session today.

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:14.230
Michael: Mm hmm.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.410
&gt;&gt; How would you advise that we deal with
that?

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:17.700
[laughing]

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:26.540
Michael: Uh, well, first I'd -- I would suggest
you tell them what a fabulous

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.940
talk they missed.

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:28.940
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[laughing]

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:34.430
Michael: And then I think you ought to ask,
umm, how come they weren't able to

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:42.410
make it? And then you might wanna say, do
you mind 'cause I -- we have -- we have

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:48.440
this, uh, this knucklehead's talk on tape,
or we -- it's a link, can we -- can we

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.580
carve out a time to go through it, 'cause
I think there's some concepts he discussed

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:58.210
that would actually help our group--Our group,
not you, but our group, be a

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:08.410
heck of a lot more effective. Can we carve
out some time to do that?

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:09.410
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:10.410
Michael: Sure.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:11.410
Host: Okay. It's 1:00 p.m. I think that's
about it. I'm gonna wrap up here.

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:12.410
Thanks very much for attending the talk.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:13.410
[applause]

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:14.410
Michael: Thanks for your time, everybody.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:14.411
[applause]
