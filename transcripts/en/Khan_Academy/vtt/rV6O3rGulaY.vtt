00:00:00.257 --> 00:00:02.242
- [Voiceover] Let's give
ourselves a reminder

00:00:02.242 --> 00:00:04.518
of how important Gregor Mendel's work was

00:00:04.518 --> 00:00:07.618
in 1866, that he published in 1866.

00:00:07.618 --> 00:00:09.580
And it's important to
realize it wasn't like

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.761
immediately in 1866 or 1867
the whole world changed,

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:15.386
and everyone said, "Oh, Gregor
Mendel figured it all out."

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:17.846
Like a lot of times in
science the big discoveries,

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:21.445
the ones that really
change people's thinkings,

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:23.838
aren't really taken
that seriously at first.

00:00:23.838 --> 00:00:25.404
And actually, Mendel's work,

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:27.379
a lot of people either
didn't take it seriously

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:29.499
or kind of ignored it in 1866.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.519
And it wasn't until the
early 1900's that people

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.262
rediscovered his work and realized,

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:38.140
"Wait. Wait. There is something
very, very powerful here,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.848
"and we might be able
to connect it to things

00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:43.562
"that we are actually
observing inside of cells."

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:46.766
But let's just remind
ourselves about Mendel's work.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.740
So, for most of human history,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.063
we've recognized probably that, okay.

00:00:51.063 --> 00:00:54.603
It looks like animals,
or not just animals,

00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:56.369
any type of living creature

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.550
seems to pass on traits
to their offspring.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.698
I could look at you and I'd say,

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:03.160
"Oh, you know, your hair
is kind of like your dad's,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.482
"and your eyes are kind
of like your mom's."

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.781
Maybe your nose looks
like something in between.

00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:09.801
You walk a little bit like your uncle.

00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:13.783
So, we've always recognized
that we pass on traits

00:01:13.783 --> 00:01:15.408
to our offspring,

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.009
but we didn't really
have a rigorous way of

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:18.984
thinking about it.

00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:20.785
And we definitely didn't have
a way to make predictions

00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:23.651
that were testable based on those traits,

00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:25.428
and that's what Mendel gave us.

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:27.066
He said, "Well, look. I'm observing,"

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.539
and he did this with pea plants,

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.861
"I observed these heritable factors,

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.310
"and there might be heritable factors on,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.587
"let's say, height."

00:01:35.587 --> 00:01:36.725
If we're talking about plant,

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:38.269
it would be the height of a plant.

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:42.065
There might be heritable
factors on, let's say,

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:43.923
flower color.

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:47.626
So, flower color.

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:50.228
And he recognized that there
were different versions

00:01:50.228 --> 00:01:51.399
of those factors,

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.768
and, so, a given plant might have

00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:55.846
one of the tall versions.

00:01:55.846 --> 00:02:00.108
So, they might have a tall
version for the height factor,

00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:01.901
and they might have a short version.

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.573
Or they might have two talls,

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:05.339
or they might have two shorts.

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:08.542
Or they might have a red factor,

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:11.642
and they have a pink factor.

00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:14.441
Or they could have two reds, two reds.

00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:16.577
It would look like that.

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:19.980
Or two pinks would look like that,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.934
but the important realization was that

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:24.093
there were these versions of the factors.

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:25.917
Today, we call these factors, we say,

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:27.868
"Hey, there's a gene for height."

00:02:27.868 --> 00:02:29.053
If there is one.

00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:31.862
Or that there is a gene for flower colors,

00:02:31.862 --> 00:02:34.673
and those variations of the genes, today,

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:36.982
we call these alleles.

00:02:36.982 --> 00:02:38.805
So, we'd say, "Hey,
you have the variation.

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:40.733
"You have one copy of the tall allele

00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:44.054
"and one copy of the short."

00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:45.072
Let me just write it this way.

00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:49.764
Let me just say these are
all alleles right here.

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:52.444
So, you have one tall
allele, one short allele.

00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:54.105
And what Mendel did is he realized,

00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:56.358
"Well, look. These things are,"

00:02:56.358 --> 00:02:58.157
he didn't know how,

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:00.282
"but these things are the
things that get passed on

00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:04.182
"from a parent to their offspring."

00:03:04.182 --> 00:03:06.993
And he started to describe
about how they got passed on.

00:03:06.993 --> 00:03:11.125
He observed that, even
if you have two of these,

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.830
that they tend to segregate when you go

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.712
to the next generation,

00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:17.627
and what do we mean by segregation,

00:03:17.627 --> 00:03:20.552
or I guess we can say
the law of segregation?

00:03:20.552 --> 00:03:24.639
Law of segregation.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.075
Well, that means if this
was a fima pea plant

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.676
and these are the version that I have,

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.593
to my offspring I might pass on

00:03:32.593 --> 00:03:35.019
an A, a capital A, the tall one,

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.942
or I could pass on the lowercase A.

00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:43.587
I might pass on the tall,

00:03:43.587 --> 00:03:46.339
or I might pass on the red version

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:48.579
of the flower color factor,

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.214
or I might pass on

00:03:53.214 --> 00:03:55.270
the pink one.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.158
And he also realized that whether or not

00:03:57.158 --> 00:04:00.062
I pass on the capital
A or the lowercase A,

00:04:00.062 --> 00:04:01.826
it's independent of whether I pass on

00:04:01.826 --> 00:04:04.450
the capital B or the lowercase B.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.738
So, they independently assort.

00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:08.130
How this one assorts is independent of

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.639
how this one assorts.

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.880
So, independent assortment.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.271
Independent.

00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:18.370
Independent Assortment.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.030
Assortment.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.714
Law.

00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:24.211
Law of independent assortment.

00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:26.439
And he also observed that

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.017
some of these versions
dominate the other one.

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:31.431
So, if an offspring has a tall version

00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:34.195
and a short one, if the
tall one is dominant,

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:37.596
the observed trait will still look tall,

00:04:37.596 --> 00:04:38.920
and the only way they'd look short is

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.042
if they have two versions
of the short one.

00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:43.529
And, so, that one he described as his

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.769
law of dominance.

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:49.927
Law of dominance.

00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:52.156
And if all of this is
completely new to you,

00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:54.571
I encourage you to watch the videos on

00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.915
Mendelian genetics on Khan Academy,

00:04:56.915 --> 00:04:58.112
but this is just gonna appreciate

00:04:58.112 --> 00:04:59.946
a little bit of a historical appreciation.

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:03.092
But as big of a deal as Mendel's work was,

00:05:03.092 --> 00:05:05.148
it's also important to
realize what he didn't know.

00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:08.711
He had no idea of how this
was actually happening

00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:11.893
at a molecular level
or at a cellular level,

00:05:11.893 --> 00:05:14.250
and it wasn't until the early 1900's

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.025
that people started to have

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:18.592
fairly robust theories
of how this happens.

00:05:18.592 --> 00:05:21.726
And, so, in 1902 and 1903.

00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:26.695
So, 1902-1903 these two gentlemen

00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:29.389
independently start coming up with the

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.675
chromosome theory of inheritance,

00:05:31.675 --> 00:05:33.452
and it's called the Boveri-Sutton

00:05:33.452 --> 00:05:34.672
Chromosome Theory of Inheritance,

00:05:34.672 --> 00:05:36.355
because right around the same time,

00:05:36.355 --> 00:05:37.853
they both started to realize

00:05:37.853 --> 00:05:39.918
that maybe chromosomes were the actual

00:05:39.918 --> 00:05:42.902
molecular mechanism,
the cellular mechanism,

00:05:42.902 --> 00:05:47.902
by which these factors segregate
and independently assort.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.774
And, so, let me write this down.

00:05:50.774 --> 00:05:55.674
This is the Boveri-Sutton,
it's sometimes called the

00:05:55.674 --> 00:05:57.415
Sutton-Boveri.

00:05:57.415 --> 00:06:02.279
Boveri-Sutton Chromosome Theory.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:07.203
Chromosome Theory.

00:06:07.203 --> 00:06:09.583
And even though they're starting to say,

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:11.277
"Maybe chromosomes have
something to do with it."

00:06:11.277 --> 00:06:13.159
They still don't know
exactly what is inside

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.040
the chromosome that are allowing somehow

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.141
this information to be encoded,

00:06:17.141 --> 00:06:18.708
and we'll get to that.

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:21.865
And we will get to that in a little bit,

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.491
but let me just underline this.

00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:28.170
Boveri-Sutton Chromosome Theory.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.690
And, so, what was their key insight?

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.930
Well, they started to
look inside of cells,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.612
meiosis was observed actually after

00:06:35.612 --> 00:06:39.106
Mendel published his laws of inheritance,

00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:40.766
and then chromosomes,

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:43.007
or how chromosomes behave in meiosis,

00:06:43.007 --> 00:06:44.992
was discovered after that.

00:06:44.992 --> 00:06:46.862
And then these guys, they
independently studied

00:06:46.862 --> 00:06:48.104
different organisms.

00:06:48.104 --> 00:06:50.681
Walter Sutton, he studied grasshoppers.

00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:53.584
Theodor Boveri, he studied sea urchins,

00:06:53.584 --> 00:06:55.129
but they looked at meiosis,

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:56.731
and they looked at the reproduction

00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:59.783
and the fertilization
during these processes.

00:06:59.783 --> 00:07:01.723
And they saw that the chromosomes

00:07:01.723 --> 00:07:04.033
seemed to do things that were very similar

00:07:04.033 --> 00:07:05.844
to these laws of segregation,

00:07:05.844 --> 00:07:07.283
laws of independent assortment,

00:07:07.283 --> 00:07:09.013
laws of dominance.

00:07:09.013 --> 00:07:10.383
And actually, the law of dominance

00:07:10.383 --> 00:07:12.508
we'll talk more about in future videos.

00:07:12.508 --> 00:07:16.166
But he saw that, let's say
that you had a organism here,

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:18.127
and in this particular organism,

00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:20.147
I just did it for simplification,

00:07:20.147 --> 00:07:23.933
it has two pairs of
homologous chromosomes.

00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:25.744
So, what does homologous
chromosomes means?

00:07:25.744 --> 00:07:28.937
Well, these two are different chromosomes,

00:07:28.937 --> 00:07:30.689
but they seem to be very similar.

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:32.651
It seems like they're
kind of the same length,

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:34.429
same size, same shape.

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:36.913
So, that's one pair of
homologous chromosomes.

00:07:36.913 --> 00:07:40.338
That's another pair of
homologous chromosomes.

00:07:40.338 --> 00:07:42.451
So, notice. Homologous chromosomes,

00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:44.750
two things that are kind
of looking the same,

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.734
but maybe they're a little bit different.

00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:47.872
We're not sure.

00:07:47.872 --> 00:07:52.239
Well, maybe, this is
what fits what's going on

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:54.629
right over here with these factors.

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:58.309
Maybe, just maybe, one
of these chromosomes

00:07:58.309 --> 00:08:00.516
somehow has on it some place

00:08:00.516 --> 00:08:03.615
what encodes for the capital A.

00:08:03.615 --> 00:08:04.672
Capital A.

00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:08.108
And maybe, the other
chromosome in a similar part

00:08:08.108 --> 00:08:09.757
of the chromosome.

00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:11.905
In a similar part of the chromosome,

00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:15.318
has what encodes a similar
part of a chromosome,

00:08:15.318 --> 00:08:19.416
has what encodes for a lower case A.

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.216
Now, this is starting to make sense

00:08:21.216 --> 00:08:23.584
because they would be
homologous chromosomes

00:08:23.584 --> 00:08:26.604
similar the chromosomes
look like they code

00:08:26.604 --> 00:08:27.962
for the same thing,

00:08:27.962 --> 00:08:30.701
for the same factors, for the same genes,

00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:32.199
but there might be some variation

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:33.256
between these chromosomes.

00:08:33.256 --> 00:08:35.775
And these guys weren't
able to somehow sequence

00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:36.773
the chromosomes.

00:08:36.773 --> 00:08:37.632
So, they didn't know.

00:08:37.632 --> 00:08:40.198
They didn't even know that
the DNA was what was important

00:08:40.198 --> 00:08:41.000
in the chromosomes,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.333
but they said, "Well, looks
like these two things,

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:45.515
"if we look through
the process of meiosis,

00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:48.314
"it seems like they
segregate from each other."

00:08:48.314 --> 00:08:52.389
For example, this capital
A one, it will replicate.

00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:56.452
So, you have capital A, and
then this is the lowercase A one

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:57.451
right over here.

00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:58.938
You might have some cross over,

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:00.411
and we'll talk about that when

00:09:00.411 --> 00:09:01.991
you can review meiosis,

00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:03.779
if it looks unfamiliar.

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:05.218
But then they segregate.

00:09:05.218 --> 00:09:08.712
You could have you capital
A ones right over here,

00:09:08.712 --> 00:09:11.812
and then these sister
chromatids split apart.

00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:14.814
So, capital A capital A,

00:09:14.814 --> 00:09:18.527
and then you have lowercase A.

00:09:18.527 --> 00:09:21.899
These lower case A ones, they segregate.

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:23.489
And they independently assort

00:09:23.489 --> 00:09:25.660
from the other chromosomes.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.075
So, this one right over
here might be the capital B,

00:09:28.075 --> 00:09:31.453
this might be the lowercase B.

00:09:31.453 --> 00:09:33.753
And whether or not this gets a,

00:09:33.753 --> 00:09:37.932
whether or not this gets a
capital B or a lowercase B,

00:09:37.932 --> 00:09:40.370
is independent of whether
it got a capital A

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.193
or a lowercase A.

00:09:42.193 --> 00:09:43.621
So, it seems like these chromosomes

00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:45.060
independently assort.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.000
And, so, they came up with
this chromosomal theory

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.797
that it looks like maybe
chromosomes are what

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:52.457
contain these heritable factors that

00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:53.977
Mendel was talking about,

00:09:53.977 --> 00:09:55.545
because it seems like chromosomes behave

00:09:55.545 --> 00:09:57.820
very similar to those heritable factors.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.922
Maybe chromosomes code for multiple

00:09:59.922 --> 00:10:02.442
of these heritable factors that segregate

00:10:02.442 --> 00:10:04.845
and independently assort.

00:10:04.845 --> 00:10:06.644
And as we know now, they were right.

00:10:06.644 --> 00:10:08.502
So, this is a very, very big deal,

00:10:08.502 --> 00:10:10.638
but it's important to realize
that they weren't sure.

00:10:10.638 --> 00:10:11.962
They established a theory,

00:10:11.962 --> 00:10:13.564
they were able to make some observations

00:10:13.564 --> 00:10:15.480
with the grasshoppers and the sea urchins,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.301
and they saw the patterns between

00:10:17.301 --> 00:10:18.684
what Mendel was describing,

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:21.807
and the way chromosomes
behave during meiosis.

00:10:21.807 --> 00:10:25.126
And then they know that each
of these products of meiosis,

00:10:25.126 --> 00:10:28.100
each of these gametes will then go

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.807
and form with other gametes to form

00:10:29.807 --> 00:10:31.048
the next organisms who say,

00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:32.767
"Oh, look. Parents will
contribute either capital A

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:35.971
"or lowercase A. Either a
capital B or a lowercase B."

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.792
So, this is very similar to
what Mendel was describing.

00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:41.090
So, they laid the
groundwork for the theory,

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.879
but they still weren't sure.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:44.818
They didn't definitively prove it,

00:10:44.818 --> 00:10:47.198
and it will take another decade or so

00:10:47.198 --> 00:10:49.137
until it's definitively proven.

00:10:49.137 --> 00:10:51.830
And even then, no one was
really sure exactly how

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.059
these different traits were encoded,

00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:57.079
and for that we would have
to wait a little bit longer.
