00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.910
well actually I don't appropriate logos

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920
well actually I don't appropriate logos
 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.240
well actually I don't appropriate logos
and symbols but you could say that I

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
and symbols but you could say that I
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.530
and symbols but you could say that I
appropriate the aesthetic and so I go

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540
appropriate the aesthetic and so I go
 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.939
appropriate the aesthetic and so I go
through a sketch process to develop each

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
through a sketch process to develop each
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.269
through a sketch process to develop each
individual drawing so if you looked at a

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279
individual drawing so if you looked at a
 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.720
individual drawing so if you looked at a
at a painting and extracted just one

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730
at a painting and extracted just one
 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.810
at a painting and extracted just one
symbol there's a development process

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
symbol there's a development process
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000
symbol there's a development process
that goes into developing just and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010
that goes into developing just and
 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.520
that goes into developing just and
creating just that one that one drawing

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
creating just that one that one drawing
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.549
creating just that one that one drawing
and so well like I was saying earlier

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
and so well like I was saying earlier
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.280
and so well like I was saying earlier
when I was growing up in Virginia Beach

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290
when I was growing up in Virginia Beach
 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.780
when I was growing up in Virginia Beach
I realized that realize the power of

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790
I realized that realize the power of
 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.939
I realized that realize the power of
icons and logos and symbols and how they

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
icons and logos and symbols and how they
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.729
icons and logos and symbols and how they
could transform otherwise ordinary

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
could transform otherwise ordinary
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.610
could transform otherwise ordinary
objects by by increasing their perceived

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
objects by by increasing their perceived
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.170
objects by by increasing their perceived
value and so I really that want to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
value and so I really that want to
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.289
value and so I really that want to
assume that power for myself and so

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
assume that power for myself and so
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.160
assume that power for myself and so
instead of simply appropriating logos or

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
instead of simply appropriating logos or
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.810
instead of simply appropriating logos or
icons that are anonymously created by

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820
icons that are anonymously created by
 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.770
icons that are anonymously created by
corporations to stand for symbolize you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
corporations to stand for symbolize you
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.959
corporations to stand for symbolize you
know any any number of goods and

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969
know any any number of goods and
 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.679
know any any number of goods and
services I really want to take that

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689
services I really want to take that
 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.859
services I really want to take that
again kind of that power and use it to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
again kind of that power and use it to
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.200
again kind of that power and use it to
communicate my own thoughts ideas or

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
communicate my own thoughts ideas or
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.819
communicate my own thoughts ideas or
concepts and do so with with an

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
concepts and do so with with an
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.859
concepts and do so with with an
authorship that is accountable and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
authorship that is accountable and
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.599
authorship that is accountable and
responsible for that image and so it's a

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609
responsible for that image and so it's a
 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.760
responsible for that image and so it's a
it's a subversion in a kind of voice a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
it's a subversion in a kind of voice a
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.169
it's a subversion in a kind of voice a
version of an aesthetic again whereby

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179
version of an aesthetic again whereby
 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.830
version of an aesthetic again whereby
I'm using that those forms which is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
I'm using that those forms which is
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.709
I'm using that those forms which is
essentially how I learn to draw by going

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
essentially how I learn to draw by going
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.029
essentially how I learn to draw by going
through a design program I learned how

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039
through a design program I learned how
 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.889
through a design program I learned how
to create logos and icons and all of the

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899
to create logos and icons and all of the
 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.020
to create logos and icons and all of the
requirements that those entail for

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
requirements that those entail for
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.580
requirements that those entail for
instance they have to be read quickly

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
instance they have to be read quickly
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.570
instance they have to be read quickly
there's a notta to not everything that

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580
there's a notta to not everything that
 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.039
there's a notta to not everything that
all the images are kind of distilled

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049
all the images are kind of distilled
 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.380
all the images are kind of distilled
down to the essential forms and their

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
down to the essential forms and their
 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.750
down to the essential forms and their
art there isn't a wide range of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
art there isn't a wide range of
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.820
art there isn't a wide range of
scale shifts and details within one

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
scale shifts and details within one
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.420
scale shifts and details within one
drawing because each little icon has to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
drawing because each little icon has to
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.789
drawing because each little icon has to
be reproduced a number of different

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799
be reproduced a number of different
 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.580
be reproduced a number of different
sizes so it really has to hold up at

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590
sizes so it really has to hold up at
 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.140
sizes so it really has to hold up at
different at different sizes so there

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
different at different sizes so there
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.130
different at different sizes so there
are a lot of different requirements that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140
are a lot of different requirements that
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.280
are a lot of different requirements that
go into making these kind of drawings

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290
go into making these kind of drawings
 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.839
go into making these kind of drawings
and again I wanted to kind of as you

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849
and again I wanted to kind of as you
 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.190
and again I wanted to kind of as you
know soon that power for myself to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
know soon that power for myself to
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.770
know soon that power for myself to
communicate my own you know hopefully

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
communicate my own you know hopefully
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.059
communicate my own you know hopefully
more poetic ideas than just you know

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069
more poetic ideas than just you know
 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.059
more poetic ideas than just you know
whatever you know you would see in our

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069
whatever you know you would see in our
 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.190
whatever you know you would see in our
environment and iconic symbol

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200
environment and iconic symbol
 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.839
environment and iconic symbol
symbolizing something in a very kind of

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849
symbolizing something in a very kind of
 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.839
symbolizing something in a very kind of
blunt and pedestrian way because that's

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849
blunt and pedestrian way because that's
 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.990
blunt and pedestrian way because that's
the goal so hopefully you know when you

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000
the goal so hopefully you know when you
 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.789
the goal so hopefully you know when you
look at a lot of my drawings that again

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799
look at a lot of my drawings that again
 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.289
look at a lot of my drawings that again
are kind of embedded in the paintings

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299
are kind of embedded in the paintings
 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.720
are kind of embedded in the paintings
you do a double take and they

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
you do a double take and they
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.970
you do a double take and they
communicate more than they then they

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980
communicate more than they then they
 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.760
communicate more than they then they
seem to it first

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770
 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.480
maybe I've kind of become numb to it and

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490
maybe I've kind of become numb to it and
 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.630
maybe I've kind of become numb to it and
I think it was a hotter topic maybe five

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640
I think it was a hotter topic maybe five
 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.730
I think it was a hotter topic maybe five
or ten years ago and the fact that it's

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740
or ten years ago and the fact that it's
 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.310
or ten years ago and the fact that it's
not so much but it's you know is is is

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320
not so much but it's you know is is is
 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.940
not so much but it's you know is is is
very telling and almost scary but but

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950
very telling and almost scary but but
 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.660
very telling and almost scary but but
but I think I you know I believe in a

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670
but I think I you know I believe in a
 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.220
but I think I you know I believe in a
kind of fight fire with fire approach so

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230
kind of fight fire with fire approach so
 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.810
kind of fight fire with fire approach so
again that is the world of course that

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820
again that is the world of course that
 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.330
again that is the world of course that
we experience in our daily lives and as

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340
we experience in our daily lives and as
 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.520
we experience in our daily lives and as
a reaction I want to create my own world

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530
a reaction I want to create my own world
 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.920
a reaction I want to create my own world
that I want to share with other people

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930
that I want to share with other people
 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.500
that I want to share with other people
at almost as an alternative to these

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510
at almost as an alternative to these
 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.480
at almost as an alternative to these
other worlds you know so if you could

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490
other worlds you know so if you could
 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.990
other worlds you know so if you could
immerse yourself in in my world with you

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000
immerse yourself in in my world with you
 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.340
immerse yourself in in my world with you
know through all the different things

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350
know through all the different things
 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.250
know through all the different things
that I make hopefully it could be more

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260
that I make hopefully it could be more
 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.320
that I make hopefully it could be more
rewarding you know and in the end i'm

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330
rewarding you know and in the end i'm
 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.620
rewarding you know and in the end i'm
not trying to sell you anything you know

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630
not trying to sell you anything you know
 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.990
not trying to sell you anything you know
just just share some share some ideas

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000
 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.070
well I have a corporation I have Ryan

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080
well I have a corporation I have Ryan
 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.740
well I have a corporation I have Ryan
McGinnis Studios incorporated and I've

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750
McGinnis Studios incorporated and I've
 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.160
McGinnis Studios incorporated and I've
owned other small businesses maybe since

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170
owned other small businesses maybe since
 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.980
owned other small businesses maybe since
high school I think I started my first

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990
high school I think I started my first
 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.040
high school I think I started my first
corporation so I'm not necessarily

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050
corporation so I'm not necessarily
 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.700
corporation so I'm not necessarily
against corporations I guess what I more

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710
against corporations I guess what I more
 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.960
against corporations I guess what I more
accurately I think what I would be

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970
accurately I think what I would be
 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:57.370
accurately I think what I would be
against or its people's relationship to

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380
against or its people's relationship to
 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.840
against or its people's relationship to
corporations and corporations

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850
corporations and corporations
 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.650
corporations and corporations
relationships to people even to the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660
relationships to people even to the
 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.350
relationships to people even to the
extent we're aware by corporations have

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360
extent we're aware by corporations have
 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.330
extent we're aware by corporations have
a lot of ways more rights than

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340
a lot of ways more rights than
 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.720
a lot of ways more rights than
individuals and i think it's it's scary

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730
individuals and i think it's it's scary
 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.360
