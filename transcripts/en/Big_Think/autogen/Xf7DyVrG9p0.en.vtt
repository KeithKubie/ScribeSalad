00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
offer and I think it's actually a
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.530 align:start position:0%

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.630 align:start position:0%

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
so in late two thousand eight we had to
 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.150 align:start position:0%
so in late two thousand eight we had to
lay<00:02:35.330><c> off</c><00:02:35.480><c> about</c><00:02:35.630><c> eight</c><00:02:35.959><c> percent</c><00:02:36.140><c> of</c><00:02:36.440><c> our</c><00:02:36.620><c> staff</c>

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
lay off about eight percent of our staff
 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.910 align:start position:0%
lay off about eight percent of our staff
and<00:02:37.490><c> that</c><00:02:38.120><c> was</c><00:02:38.300><c> actually</c><00:02:38.750><c> a</c><00:02:39.050><c> pretty</c><00:02:39.230><c> tough</c>

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
and that was actually a pretty tough
 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.710 align:start position:0%
and that was actually a pretty tough
thing<00:02:40.130><c> to</c><00:02:40.160><c> do</c><00:02:40.400><c> we</c><00:02:41.120><c> were</c><00:02:41.270><c> we</c><00:02:41.480><c> were</c><00:02:41.569><c> actually</c>

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
thing to do we were we were actually
 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.780 align:start position:0%
thing to do we were we were actually
still<00:02:42.110><c> growing</c><00:02:42.470><c> year</c><00:02:42.680><c> over</c><00:02:42.890><c> year</c><00:02:42.920><c> but</c><00:02:43.550><c> this</c>

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 align:start position:0%
still growing year over year but this
 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.970 align:start position:0%
still growing year over year but this
was<00:02:43.970><c> during</c><00:02:44.150><c> the</c><00:02:44.300><c> whole</c><00:02:44.450><c> financial</c><00:02:44.980><c> crisis</c>

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 align:start position:0%
was during the whole financial crisis
 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.370 align:start position:0%
was during the whole financial crisis
and<00:02:47.380><c> and</c><00:02:48.400><c> we</c><00:02:49.400><c> had</c><00:02:49.580><c> planned</c><00:02:50.150><c> for</c><00:02:50.330><c> much</c><00:02:50.720><c> more</c>

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 align:start position:0%
and and we had planned for much more
 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.350 align:start position:0%
and and we had planned for much more
growth<00:02:51.620><c> than</c><00:02:51.830><c> we</c><00:02:51.950><c> actually</c><00:02:52.100><c> had</c><00:02:52.459><c> and</c><00:02:52.820><c> so</c><00:02:53.240><c> we</c>

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
growth than we actually had and so we
 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
growth than we actually had and so we
had<00:02:53.450><c> hired</c><00:02:53.720><c> into</c><00:02:54.080><c> that</c><00:02:54.230><c> and</c><00:02:54.410><c> then</c><00:02:54.709><c> we</c><00:02:54.860><c> realized</c>

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 align:start position:0%
had hired into that and then we realized
 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.430 align:start position:0%
had hired into that and then we realized
that<00:02:55.580><c> we</c><00:02:55.700><c> weren't</c><00:02:56.150><c> going</c><00:02:56.390><c> to</c><00:02:56.540><c> be</c><00:02:56.810><c> making</c><00:02:57.350><c> our</c>

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we weren't going to be making our
 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.030 align:start position:0%
that we weren't going to be making our

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
numbers so we ended up laying off about
 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.449 align:start position:0%

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 align:start position:0%
eight percent of our staff and but we
