00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.530
[music]

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.040
OK, so we are about to demonstrate

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.060
Dragon's Breath ammo, the ultimate in muzzle flash, and we got

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.080
the most manly person we know, John to do it, John can you hear us?
- yeah

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.410
-Are you ready?
- Ready.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.120
3..2..1.. [bang]
[laugh]

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.140
[music]

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.410
What if you catch yourself on fire?

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:49.200
  

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.350
[bang]
[laughs]

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.370
Fantastic!

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:54.630
             

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.750
3.. 2.. 1.. Fire

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.780
- Holy Crap.
- That's amazing.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.790
Aah, that's the shot right there.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.840
Look at this.
- Ow man.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.900
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.050
3..2..1..

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:38.590
   

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.140
Alright, man play with fire time is over.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.170
It's time for you to get Smarter Every Day. So I've obtained a document

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.180
made by the US Department of Energy back in 1984 reviewing Zirconium

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.190
Zircaloy Pyrophoricity. This is important because this is what's used in

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.200
Dragon's Breath ammunition. This is a little different than normal tracer ammunition which uses

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.210
magnesium or phosphorous if you're an American, or barium salts if you're Chinese

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.270
or Russian. So this document reveals how

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.290
Zirconium is actually ignited. Way on down here on page

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.310
19, there's a graph that shows how ignition temperature

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.320
in Celcius is a function of log specific area

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.340
which is the external surface area of the particle of zirconium

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.380
ratioed with the mass. So basically as the particle

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.400
gets smaller, the ignition temperature gets much easier.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.440
So you can see that inversely proportional here.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.460
So, why do we care about that. Well it's just interesting.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.480
Another thing that's interesting about zirconium is, well, on the periodic table it's

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.490
way over here, it's very similar to hafnium, it has some of the similar characteristics.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.540
One thing that's neat about zirconium is that it doesn't care about neutrons

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.550
at all. Neutrons zip right through it, and it doesn't absorb neutrons very

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.570
much at all, which makes it very very nice for the nuclear industry.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.630
It's also very low in terms of it's reaction to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.650
corrosives, so it's used as cladding for nuclear

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.690
reactor fuels. The reason being is the neutrons go through and that

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.740
energy doesn't get absorbed. This is interesting until

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.760
you have a Fukushima type incident, and when you do

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.790
start increasing temperature, like we saw earlier on that

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.800
chart, you start to get some reactions. As you can see here

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.840
one of the byproducts of that reaction is hydrogen,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.850
often gas. This is what happened at Fukushima. It built up hydrogen gas

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.880
when the zirconium started heating up, and reacting, and that

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.880
is what detonated. That detonated and causes all

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.910
kinds of problems. So anyway, now you're Smarter Every Day, and

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.000
if you would help me out, I'd appreciate if you'd pass this along to some of your smart buddies

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.030
or people who like guns and see if you can help me get some

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.070
subscribers. I would greatly appreciate that. Have a great day. Bye.
