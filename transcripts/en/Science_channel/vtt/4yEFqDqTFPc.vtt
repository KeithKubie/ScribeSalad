00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:05.367
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHETHER A MAGAZINE

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:08.334
WOULD ACTUALLY SET ON FIRE
WHEN IT'S PUT IN A TOASTER.

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:09.367
OKAY.

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.100
Narrator:
THERE ARE THREE INGREDIENTS

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.000
TO THIS BOURNE-STYLE GETAWAY --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.434
THE TOASTER, THE MAGAZINE,
AND THE NATURAL GAS.

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:22.100
AND FIRST IN THE MIX
ARE ONE AND TWO.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.968
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO TOAST A MAGAZINE?

00:00:24.968 --> 00:00:26.334
YOU READY?
I'M READY.

00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:27.601
ALL RIGHT.

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.100
THE GUYS START THE CLOCK

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.300
USING A MAGAZINE
LIKE THE ONE IN THE MOVIE

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.501
AND A TOASTER
RIGGED TO STAY ON.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.033
YOU KNOW, IN THE MOVIE,

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.467
IT WAS ALREADY ON FIRE
AT THIS POINT.

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:40.767
AS IT TURNS OUT,
TOASTING A MAGAZINE

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:43.801
TAKES A LITTLE LONGER
THAN THE 20 SECONDS OF THE FILM.

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:45.801
OH, THREE MINUTES
OVER SCHEDULE.

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.834
I THINK
WE'RE REALLY CLOSE.

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:50.434
IN FACT,
IT TAKES OVER 12 MINUTES

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:51.834
BEFORE THEY GET IGNITION.

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:52.934
HEY, WE GOT FIRE!

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:54.501
TA-DA!

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:55.834
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.467
[ Laughing ] REMEMBER, KIDS,
WE'RE PROFESSIONALS.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:01.334
[ LAUGHS ]

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:05.100
SO, REALITY IS 12 MINUTES,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.400
VERSUS THE MOVIE'S
25-SOME-ODD SECONDS.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.868
HEY!
WE GOT FIRE!

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:11.100
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.334
WELL, WHAT I THINK
IS THAT THIS MAGAZINE

00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:14.667
IS A WORST-CASE SCENARIO,

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.501
BECAUSE LOOK HOW THICK
THOSE PAGES ARE.

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:20.534
AND MAGAZINES ARE
ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES.

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:21.868
SO YOU THINK WE SHOULD TRY
A WHOLE BUNCH

00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:22.934
OF DIFFERENT KINDS
OF MAGAZINES

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.434
AND SEE IF THEY HAVE
DIFFERENT RATES

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:26.267
AT WHICH THEY CATCH ON FIRE?
EXACTLY.

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:27.534
I LOVE IT.
LET'S DO IT.

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:30.033
LOTS OF TOASTERS NOW.

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:32.300
Narrator: IT'S CLEAR
THE REAL-WORLD MAGAZINE

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.601
DOESN'T LIGHT UP
LIKE ITS MOVIE COUNTERPART,

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:36.968
SO NOW THE MYTHBUSTERS
ARE ON THE TRAIL

00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:39.167
OF A BEST-CASE SCENARIO.

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:40.634
Adam:
IN ORDER TO COVER OUR BASES HERE

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.968
AND WORKING OFF THE THEORY THAT
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MAGAZINES

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:44.267
COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT KINDS
OF PAPER

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:47.033
ARE GOING TO CATCH A LIGHT
AT DIFFERENT RATES,

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.133
WE'RE ABOUT TO PUT A HALF-DOZEN
OF THEM TO THE TEST --

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.767
EVERYTHING
FROM OUR ORIGINAL MAGAZINE

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.701
TO SOMETHING MUCH HARDER
TO CATCH ON FIRE,

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:54.968
COMIC BOOK, SOMETHING
THAT WILL PROBABLY CATCH ON FIRE

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:56.200
IN, LIKE, SECONDS.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.901
WE'RE GONNA PUT ONE
IN EACH OF THESE TOASTERS,

00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:59.267
START THIS TIMER,

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:01.701
AND LOG HOW LONG EACH OF THEM
TAKES TO CATCH A LIGHT.

00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:02.968
WHAT COULD BE MORE FUN?

00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:06.067
Narrator: WELL, WITH
THE SIX MAGAZINES IN PLACE,

00:02:06.067 --> 00:02:08.567
LET THE CHARGRILLING CHALLENGE
COMMENCE.

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:09.634
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:11.033
WE'RE EXPERIMENTALLY
DOING SOMETHING

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:13.200
THAT SHOULD JUST NEVER,
EVER BE DONE.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.701
I LIKE THAT.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.701
OH.
OH!

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.634
FLAME.
NUMBER 3.

00:02:17.634 --> 00:02:19.267
1:40.

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:21.634
THIS TIME AROUND,
IT SEEMS THE CONTENDERS

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:24.767
ARE A LITTLE QUICKER TO TOAST.

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:26.234
2:20.

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:27.267
YEP.

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:28.968
HERE WE GO.
NUMBER 4.

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:30.934
3:15.

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:31.934
WHOA!
NUMBER 1.

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:34.634

[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:36.968
LET'S LISTEN
FOR THAT SOUND.

00:02:36.968 --> 00:02:38.734
[ FLAME POUFS ]
THERE WE GO.

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:39.901
THERE IT IS.

00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.000
4:36.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.534
AND, FINALLY,
BRINGING UP THE REAR...

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:45.734
THERE IT IS.

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:48.801
...IS THE ORIGINAL MAGAZINE
AT 12 MINUTES.

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:52.400
Jamie: AS WE SUSPECTED,
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.834
WHAT KIND OF MAGAZINE
IS STUCK IN YOUR TOASTER.

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:56.400
THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.834
IS SOMETHING THAT AMOUNTS
TO COMMON NEWSPRINT,

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:02.467
BUT EVEN THAT
TOOK ABOUT THREE TIMES AS LONG

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.033
AS WHAT IT DID IN THE MOVIE.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.634
INTERESTING.

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:07.133
Narrator: SO, IT'S CLEAR

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:09.667
THAT EVEN WITH
THE BEST-CASE-SCENARIO MAGAZINE,

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:11.734
TOASTER IGNITION
TAKES A LOT LONGER

00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:13.968
THAN THE 20 SECONDS
IT TOOK BOURNE.
