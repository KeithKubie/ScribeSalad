00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.610
from a media perspective is when I speak
to people in the media about this they

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620
to people in the media about this they
 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.920
to people in the media about this they
will often say well we simply go where

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930
will often say well we simply go where
 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.650
will often say well we simply go where
the story takes us so we'll give as much

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660
the story takes us so we'll give as much
 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.640
the story takes us so we'll give as much
coverage to whatever the story's at even

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650
coverage to whatever the story's at even
 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.060
coverage to whatever the story's at even
if the story is one that incites hatred

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070
if the story is one that incites hatred
 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.879
if the story is one that incites hatred
or violence but I actually think that

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889
or violence but I actually think that
 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.730
or violence but I actually think that
there is a very very powerful ethical

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740
there is a very very powerful ethical
 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.180
there is a very very powerful ethical
choice that the media makes in that

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190
choice that the media makes in that
 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.240
choice that the media makes in that
because when they expose and expose and

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250
because when they expose and expose and
 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.890
because when they expose and expose and
expose and expose a story that is about

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900
expose and expose a story that is about
 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.890
expose and expose a story that is about
hatred and a story that is about

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900
hatred and a story that is about
 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.890
hatred and a story that is about
violence as human beings the more

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900
violence as human beings the more
 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.960
violence as human beings the more
familiar we become with that story

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970
familiar we become with that story
 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.050
familiar we become with that story
the more in nerd we become to it and I

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060
the more in nerd we become to it and I
 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.640
the more in nerd we become to it and I
think we can see exactly this in the

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650
think we can see exactly this in the
 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.060
think we can see exactly this in the
current elections that things that were

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070
current elections that things that were
 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.620
current elections that things that were
said six months ago where everyone was

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630
said six months ago where everyone was
 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.110
said six months ago where everyone was
horrified that a politician could

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120
horrified that a politician could
 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.469
horrified that a politician could
possibly even prevail on people to

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479
possibly even prevail on people to
 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.129
possibly even prevail on people to
listen to what was being said are now

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139
listen to what was being said are now
 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.230
listen to what was being said are now
being met with oh you know there we go

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240
being met with oh you know there we go
 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.600
being met with oh you know there we go
again we somehow has become

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610
again we somehow has become
 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.490
again we somehow has become
nerd to the messaging because of the

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500
nerd to the messaging because of the
 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.770
nerd to the messaging because of the
familiarity with which we are hearing it

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780
familiarity with which we are hearing it
 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.170
familiarity with which we are hearing it
and I think it's really important for us

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180
and I think it's really important for us
 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.200
and I think it's really important for us
as a society and for us as voters to

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210
as a society and for us as voters to
 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.959
as a society and for us as voters to
recognize that a familiar story is not

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:51.969
recognize that a familiar story is not
 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.589
recognize that a familiar story is not
necessarily a truthful story a familiar

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599
necessarily a truthful story a familiar
 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:59.159
necessarily a truthful story a familiar
story might sound comfortable and our

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169
story might sound comfortable and our
 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.770
story might sound comfortable and our
brains might proxy that story for

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780
brains might proxy that story for
 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.260
brains might proxy that story for
meaning safe and therefore right and

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270
meaning safe and therefore right and
 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.409
meaning safe and therefore right and
therefore comfortable but that story

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:07.419
therefore comfortable but that story
 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:10.350
therefore comfortable but that story
doesn't necessarily reflect us or what

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360
doesn't necessarily reflect us or what
 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.860
doesn't necessarily reflect us or what
we value and it's really important to be

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870
we value and it's really important to be
 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.459
we value and it's really important to be
able to step out from the safety of what

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:17.469
able to step out from the safety of what
 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.110
able to step out from the safety of what
might at this point feel familiar and

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120
might at this point feel familiar and
 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.540
might at this point feel familiar and
really recognize the words for what they

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550
really recognize the words for what they
 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.290
really recognize the words for what they
are there are words that are inciting

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300
are there are words that are inciting
 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.939
are there are words that are inciting
hatred and division and stereotyping in

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:32.949
hatred and division and stereotyping in
 

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:36.629
hatred and division and stereotyping in
us as a society and for many of us

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639
us as a society and for many of us
 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.029
us as a society and for many of us
that's not the society in which we want

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039
that's not the society in which we want
 

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:42.029
that's not the society in which we want
to live and I think there's a moral

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.039
to live and I think there's a moral
 

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:44.909
to live and I think there's a moral
impetus on us to be able to step back

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:44.919
impetus on us to be able to step back
 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:49.499
impetus on us to be able to step back
from the story and step forward with our

00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:49.509
from the story and step forward with our
 

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:51.930
from the story and step forward with our
values
