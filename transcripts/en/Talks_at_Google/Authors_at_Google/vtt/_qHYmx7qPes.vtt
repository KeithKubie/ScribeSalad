[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.850
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Awesome.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.520
Hey everyone, thank you
all for coming through.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.594
Really appreciate it.

00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:15.760
My name is Jordan Thibodeau.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.950
I'm here hosting Gad Saad.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.830
This talk was brought
to you by Talktopia.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.530
Go/talktopia have a lot
of great talks on there.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.287
Tim Ferriss writing
all day and what not.

00:00:25.287 --> 00:00:27.370
So if you don't want to
miss out on a great event,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.145
go ahead and subscribe.

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:31.930
Gad Saad is someone who doesn't
really need an introduction,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.850
but I'm going to do it anyways.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.690
He's a professor of marketing
at Concordia University

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.000
and a research chair in
evolutionary behavioral

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.870
sciences and
Darwinian consumption.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.150
He also has an amazing
YouTube channel, which

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.525
is called "The Godfather?"

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:48.650
GAD SAAD: "The Saad Truth."

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.066
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
The Saad Truth."

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.880
People call-- his
nickname is the god--

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.270
OK yeah, "The Sad Truth."

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.980
so anyways, thank you all
for coming through and let's

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.050
give a round of applause
to Dr. Gad Saad.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.213
GAD SAAD: Thank you.

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:04.379
Thank you very much, Jordan.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.740
It's a true pleasure and
honor for me to be here.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.500
I guess my life has
gone full circle

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.510
because my doctorate, which
I defended 23 years ago,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.910
was actually in an
issue of "Search," which

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.880
should be relevant
to the top search

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.300
company in the world-- of
course, you do more than that.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.140
My doctoral dissertation was
on a very specific problem,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.130
specifically something
called stoppings behavior.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.860
When is it that we've
acquired enough information

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.050
to stop acquiring
additional information

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.400
and commit to a choice?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.850
Which is a fundamental
search problem, right?

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.680
When you're choosing
a mate to marry,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.770
of course there are many
more people to sample

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.094
from in the world, yet
we don't, regrettably.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.650
When it applies to which
political candidate we choose,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.260
which car we buy,
which person to hire,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.840
we don't look at all of
the available and relevant

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.830
information.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.920
Instead, we look at
enough information

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.220
until a point when we say
I'm ready to choose Toyota,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.020
I'm ready to marry this person,
I'm ready to hire this guy.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.450
So this was the topic--

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.690
the cognitive processes of how
we stop information search.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.890
That was my doctoral
dissertation at Cornell.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.940
Then, I went off.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.450
Well actually, let me
tell you how it all

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.369
started the evolutionary
part of my research career.

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:31.910
When I went to
Cornell, it was really

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.690
to study consumer choice
as a mathematical modeler.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.427
And then I hooked
up with the guy

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:40.010
who became my doctoral
supervisor, who

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.200
was a mathematical and
cognitive psychologist,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.270
and he suggested that I go
into the behavioral sciences.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.270
First semester at Cornell, I
had taken a course with this--

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.770
Oh!

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.680
What did I do?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.610
What did I do?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.010
OK.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.811
I had taken a course with this
gentleman-- professor Denis

00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:58.310
Regan.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.380
It was an advanced
psychology course.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.290
And about halfway through
the course he assigned--

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.470
this is in fall 1990, my
first semester at Cornell--

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.849
he assigned this book.

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.140
Has anybody heard of this book?

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.974
Has anybody read it?

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:10.848
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:11.758
GAD SAAD: Sorry?

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.294
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:13.960
GAD SAAD: Looks?

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.082
AUDIENCE: Cheery.

00:03:15.082 --> 00:03:15.790
GAD SAAD: Cheery.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.010
Yes, exactly.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.620
"Homicide" is a book
written by two pioneers

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.920
of evolutionary psychology,
Martin Bailey and Margot

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.780
Wilson, where they offer
evolutionary explanations

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.307
for patterns of
criminality to the extent

00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:32.890
that there are certain
types of crimes

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.430
that happen in roughly
the same way across time,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.770
across cultures.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.800
There might be some
underlying universal processes

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.510
that explain these crimes.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.910
And when I saw the
explanatory power

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.000
of evolutionary psychology
in explaining criminality,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.640
I had my eureka moment.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.000
I knew that I would
use that framework

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.657
to study consumer behavior.

00:03:56.657 --> 00:03:58.490
Now I define consumer
behavior very broadly.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.390
It's not just consuming
Coca-Cola and Starbucks,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.530
but we consume religion,
we consume friendships,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.200
pretty much anything
you can think of,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.460
I could fit it under a
consumatory umbrella.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.810
And so this is how
I started looking

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.890
at how I could apply biology
and evolution, and psychology

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.720
in particular, to study
our consumatory nature.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.029
And so what I'll do for today's
lecture is offer you, hopefully

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.570
by the end of today's
lecture, you'll

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.370
get a good sense of how we
could use Darwinian thinking

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.331
in studying consumption.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.740
Now as you might imagine,
in the social sciences,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.840
I really straddled both
the natural sciences

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.570
and the social sciences
given the work that I do.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.150
Amongst my natural
science colleagues,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.660
of course they all say yes,
of course biology matters.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.690
Amongst my social
science colleagues,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.700
the story is a bit
more complicated,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.370
because most social
scientists, in a sense,

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.210
define their belongingness
to the social sciences club

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.180
by their abdication
of biology, right?

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.430
According to them,
what makes us humans

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.840
is that we transcend
our biology.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.020
And so as you
might imagine, I've

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.240
had quite a bit of a rough ride.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.850
Now, the reality is that science
is an auto-corrective process.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.840
So without being too
gleeful, the better ideas

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.970
eventually went out, and
I think most people now

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.136
are starting to come around.

00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:26.937
It's becoming less
tenable to say openly

00:05:26.937 --> 00:05:28.645
that you don't think
biology matters when

00:05:28.645 --> 00:05:29.740
it comes to human affairs.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.680
But there are still
some old remnants

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.230
who refuse to admit
that biology matters.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.784
Some of the key canards
that you typically hear,

00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:41.200
some of the key objections--
there are many more of these.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.530
I discuss this-- by the way,
the book that Jordan kindly

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.480
got for you guys, "The
Consuming Instinct,"

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.780
I discussed many of
these detractors,

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.030
but let me just mention
a few very briefly.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.550
So here's one typical
argument you hear.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.400
Well, biology is
great to explain

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.130
the behavior of the mosquito
and the zebra and the dog,

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.410
but surely, you
can't use biology

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.330
to explain human behavior.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.120
This is called the
human reticence effect.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.830
The exact same
evolutionary principle

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.250
might apply to every possible
species except humans.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.200
Evolution stops right here.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.270
Somehow our brains come
through a magical process

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.550
that's outside of
evolution, which,

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.230
of course, is ridiculous.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.950
Here's a second
one you often hear.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.410
Evolutionary
psychology is dangerous

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.220
because it quote "justifies"
and condones reprehensible

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.880
behavior."

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.110
So for example, if you explain
why child abuse might happen

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.520
or why rape happens or why men
and women cheat on one another

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.530
in an otherwise
monogamous union,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.110
then somebody will come
along in a very irate manner

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.924
and say you're using science
to condone and justify

00:06:52.924 --> 00:06:53.590
these behaviors.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.140
Of course you're not doing that.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.720
The oncologist who
studies pancreatic cancer

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.850
is not for cancer.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.440
He's not justifying cancer.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.220
He's studying honestly cancer.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.260
And so if you study
child abuse and rape

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.210
and marital infidelity,
that doesn't

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.210
mean that you're for it.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.168
That doesn't mean that
you're trying to come up

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.710
with an umbrella to justify it.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.251
It means that you're trying to
honestly understand these very

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:21.070
reprehensible behaviors.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.250
Here's another one
that comes up often.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.430
This is what I call
the but men are not

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.300
taller than women because Tom--

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.430
not Tom Jones.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.880
What's his name?

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.430
What's the actors name?

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.630
Tom Cruise.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.590
Tom Jones.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.490
I'm showing my age.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.650
Tom Jones was a was a
sex symbol in the '70s.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.410
So Tom Cruise is shorter
than Katie Homes who

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.380
was his ex-wife, therefore aha!

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.820
it's not true that men
are taller than women.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:55.500
The cognitive bias there is
that people take a single datum

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.650
to falsify a statement that
holds true at the population

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.320
level.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.350
So if you explain,
on average, men

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.080
prefer to mate with
nubile, fertile women

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.624
more so than
post-menopausal women,

00:08:05.624 --> 00:08:07.290
someone will put up
their hands and say,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.870
but that's not true because
my Uncle Joe is dating

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.450
an older woman named Glenda.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.690
Oh gee, Darwin is dead.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.790
We're back to the
drawing boards.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.350
Of course that's not true.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.000
But again, that's the cognitive
vice that people succumb to.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.020
And this is the one that
irritates me the most

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.810
because it is the
one that typically

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.320
is levied by otherwise
sophisticated academics.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.360
They say that evolutionary
psychology is just

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.870
a bunch of fanciful
post-hoc stories

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.980
that you come up
with after the fact.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.730
Nothing could be
further from the truth

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.139
as I will show you
in a few slides.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.410
This is going to be a
bit the technical part

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.485
of the presentation.

00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:50.110
And then later, I'll
give you some sort

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.080
of sexy, practical examples.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.620
So the epistemology of
evolutionary psychology,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.880
or for short, I'll
just call it EP.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.190
So the method of EP is really
comprised of three components.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.650
When you're doing
evolutionary research,

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.645
you really are doing
these three things.

00:09:08.645 --> 00:09:10.020
You first have to
differentiate--

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.167
and I'll explain each
of these in turn.

00:09:12.167 --> 00:09:13.750
You have to differentiate
between what

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.760
are called proximate
and ultimate scientific

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.200
explanations.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.360
That's a fundamentally
important distinction.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.970
And I'll talk about
this in a second.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.190
You build what are called
nomological networks

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.959
of cumulative evidence,
very, very important.

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.000
Again, I'll explain this.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.625
And then you also
build what are called

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:31.270
consilient trees of knowledge.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.840
Consilience basically
means unity of knowledge.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.900
Physics is more
consilient than sociology,

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.450
not because physicists are
smarter than sociologists,

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.450
but because physics has
organized its knowledge

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.110
base in a way where there are
these organized, coherent trees

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.830
of knowledge.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.480
Sociology hasn't.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.210
We can't agree in
sociology whether there

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.030
is such a thing as innate
sex differences or not.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.010
OK?

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.382
So I'll explain each
of these in turn.

00:10:00.382 --> 00:10:01.840
So let's begin with
this first one.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.110
So here I'm going
to discuss this one.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.480
The difference between proximate
and ultimate explanations.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.170
Much of science operates
at the proximate level.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.570
Most Nobel Prizes that
have ever been won

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.350
have been won at
the proximate level.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.900
What does proximate means?

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.650
Proximate means you're trying
to understand the how and what

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.060
of a phenomenon.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.860
How does diabetes work?

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.140
What are some factors
that increase the severity

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.700
of the symptoms of diabetes?

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.040
These questions--
the how and what,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.350
which is where much of
science operates-- those

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.360
are proximate questions.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.700
Ultimate questions--
and by the way here,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.030
people think ultimate means
superior, it's the ultimate.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.200
That's not what it means.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.730
Ultimate means the
ultimate Darwinian why.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.120
Why would the mechanism have
evolved to be of that form?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.140
So it's not that
ultimate explanations are

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.000
superior to
approximate ones, it's

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.550
that you need both
levels of explanations

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.290
to fully understand
the phenomenon.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.410
So again, you will only study
these types of explanations

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.994
if you come with an
evolutionary lens.

00:11:10.994 --> 00:11:13.159
Now you might say OK, I'm
not really quite following

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:13.830
what this is.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.621
So let me give you a
very concrete example.

00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:18.890
Take, for example,
pregnancy sickness.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.140
This is a universal
phenomenon that

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.170
happens throughout time
and across cultures.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.040
Women, at a very predictable
point in their gestation,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.510
will experience
pregnancy sickness.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.051
The reason why we call pregnancy
sickness rather than morning

00:11:32.051 --> 00:11:33.620
sickness is because
it doesn't only

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.770
manifest itself in the morning,
although typically, it does.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.830
So we call it, more
generally, pregnancy sickness.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.770
Well, what would be
a proximate story

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.890
to tackle when it comes
to pregnancy sickness?

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.880
Well, how do the hormonal
fluctuations of a woman

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.700
affect the severity
of her symptoms?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.400
That's approximate question.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.140
The ultimate question is
why have women evolved

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.000
this physiological response?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.050
Why is it that women,
at a very specific point

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.310
in their gestation, actually
experience these very, very

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.230
ugly and unpleasant symptoms?

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.560
And the answer from an
adaptive evolution perspective,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:21.380
is that this is the mechanism
to protect the fetus in-utero

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.800
from exposure to pathogens.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.280
At a very specific point in the
gestation called organogenesis,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.210
during the first trimester, if
the fetus is exposed typically

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.750
to food pathogens-- things
that the woman will ingest,

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.190
consume--

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.420
that could wreak havoc with
the development of the organs.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.620
Therefore, evolution has
yielded a very elegant,

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.820
adaptive solution.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:53.850
Women tend to be repelled from
foods or other sources that

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.550
have high teratogen values.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.850
They'll be attracted to
other foods that serve

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.190
anti-microbial properties.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.760
Pickling-- the typical,
stereotype of a pregnant woman

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.020
wanting pickles--

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.890
pickling has an
anti-microbial property.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.310
Women who experience
more pregnancy sickness

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.250
are less likely to
have miscarriages.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.610
The outcome of the
child is greater

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.400
if the woman experiences
pregnancy sickness.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.130
So when a woman
goes to her OBGYN

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.280
and he or she will
give her a pill

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.710
to attenuate those symptoms,
from an evolutionary

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.360
perspective, you're doing
the exactly incorrect things.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.820
Now you might need
it because you

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.980
might have to give a
talk that day at Google

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.170
and you can't run every
three seconds to throw up.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.770
So from that perspective, from
that proximate perspective,

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.270
it would make sense, but from
an evolutionary perspective,

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.790
it doesn't.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.787
So here you see the difference
between a proximate perspective

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:50.620
and an ultimate one.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.290
Sorry, you might not be able
to read this very clearly.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:02.540
But this now goes
to the second point.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.490
Here I'm going to
talk about how you

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.010
build these nomological
networks of cumulative evidence.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.820
How do you build
evolutionary explanations?

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.640
And is exactly the
opposite of this idea

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.950
that we just sit
there, smoking a pipe,

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.380
coming up with fanciful stories.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.627
It's the exact opposite of that.

00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:21.210
So here we go.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.840
So here, I'm looking
at the biological roots

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.460
of toy preferences.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.150
Are toy preferences
innate-- biological--

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.330
or, is it, as social
scientists tell us,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.600
the means by which little
boys and little girls

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.700
learn about their sexist,
arbitrary stereotypes.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.500
From the social
scientists perspective,

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.230
biology has nothing to
do with toy preferences.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.960
The evidence points very
much against that position.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.240
So what I've done here is I've
built a nomological network.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.220
What's a nomological network?

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.980
It's evidence stemming from
many, many different lines

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:10.460
of evidence that
makes it unassailable

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.090
that there is an inherent
biological root to toy

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.740
preferences.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.689
So I took a lot of
effort to actually build

00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:19.730
this nomological network.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.880
Let's go through
it very quickly.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.040
This is from
developmental psychology.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.330
You could take children who
are too young to be socialized.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.070
In other words, by
definition, they

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.050
haven't yet reached
the cognitive stage

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.480
where they could be
taught by mommy and daddy

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.420
to play with trucks and
dolls, and guess what?

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.980
They already exhibit those
sex-specific preferences.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.970
Now you might say ho do you
elicit those preferences?

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.040
It's either usually
when they reach

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.250
to one of the toys or the
other, or through gaze studies.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.790
So little boys do look at trucks
much more than little girls,

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.760
and little girls will
look at dolls and so on.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.420
So already, just that
one line of evidence

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.000
is casting doubt on
the idea that there

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.400
is no innate preference involved
with toys, but let's go on.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.830
Look at this one--
cross- species.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.730
Studies done with vervet
monkeys, with rhesus monkeys,

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.970
and with chimps shows
the same sex-specificity

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.140
of toy preferences.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.650
That's not looking like it's
all due to arbitrary, sexist

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.930
stereotypes from the patriarchy.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.080
Let's go on.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.730
Clinical endocrinology.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.980
Girls who are afflicted
with congenital adrenal

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.090
hyperplasia--

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.980
this is an
endocrinological disorder

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.190
that masculinizes
morphological features,

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.590
that masculinizes behaviors--

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.895
little girls who suffer from
congenital adrenal hyperplasia,

00:16:44.895 --> 00:16:47.020
what do you think happens
to their toy preferences?

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.260
They become a lot
more similar to boys.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.710
It's not looking like it's all
due to random socialization,

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:53.400
does it?

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.730
Let's keep going if
you're not convinced.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.760
Cross-cultural study, Sweden.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.220
By the way, are there
any Swedes here?

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.300
No?

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.180
OK, so then I'll bash
on Sweden without--

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.349
In Sweden, there's something
called the Hofstede score.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:12.270
Hofstede was a
cross-cultural psychologist

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:17.010
who scored countries along
different cultural values.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.050
Of all countries in
the world, Sweden

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.460
scores the highest
on femininity.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.420
So if there is a
natural experiment where

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.750
you could see whether
toy preferences

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.740
in a feminized society
would somehow flip,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.370
Sweden would be the case.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:39.000
So this person
inventoried 40,000 toys

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.970
in actual bedrooms
of little boys

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.060
and little girls in
Sweden, and guess what?

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.540
They had the exact same toy
preferences as everywhere else

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.590
in the world.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.010
Already we've reached
enough evidence,

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.370
but let's keep hammering it
so it becomes unassailable.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.710
You could do
cross-cultural studies

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.390
with non-western samples,
because you might say oh,

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.690
but Sweden is still a
westernized country.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.500
So you could go to
cultures in Sahara

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.600
and in North African region that
have absolutely no Venn diagram

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.340
interactions on many of
these cultural values,

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.780
and yet, the sex specificity
of toys is exactly the same.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.360
Let's keep going.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.260
You could look at classics,
meaning ancient Greece.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.970
And you could look at
funerary art in tombstones.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.830
What is the art that's depicted?

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.490
Little boys are depicted with
the typical sex-specific toys.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.250
And little girls with a
typical sex-specific toys.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:43.050
It's not looking like it's
due to the patriarchy is it?

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.270
Pediatric endocrinology.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.180
You could take urine
samples from little boys

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.650
and little girls starting at
age seven days until six months,

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.890
and you show that the more
testosterone you have,

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.539
that will affect
your toy preferences.

00:18:57.539 --> 00:18:58.830
I won't go through all of that.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.380
I mean, I guess I missed one
or two, but you get the idea.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.860
By building these nomological
networks of cumulative evidence

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.860
stemming from completely
different fields,

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.380
you then build an
evolutionary argument.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.310
This doesn't look like it's just
random, sort of storytelling,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.920
does it?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.860
Let's keep going.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.420
Here's another example.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.450
This one is a bit
more controversial

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.450
because we're talking
about mating preferences.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.330
Men have an evolved preference
for the hourglass figure

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.320
in women.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.440
My goodness, that's
very sexist to say.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.160
No it's not.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.120
Women, by the way, have very
clear morphological preferences

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.100
in the types of men they prefer.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.470
For a sexually
reproducing species,

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.570
you would expect
that the two sexes

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.010
would have evolved preferences.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.280
It's called sexual
selection, one

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.110
of the fundamental
mechanisms of evolution.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.620
So let's see
whether we can build

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.600
an adaptive
evolutionary argument

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.955
to explain this reality.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.070
Well, it turns out that the
hourglass figure medically

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.710
has been shown to be a reliable
cue of fertility and health.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.800
So we're not just building
these evolutionary arguments

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.200
while taking acid.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.470
There is actually
epidemiological studies

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.380
that demonstrate that if you
have an hourglass figure,

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.590
you're more likely
to be fertile.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.120
You're more likely
to be healthy.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.036
And so it doesn't take
much of an evolutionist

00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:26.590
to understand why there'd be
selection pressures for men

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.950
to prefer women who have
the body shape of Beyonce

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.630
more so than a male
Olympic swimmer.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.890
OK, let's keep going.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.350
This, actually, one of these
cited studies comes from me.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.960
Let me tell you the
background to it.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.090
A few years ago one of
my undergraduate students

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.585
had finished his course
with me, and then came to me

00:20:45.585 --> 00:20:47.210
at the end of the
course and said, hey,

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.043
I'd like to hang out
with you professor Saad

00:20:49.043 --> 00:20:52.904
and maybe serve as a research
assistant on some project.

00:20:52.904 --> 00:20:54.820
At the time, I didn't
have any research funds.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.592
I didn't have my chair
professorship yet.

00:20:56.592 --> 00:20:59.050
I said, well, I don't have any
immediate money to give you.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.870
He said, well, it doesn't
matter, I'll do it pro bono.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:01.828
Just give me a project.

00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:04.240
I just want to hang
out and learn from you.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.190
So I thought about what
project to give him

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.410
and I contacted him and I
said, all right, I think

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.534
I've got a project for you.

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:12.850
How would you like to surf porn
sites for a couple of weeks?

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:17.400
To which he answered, I
love you professor Saad.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.390
What did I ask him to do?

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.830
I wanted to see, speaking
of search engines,

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.680
the Internet allows us
to really get access

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.320
to cross-cultural
data very quickly.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.490
I said go to as many sites
as you can find online where

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.060
they advertise online escorts--

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.730
women advertising
their sexual services.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.850
My name is Linda, here is
my height, here's my age.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.220
And usually, they always
give you their measurements.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.636
Now of course it doesn't matter
whether their measurements

00:21:47.636 --> 00:21:48.940
are true or not.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.340
Because sometimes people
say, but what if she's lying?

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:51.980
Who cares.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.970
That's not the point.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.060
The point is what
is she advertising?

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.220
Because what she's
advertising is

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.570
what's catering to men's
evolved preferences.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.856
And so I simply asked him to
code the waist and the hip.

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:06.230
And, by the way,
in case you want

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.800
to know later if you want
to take the measurements,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.100
the preferred waist to
hip on a woman is 0.7.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.870
On a man-- in other words,
what women like in a man--

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.990
it's 0.9 OK.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.870
So 0.7 is that marker.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.630
Well, the average
across 48 countries

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.910
that couldn't be any more
different than one another

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.550
was 0.72, exactly within
what you would expect.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.730
Let's keep going.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:39.290
Here's the hourglass across 286
Egyptian, African, Greco-Roman

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:43.550
and Indian sculptures spanning
several thousand years.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.100
And also looking at
Joman figurines--

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.530
155 prehistoric
figurines-- guess what?

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.260
The hourglass figure comes
out across all those cultures.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:58.310
That doesn't seem like it's
due to the pervasive patriarchy

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.280
as shown in
"Cosmopolitan Magazine."

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.240
Let's keep going.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.040
I won't go through all of these
because you get the point.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.240
This one is the real killer.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.440
You ready for this?

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:12.200
Congenitally blind men-- men
who've never had the gift

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.340
of sight--

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.670
exhibit the hourglass
figure preference.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.580
Now you might say, well, how do
they elicit those preferences?

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.110
They do it haptically.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.330
They give different mannequins.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.440
The congenitally blind
men check them out,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.020
and then they choose the
one that's the hourglass.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.050
That doesn't suggest that
it's due to media images.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.501
Those guys have never
seen media images.

00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:37.250
So again, I won't go
through all of these,

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.790
but systematically, by
coming up with data sources

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.680
from completely
different fields,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.740
you end up building an
unassailable argument.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.860
By the way, none other than
the great Charles Darwin

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.290
himself had precisely done that.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.270
Now he didn't call it
nomological networks

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.900
of cumulative evidence.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.360
This is a term
that came in later.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.360
For those you're interested,
you could check out

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.940
a paper by Schmidt and
Pilcher that have done this.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.450
But when he wrote
"Origin of Species,"

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.560
the book that introduces the
idea of natural selection,

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.730
that's exactly what he did.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.380
He came up with
years of observations

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.010
coming from many,
many different fields,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:22.610
which, when put together,
makes his natural selection

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.580
idea seem unassailable.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.410
So contrary to what
most people who

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.630
don't understand evolutionary
psychology argue,

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.090
which is oh, we just come
up with fanciful stories,

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.840
it's the exact opposite.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.510
The evidentiary
threshold that we

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.990
set before we decide that
something is an adaptation

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.714
is actually much higher than
the rest of the sciences.

00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:43.880
All right, let's keep going.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.220
So this is exactly what
this curve is showing.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.210
Here's the threshold
that you'd like to reach

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:57.010
in support of your hypothesis.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:01.200
Here's the threshold
that you'd like to reach

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.970
to refute your hypothesis.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.530
And basically, each
of those squares

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.880
that I showed you earlier is
systematically leading us up

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.216
to that threshold.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.030
So now that was sort of the
more technical part of the chat.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:22.020
Now let's kind of give
you some breathing room.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.570
Are consumers born or made?

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.800
You often will hear this--

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.180
is it nature or nurture?

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.490
That's actually a
false dichotomy.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.850
And the example I like to
use is the cake metaphor.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.150
If you look here,
each of these are

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:40.530
ingredients that constitute
elements of baking a cake.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.210
Then, I bake the cake.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.090
If I now tell you here,
please point to the sugar,

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:46.590
please point to the
eggs, you can't.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.200
It's an inextricable
mix of all of it.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.360
That's what humans are.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.600
For most relevant phenomena,
we are inextricable mix

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.490
of our nature and nurture.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.380
That's called the
interactioners viewpoint.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.850
Our genes interact
with the environment.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.900
So it's not only the environment
as many social scientists

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.680
think.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.320
And no serious
evolutionist thinks

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.540
that the environment
doesn't matter,

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.964
but what we do say is you have
to take biology into account.

00:26:14.964 --> 00:26:16.380
Now of course in
my work what I do

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.950
is I introduce biology
to the business school.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.610
If anybody here has an
MBA, undoubtedly, you

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.290
can't get you MBA
without ever hearing

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:26.970
the word biology mentioned.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:31.320
That's crazy because our
hormones affect the investment

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.680
decisions that we make.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.920
If we're situationally
hungry or not,

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.040
we decide to make
the decision a or b.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.364
So all sorts of very basic
physiological realities

00:26:41.364 --> 00:26:42.780
affect the decisions
that we make,

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.840
whether we're employers,
employees, consumers, managers.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.630
And so what I try to do is
systematically introduce

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.940
evolutionary theory into
the business school.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.290
I'll skip this part because
it might take a bit to cover.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.540
Evolutionary
psychology is not only

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.610
about looking at
human universals--

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:06.572
things that are the
same across cultures.

00:27:06.572 --> 00:27:08.030
Evolutionary
psychology can also be

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:12.170
used to explain why
cultural differences exist.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:17.250
So for example, some cultures
have very spicy foods,

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.770
other cultures have
very non spicy foods.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.930
If I were cultural
psychologist, I

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.020
would simply stop at that fact.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.990
I would simply point the
Malaysians have spicy food,

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.270
the Swedish folks
don't have spicy foods.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.560
Good night, everyone.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.000
It ends there.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.540
An evolutionist says, no, why
do culinary traditions evolve

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.550
to take different trajectories?

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.670
Is there a fundamental
reason that

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.390
can help us understand why
some culinary traditions are

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.320
spicier than others?

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.400
In this case, here's a
very spicy Mexican soup,

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.630
and here is a very non spicy,
classic Swedish meatball plate.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.300
And there turns out to
be a very good answer.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.830
If you map the
spiciness of a cuisine

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:09.920
against pathogenic density
across different environments,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.330
the data couldn't
be more perfect.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.080
Why?

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.750
Because in hot
climates where there

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.990
is a greater proliferation
of food pathogens,

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:23.340
cultures evolve to
come up with a solution

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.930
to a biological problem.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:29.700
Therefore, spices,
pickling, smoking, salting

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:34.110
are all cultural adaptations
to a basic biological problem.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.950
So culture doesn't exist outside
the boundaries of biology,

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.560
cultures exist
because of biology.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.030
Nothing is outside of biology.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.000
Here's a cool example
to explain something

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.500
known as the variety effects.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.520
The variety effect is the idea
that when you go to a buffet,

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.800
most of us will tend
to over eat, some of us

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.100
more than others
because it triggers

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.670
our penchant for variety
seeking when it comes to foods.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:08.460
Now for some animals, they have
a very high metabolic rate.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.070
So if you are a hummingbird, you
have to eat roughly three times

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.310
your body weight in
a typical day just

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.080
to survive until tomorrow.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.050
If you did that as a
200 pound individual,

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.400
you'd have to eat 600 pounds.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.800
Well of course, we don't
have that metabolic rate,

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.590
but yet we still
have this penchant

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.660
to eat many different
foods, which results--

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.870
for example, if you go to
an all-inclusive vacation.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.990
Has anybody been to Club Med?

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.980
Anybody?

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.200
On average, I think
five pounds a week.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.330
So if you go for two weeks, I
don't care how much exercise

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.580
you do, while
you're there, you're

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.470
putting on roughly
about 10 pounds.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:52.070
Because at an
all-inclusive resort,

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.840
it's almost impossible
for you to not

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.260
succumb to the pull of
sampling way more foods

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.940
than you otherwise would.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.630
And so here's very two examples.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.820
These are such simple
studies, but they

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.710
explain something so profound.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:10.010
Take M&amp;Ms that are one
color or multi-colored.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.610
The colorants is
tasteless, it's odorless.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.370
In other words, it doesn't
affect in any way objectively

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.360
what happens.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.600
But which of these do you
think people eat more of?

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.360
This one, because
the visual system

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.960
is being tricked into
sampling more because

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.000
of the variety of colors.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.050
Exact same study, but
using shapes in this case.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:37.080
Here is one-shaped pasta,
multi-shaped pasta.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.412
In other words, the pasta
is exactly the same.

00:30:39.412 --> 00:30:40.620
I eat a lot more of this one.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:49.980
Now this is actually one of
the studies that perhaps--

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.532
I mean, I'm fortunate enough
that my work not only receives

00:30:53.532 --> 00:30:55.990
attention among scientists,
but because of the type of work

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.360
I do, often the
media comes calling.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.010
This is one of
those studies where

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.220
the media came calling a lot
and you'll see in a second why.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.640
So I took here a principle
from animal behavior,

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.220
literally called peacocking.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:13.220
In this case, you've got the
male peacock, here's the hen,

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:17.870
and he starts exhibiting
this type of signaling

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:22.190
to show the iridescent coloring,
the size of the patterns,

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.570
the size of the tail--

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:28.160
all of this is what's known
in biology as a handicap

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.210
principle.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.080
Why?

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.150
Because for this animal to have
evolved such a burdensome tail,

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:39.060
this tail actually goes
against its survival.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.120
It actually reduces
the likelihood

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.040
of him taking flight
and avoiding predators.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.310
It actually increases
the likelihood

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.290
of a predator seeing him.

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:49.820
So how could it evolve?

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.400
Through natural selection it
certainly couldn't evolve.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.830
It evolved through
sexual selection

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.910
because it is actually
an honest signal

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.340
of his phenotypic quality.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.060
He is saying, look,
despite the costs

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.500
I am carrying for having
this tail, here I am.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.320
I'm the real deal.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.400
Pick me.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.560
So I take this idea and then
I apply it to human consumer

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.400
behavior, and therefore, for
all of you rich Google types

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:26.420
that are buying the Maserati,
you're just lowly peacocks.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.469
I got you pegged from day one.

00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:30.260
What are you doing?

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.390
You're basically saying,
look, you little--

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.730
pretend they are males--

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.640
you can't compete
with me, because it

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.160
requires for you to
play at a higher level

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.510
to reach my signal.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:46.040
By the way, the upper
uppers, the highest echelon,

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.411
actually drive very
non-fancy cars.

00:32:49.411 --> 00:32:49.910
Why?

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.944
Any ideas?

00:32:53.944 --> 00:32:55.315
Yes?

00:32:55.315 --> 00:32:57.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.400
GAD SAAD: No.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:58.930
Good answer.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:32:59.430
No.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.066
It's-- yes?

00:33:01.066 --> 00:33:02.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.293
GAD SAAD: It's almost that.

00:33:04.293 --> 00:33:06.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.860
GAD SAAD: Exactly.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.660
Especially within
their social class.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.430
So let me say it.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:17.150
So if I am a billionaire
driving a Ferrari

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.510
amongst my billionaire's circle.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.240
It's not really a barrier
to entry for their signaling

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.230
because they could
match that as well.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.110
Therefore, it is
an irrelevant cue

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.370
to use to demonstrate
my honest status.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.140
The way that I
would do that is I

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.710
will buy a painting
that a three-year-old

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:40.200
could have painted and
pay $100 million for it.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.140
Now that's an honest signal.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.970
It has to be wasteful.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.850
Just like the peacock
still has to be wasteful,

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.130
throwing away $100
million on something

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.100
that a three-year-old
degenerate could do,

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.480
now that's impressive.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.740
I'm mixing it up for you.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.390
You guys are too
politically correct.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:59.450
Let's bump it up a bit.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:00.020
OK.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.080
All right, so therefore,
what I did in this study--

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.820
not a three-year-old degenerate,
a prospective three-year-old

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:09.570
degenerate.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:13.770
Because at three years old, his
trajectory hasn't been set yet.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:18.030
So what we did here is we took
this idea and we actually--

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:20.550
and I say we, this is with my
former graduate student John

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.350
Vungus--

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:26.820
we actually got a Porsche
and a beaten up car.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.300
This wasn't imagine
you're driving a Porsche,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.860
we actually rented a Porsche.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:36.810
And I always tell people, try
to get a granting agency to give

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.030
you money because
you write, we're

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.889
going to rent a
Porsche for the weekend

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:43.310
for scientific purposes.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.150
Well, we did.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:48.449
And what we did for this study
is after they drove these two

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:55.400
cars, we took salivary assays
to measure, what do you think?

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.881
Testosterone.

00:34:56.881 --> 00:34:58.130
And what do you think happens?

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:02.240
You put a young male in this car
and his endocrinological system

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.370
explodes.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.740
Now in retrospect, you
all say, of course that

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.700
makes sense, but guess what?

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.420
Nobody in the business school
is looking at things like that.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.890
Somehow hormones magically
cease to be relevant when

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:17.500
you enter the business world.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.470
It doesn't.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.740
It's an indelible
part of who we are.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.150
Let's go on This
is not my study.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:25.880
This is from some
British psychologist,

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.710
but along the same lines in
terms of the status of a car.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.570
You take the exact same guy.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.314
You put him in a Ford
Fiesta or in a Bentley.

00:35:35.314 --> 00:35:37.230
You take the same girl,
you do the same thing,

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.563
and you do opposite sex ratings.

00:35:38.563 --> 00:35:43.080
So for this guy, you ask women
to rate just how attractive

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.580
he is.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.440
It's not how
attractive as a mate,

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.600
which is a multi-attribute.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.270
Obviously, his physical
looks don't magically

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.460
change if he's in
a Bentley or not.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.490
Apparently they do
if you're a woman.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.530
This guy is gorgeous.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:01.020
This guy is a degenerate.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.560
But for men, this didn't matter.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.430
In other words, men
did not evaluate

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:09.710
the physical
attractiveness of a woman

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.370
as a function of which status
symbol she was associated with.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:15.980
Now, I can guarantee
you that I could

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.470
run this study in 50
countries of your choosing

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.040
and we will exactly
replicate this finding.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.200
We will replicate
exactly this finding

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.020
because the underlying
phenomenon behind this finding

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.120
is rooted in
evolutionary psychology.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:34.280
It's not as though in Bolivia
and in Nigeria and in Japan

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.008
this finding would be different.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:45.340
Same thing done with
a guy being shown next

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.000
to a shady apartment
or a fancy apartment.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.710
And a woman-- same thing--

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.310
this guy is gorgeous,
this guy is not.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:57.611
Men couldn't give a damn
where the girl was shown.

00:36:57.611 --> 00:36:59.860
So you could do this with a
million different products

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.568
and you'll get the
exact same phenomenon.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.180
This is a study that
we're currently-- this

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.440
is myself with one of my former
doctoral students Tripat Gill.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.570
We've collected more data
since, so this could be

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:15.080
probably updated to 2015 maybe.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.660
Here's what we did here.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.170
We created, ostensibly,
an online dating profile.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.930
Here's the guy.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.610
Here's stuff about me.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.092
Here's my favorite possession.

00:37:27.092 --> 00:37:29.300
The only thing we changed
is his favorite possession.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.310
He either has a red Kia.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:36.020
No disrespect to any Kia owners,
or he's got this Porsche.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:40.424
And then we asked
people to rate this guy.

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:41.840
Now let me give
you the background

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.240
to how I got the idea
to run this study.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.180
There was a famous
study done in psychology

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:50.960
where they brought
a guy into a room

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.040
and introduced him by ascribing
different academic statuses

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.540
to him.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.370
Here is Joe Smith.

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.420
He's a lecturer.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.310
Here's Joe Smith.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.800
He's an associate professor.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.320
And then when he
left, they would

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:11.570
ask the people to tell their
perception of his height.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.800
Well it turns out that
with academic status,

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.585
you grow taller.

00:38:15.585 --> 00:38:17.210
That's why I told my
wife, don't worry,

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:18.626
you're not married
to a short guy.

00:38:18.626 --> 00:38:22.220
You're married to an NBA star.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:27.350
Because the reality is that
your perceptual system gets

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:31.860
tricked by this status cue.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.080
And so what happened here?

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.660
This guy was judged as taller--

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.990
there was what we called his
status elongation effect.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:47.330
He became taller, but
only in the eyes of whom?

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.410
Women.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.170
What do you think
men rated the guy?

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.520
Shorter.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.370
Which again speaks
to the psychology

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.560
of intra-sexual rivalry.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.449
Both men and women
denigrate same-sex partners

00:39:01.449 --> 00:39:02.990
in a way that is
perfectly consistent

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:04.198
with evolutionary principles.

00:39:04.198 --> 00:39:06.530
In this case, I am
threatened by a guy

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.332
who may have higher status
than me, so I denigrate him.

00:39:09.332 --> 00:39:10.290
How do I denigrate him?

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:13.310
Oh he's driving a Porsche, he
must be a little short runt.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:17.210
And so again, you see how
all of this psychology

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:21.970
is playing into these basic
evolutionary principles.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:26.290
Very, very quickly let me do a
few more of these car studies.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.232
This is a study that was
done a long time ago.

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:30.440
It might seem dated, but
it's actually very powerful,

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.549
especially in
California, especially

00:39:32.549 --> 00:39:34.840
in a place like the Bay Area
here where a lot of people

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.980
drive fancy cars.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.660
So here's what they
did in the study.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.576
At a red light-- this
was a field experiment--

00:39:39.576 --> 00:39:42.710
at a red light,
they actually put--

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.860
these are the experimenters--
either a-- it wasn't

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:49.360
these cars, this was
then 1968, so I just

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.970
chose a fancy car
versus a non-fancy car.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.430
And they simply
looked at how long

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.029
it took a person who
was-- wait, this person

00:39:57.029 --> 00:39:59.320
doesn't know that they're
going to be in an experiment.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:05.260
How many seconds when the
light turns from red to green

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.990
do you exhibit
cues of impatience?

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:11.170
Maybe you flick the
light, maybe you honk.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.870
Of course people were
a lot more impatient

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.690
when the car that was blocking
them was lower status.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.320
That again speaks to certain
submissive dynamics that

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.870
happen within social species.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.390
In this case, it's happening
in a very modern context

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.248
in the way that we
respond on the road.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.890
In this case, in another
study almost 30 years later,

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:41.260
they kept the status of the
car constant that's blocking.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.620
And then they looked at whether
the car that's being blocked

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.950
would exhibit greater impatience
as a function of which car

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:48.880
I was driving.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.160
If I am in a fancy
car, it'll take me

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.500
less time to be irritated.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.420
And again, you could
see these types

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.390
of dominance,
submission interactions

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:02.070
across many social species.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.417
Let's move on.

00:41:03.417 --> 00:41:06.000
Now so far, a lot of the stuff
that I've been talking about it

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.530
seems as though I'm looking at
male-based sexual signaling.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.280
But of course, that's not true.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.610
Women-- I mean in the
human context, and not

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:17.310
just human context,
but across animals.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.400
Women, of course-- or females,
in the greater context--

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.850
will engage in sexual signaling.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:27.820
So in this case, this
is a female chimp.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.100
She will exhibit estrus--

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.230
that she is in a sexually
receptive state--

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.300
by sending certain
olfactory signals

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.950
that are very
attractive to the males.

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:39.910
Her genitalia will become
engorged, will become enlarged.

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:42.910
And this is basically saying
that she is sexually receptive.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.620
So I took this idea
and I thought, well,

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.290
how could we apply this
principle, which manifests

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:51.550
itself across many, many
species to the human context

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.950
and, specifically, to
the consumer context.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.860
And the idea was to
look at how women

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.100
dress as a function
of where they

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.060
are in their ovulatory cycle.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.740
And what do you think we found?

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.830
When women are in the
maximum fertile stage

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.240
of their menstrual cycle--

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.450
when they're ovulating--
they dress more sexily.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:13.920
They beautify more.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.690
Now that doesn't
mean, by the way,

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.550
that they look at an ovulation
chart and say, oh geez,

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.920
OK, there's ovulation, let
me dress with shorter skirt.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.970
It's a subconscious mechanism.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.830
I feel more sexy.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:26.910
I feel less bloated.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:28.400
I feel more desirable.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.330
My self-esteem is higher.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:34.110
And so all of these
mechanisms ensure

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.560
that a woman is more likely to
advertise herself in the mating

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.810
market when,
evolutionarily speaking,

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:42.790
it makes more sense to do so.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.060
Now these studies are
unassailable because they're

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.000
looking at very
basic physiological,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.250
hormonal, biological facts.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.770
That's why I very
carefully selected

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.810
to do these studies because
it makes them a lot more

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.410
difficult for my social science
colleagues to say, oh yeah,

00:42:58.410 --> 00:42:59.940
but this is just
due to learning.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.980
This is just due to culture.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:06.225
Because they're so basic in
their physiological genesis.

00:43:08.892 --> 00:43:09.600
Let's keep going.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.970
Switching gears.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:20.120
At the end of a successful
mating encounter,

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.790
you might have a
child and so this

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.290
is kind of the segue to this.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:29.230
Here's a study that was done in
Mexico in the Yucatan region.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:34.310
When a baby was born,
people would say, oh my god,

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:37.750
he looks so much
like the father,

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:42.400
even though objectively
that's absolutely untrue.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.140
That's absolutely untrue in
that the morphological features

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.580
of a newborn haven't yet
sufficiently formed for you

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.670
to be able to objectively
he looks more like the dad

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.790
or he looks more like the mom.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:57.590
So something's going on.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:01.100
Not only do people
say, oh my god,

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.400
he looks so much
like his father,

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.750
but which side of the family
is more likely to say it?

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.966
The mother's side because
the mother's side,

00:44:11.966 --> 00:44:13.340
from an evolutionary
perspective,

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.660
wants to send a very clear
signal to the father that don't

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.910
worry, this is your child.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.760
So before we had
DNA paternity tests

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.660
and before we had the
Maury Povich show, where

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.540
every second episode
is exactly that,

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.780
we had to come up with
a cultural mechanism

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.240
to ensure paternity certainty.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.840
And the way we do that is
by fakely stating, my god,

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.110
he looks exactly like you.

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:44.730
And by the way, if
you're wondering

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:49.650
why these two gorgeous,
stunning kids are so gorgeous,

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.760
that's because those
are my children.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.950
This is Luna when she was
very young, and this is Leor.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.516
They're now a bit older.

00:44:57.516 --> 00:44:59.390
They're in Southern
California waiting for me

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:00.181
to go to the beach.

00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:02.360
I am from the beach to
come to Google and speak.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:07.760
Now I want to tell you
a little fun story.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.710
I mentioned this story
before, but I always

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.110
love repeating it
because it demonstrates

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:14.840
the power of
evolutionary thinking

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.670
in understanding
our daily lives.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:30.670
These are the actual images, the
first images of Luna in utero.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:33.120
So for those of you
who are parents,

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:38.280
you know that when the mother
goes the first time to OBGYN,

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.480
usually you get those images.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.060
Most people are very
happy and proud.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.140
They celebrate this.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.120
They'll put it up on the fridge.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.180
We were no different.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:51.030
We put up this image and one
day my mother-in-law comes over

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:52.639
to our house, looks at--

00:45:52.639 --> 00:45:54.180
some people are
laughing because they

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.830
know where I'm going with this.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.920
She looks and she goes, oh
my god, Gad, the baby looks

00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.850
exactly like you.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.340
So I made my daughter
famous because this

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.220
was the first case
in science where

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.620
the maternal side
of the family was

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:16.180
trying to assure a father of
paternity certainty in utero.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.480
So I said, should I
be worried that you're

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.430
trying so hard to convince
me that your daughter didn't

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:25.122
go behind the bushes on me?

00:46:25.122 --> 00:46:26.580
She looks at me
she goes, oh enough

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.954
with your bullshit
science stuff.

00:46:27.954 --> 00:46:28.710
Look at that.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:30.954
She looks exactly like you.

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:33.120
Oh actually, she didn't
know it was a she because we

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.440
didn't know what sex it was--

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.550
it looks exactly like you.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.330
Here's a study that was actually
just accepted for publication.

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:44.550
This is Sigal Tifferet.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:47.830
This is myself and two other
young folks who helped us out.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.430
This is actually the
photo of my parents

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.680
when they got married in 1950.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.930
They're still both alive.

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:57.680
This was a study
where we looked at--

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.930
that this is going to speak
about paternity certainty.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.346
So you might say,
how do you apply

00:47:01.346 --> 00:47:02.440
this in consumer behavior?

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.000
Watch.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.300
The data here is from Israeli
weddings where this author

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.800
along with these guys--

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.750
they asked me to
come in on the paper

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.000
to help with the
evolutionary story.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.200
And this paper by the way is the
longest, most circuitous paper

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.260
that I've ever had in my
scientific career before it

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.940
being accepted for publication.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:29.300
We've worked on this paper I
think for more than five years

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.820
after the peer review process.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.120
That's how long it took to get
this paper through for reasons

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.930
related to people's antipathy
towards biological-based

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:39.830
thinking.

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:42.600
So let me explain to you
what we did in this paper.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.280
We had data from 30
actual Israeli weddings--

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.440
Excel sheets--
where every person

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.580
who attended the wedding, we
had how much money they gave.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.380
So in other words, in
the Israeli context,

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:58.220
you don't give toasters and
whatever other appliances.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.360
You just give money.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:05.210
So Uncle Mordecai,
$180, Aunt Hannah, $200.

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:09.522
And so we had all this data,
and so we tested two things.

00:48:09.522 --> 00:48:11.480
One of them is pretty
obvious for you to guess,

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.620
the other one is not so obvious.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.340
The first thing we
looked at is the size

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.530
of the wedding
gift as a function

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:23.150
of the genetic relatedness
between the giver and the bride

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.700
and groom.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.220
And what do you think happens?

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.170
To the greater the
genetic relatedness,

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.300
the larger the gift.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.360
In other words, people
modulate their investment

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:37.996
in others as a function
of the genetic lineage.

00:48:37.996 --> 00:48:39.870
Now you might say, well
I could have probably

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:43.140
predicted this without being a
fancy evolutionary scientist.

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.940
The second hypothesis
you couldn't.

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.080
Here it goes.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.650
If you take, for example, your
four grandparents, on average,

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:51.670
they share--

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.100
each of them-- a quarter
of their genes with you.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.080
In other words, the
genetic relatedness is 25%.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.140
If you stop the
story there, they're

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.920
all equally invested in you.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.350
But there is a second
element to the story.

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:05.470
It's not just
genetic relatedness,

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.020
it's genetic assuredness.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.930
How assured are you
of a genetic lineage?

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:15.880
Well, your maternal grandmother
is assured of her lineage.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:19.970
There is no such thing
as maternity uncertainty.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:24.160
Your paternal grandfather
has two generations

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.900
of paternity uncertainty.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.030
Therefore, we expect
the maternal grandmother

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.580
to invest the most, the
paternal grandfather

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.950
to invest the least, and
the two other grandparents

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:33.950
in the middle.

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:35.650
So we took this--

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:39.310
the fancy term is differential
solicitude-- we took this idea

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:42.270
and applied it in
the following way.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.480
Does the matrilineal side
of the bride and groom

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.900
give larger gifts than
the patrilineal side?

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.920
And the answer is yes.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.690
This is the one for matrilineal.

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:53.700
This is the one for patrilineal.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.820
So holding genetic
relatedness constant,

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.590
when you come from
the mother's side,

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:02.010
you give greater gifts than when
you do from the fathers side.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.500
No one would have
generated this hypothesis

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.600
if you weren't coming
from an evolutionary lens.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.360
You couldn't have even
posited that hypothesis.

00:50:12.914 --> 00:50:14.580
I don't want to spend
much time on this.

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.240
But remember earlier I talked
about that conciliar tree

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.120
of knowledge?

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.249
This is exactly an example
of a consilient tree

00:50:20.249 --> 00:50:21.790
when it comes to
evolutionary theory.

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:25.100
You start with some general
evolutionary principles

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.310
that are now unassailable.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:28.700
They've been tested
for over 150 years.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.150
These lead to what are
called middle level theories.

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:33.860
Kin selection is
the mechanism that

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.580
explains why people or
animals invest in their kin

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.250
more so than in
random strangers.

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:43.640
Based on kin selection, I
could generate hypotheses

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.980
about genetic relatedness
and genetic assuredness,

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.080
and then based on
that, I just told you

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.000
the study that I mentioned.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.760
Therefore, what
evolutionary theory does

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.120
is it provides you with these
elegant, organized trees

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.790
of knowledge, very much like
you would expect in physics

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.510
and chemistry and biology.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.600
And so one of the arguments
that I make and some

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.820
of my evolutionary
minded colleagues make

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.610
is that the social
sciences will eventually

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:11.210
have to go through the same
revolution that biology did.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:15.680
To date, no working biologist
says that evolutionary theory

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.150
is maybe right, maybe wrong.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:21.110
There is no chemistry
professor who

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:23.780
is for the periodic
table and some

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.390
who are anti-periodic table.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:28.610
The same thing has to happen
in the social sciences.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:31.670
For us to have the same
impact and same influence,

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.640
we have to agree that there
is a set of core knowledge

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.440
that after awhile
becomes unassailable.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.620
And the way you do that is by
building these coherent trees

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.120
of knowledge.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.672
All right we're almost done.

00:51:43.672 --> 00:51:45.880
Let me just read you a few
quotes that are very, very

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.710
powerful to really
drive the point

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.489
home of the
importance of biology

00:51:49.489 --> 00:51:50.530
to everything that we do.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:53.330
This is an exchange that
took place on Charlie Rose.

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:56.110
If any of you watch it,it's
usually late at night on PBS.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:59.229
He brings all sorts of guests
and they get into a really fun

00:51:59.229 --> 00:51:59.770
conversation.

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:03.220
This is EO Wilson, who's
a very famous Harvard

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.910
entomologist still alive.

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:07.400
One of the biggest scientists
of the 20th century.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.020
This is James Watson,
the co-discoverer

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:15.910
of the double helix structure
of DNA, Nobel Prize winner.

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:17.750
And they're talking
to each other.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:18.600
So let me just read it for you.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.590
"Psychologist, most of the
practicing psychologists

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:22.715
and theoretical psychologists
and the vast majority

00:52:22.715 --> 00:52:24.520
of social sciences,
who really determine

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.380
a lot of the intellect that
goes into our policies,

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.480
you know, and our
philosophies, our philosophies,

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.450
have no collection at all to
their true nature of humanity

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:34.840
or what human nature is
at a biological level.

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.234
This is still a huge gap.

00:52:36.234 --> 00:52:37.900
And I believe that
we will start to fill

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.780
that in a way that
will be useful in years

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.310
immediately ahead.

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:44.860
I see the coming-- the past
century was the coming together

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.160
of chemistry and biology.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.760
This century will be the
coming together of psychology

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.370
and biology. " This is
exactly what I do in my work.

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:54.680
I marry psychology and biology.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.670
Now interestingly-- this might
interest some of the folks here

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:59.860
who are more
practitioner-oriented--

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:04.780
practitioners of business
are typically a lot less--

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.650
they exhibit a lot less animus
to these ideas than academics.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:12.340
Because academics are typically
vested within their paradigms

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.640
and therefore, if you come
along on your biology horse

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.382
and if they feel
threatened, then they

00:53:17.382 --> 00:53:18.340
will put up resistance.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.280
Well, the practitioner
doesn't care.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.600
The practitioner simply
cares about what works.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.660
So if you're an advertising
executive and my theories can

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:29.360
help you develop better
advertising appeals, go for it.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:32.650
And so here's an example
from way back in 1964.

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:35.290
This could have been written by
an evolutionary psychologist.

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:36.460
Let me just read it for you.

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:38.770
"Because advertising,
effective advertising,

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:42.500
is an appeal to human
fundamental needs, desires,

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:45.220
and motivations, it is an
appeal to basic human nature.

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.410
People the world over
have the same basic need

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:49.780
for food, clothing, and
shelter, the same ambitions,

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.090
the same egotism, and
the same temptations.

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:54.220
The setting changes, the
climate, the culture,

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.730
the idiom, but the basic
human nature is the same. "

00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:59.480
This is basically
evolutionary psychology.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.570
It's looking at these
human universals.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:04.312
And then this one is
the founder of one

00:54:04.312 --> 00:54:06.520
of the biggest advertising
firms of the 20th century.

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.895
He's basically
saying if you want

00:54:07.895 --> 00:54:09.280
to understand how
to communicate,

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.780
you have to understand
human nature.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:14.885
Again, this is very much
of a evolutionary argument.

00:54:14.885 --> 00:54:15.795
Almost done.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:21.380
Before I put up--

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.792
let me just--

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:24.750
Sometimes I get people
who would say, well, OK,

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:27.770
but give me some very clear,
practical applications

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:30.320
of the fancy
scientific work you do.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.600
Well here's one, which
will be the next slide.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.380
If good marketers, whether
they know it or not,

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.450
understand human nature well.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:42.020
If you develop products
that are contrary

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:45.240
to some basic principle
from human nature,

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.270
the product will fail.

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:51.800
So for example, McDonald
works well not so much

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:55.430
because it gets celebrity
endorsers to support it,

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:57.590
but it's because it
offers you a product

00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:01.160
that my evolved gustatory
preferences expect.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.170
Give me fatty, tasty foods.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:06.230
Well it's not difficult to teach
most children around the world

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:08.780
to like that product
because, again, as I said,

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.990
our taste buds have
evolved to like

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:14.150
that because of the
environment of caloric scarcity

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:16.500
and caloric uncertainty
that we've evolved in.

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.490
So here's an example
that speaks to this idea.

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:23.480
Romance novels are
almost exclusively

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.390
read around the
world only by women.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:27.775
There is no culture.

00:55:27.775 --> 00:55:29.900
And if you can find that
culture, send me an email,

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.280
I'll make you famous.

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.300
You won't find it
because it doesn't exist.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:37.040
There is no culture where men
are the predominant consumers

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.580
of romance novels.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.490
Now you might say, OK, so what?

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:45.020
Well, if you want to
understand female sexuality,

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:50.360
study the archetype of the
male hero in romance novels.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.560
It is the exact same guy.

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:55.642
It's a cut and paste job
irrespective of which country--

00:55:55.642 --> 00:55:56.850
and very different countries.

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.310
It can be Pakistan.

00:55:58.310 --> 00:55:59.960
It could be Lebanon.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.890
It could be Bolivia.

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:02.570
It could be Japan.

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.640
The male hero is
the exact same guy.

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.900
He's tall.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.450
He's a prince and
a neurosurgeon.

00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:14.390
He wrangles alligators
on his six pack.

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:17.630
He's reckless in
his risk-taking,

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:20.210
but he could only be tamed
by the love of this one

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.105
good woman.

00:56:21.105 --> 00:56:25.730
Boom, I just read for you
every single romance novel.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:31.350
Not surprisingly, every
single cover the guy

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:32.940
looks exactly the same.

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:36.040
He never looks like this guy.

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:36.870
Who?

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:41.100
Is this is this
some VP of Google?

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.640
I shall never be
invited again here.

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.020
So this is not because
there is a conspiracy

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:53.970
to promulgate unrealistic
images of masculinity.

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:57.720
It's because marketers
understand what, in this case,

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.750
appeals to women's
evolved fantasies,

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.210
and they provide a product
that is consistent with that.

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:04.170
There was a company--

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:05.711
I don't remember
what it was called--

00:57:05.711 --> 00:57:07.470
that tried to move
away from that.

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:11.580
They wanted to create a
new line of romance novels

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.400
that broke the shackles of this.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.820
Guess what happened
to that company?

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:18.250
It died.

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:23.520
It died because it had an
erroneous view of human nature.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:26.580
It thought that human nature
is infinitely malleable

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:30.395
when human nature is
constrained by biology.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:33.770
So I'm almost done.

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:35.390
I think maybe two more slides.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:39.330
This quote right
here, I've always

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.280
joked that if I ever
wrote an autobiography

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.980
of my scientific life, it
would consist of one page.

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.480
Basically, this quote.

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:46.140
Why?

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:49.050
Because this quote
perfectly captures

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:50.880
what I have faced in
my scientific career.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.850
This is JBS Haldane,
who is a very famous

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:57.060
evolutionary geneticist and also
a guy kind of like Mark Twain.

00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:01.470
He had this beautiful ability
with words, great quips.

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:04.620
He said, when scientists
go through a new radical

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:09.344
scientific idea, they go through
four stages of acceptance.

00:58:09.344 --> 00:58:11.760
When they first hear about it,
this is worthless nonsense.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.930
This is garbage.

00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:15.652
In my case, you're applying
biology to consumer behavior?

00:58:15.652 --> 00:58:16.860
What kind of heretic are you?

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.500
You're a moron.

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:22.020
Stage 2, as the evidence
starts coming in,

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:26.850
well, this is interesting, but
it's a perverse point of view.

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:30.300
Stage 3, this is
true, but who cares.

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.440
Quite unimportant.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.600
Stage for, when the
paradigmatic wall breaks,

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:35.610
oh, I've always said so.

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:38.520
I've always loved
your work, Dr. Saad.

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.380
I still have emails--

00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:43.630
and I say this with
all due modesty--

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:47.400
I still have emails from
guys who had written to me

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.250
when they were at stage
one, but they don't

00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:51.890
know that I've kept that email.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:53.970
Now they're writing
to me at stage 4,

00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:55.560
will you do us the honor?

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.300
But I thought I was
a bullshitter who

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.370
applied biology.

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:01.350
Because that's
how science works.

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:03.090
It's an auto-corrective process.

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:06.780
Hopefully, the good
ideas eventually win out.

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.370
And were almost done.

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:10.890
Last slide.

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:14.460
Dobzhansky famously
stated, "nothing in biology

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.872
makes sense except in
the light of evolution."

00:59:16.872 --> 00:59:19.080
And if you walk away with
nothing other than this one

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.300
quote, I slightly
tweak this to say,

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.280
nothing in consumer
behavior or in business

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.740
makes sense except in
the light of evolution.

00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:26.940
Here are some of my books.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.523
Thank you very much
for your patience.

00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:30.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:33.604 --> 00:59:35.770
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Thank you
very much for your time.

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:38.620
We're going to go through
some questions real quick.

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:40.930
If anyone has any
questions for the doctor,

00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:42.970
please head over to
the mic right there.

00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:45.100
If not, I'm going to jump
on the dory and we're

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.180
going to go from there.

00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:53.850
GAD SAAD: That's either really
good news or really bad news.

00:59:56.886 --> 00:59:58.510
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Oh
I got one for you.

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:03.540
Can you talk about what
male lions and step-parents

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.600
have in common when
it comes to children?

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600
GAD SAAD: Oh, very good.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.230
Yes.

01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:09.944
I guess you saw my latest
Joe Rogan appearance.

01:00:09.944 --> 01:00:10.985
Is that where you saw it?

01:00:10.985 --> 01:00:11.810
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
No, from the book.

01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:13.020
GAD SAAD: From the book, OK.

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:17.400
So what Jordan's talking
about is the following idea.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.490
When you have a pride
of lions, usually there

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:23.220
is one, two, three
dominant males

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.970
that really rule the pride.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:30.250
And there will be these
bands of young males

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.250
who are now looking to
have their own tribe who

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:36.790
will consistently test
these dominant males.

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:39.430
Usually, they will lose until
one day nature catches up

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:42.580
to the older guys and
they're either killed

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.560
or they're ostracized out.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.740
The new males come in,
take over the pride.

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:51.070
What's the first thing they do?

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:52.630
They kill all the cubs.

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:56.200
They kill all the cubs
because for a species

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.750
that is going to engage
in substantial parental

01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:59.950
investment--

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:02.050
none more so, by the
way, than human males--

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:05.290
across animals and from
a male perspective,

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:08.740
it makes no sense for me to
invest in the genetic package

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.150
of other males.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:11.500
Therefore, I kill them.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:16.090
And that will lead females
coming into estrus.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:18.490
Now I've joked that
that's how you get

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.550
a female lion into the mood.

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:22.480
You kill her cubs
in the way that we--

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.200
in the human case we
play Barry White music.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.430
Some idiot on my comments
wrote, that's not how it works.

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:34.300
He actually literally took
my words as literally true

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.392
that that's how you--

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:36.850
of course that's
not the mechanism.

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:38.230
The mechanism is different.

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:40.030
But it is really what happens.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.000
You kill her cubs,
she comes into estrus.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.467
Now how do you link that
to the human context?

01:01:45.467 --> 01:01:47.050
Member the first
book that I mentioned

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:49.180
at the start of the
talk, "Homicide?"

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.160
The book that sort of
led me on my epiphany

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.470
to apply evolution psychology
to consumer behavior.

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:58.570
In that book, they talk about
how the number one predictor

01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:03.820
of having child abuse in a
home by a factor of 100 times

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.790
greater than anything
else is if there

01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:08.950
is a step-parent in the house.

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.830
And this has now become
known colloquially in science

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:13.720
as the Cinderella effect.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.330
Because the story
of Cinderella is

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:18.550
there is the evil
step-mother who

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:22.390
loves her biological children,
but is differentially

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.880
nasty to her step-daughter.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.487
And so again here, this is an
example where people get upset.

01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:29.320
Because then somebody
will raise their hand,

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.250
well this is bullshit!

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:33.000
I was raised by a
step-father and he's lovely.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.070
But nobody cares about
your personal example.

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:37.150
It's the aggregate.

01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:38.230
OK.

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:41.470
Smoking causes cancer,
but your Uncle Joe smoked

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:42.760
and he lived to be 100.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.110
It doesn't matter.

01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:47.080
But again, people have this
visceral response against it.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.790
But that's an example of how
you apply a behavior in lion

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:53.464
context to the human context.

01:02:53.464 --> 01:02:55.380
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Let's
have a seat over here.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:58.300
We have a live question.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:01.000
AUDIENCE: With the
example of the Porsche.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.260
It's an expensive item
and it sounds really cool.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:08.170
That's kind of like I
guess more of a complex.

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:12.580
There's like a cultural, or
some sort of higher level

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:16.450
recognition there so it
evokes like a primitive kind

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:17.410
of response.

01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:20.050
Is there any research
into that or anything

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:22.122
you've heard about that?

01:03:22.122 --> 01:03:23.830
GAD SAAD: Not sure I
follow the question.

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:25.119
Can you rephrase it?

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:26.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like a Porsche.

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:32.200
We know a Porsche is an
expensive, kind of sexy object,

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.490
and having one increases status.

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:39.940
But, the recognition that
a Porsche is expensive

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.950
and it sounds really
cool and stuff

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:47.240
like that, that requires a
higher level of processing.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.650
So how does our biological--

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:51.550
GAD SAAD: Right.

01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:56.650
So the underlying mechanism is,
of course, not Porsche-related.

01:03:56.650 --> 01:04:00.130
In other words, it's in the
current cultural context

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:03.660
that status has become
associated with the Porsche

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.470
that that's what we get.

01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:09.100
In other cultures, it might
be the number of cattle heads

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.070
that I own.

01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:14.620
In another culture, it might be
whether I'm a famous painter.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:17.560
Picasso was a profoundly
unattractive male

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.510
by any measure.

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:20.390
He was short.

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.980
He was bald.

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:21.850
He was overweight.

01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:24.460
He was not particularly
attractive in any way, yet

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.950
he had an extremely
long line up of women

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.840
who were more than
happy to mate with him--

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.420
very beautiful women--
because he was Picasso.

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.490
So the underlying
phenomenon is not

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:37.680
as though we have genes
for Porsches any more

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.030
than we have genes
for pornography.

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:44.180
It's that these
modern day products

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:48.280
tickle evolutionary
principles that exist in us.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.327
That make sense?

01:04:49.327 --> 01:04:51.160
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Do
the next live question.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:51.785
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:51.785 --> 01:04:55.650
So as an individual
and consumer,

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:58.590
how does one use this
knowledge to protect oneself

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:02.790
from step-mothers, advertisers
and mother in-laws and things

01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:03.610
like that?

01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:05.485
GAD SAAD: Well, I mean
it's a broad question.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.050
I think to use a cliche--

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:08.620
knowledge is power.

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:13.290
So to the extent that each of
us has a key-- in this case,

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:15.060
evolutionary
psychology-- to help us

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.270
understand human behavior,
then it's a very powerful thing

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:19.230
to have.

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:23.610
I will get students who took
my course 10 years earlier who

01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:27.030
will write to me and
say, hi professor Saad,

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:28.740
I remember the lecture
where you talked

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:33.360
about the evolutionary
roots of romantic jealousy,

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.069
and I'm currently having such
and such fight with my wife

01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:37.110
because of such and such.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:39.060
And it perfectly
matches what you are--

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.570
So in other words, it's
not as though there

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.350
is a prescription
for every syllable

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:45.810
that I utter to a specific
practical application,

01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:47.990
but rather, having
that knowledge,

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:49.740
allows us to better
understand everything.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.770
It allows us to understand
group dynamics of Google

01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:55.650
and why I'm going to fight
for the corner office

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:58.330
because it serves
as a status symbol.

01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:00.780
So in other words, I'm
giving you a universal key

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.230
for understanding human nature.

01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.970
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:04.975
GAD SAAD: Cheers.

01:06:04.975 --> 01:06:06.350
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:07.870
so much for giving this talk.

01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:08.870
It was very interesting.

01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:09.470
GAD SAAD: Thank you.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:11.150
AUDIENCE: I want to ask you
about one of the studies

01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:13.010
that you talked about--
the wedding gifts.

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:14.010
GAD SAAD: Yes.

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:16.010
AUDIENCE: My question is,
how do you come from--

01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:17.843
the data that you've
collected-- how did you

01:06:17.843 --> 01:06:19.140
come to a certain conclusion?

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.460
For example, in Lebanon,
I grew up there.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.940
You know if my granddaughter
were to get married,

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.960
my granddaughter is more
valuable to the family.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.050
So typically, families
give more gifts

01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:33.532
to the female that's getting
married than the guy.

01:06:33.532 --> 01:06:34.490
That might be a reason.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:35.660
There might be other reasons.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.035
How do you come
to the conclusion

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:41.332
that it's an evolutionary
thing not something else?

01:06:41.332 --> 01:06:43.040
GAD SAAD: So several
ways to answer that.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.400
One is that, as is the
case in all science,

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.460
you have to rule out
alternate explanations.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.770
If you can't rule out an
alternate explanations.

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:53.630
Then your data is
not as convincing

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:55.334
as it otherwise could be.

01:06:55.334 --> 01:06:56.750
But I also showed
you how we build

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:58.370
these nomological networks.

01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:02.270
These nomological networks,
not one of the boxes

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:05.250
is enough to convince you,
but once I show you the eight

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:07.280
boxes, it becomes
difficult for you

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.930
to argue against my position.

01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:11.340
So that's how you do
it in evolution theory.

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.730
You accumulate
evidence stemming from

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.760
many, many different
regions, many different lines

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.440
of evidence, that it
makes it impossible

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.990
for you to generate an
alternative explanation

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:22.822
to explain the phenomenon.

01:07:22.822 --> 01:07:23.734
Thank you.

01:07:25.995 --> 01:07:27.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming today.

01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:28.230
GAD SAAD: Thank you.

01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:30.646
AUDIENCE: It's been amazing
to hear your presentation live

01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:32.450
and not just on podcast.

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:34.330
Second, my question
is, through the lens

01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:37.990
of evolutionary biology,
what is your perspective

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:40.870
on people that choose to use a
plural pronoun such as "they"

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:43.930
or "them" since,
evolutionary speaking,

01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:45.430
they're born female or male?

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:46.180
GAD SAAD: Right.

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.270
So I recently gave a--

01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:50.770
for those of you who are not
familiar with the question that

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:51.790
was just posed--

01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:54.160
this is really sort of
a big issue in Canada

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.730
right now because there
is a bill that was just

01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:00.850
tabled and passed
called Bill C-16

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.400
which incorporates gender
identity and gender

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.800
expression as part of
the rubric of hate crime.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.600
So in other words, if you do
or say or not say or not do

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.520
something, that
could be construed

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.340
as hateful towards
say the transgendered,

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:18.670
then you could be
liable for a hate crime.

01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:21.430
And to the context of your
specific question of gender

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:25.149
pronouns, a good friend
of mine and a colleague

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:29.740
by name of Jordan Peterson
got into a lot of hot waters

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:30.949
because he said--

01:08:30.949 --> 01:08:33.340
and he's a very
accomplished scientist.

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:35.649
He's a tenured professor at
the University of Toronto

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:39.040
in psychology-- he said
you cannot force me,

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.279
the government can't force
me, cannot compel me,

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:47.524
to use specific pronouns
like zir and ze and so on.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:49.399
So I appeared in front
of the Canadian Senate

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:52.479
and I testified
regarding that issue.

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:58.250
My position is there's a
huge panoply of personhoods.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:00.840
Transgendered people exist,
the non-gendered exist,

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.420
the non-binary exists.

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.270
We should honor everyone.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.700
We should treat everybody
equal under the law.

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:09.410
That doesn't mean,
though, that I

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:12.710
have to celebrate your
personhood by you compelling

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:16.160
me to come up with pronouns
that are nonsensical.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.399
So my personal
position is that we're

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:21.859
threading on dangerous
waters with this bill.

01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:24.180
My point during the
Senate hearing by the way,

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:27.050
was every single
word that I uttered

01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:30.050
in today's lecture
could be construed

01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:32.318
as a transgression of Bill C-16.

01:09:32.318 --> 01:09:34.609
Because when I'm talking,
for example, about innate sex

01:09:34.609 --> 01:09:37.609
differences, someone could
raise their hand and say,

01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:41.180
never in your course did you
mention the transgendered

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.850
or the non-gendered
or the non-binary,

01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:45.439
and that marginalizes me.

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:47.660
So literally,
evolutionary biology

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.029
and evolutionary
psychology could become

01:09:50.029 --> 01:09:51.859
transgressive of this bill.

01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:55.190
So while I respect
everyone's personhood,

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:59.490
that doesn't mean that it
should be anti-science.

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:00.777
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:10:00.777 --> 01:10:02.860
JORDAN THIBODEAU: You can
have a seat if you want.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.860
GAD SAAD: It's hard for
me to sit on this thing.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:06.090
I feel as though like it's--

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:08.990
I've got this,
you've got nothing.

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:11.370
Now it's forever on Google.

01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:14.130
JORDAN THIBODEAU: It's because
I'm sucking it in actually.

01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:17.460
Your book is critical
religion and what

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.670
are the positive psychological
aspects of religion?

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:22.290
GAD SAAD: Yes, great question.

01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:25.830
So in in chapter 8 of my book--
for those of you who took

01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:30.510
a copy, the chapter is titled
"marketing hope by selling

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:31.350
lies"--

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:34.560
so that might give
you a general summary

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.770
of what I think of religion.

01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:39.600
It's very hard to
eradicate religion

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.200
because, ultimately,
we are the only being

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.530
that we are aware of that
is aware of its mortality.

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:50.430
And to the extent that we suffer
from this existential angst,

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.910
our only solution to
that is to subscribe

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:56.100
to some religious narrative.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.740
Because all religious
narratives ultimately

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:02.520
offer you a solution,
quote, "to this problem."

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.680
But here I'm torn,
because on the one hand,

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.860
I appreciate the fact that
religion has some functional

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:08.940
benefits.

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:13.840
But on the other hand, if you
truly wish to pursue truth,

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.690
then maybe believing
in wrong ideas,

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:18.880
even though they
feel good, might not

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.780
be a good thing to do.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:27.510
So I guess my thinking is few
people have the testicular

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:30.840
fortitude to be
nonbelievers because it's

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.165
a lot easier to be a believer.

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:36.290
JORDAN THIBODEAU: What's
the most exciting frontier

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:38.620
of evolutionary
psychology for you?

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.530
GAD SAAD: Oh great question.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.900
I think it is to
apply the principles

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.720
of evolutionary psychology
in practical fields.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.610
So for example, in
my case, I apply it

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:50.250
in consumer behavior
in business.

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:54.480
Now there is the application
of evolutionary theory

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.130
in medicine.

01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:57.588
Now you might think, oh, but
hasn't that been done already?

01:11:57.588 --> 01:11:58.110
No.

01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:02.520
Most physicians will never
hear the word evolution ever

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.550
uttered because they work
at the proximate level.

01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:08.192
My good colleague who was, by
the way, a guest on my show,

01:12:08.192 --> 01:12:10.650
Randy Nesse, one of the pioneers
of evolution and medicine.

01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:13.560
And is now trying
to make it part

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.810
of the curriculum
of medical school

01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:17.664
that physicians,
future physicians,

01:12:17.664 --> 01:12:19.080
be trained in
evolutionary theory,

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.579
because there are
insights that come

01:12:20.579 --> 01:12:23.490
from evolutionary principles
that you would typically not

01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:26.230
have access to if you
didn't have that lens.

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:28.950
There's a field now
called evolutionary law

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:32.490
where you apply principles
from evolutionary theory

01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:34.710
to understand whether
legal codes are

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:36.510
consistent with
human nature or not.

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:39.480
So I think the next
frontier is to move

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.270
beyond the study of
mating behavior and so on.

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:46.050
It's to take the key of
evolutionary psychology

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:49.347
and use it to unlock
different practical fields.

01:12:49.347 --> 01:12:51.680
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Going back
to you comment on the car--

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.430
I have to reflect on my
own personal anecdote--

01:12:55.430 --> 01:13:04.100
my first car when I was 18 years
old was a 1987 Volkswagen Fox.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.420
It had about
200,000 miles on it.

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.590
Went around the sun multiple
times I guess or something.

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:11.750
The engine was so loud
that I could literally

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:15.230
have like George Clooney
and Angelina Jolie in my car

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.350
with a pile of cash, and
I couldn't get anyone

01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:20.180
to come inside because the
car looked so terrible.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.750
But when I would drive to De
Anza for community college,

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:25.910
I got stopped multiple
times for the car

01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:28.310
I was driving because it
looked like a good stop.

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:31.550
But then once I upgrade my
car to like a Ford Focus

01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:34.120
and put my Santa Clara
University alumni

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.140
plaque on that, I
haven't been stopped

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.180
for like 10 years almost.

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.160
So it's really interesting
because in your book

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.243
you talked about if you're
driving a high end car,

01:13:42.243 --> 01:13:44.540
people are less likely
to honk when you're

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.180
late at a red light compared to
if you're driving a cheap car,

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.846
people will honk right
away because it's

01:13:48.846 --> 01:13:51.210
like, who is this person?

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:53.840
But I wanted to ask
you, you had a point

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:57.176
about how birth order affects
our psychology in families.

01:13:57.176 --> 01:13:58.550
Can you talk a
little about that?

01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:00.877
GAD SAAD: Sure.

01:14:00.877 --> 01:14:03.210
There's this gentleman by the
name of Frank Sulloway who

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.450
is a historian of science
and a Darwinists who

01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:10.130
came up with an incredible idea
to explain birth order effect.

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:12.380
Typically, when you
talk about birth order--

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.797
sorry, should I be looking at
you or is it OK to look at--

01:14:14.797 --> 01:14:15.921
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Everyone.

01:14:15.921 --> 01:14:16.607
Yeah.

01:14:16.607 --> 01:14:17.815
I know I'm just too handsome.

01:14:17.815 --> 01:14:18.460
It's hard.

01:14:21.170 --> 01:14:23.570
GAD SAAD: Typically, when you
study birth order effects,

01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:24.986
it is studied from
the perspective

01:14:24.986 --> 01:14:30.800
of how parents treat children
of different orders differently.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.080
So they might treat the
firstborn differently

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.690
than the last born,
and that's the genesis

01:14:35.690 --> 01:14:38.390
of birth order phenomenon.

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:41.360
Frank Sulloway flipped that
whole script upside down.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.060
He argued that
no, actually, what

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:47.410
drives birth order effects
are the children themselves.

01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:49.160
And let me just explain
that very quickly.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.320
It's actually an interesting
marketing problem.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.170
The fancy term is
called Darwinian niche

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:55.430
partitioning hypothesis.

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:57.150
So it basically
works as follows.

01:14:57.150 --> 01:14:59.720
When a child is
born, one of the ways

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:04.100
that it has to secure
maximal parental investment

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.200
is to convince the
parents that it

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.470
is uniquely different from
all the other children.

01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:11.300
So there are many
different niches

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.850
I could occupy as a child.

01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:15.110
I could be the good boy.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:16.690
I could be the rebellious boy.

01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:20.900
So if I'm the first born, all
of the niches are unoccupied.

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:21.540
Correct?

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.090
Therefore, I could
pick any of them.

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:26.030
If I'm the second born,
I have n minus niches.

01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:30.360
As I go down the sip ship,
there are fewer and fewer niches

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.290
from which I could fill.

01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:38.180
And he argued that
that adaptive problem

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:42.050
causes later-borns
to score higher

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:45.830
on openness to experiences,
to be greater thinkers

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:49.040
outside the box because
of this original problem

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.720
that they have to
solve, which is

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.810
how could I be maximally
different from all

01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:55.190
my other siblings?

01:15:55.190 --> 01:15:56.720
And whenever I
lecture about this,

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.820
I always end with
the following-- can

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:03.394
we guess what professor
Saad's birth order is?

01:16:03.394 --> 01:16:04.870
Boom.

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:09.160
I was destined for greatness
cause I'm last born.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.100
I'm the last four.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.030
So that's the explanation
for the birth order effect.

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:18.050
JORDAN THIBODEAU: That caught my
eye because my brother is like

01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:20.840
6'3", amazing
athlete and whatnot.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.450
He was getting
recruited for college

01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:24.640
when he was playing for
Bellarmine for football,

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.960
and I was always known as
Gabriel's little brother.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.970
And I was like crap, well,
I'm 5'7" nothing and I weigh

01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:33.520
nothing, so I guess I'll be
the one who either makes people

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.714
laugh or is either
like studying--

01:16:35.714 --> 01:16:36.880
GAD SAAD: The guy at Google.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.963
JORDAN THIBODEAU: The guy
at Google, you're right.

01:16:38.963 --> 01:16:40.930
So it's funny how
that plays out.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:44.920
Can you talk about the mobility
in friendship issue the US?

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.040
How we're constantly
relocating and whatnot.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.390
And how can we overcome that?

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:51.310
GAD SAAD: So that
part I was talking

01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:56.470
about cross-cultural
differences in friendships.

01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:58.510
And one of the arguments
that I've often heard--

01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:01.480
when I was in graduate school,
most of the graduate students

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.390
who were not American, would
always say the same thing--

01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:07.570
you could make friends very
easily with an American,

01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:11.240
but the friendships somehow
seemed to be shallower.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.570
There are sort of
more ephemeral.

01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:15.310
And so I was thinking,
well, why is that?

01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:16.810
I mean it can't be
because Americans

01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:18.370
are more shallow folks.

01:17:18.370 --> 01:17:19.780
That certainly can't be it.

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.380
And so the argument
that has been proposed

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:29.470
is that the greater geographic
and socioeconomic mobility

01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:31.360
in the United States--

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.480
today I'm in Atlanta,
tomorrow I'm in Mountain View.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:39.380
Today I am a lower
economic status,

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:42.010
now I'm a dot.com billionaire.

01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:46.060
That mobility causes people
to have a different outlook

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.300
on friendships, whereas when
you come from the old country,

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:54.790
meaning Lebanon, Italy,
Greece, India, typically

01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:57.220
the place where you're born,
that little village where

01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:00.970
you were born, is where
you're going to typically die.

01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:04.240
And therefore, that's closer
to the evolutionary environment

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.190
in which we've evolved.

01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:09.130
The networks are much tighter.

01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:10.660
They mimic much
more the environment

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.700
in which we evolved,
whereas the environments

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.500
that we see in our
modern environment today

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.660
are not the ones that
we have evolved in.

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:19.870
That's why in California,
for every single

01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:24.040
of the most banal exchanges,
you have a 600 page

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.870
legal disclaimer form.

01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:27.700
I remember where
we moved from what

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.020
we moved from Montreal to--

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.030
I was a professor at UC Irvine--

01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:36.280
the first place that
we rented, a townhouse,

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.490
the rental agreement
was probably three times

01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:44.180
the size of the Camp David
Accords between Egypt, Lebanon,

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.550
and the United States.

01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:49.150
In 1953, we passed a
certain fumigation,

01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:52.690
you can't sue us if in 17
generations one of your kids

01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:53.920
develops cancer.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.045
You're reading through
this, you're saying, I mean,

01:18:56.045 --> 01:18:58.600
am I renting an apartment or
is this like a nuclear reactor?

01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.920
What's going on?

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:03.170
Well, the reason
for that is because

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:06.380
of the anonymity of the current
environment that we live in.

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:10.940
The social interactions have to
be mandated by these contracts.

01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:15.590
If you're back in Lebanon, well,
I just have to shake your hand

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:16.680
and that's enough.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.490
Now that's not because the
Lebanese are more honorable.

01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:21.572
That's because, if
I cheat you once,

01:19:21.572 --> 01:19:23.030
that's the last
time I'm ever going

01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:26.000
to cheat you because I'm going
to be in that environment.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.500
So you don't need the
7,000-page contract to mandate

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.210
relationships.

01:19:31.210 --> 01:19:33.770
So I argue that
that's what drives

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:37.940
the cross-cultural differences
and the depth of friendships.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.140
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
For last question,

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:42.985
there seems to be a push
against dissension in academia.

01:19:42.985 --> 01:19:44.250
Can you talk about that?

01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:46.404
Is this a recent development?

01:19:46.404 --> 01:19:47.820
GAD SAAD: What was
the first part?

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:50.361
JORDAN THIBODEAU: There seems
to be a push against dissension

01:19:50.361 --> 01:19:51.480
in academia.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.090
Is this a recent development,
or is this something

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:57.120
that's been going on since the
beginning of the university

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.611
system?

01:19:58.611 --> 01:20:00.360
GAD SAAD: Well it's
certainly gotten worse

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:03.100
over the past 30, 40 years.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:05.560
And so for those of
you who follow my work,

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.910
I really have two hats.

01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:09.640
I both have the
hat of an academic

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.850
who publishes in
journals and so on.

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.760
But I also weigh in on
many of these issues--

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.340
the political correctness,
the trigger warnings,

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:19.980
the microaggressions and so on--

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.700
that are taking place
at the university

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.910
that it is making
it very difficult

01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:27.090
to have interesting debates
about controversial topics

01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:30.510
because everybody is afraid
that they might offend somebody.

01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:32.910
And actually, the
topic of my next book--

01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:35.380
which I'm currently working
on-- is the tentative title

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.650
is "Death of the
West by 1,000 Cuts."

01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:41.522
I go into what has led
us down this quagmire.

01:20:41.522 --> 01:20:43.230
So no, I don't think
it's a recent thing.

01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:45.600
I think it's taken
about 40 years

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.700
of horrifying faux
intellectualism

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:50.410
to lead us to the
place where we are at.

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:52.530
And some of these movements,
in case some of you

01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:56.550
want to know, postmodernism,
everything is relative,

01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:58.050
there are no objective truths.

01:20:58.050 --> 01:21:01.410
Cultural and moral
relativism, identity politics,

01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:04.410
intersectionality,
radical feminism-- each

01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:09.750
of these movements are perfect
anti-science, anti-reason

01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:10.830
positions.

01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:13.320
Put them all together,
you get a cocktail.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.230
You get a melange
of utter nonsense

01:21:16.230 --> 01:21:17.790
that has led us to where we are.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.520
So I'd like to think
that there's a few of us

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:25.140
now that are working
to fight against this.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:28.290
The news is still not good
because I will often receive

01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:31.870
emails from professors--

01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:37.160
tons of them-- who will write to
me we were so inspired by you,

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.200
thank you for your
courage, but shh, they'll

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.610
never say it publicly.

01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:43.530
As if supporting
freedom of speech,

01:21:43.530 --> 01:21:45.470
freedom of
intellectual diversity

01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:48.080
is a controversial topic.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.470
They support freedom
of speech, but they're

01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:53.360
afraid to state so openly.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.190
So we're in a
difficult position.

01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:58.160
But a few of us are
fighting very hard

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.365
to try to reverse the trend.

01:22:00.365 --> 01:22:01.740
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Well, thank you

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.365
very much for coming
here and speaking.

01:22:03.365 --> 01:22:04.290
GAD SAAD: Likewise.

01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:06.165
JORDAN THIBODEAU: You
flew across the country

01:22:06.165 --> 01:22:08.070
to make it here on
short notice, so if we

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:10.200
can give him round of applause.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.850
[APPLAUSE]
