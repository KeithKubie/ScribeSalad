the social scientists studied a group of

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:05.439
the social scientists studied a group of
 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.019
the social scientists studied a group of
farmers and give them IQ tests

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029
farmers and give them IQ tests
 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.330
farmers and give them IQ tests
throughout the year same farmers same

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340
throughout the year same farmers same
 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.520
throughout the year same farmers same
test but what they found is that these

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530
test but what they found is that these
 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.520
test but what they found is that these
farmers did much much worse on this test

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530
farmers did much much worse on this test
 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.499
farmers did much much worse on this test
at the end of their season before they'd

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:16.509
at the end of their season before they'd
 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.390
at the end of their season before they'd
actually harvested crops when everything

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400
actually harvested crops when everything
 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.950
actually harvested crops when everything
was starting to go that towards empty

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960
was starting to go that towards empty
 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.320
was starting to go that towards empty
they actually had lower IQ scores and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330
they actually had lower IQ scores and
 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.179
they actually had lower IQ scores and
then when they tested them at a point

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189
then when they tested them at a point
 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.040
then when they tested them at a point
when the harvest had come in and their

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050
when the harvest had come in and their
 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.259
when the harvest had come in and their
IQs went up and so then they were trying

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269
IQs went up and so then they were trying
 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.599
IQs went up and so then they were trying
to figure out how did the same person's

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609
to figure out how did the same person's
 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.030
to figure out how did the same person's
IQ actually change throughout the year

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040
IQ actually change throughout the year
 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.520
IQ actually change throughout the year
and then they ran a similar test on

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530
and then they ran a similar test on
 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.430
and then they ran a similar test on
Americans and what they did is they

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
Americans and what they did is they
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.650
Americans and what they did is they
asked people a bunch of IQ related

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660
asked people a bunch of IQ related
 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.660
asked people a bunch of IQ related
questions and got baseline scores and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670
questions and got baseline scores and
 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.150
questions and got baseline scores and
then they said hey you now have a bill

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160
then they said hey you now have a bill
 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.690
then they said hey you now have a bill
that you cannot pay just think about

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700
that you cannot pay just think about
 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.330
that you cannot pay just think about
that and then they gave them the same IQ

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340
that and then they gave them the same IQ
 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.090
that and then they gave them the same IQ
test again and lo and behold the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100
test again and lo and behold the
 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.950
test again and lo and behold the
Americans who are presented with a bill

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960
Americans who are presented with a bill
 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.299
Americans who are presented with a bill
that they could not pay even though it

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309
that they could not pay even though it
 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.880
that they could not pay even though it
was obviously a fictitious bill actually

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890
was obviously a fictitious bill actually
 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.119
was obviously a fictitious bill actually
had lower IQ scores and it turns out

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129
had lower IQ scores and it turns out
 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.590
had lower IQ scores and it turns out
that not being able to pay your bills

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600
that not being able to pay your bills
 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.190
that not being able to pay your bills
has the functional equivalent of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
has the functional equivalent of
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.410
has the functional equivalent of
decreasing your IQ by 13 points or one

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
decreasing your IQ by 13 points or one
 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.780
decreasing your IQ by 13 points or one
standard deviation and what they found

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790
standard deviation and what they found
 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.270
standard deviation and what they found
is there's a mindset of scarcity that's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280
is there's a mindset of scarcity that's
 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.030
is there's a mindset of scarcity that's
associated with when you don't have

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040
associated with when you don't have
 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.190
associated with when you don't have
enough money or you don't have enough

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200
enough money or you don't have enough
 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.130
enough money or you don't have enough
time or you don't have enough food or if

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140
time or you don't have enough food or if
 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.690
time or you don't have enough food or if
you don't have enough companionship and

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700
you don't have enough companionship and
 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.630
you don't have enough companionship and
it actually decreases your functional

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640
it actually decreases your functional
 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.120
it actually decreases your functional
bandwidth is different than stress it

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130
bandwidth is different than stress it
 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.850
bandwidth is different than stress it
actually makes you less reasonable less

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860
actually makes you less reasonable less
 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.910
actually makes you less reasonable less
rational less generous and more subject

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920
rational less generous and more subject
 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.850
rational less generous and more subject
to bad ideas and bad impulses including

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860
to bad ideas and bad impulses including
 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.719
to bad ideas and bad impulses including
even things like racism and xenophobia

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
even things like racism and xenophobia
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.160
even things like racism and xenophobia
now the opposite of a mindset of

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170
now the opposite of a mindset of
 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.380
now the opposite of a mindset of
scarcity is a mindset of abundance which

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390
scarcity is a mindset of abundance which
 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.149
scarcity is a mindset of abundance which
is what most entrepreneurs have a

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159
is what most entrepreneurs have a
 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.210
is what most entrepreneurs have a
mindset of abundance is a sense of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220
mindset of abundance is a sense of
 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.490
mindset of abundance is a sense of
optimism that if you build it it will

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500
optimism that if you build it it will
 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.469
optimism that if you build it it will
improve you will be able to get the

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479
improve you will be able to get the
 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.420
improve you will be able to get the
resources you will be able to get the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430
resources you will be able to get the
 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.370
resources you will be able to get the
customers you will to hire and find the

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380
customers you will to hire and find the
 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.609
customers you will to hire and find the
right people and abundance and optimism

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619
right people and abundance and optimism
 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.270
right people and abundance and optimism
ends up building unto itself and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
ends up building unto itself and
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.880
ends up building unto itself and
producing results if the environment is

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890
producing results if the environment is
 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.479
producing results if the environment is
right and so this scarcity mindset and

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489
right and so this scarcity mindset and
 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.220
right and so this scarcity mindset and
abundance mindset are very much in

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230
abundance mindset are very much in
 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.559
abundance mindset are very much in
opposition

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569
opposition
 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.199
opposition
and we're programmed with a scarcity

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209
and we're programmed with a scarcity
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.199
and we're programmed with a scarcity
mindset in many ways because genetically

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209
mindset in many ways because genetically
 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.379
mindset in many ways because genetically
we're brought into an existence where

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389
we're brought into an existence where
 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.899
we're brought into an existence where
things were scarce where if you ate too

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909
things were scarce where if you ate too
 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.729
things were scarce where if you ate too
much in a particular period maybe you

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739
much in a particular period maybe you
 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.099
much in a particular period maybe you
won't have enough to eat later and so

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109
won't have enough to eat later and so
 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.119
won't have enough to eat later and so
right now this tension is something that

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129
right now this tension is something that
 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.580
right now this tension is something that
humans and America and struggle with all

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590
humans and America and struggle with all
 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.589
humans and America and struggle with all
the time unfortunately right now the

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599
the time unfortunately right now the
 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.720
the time unfortunately right now the
scarcity mindset is going up and up in

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
scarcity mindset is going up and up in
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.360
scarcity mindset is going up and up in
the United States because people can't

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
the United States because people can't
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.000
the United States because people can't
pay their bills 78% of Americans are

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010
pay their bills 78% of Americans are
 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.379
pay their bills 78% of Americans are
living paycheck to paycheck

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389
living paycheck to paycheck
 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.949
living paycheck to paycheck
57% can't afford an unexpected $500 bill

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959
57% can't afford an unexpected $500 bill
 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.659
57% can't afford an unexpected $500 bill
and so if there's a sense that the

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669
and so if there's a sense that the
 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.399
and so if there's a sense that the
United States is getting less reasonable

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409
United States is getting less reasonable
 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.429
United States is getting less reasonable
less rational even more subject to bad

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439
less rational even more subject to bad
 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.899
less rational even more subject to bad
ideas and less open other people it's

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909
ideas and less open other people it's
 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.030
ideas and less open other people it's
related to the fact that right now a

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040
related to the fact that right now a
 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.309
related to the fact that right now a
mindset of scarcity has swept this

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319
mindset of scarcity has swept this
 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.530
mindset of scarcity has swept this
country because of pervasive financial

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540
country because of pervasive financial
 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.390
country because of pervasive financial
and security and that's one of the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400
and security and that's one of the
 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.339
