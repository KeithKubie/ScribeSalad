00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.420
So, I've been reading a lot of self-help books lately,

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.020
not just 'cause it's my job and I'm fascinated with self-improvement, but 'cause...

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.960
Fix me! Please, any of you, fix me!

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.880
*cries* I'm broken... *sobs*

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.580
And one that I read, that was incredibly thought-provoking

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.600
was Brené Brown's "The Power of Vulnerability".

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.600
Though the book has a lot of amazing insights, the one I want to talk about today is about play.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.940
So Brené's research stresses the importance of creative play to lead a life of joy.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.080
And what I actually found most surprising, is that she states that unharnessed creativity doesn't actually go anywhere.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.920
Instead, if you're not utilizing your creative self,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.040
it manifests itself as stress, judgment, anxiety and so much more awful stuff.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.360
And I thought this explains so much to me, because you know people who are like...

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.580
Oh. Wow. No, I don't do any of that losery stuff.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.840
I mean, painting is just pointless, and dancing makes you look dumb, and pottery is just for idiots.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.880
I mean, I'm a super serious lawyer and I do incredibly serious lawyer stuff.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.780
I feel like we all know someone who just totally looks down on any kind of hobby or creative endeavor.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.000
And they're all just kind of bitter, right? And I was like....

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.520
Oh, this is why, because they're not being creative.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.380
So all this repressed energy is just making them very unpleasant.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.760
And I know what you're thinking...

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.720
Anna, you're just saying that because it's your job to be creative.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.100
I mean, some of us don't have that luxury.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.940
Some of us have- have families,
careers in non-creative fields,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.460
and like hundreds of cats to take care of.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.980
First of all, you can play with your cats.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.420
And second, if you have a career in a creative field,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.600
I don't think that necessarily means you're using your creative energy.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.380
Let me explain.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.940
So Brené Brown describes two factors that determine play.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.400
They are: one, you never want it to end,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.400
and two, it has no discernible purpose.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.380
And when I heard this, I was like, wow,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.980
I don't know what in my life actually meets these two categories.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.900
Even though I get to be creative all the time, it doesn't necessarily feel like play?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.840
I mean it kind of feels like work.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.900
And sometimes I resent creativity, because

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.020
there's so much pressure to be imaginative in order to be relevant or successful, which is not fun.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.800
It just feels like you're going insane.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.029
Okay! So are we gonna do this sketch about dicks this week?

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.360
Well, we've never approached it from a satirical angle.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.940
Exactly! How I feel about dick pics is more of a confessional vlog style.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.760
"here's what i'll do to your dick", is a public service announcement

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.980
that satirizes violence against fruits and vegetables, in an effort to demonstrate how ludicrous it is

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.040
to send a photo of your genitalia to someone you don't know as a courting favor.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.040
I just don't think that dicks are on trend anymore. And if we want to...

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.300
*talking over each other*

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.180
Can we settle on like one idea? Just one idea, cats or dicks. That's all we have, cats or dicks.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.420
And I've started to make Brunei's stressed importance on play a huge factor in my life.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.220
Because I've definitely felt myself over time, become judgmental or bitter or anxious,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.300
if I'm not doing anything that brings me joy.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.000
I mean that just makes a lot of sense, right?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.400
And who wants to hang out with someone who's all those things?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.100
So recently, I've written down what is play for me?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.900
What do I love and I never want to end that has no discernible purpose other than it's fun?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.680
So I've been trying to dive more into like animation with poems like, "The Moment I Threw Your Toothbrush Away" and "p a l i n d r o m e".

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.620
And I'm also doing a stop-motion project called allure that I'm incredibly excited about.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.680
And now you guys may think...

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.240
Erm, hey! Those sound like they have a discernible purpose. As in, they're going on your channel.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.020
Yes, you're technically right.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.720
I will definitely put them up, but they don't have a real purpose,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.520
because they're kind of just one offs that I'm sinking money into

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.440
that I can't necessarily make it to a bigger property.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.700
So they're purely passion projects and I've started to rediscover how much I really love animation.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700
When I was a teenager,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.400
I actually wanted to be an animator at like Pixar or Disney.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.980
And I would pull all of these unintentional all-nighters,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.760
because I loved drawing so much.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.480
And though I'm not animating these personally,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.200
the process of making something from absolutely nothing come to life is still so wild and awesome to me.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.400
And beyond that, of course, I've tried to think of activities that fall into these categories.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.780
Like Nerf gun fights, hiking, camping, crafting,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.860
and trying to be much more engaged in those activities.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.040
To give myself more joy.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.120
But what about you? What activities are play for you?

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.920
And are you doing them enough or are you doing them at all?

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.380
