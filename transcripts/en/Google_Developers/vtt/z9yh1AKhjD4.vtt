00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.410
Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.760
My name is Elena Kon.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.390
I'm a Software
Engineer at Google.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.574
And today I'm going to
talk a bit about failure,

00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:08.490
why I think it's important,
and how to embrace

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.547
it to become more awesome.

00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:11.630
We all want to be awesome.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.080
We all want to win at life.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.950
And we all want
to be successful.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.620
But how do we get there?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.917
Often, our first reflex
is to be careful.

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:21.250
We say to ourselves, I'm going
to try and get this right

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.360
the first time, once
I'm good enough.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.930
But the road to success is
almost never a smooth one.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.500
In fact, it's
usually pretty bumpy.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.100
No matter how
careful we are, only

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.630
by failing over and
over and over again,

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.544
do we eventually succeed.

00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:35.960
So if we want to
be successful, it

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.200
is critical that
instead of avoiding it,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.470
we learn how to deal
with and embrace failure.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.030
Confidence is a key part of
our ability to embrace failure.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.770
An article titled
"The Confidence Gap,"

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.250
that I recently
read made me think

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.510
more of why some people like the
confidence needed to succeed.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.870
The article tries to
explain the observation

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.900
that women lack the
same level of confidence

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.050
as their male counterparts.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.770
It boldly states that, "If life
were one long grade school,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.870
women would be the undisputed
rulers of the world."

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.097
What this means is that
girls do just as well as

00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:09.569
boys in school-- by some
measures, even better.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.110
But as soon as we're
done with school

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.780
and released out
into the real world,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.580
we struggle to keep up with
boys' success-- especially

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.260
with the level of confidence
that they exhibit.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.810
This is explained by the fact
that girls come into school

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.470
with a developmental
advantage, making it easier

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.050
for them to behave.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.620
They then get praised a
lot for being perfect.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.920
In turn, they begin to
crave this approval that

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.510
causes them to avoid failure
and take fewer risks.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.850
Boys also tend to get
a lot more scolding,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.620
as studies show that
in the classroom,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.440
boys were observed
to get eight times

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.220
more criticism than girls.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.470
Naturally, boys learn to
take failure with stride.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.490
Furthermore, boys toughen
each other up outside

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.580
of the classroom.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.130
They tease each other, point
out each others' limitations,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.570
and call each other
butt-heads and morons.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.880
This makes such criticism
lose a lot of its power.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.780
This playground mentality
encourages them later as men,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.240
to let other people's tough
remarks slide off their backs.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.390
The result of this upbringing is
that girls avoid taking risks,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.700
because they're more
fearful of failure.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.240
When they do take
risks, they're not

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.460
as experienced and
prepared as boys to deal

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.150
with the potential failure.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.190
So when they do fail,
they're typically more

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.710
negatively affected by it.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.380
This in turn causes them to be
even more apprehensive to take

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.100
risks in the future.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.910
But being able to
overcome failure

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.530
that is typical of the
result of taking risk,

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.050
is essential for
confidence building.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.180
While we can't go back in
time to change the past,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.656
to take more risks and
make more mistakes,

00:02:32.656 --> 00:02:35.280
we can hopefully try to reverse
some of the habits that make us

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.664
more risk averse I want to
start by providing some context,

00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:40.580
and setting the stage
for how I got interested

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.760
in this topic, how I
failed many, many times,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.050
and how I've learned
to deal with failure,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.020
appreciate it, and use it
to build up my confidence,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.630
to help me take more risks.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.480
My first undisputed, very
public failure in life,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.635
was when I got a an F
on a calculus pop quiz

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:58.640
that I was entirely
unprepared for.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.350
This freaked me out
so much, that it

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.170
kicked me into high gear
and motivated me to study.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.120
As a result, for the next test
in this class, I got 108%.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.590
Yes, there were some
bonus questions.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.870
When I later reflected
on this experience,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.630
I realized that failing
this quiz actually inspired

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.260
and motivated me to work
harder to try to succeed.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.220
I found a silver lining here.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.610
I had discovered this
intrinsic motivating force

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.975
that could help propel me
through difficult times.

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:27.100
Ever since that experience,
I've become much better

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.620
at dealing with failure.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.380
Instead of getting stuck
at step one, being upset,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.750
I'm able to pretty quickly
jump to step two, where

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.840
I get super excited about what
is to follow; the purposeful,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.320
hopefully rewarding hard work.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.190
If we take some
time to reflect, we

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.060
can all probably think of
many times when we failed.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.190
And all of us over
time have learned

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.830
to deal with failure
in one way or another.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.410
Some people need
space to recover,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.900
and others are able
to laugh it off.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.990
But what if we could harness
that failure to succeed?

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.890
The key idea that I
want to point out here,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.695
is that if we re-frame
these failures that

00:03:59.695 --> 00:04:01.620
are potential precursors
to success, then

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.910
we can use that to
build up our confidence.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.930
Beyond the idea of just
re-wiring your brain,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.950
I do hope to leave you
with some more practical,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.810
hopefully easy to implement tips
and tricks to embrace failure.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.160
The first is to
minimize the risk.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.300
Set small milestones that are
independent of external factors

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.570
like people or
particular events.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.330
For example, when I was
interviewing for jobs,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.160
one time I set a small
milestone to look

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.760
into the interviewer's eyes
when communicating with them.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.520
I had a really hard
time doing that,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.730
and was trying to
improve it at the time.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.390
So I did it.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.840
And despite not
getting the job, I

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.280
was actually really proud
of my small accomplishment.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.850
Another way to minimize risk
is to anticipate problems

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.480
and prepare for them.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.070
Whenever I encounter an
ambitious problem or situation,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.850
I try to imagine
what Batman would do.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.840
It's widely known that
given enough prep time,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.790
Batman could win any fight.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.411
I want to be the same way.

00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:54.410
After spending a few years
in the tech industry,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.740
I decided I wanted
to switch jobs.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.260
But before I began
interviewing, I

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.970
spent weeks relearning
CS concept and practicing

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.230
problems.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.980
Feeling prepared when
I came to interviews

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.870
gave me the confidence I needed
to calmly tackle problems

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.100
that I was not at
all familiar with.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.650
The next thing is to
find the silver lining.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.470
When I competed in
swing dancing, often

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.260
I wouldn't win first place.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.340
But being put on the spot
to the something cool

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.660
with the audience watching
and cheering you on,

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.590
gives you the adrenaline
and encouragement

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.190
to try some really creative
moves that fit the music.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.992
So oftentimes I would get
one or two great new moves

00:05:27.992 --> 00:05:29.700
from competing, that
I could take with me

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.620
and developed later,
and potentially

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.130
use again in competition
when it's been perfected.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.310
This was a huge win for me.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.330
Finally, pat yourself on
the back heavily and often.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.300
The idea here is
that doing so helps

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.781
strengthen the connection
between success and failure,

00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:46.280
and gets you the
courage when you're

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.180
contemplating taking a risk.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.950
One thing I do is I
keep an 'I'm awesome'

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.690
email label and folder.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.390
I put 'thank you' and
'congratulation' emails there,

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.690
my performance review,
any great ideas,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.510
and anything else I can
associate with success.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.410
Whenever I'm sad
because I just failed

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.420
or hesitant to
try something new,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.310
I go and look at this
folder and remember

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.760
all of my accomplishments.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.410
And more importantly, I
remember all of the failures

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.730
that it took to get there,
and think to myself, yeah,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.920
I am awesome.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.860
And pretty much instantaneously,
feel better and encouraged

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.940
to try something new.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.620
While a large part of my talk
was focused on women building

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.762
confidence, as you may
have realized by now,

00:06:23.762 --> 00:06:25.470
these tips aren't just
relevant to women.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.150
But really could be used
by any person of any age.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.330
So now that hopefully
you've thought

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.120
about re-framing failures
as a precursor to success,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.545
and have some ideas on
how to deal with failure,

00:06:37.545 --> 00:06:40.170
go create your 'awesome' folder,
and try something new that you

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.820
think may be rewarding but take
you outside of your comfort

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.120
zone, like that dance class,
or that project at work

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.360
no one will touch.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.110
And start filling up
your 'awesome' folder

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.060
with accomplishments, to help
you accomplish even more.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.840
Thank you.
