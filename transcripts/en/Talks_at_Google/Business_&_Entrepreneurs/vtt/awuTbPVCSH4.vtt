[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:19.850
DAVID MOLTZ: Cool,
So let's start

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.160
with your blog and your podcast.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.420
You call it "Afford Anything."

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.070
Where did that name come from?

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.050
PAULA PANT: So the concept
of "Afford Anything"

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.630
is really the concept
of opportunity cost.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.570
It's this notion that
you can afford anything,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.490
but not everything.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.500
And every decision that
you make is a trade-off

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.520
against something else.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.670
And this concept doesn't
just apply to your money,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.460
even though the word afford
conjures up images of money

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.390
immediately.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.200
It also applies to your time,
your focus, your energy,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.530
your attention because we all
have limited cognition, limited

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.350
mental bandwidth.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.450
So really, it's this
notion of recognizing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.760
that most of the
resources that you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.390
deal with on a day-to-day
basis are limited resources.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.269
And we need to be
extremely conscious--

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.980
I would say even ruthless--

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.470
about how we allocate them.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.870
And that means, number one,
allocating our resources with

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.420
more intention and, number
two, deeply reflecting on how,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.300
at a 30,000-foot level, what
is actually a priority to us

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.035
in our lives to each individual,
not what does society say ought

00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:30.410
to be, or what are the default
priorities that we've been

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.970
taught.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.990
DAVID MOLTZ: Very nice.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.885
And your best known,
you know, kind of

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:36.260
in the personal
finance community

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.780
for talking and writing a lot
about financial independence.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.090
So what is financial
independence?

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.160
And how does it
relate to your story?

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.350
PAULA PANT: OK, so
financial independence

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.198
is an interesting
concept, and it's

00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:48.740
one that's gained
a lot of popularity

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.230
in the past few years.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.660
I define financial
independence as the point

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.280
at which your passive income
typically, but not always,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.240
through investments is enough.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.160
And when I say enough,
I mean that it's enough

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.460
that it creates at least
some type of a safety

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.620
net underneath you,
some type of a floor

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.030
or a foundation such that you
know that, in a worst case

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.770
scenario, in a black swan
situation, you would be OK.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.170
And so let's unpack that a
little bit because there's

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.970
a lot going on in that concept.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.940
Now, first of all, so
financial independence

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.970
is the point at which your
passive income, typically

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.280
through investment-- so
what we mean by that?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.820
So passive income is
income that does not

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.840
come through exchanging
time for money directly.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.610
So for example, if you
have access to a 401(k),

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.110
and you make contributions
of income into your 401(k)

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.910
that money will,
hopefully, grow.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.410
Right?

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.080
That money will grow both
through capital gains

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.490
and through dividends.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.250
And then that growth
will compound.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.430
So that would be an
example of passive income.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.720
Regardless of whether
or not you harness it,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.420
right, it's income in the sense
that it fuels your net worth,

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.230
and it makes your balance sheet
bigger, your personal balance

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.240
sheet bigger,
regardless of the fact

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.130
that you are not actively
pulling money out

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.860
of your 401(k) on
Tuesday in order

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.800
to pay for a pair of shoes.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.100
It's still yours.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.600
Right?

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.320
Same thing with if you make
contributions to an IRA

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.660
or to a health savings
account or if you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.388
use that money to buy a personal
residence or a rental property,

00:03:36.388 --> 00:03:38.930
assuming that those appreciate
or if the rental property does

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.430
well.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.660
In all of those examples,
you have a source

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.550
of passive income
coming in that's

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.940
fueling your net
worth, despite the fact

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.430
that you're not actively
trading dollars for it.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.828
Now when we talk about--

00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:52.370
so the last portion
of the definition

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.850
of financial independence
is this concept of enough.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.600
And that leads to a fairly
big philosophical question,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.980
which is how much is enough.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.967
And this is a source of endless
debate within the Financial

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:10.800
Independence community,
which is abbreviated

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.390
as the FI community.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:22.060
But at a bare bones, basic
level, enough is, as I see it,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.030
enough such that, in
a worst case scenario,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.970
you would at least be OK.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.430
You could feed yourself.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.710
You could keep the lights on.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.620
You could have some type of
a reasonable human shelter.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.695
It might not be what
you prefer, but you

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.540
know that you would be OK.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.050
And the example that I
often like to use is--

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.120
so a lot of people conflate
financial independence

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.420
with extreme wealth or
big other highfalutin,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.345
pie in the sky ideas.

00:04:57.345 --> 00:04:59.470
The example that I like to
give to kind of bring it

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.928
down to Earth a
little bit is let's

00:05:00.928 --> 00:05:03.430
say that you had a
brother or sister.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.440
And today, in an hour from
now, you get a phone call,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.980
and you find out that your
sibling just got diagnosed

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.780
with a terminal illness.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.840
And they have one
year left to live.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.160
And you want nothing more
than to take a one year

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.110
leave of absence,
unpaid leave of absence

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.640
from work, so that you can spend
that last year or that last six

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.200
months with your sibling.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.355
And you can't do that locally
because your sibling lives

00:05:32.355 --> 00:05:33.730
on the other side
of the country,

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.360
or they live in a
different country.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.650
All right, so you
need that time.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.100
Financial independence
is the state

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.830
of having enough
passive income so

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.350
that when you're doing that,
when you drop everything

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.400
to be with your sibling
for those critical moments,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.510
you'll be OK.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.940
You know, you're not going
to be going to Disneyland.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.260
You're not going to be
having $400 steak dinners,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.347
but you'll at least be OK.

00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:03.430
And there's a lot of freedom
that comes with that.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.310
A lot of people who reach
financial independence-- and I

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.900
reached it when I was 31.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.320
We'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.580
But a lot of people who reach
financial independence often

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.350
find that nothing in their
life necessarily changes.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.260
The day to day of
their life might

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.780
look exactly the same
post-FI, as it did pre-FI.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.480
But the psychological
relief that

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.880
comes from knowing that you've
built your own safety net

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.750
is valuable.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.910
And so sometimes, I joke that
FI is an extremely elaborate

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.771
anxiety reduction measure.

00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:43.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.260
So in my own life,
so my own story is

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.280
I graduated from
college when I was 21.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.080
This was in 2005.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.890
And I shortly after, a few
months after that, I got

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.440
my first job at a newspaper.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.720
And my starting salary
was $21,000 a year.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.200
And I worked at
that job until 2008.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.395
And at the time that I left,
my salary was $31,000 a year.

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:10.020
By the way, I know
it's unusual to like

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.160
to sit on stage with
a microphone revealing

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.340
your salary, but I'm a
blogger and podcaster.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.950
And I've made this very,
very public for years.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.230
So I'm comfortable
sharing all these numbers.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.160
So at the time that I left
my job, which was in 2008,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.820
I was making $31 a year.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.100
And I had a lot of
anxiety at that time.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.120
Like being in my
early 20s, I could

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.600
live like a college student.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.140
So it was fine, but I
knew that later in my life

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.402
I was going to need
something more, something

00:07:43.402 --> 00:07:45.610
bigger, something better,
especially if I ever wanted

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.790
to have a family or
ever wanted to own

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.250
a home or anything like that.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:57.730
And so I became really
obsessed with saving

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.800
and obsessed with investing.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.045
I started making money--

00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:03.420
while I was still
in newspaper, I

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.490
was making money on the
side as a freelancer,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.270
and I continue to grow that.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.540
And I became just
extremely aggressive

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.640
about saving and
investing, largely fueled

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.730
by honestly fear,
which, you know,

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.920
I wanted to make sure
that I would be OK.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.660
And so over the
course of the next--

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.640
basically throughout
the rest of my 20s

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.000
and into my early
30s, myself and also

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.650
my husband at the time,
soon to be ex-husband,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.100
Will, who shares my same
like enthusiasm for saving

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.669
and investing, we
lived on oftentimes

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:47.020
about 50% of our combined income
and invested the rest of it.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.340
And we invested in a
combination of 401(k)--

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.500
I have a Roth Solo 401(k).

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.660
He has a simple IRA.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.350
We both had Roth IRAs, which
later turned back to Roth IRAs.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.820
We had HSA accounts.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.160
We had the whole
alphabet soup going on.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.950
And so we put a
lot of money there.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.940
And then we put a lot of money
into rental properties as well.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.330
We lived with roommates
until we were 31.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.600
And I mean, our net worth
at the time that we stopped

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.090
living with roommates,
our combined net worth

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.840
was over $1 million at the time.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.080
So we were millionaires
living with roommates

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.525
so that we could save
50% of our income

00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:29.140
and just shovel that
into investments.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.400
And that was the level of our
dedication towards investing.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.830
So that was how I reached FI.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.860
DAVID MOLTZ: Wow,
over $1 million

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.825
and financially
independent by 31,

00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:43.700
which brings us to a
very important question.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.130
Please share with us
your investing philosophy

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.670
and some tactics and
strategies that you use.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.410
PAULA PANT: Sure,
at a high level,

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.790
my investing
philosophy is one that

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:01.740
is very fond of passively
managed investments.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.330
So there is this thing
called index funds

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.280
that was created by John Bogle
who's the founder of Vanguard.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:15.560
And an index fund is a fund that
tracks a market, a broad market

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.260
index.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.650
So for example, an index fund
might track the S&amp;P 500 index.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.380
And when you invest
in an index fund,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.060
that fund attempts, to
the best of its ability,

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.490
to mirror everything
in that index.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.630
And that means that it will
do as well as or as poorly

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.180
as what it's tracking.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.580
So if you invest in the
total US stock market index,

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.850
you will do as well
as or as poorly

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:49.250
as the total US stock market,
no better and no worse.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.610
And what they found is that,
statistically speaking,

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:58.220
over the long term, over about
a 15- to 30-year time span,

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.060
you are, statistically
speaking, more

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.570
likely to do better
trying to match the market

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.230
than you are trying to
outperform the market.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.720
You will sometimes,
occasionally, in the short run,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.340
have funds or fund managers
that momentarily outperform.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:21.350
But then they tend to, over
time, revert to the mean.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:26.650
So you're better off just
taking the passive approach.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.830
And similarly, with
real estate investments,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.742
I'm a big fan of
rental properties.

00:11:31.742 --> 00:11:33.200
And with rental
properties as well,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.980
I favor a passive
approach of, you know,

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.363
don't try to constantly be
flipping home in my view.

00:11:40.363 --> 00:11:41.780
There are other
people, of course,

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.030
who do it differently than me.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.830
But I don't want to be
spending all of my time

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.650
trying to flip homes or
trying to go into extremely

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.220
sophisticated tactics because
that's not what I do full time.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.200
I have a different
full-time job.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.770
And I want to focus on
that other full-time work

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.150
because that's my
core competence.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.480
And so I want to make my
real estate investments

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.950
as passive as possible so
that they take up as little

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.230
of my cognition as
possible, again,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.830
because you can do anything,
but not everything.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.580
DAVID MOLTZ: Right,
and you write and talk

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.030
a lot about growing the gap.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.920
So what do you mean
by growing the gap?

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.040
PAULA PANT: So growing the
gap is the result of a big--

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.130
an argument, a debate that
is popular among people

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.600
in the personal
finance community

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.080
and in the FI community, which
people love to argue about

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.120
whether it is more efficient
to earn more or spend less.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.320
It's that classic like chocolate
versus vanilla, peanut butter

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.250
versus jelly debate.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:41.750
Right?

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.290
And people often tend to--

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.520
they'll choose a side.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.630
They'll pick a camp.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.857
It's almost like you have
a favorite sports team.

00:12:51.857 --> 00:12:52.940
I'm on the earn more side.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.090
Well, I'm on the save more side.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.450
And the way that I was able
to find a bit of compromise

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.330
between those two
is I asked myself

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.930
what are we actually
trying to do here.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.860
Like forget what camp you're in.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.720
What's the goal?

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.870
Well, the objective is to
increase the gap between what

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.840
you make and what you spend.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.970
And when you think
of it in that terms,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.210
you know, growing the gap is--

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.140
the objective
becomes more clear.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.640
Right?

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.390
You're not caught up in
endless penny-pinching.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.970
You're not caught
up in like trying

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.900
to shrink your way to
greatness, nor on the other side

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.860
are you caught up
in just, you know,

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.560
going for promotion after
promotion and raise to raise,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.330
trying to make as much
money as possible,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.540
but being super careless
about your spending.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:51.610
Like growing the gap
is that recognition

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.170
that you can earn more.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.230
You can spend less.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.790
You can do a
combination of both.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.740
But ultimately, your
approach or your tactic

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.882
matters less than
the size of the gap.

00:14:02.882 --> 00:14:04.340
DAVID MOLTZ: So on
the saving side,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.260
there's a cliche that says,
you know, don't buy lattes.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.290
Or said another way, don't
pay $5 for a cup of coffee.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.250
Do you agree with that?

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.190
PAULA PANT: So that was
coined by David Bach.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.800
And David Bach, he's
a best-selling author.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.630
And he very much meant that
as a metaphor for don't be

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.600
mindless about your spending.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.470
The $5 a day, you know,
the buying a latte,

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.010
if it is done with intention,
if you sit down, and you think,

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.840
you know, I really value this.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.210
I value this moment
in my morning

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.770
where I can drink a latte
and write in my journal

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.230
and reflect on what's
coming up in my day.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.100
That conscious,
intentional spending

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.910
is very different
than mindlessly

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.840
buying a $5 coffee
every morning and then,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.610
at the end of the
week, complaining

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.430
that you don't have enough
or wondering why you're still

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:04.670
in credit card debt.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.930
Those are same action,
but the thought behind it

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.610
is the differentiator.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.840
That being said, in the
world of saving money,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.850
there's what I call
the big three--

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.440
housing, transportation, food.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.210
And if you can get
those big three right,

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.575
then you can actually
make a lot of small--

00:15:25.575 --> 00:15:26.950
you can get a lot
of small things

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.100
wrong, if you get those
three things right.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.930
Because for the
average American,

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.060
housing,
transportation, and food

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.160
are going to be your
three biggest expenses.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.950
DAVID MOLTZ: And
actually, just as a

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.440
follow up on that, same
concept of like how

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.183
do you think about making
budgeting and budgeting

00:15:46.183 --> 00:15:47.600
and spending
decisions, especially

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.410
for certain categories?

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.440
So to come up with
a budget, how do you

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.020
decide for these
categories, oh, my budget

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.410
is going to be $50 or
$100 or $200 a month?

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.172
Is it arbitrary?

00:15:58.172 --> 00:16:00.380
And then also, like how do
I decide how much to spend

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.990
versus how much to invest?

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.700
You know, if I have x
amount of dollars, you know,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.230
from my paycheck,
how do I decide

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.438
where to allocate that money?

00:16:07.438 --> 00:16:09.105
PAULA PANT: So it's
interesting that you

00:16:09.105 --> 00:16:11.570
ask about different
categories because I'm

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.460
going to take a step
back for a second

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.290
and question the premise.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.290
What is the point of
allocating your budget

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:24.080
into specific, granular,
line-itemized categories?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.610
Ultimately, a budget
is a tool that people

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.120
use in order to make sure
that you are saving enough.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.120
So again, let's take
that step back and ask

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.410
what's the objective here.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.680
If the objective is to make
sure that you're saving enough,

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.680
well, let's start with that.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.590
So you take whatever
your take-home income is,

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:51.110
your after-tax income
and, from that,

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.330
decide how much
you want to save.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.760
And when I say save, I
mean that very broadly.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.950
I mean that as anything that
improves your net worth.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.710
So how much money do you want
to put into retirement accounts,

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.700
use as additional payments
on a debt, so maybe

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.490
additional payments towards
a student loan or a mortgage?

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.099
And then savings could
also be literal savings

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.200
in a savings account.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:14.700
Right?

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.790
So take your income, then
ask yourself how much of this

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.390
do I want to save, meaning
any improvement my net worth.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.670
Yank that off the top.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.150
And then whatever is left
over is yours to spend.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:34.730
And there isn't actually
any reason to line

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.980
itemize it any
further than that.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.800
Now if you want to, if you're
the personality type who

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.620
loves tinkering
with spreadsheets,

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.250
and that sounds like
a really fun way

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.340
to spend a Friday night,
then go for it, you know,

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.900
if that's what you want to do.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.540
But to a lot of
people, a lot of people

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.820
believe that they
can't stick to a budget

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.600
because they create these
incredibly granular budgets

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.990
where they've allocated
precisely $37 a month

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.490
for dog food.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.805
And then it turns out that
they've spent $42 that month.

00:18:07.805 --> 00:18:09.680
And then they throw up
their hands in despair

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.540
and decide that
budgeting is not for me.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.400
And I'm just not
very good at money.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.060
Right?

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.380
And so the concept of what I
call the anti-budget, which

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.150
is what I've just
described, which

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:24.020
is this very simple,
two-category budget of save,

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.890
spend, the anti-budget
was something

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.420
that I developed
in order to address

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.455
that concern that a
lot of people had,

00:18:32.455 --> 00:18:33.830
that problem that
a lot of people

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.540
had because so many
people were giving up

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.610
on the notion of
budgeting, thinking

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.243
that it had to be more
complicated than it is.

00:18:41.243 --> 00:18:42.660
DAVID MOLTZ: So
for people that do

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.235
want to increase
their savings rate,

00:18:44.235 --> 00:18:46.110
as you were talking
about, what are some ways

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.327
to go about doing that?

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:52.380
PAULA PANT: Oh, so again,
if you think of savings

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.600
more broadly as growing the
gap, then you can earn more.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.960
You can spend less.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.490
You can do a
combination of both.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.240
So let's talk about
each of those.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.380
So earning more,
you can do that--

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.720
and it depends on really
where you are in life,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.640
like what your
life situation is.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.470
For some people, like if
you have the opportunity,

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.660
if you're at a company
that is large enough

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.220
to have the opportunity
for promotions and raises,

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.100
then hitting it
really hard at work

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.750
and making yourself extremely
valuable to your company

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:36.210
so that your company
reciprocates with rewarding you

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.030
with some of that value
that you are giving to them,

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.520
that can be an
incredibly powerful way

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.680
to save because, if you keep
your current standard of living

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.190
exactly where it is,
and then you earn more--

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.910
you get raises.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.720
You get promotions.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.410
You earn more.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.540
And then you bank
all of those raises.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.570
So you just keep living
exactly where you are today

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.420
and save every single raise.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.090
That, over the span
of 10 years, assuming

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.910
that you continue to get raises
and promotions over the next 10

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:11.580
years, that alone can be
rocket fuel on your finances.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.710
Of course, that
assumes that you are

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:19.050
at a company that has those
types of opportunities.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.650
You know, in my case, I worked
at a very small newspaper,

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.310
where, like I said, my
maximum salary was $31,000.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.940
And at that company, the highest
paid person at that company

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.530
was making about $60.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.020
It was just a small
company that didn't

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.780
have those types of
opportunities for advancement

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.922
or at least those
opportunities for--

00:20:38.922 --> 00:20:41.130
I didn't have the opportunity
for a six-figure income

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.000
where I worked.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.070
And so in that
situation, developing

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.980
some type of a side
hustle or a side business

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.650
could be a good approach.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.040
And I'll divide that actually
into two different levels

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.230
because, in terms
of side businesses,

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.400
you have the gig economy stuff.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:00.900
Right?

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.750
You have driving for
Uber, driving for Lyft,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.530
renting out of room on
Airbnb, walking dogs on Rover,

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.180
renting out your car on Turo.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.940
Those are all gig
economy types of ways

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.320
to make some extra income.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.290
The benefit is that that
income is immediate,

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.190
but the drawback
is that you can't--

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.260
well, with the
exception of Airbnb,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.370
you can't really distinguish
yourself very much.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.720
You don't have much of
a competitive advantage.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.330
And so while you have
some immediate income,

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.240
your upside potential
will be limited.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.815
The other type of
side income would

00:21:37.815 --> 00:21:40.590
be something like freelancing,
consulting, something

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:46.000
where you have unique value that
is your market differentiator.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.015
And so the advantage to
that type of side income

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:50.910
is that you can potentially
make a lot more.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.400
The disadvantage is that
that can take a while

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.570
to build into scale.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.700
So that income is
not necessarily

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.152
going to be immediate.

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.110
DAVID MOLTZ: Very nice.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.430
And another thing you say is
never delay gratification.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.830
So what does that mean?

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.540
PAULA PANT: So that much
applies to the thinking

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:14.310
or the mental construct around
saving money and investing

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.030
money.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:19.860
A lot of people refer to saving
money as delayed gratification.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.433
And I think that that's a
huge mistake, especially

00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:24.600
because, you know, you're
trying to encourage people

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.350
in their 20s and 30s
to save, especially

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.410
to save for retirement because
the longer your money is--

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.320
time in the market is far
more important than timing

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.310
the market.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:40.660
And compounding growth is, you
know, a wonder of the universe.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.160
Right?

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.500
So when you tell
someone in their 20s

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.480
to delay gratification,
that sounds pretty awful.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.460
But if you reframe
that mental concept,

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.890
and if you say you know what,
I'm not delaying gratification.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:04.110
I am super gratified by
watching my net worth grow.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.650
Like I am super
gratified by looking

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.030
at the numbers in this account
and watching them get bigger

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.320
and tracking my net worth
and watching that line go up.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.580
That's super cool.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:22.110
And that brings me far more
of a sense of satisfaction

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.020
than some cheap
plastic junk or a car

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.280
that is marginally nicer than
the one that I already have.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:29.780
Right?

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.180
Like that's a way that you can
reframe gratification, rather

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.340
than delay it.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.700
The other aspect of that
is to have a very strong

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.800
why that motivates you.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.930
So you don't want to be
unhappy in the present

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.233
for the sake of a future.

00:23:49.233 --> 00:23:51.150
You do want a future
that you look forward to.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:55.540
You want a strong,
compelling why in the future,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.640
but you also want to frame that
saving and investing in a way

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.810
in which you're enjoying
the present moment.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.050
So for example, when I
lived with roommates,

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:07.350
like my thinking at the time,
my mentality was like, cool,

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.240
I've got built-in friends.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.180
You know, I've always got
people to eat dinner with.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.300
And you know, so there were,
of course, certain drawbacks

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.270
with that like sharing
a refrigerator.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:24.420
But I mentally focused on
the advantages, rather than

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.800
the disadvantages.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:31.740
And that made it feel like
an immediately fun option,

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.495
rather than as a sacrifice.

00:24:34.495 --> 00:24:36.412
DAVID MOLTZ: And so yeah,
we talked about kind

00:24:36.412 --> 00:24:37.412
of saving and investing.

00:24:37.412 --> 00:24:40.350
How about investing
versus paying off debt?

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.730
So you know, most people
have some sort of debt,

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.820
whether it's a mortgage or
student loans or whatnot.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.210
And how do you think
about whether, if you

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.910
do have some extra cash, do
you pay down debt quicker?

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.940
Or should I do the
minimum payment

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.730
and invest that in
the stock market?

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.480
And there seems to be
arguments both ways.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.570
What are your thoughts on that?

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.278
PAULA PANT: That's an
excellent question.

00:24:59.278 --> 00:25:01.590
Now first of all, both of
them are fantastic options.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:06.030
Anything that improves
your net worth is awesome.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:12.180
So regardless of which one you
choose, either way, it's great.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.540
In terms of how to think
through that question,

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.930
there are a couple of
different approaches.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.690
First of all, I'm
going to differentiate

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.660
between high-interest debt
versus low-interest debt.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.400
Now we know that, historically,
the US stock market, depending

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.430
on the years that you're looking
at, the time frame that you're

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.650
looking at, historically,
the US stock market

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:36.750
has returned somewhere
between 7% to 10% ish

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.162
as a long-term
aggregate average.

00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:41.370
Warren Buffett has predicted
that the US stock market

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:45.000
might, to the extent
that anybody can ever

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.490
predict anything
about the future,

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:52.020
has predicted that the US stock
market may produce 7% returns

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.230
in the future, moving forward.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.660
Of course, projection is
just a fancy word for guess,

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.820
but we can use that
as a ballpark figure

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.260
as we're kind of thinking
through this decision.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.640
So if you have a debt that has
double-digit interest rates,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.060
right, if you've got a
debt that's 10% or more--

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.680
or I would argue,
personally, 8% or more,

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.720
pay that off because you're
not likely to do better

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.250
in an index fund, in a
broad market index fund.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.400
Now if you have a debt that
has a high single digit--

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.235
we'll say somewhere between
5% to 8% interest rate--

00:26:33.235 --> 00:26:35.610
there's still a strong argument
for paying that debt off.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.735
Although, the argument is
a little bit less strong.

00:26:37.735 --> 00:26:40.300
But when you talk about
investment returns,

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.810
you want to think of
them in the framework

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.580
of a risk-adjusted return.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.970
And what that means
is that getting

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:52.560
a return of 8% in
a treasury bond

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.170
is very different than getting
a return of 8% in Bitcoin,

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:01.020
right, like two totally
different types of risk

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.470
that we're talking about.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.570
So if you're thinking about
arbitraging the difference

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.640
between the interest
rate that you're

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.190
paying on a loan
versus the return

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.250
that you could get
in an investment,

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:19.608
you want the potential
gap to be big enough.

00:27:19.608 --> 00:27:21.150
You want that spread
to be big enough

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.990
to justify the added risk.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:27.420
So for example, if you have
a mortgage at a 3.5% interest

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:34.380
rate, and you have $10,000
that you got as a bonus,

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.810
and you're wondering
should I apply

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.480
this $10,000
towards my mortgage,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.090
or should I put this $10,000
into the stock market, well,

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:49.240
at that point, we're
talking about a spread that

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.560
is large enough that there would
be, in many cases, a pretty

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:58.270
valid argument for putting
that 10 grand into the market.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:04.370
If the spread is really small,
then it's just not worth it.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:09.070
So that being said, the
other thing that I'll say

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.900
is that there are
many people who

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.690
are proponents of getting rid
of debt as quickly as possible

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.190
because there are a lot of
emotional and psychological

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.660
benefits to getting
rid of that debt.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.870
And so in addition
to the math of it,

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:28.570
in addition to the opportunity
cost and the expected value,

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.020
you also do want to think about,
you know, we're not machines.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.310
We're not robots.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.880
And if that psychological
benefit to being debt-free

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.310
is going to help you get
a better night's sleep,

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.427
well, then there's
added value in that.

00:28:42.427 --> 00:28:44.010
DAVID MOLTZ: Yeah,
so you've obviously

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.292
made a very compelling argument
like why you should invest.

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:49.000
There are seasoned
investors in the room.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.390
And there's also people
just getting started.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.270
And I guess one
challenge that I still

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:58.170
have is trying to figure out
my ideal asset allocation.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.430
Everyone disagrees with it.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.513
You know, some people would
say you're very young.

00:29:01.513 --> 00:29:02.580
You should be all stocks.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.190
Some people would say you
should have your age in bonds.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.590
Some people should say the
market has been very volatile.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.110
You should have real
estate in your portfolio.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.800
And others would
say cash is king.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.100
So with so many
different asset classes,

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.090
how do you make a decision
on how-- you know,

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:17.760
based on things
like risk tolerance,

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.432
how do you decide for
you specifically, rather

00:29:20.432 --> 00:29:21.640
than just some rule of thumb?

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.330
Like how do I decide
what my personal asset

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:25.853
allocation should be?

00:29:25.853 --> 00:29:27.520
PAULA PANT: That's
also a good question.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:33.610
So when people diversify
their investments,

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.420
the idea behind
diversification is

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.820
to have an assortment
of what are known

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.430
as low-correlation assets.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.920
And so low-correlation
assets are

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.650
assets in which, when
one moves this way,

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.610
the other doesn't move, or
it moves, you know, inverse.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.620
So like stocks and bonds,
that's an easy example.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.090
They tend to have an inverse
correlation with one another.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.070
When one goes up,
the other goes down.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.580
And so having that mix
of stocks and bonds

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.130
smooths out the ride
in your portfolio.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:08.400
And really, what it does
is when you rebalance--

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.770
the idea behind
rebalancing is that you

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.650
sell some of the winners
and buy more of the losers.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.010
You know, you buy things
that underperform--

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.800
you sell things that
are doing really well

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.870
and buy more of what's
underperforming.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:29.100
Rebalancing a portfolio
forces you to do exactly that.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.860
It forces you to sell the
winner, harvest the winners,

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.570
and buy the underperformers.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.530
And as a result, the whole
concept of rebalancing

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:41.220
forces you to take a
contrarian approach

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.220
and move in the opposite
direction of the market.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.520
It forces you to be greedy when
others are fearful and fearful

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.030
when others are greedy, to
paraphrase that famous quote.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:59.220
And that's the reason why
asset allocation and buying

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.770
an assortment of
like different assets

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.020
and then rebalancing
periodically

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.110
is so well regarded
among many people.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.010
That being said,
it's not necessarily

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.610
the only way to do it.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.820
There are plenty of people
who make the argument

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.680
that, particularly
when you're young,

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.650
having an all-equities
portfolio,

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.800
you know, balanced out
with a strong cash reserve

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.950
would be better than putting
a portion of your portfolio

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:34.117
in bonds since, historically,
over a 40-year time span,

00:31:34.117 --> 00:31:35.700
those equities are
going to do better.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.283
And so there are
people who will argue

00:31:37.283 --> 00:31:39.350
that having any type
of a bond allocation

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:43.700
means that you are giving
up some returns in exchange

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.520
for that smoother ride.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.240
So if you talk to 100 different
people about asset allocation,

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.670
you're going to hear
101 different responses.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.740
The way to think
through it for yourself

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.250
is, first and foremost, again,
what's going to help you

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:03.920
sleep more easily at night
because your behavior

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.830
and your contributions are
the single biggest determinant

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.570
of market performance.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:12.530
They've found that people
often underperform the funds

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:13.880
that they are in.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.490
And on the surface,
that sounds impossible.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.940
Like if you're in a fund, how
could you possibly underperform

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.960
the fund that you're in?

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.580
But the reason that that happens
is because people get nervous,

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.840
and then they dance in
and out of the fund.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.480
And as a result,
they underperform

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.030
what they're already holding.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.780
And so they've actually found
that dead people actually

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.370
outperform the living when it
comes to investment returns

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.020
because they just
don't touch-- they

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.760
don't touch their portfolio.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.170
And so actually, I learned
that through JL Collins who

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.940
gave a great talk at Google.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.260
And so that's the first question
that I would ask yourself.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:57.760
Right?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.280
Like the math of
it is one thing,

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.970
but the behavioral component
cannot be understated.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.510
So if having that
bond allocation

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:09.410
or having some portion of
your portfolio in commodities

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:16.400
or in real estate or just
keeping an excess in cash

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:22.130
beyond what most financial
advisors might recommend,

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:27.950
if that's what helps you hold
steady through market declines

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:31.610
and hold steady
through a recession,

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.710
then it's worthwhile.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.770
DAVID MOLTZ: So speaking of
JL Collins and other industry

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.620
titans, like Warren
Buffett, Jack Bogle,

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.490
they all say US stocks.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.112
You know, put your money
in either the S&amp;P 500

00:33:44.112 --> 00:33:46.070
or the total US stock
market and don't touch it

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.660
for a really long time.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.650
What are your thoughts on US
versus international investing?

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.815
So should people be investing
in international stocks?

00:33:54.815 --> 00:33:56.315
So I guess could
you talk about kind

00:33:56.315 --> 00:33:59.180
of home-country bias
and then whether or not

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.080
you recommend investing
internationally as well?

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.380
PAULA PANT: So I do, yes.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.370
I think that it is
a very good idea.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.330
Again, this is one of
those controversial topics

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:15.080
where there are some people,
JL Collins being an example--

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.429
he makes the
argument that, if you

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:22.800
are invested in major companies
that are based in the United

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.920
States, like Google
or Nike, you know,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.949
many of the big
companies based here

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:33.630
do business in countries
around the world.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.889
And so he and many other
people make the argument

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:40.730
that, simply by virtue of
investing in large-cap US

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:45.980
companies, you necessarily
have international exposure

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.560
indirectly through them.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.179
And his argument is
that, for that reason,

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:55.409
international funds
are unnecessary.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:59.450
They also, oftentimes,
depending on the specifics

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.230
of the type of plan that
your company offers,

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.180
these funds can often
be more expensive.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.690
And there's also currency
risk because you're

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:16.560
using US dollars to invest
in companies that operate

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.580
in different currencies.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.650
And so in addition
to all of the risks

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.700
that you have when you become
an investor in a company, which

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.260
is what happens whenever
you buy a stock,

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.920
you also have currency
conversion risk

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.370
to contend with as well.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.150
So for that reason,
there is a camp

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.780
of people who think that
international investing is

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.950
unnecessary.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.940
Personally, I disagree.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.260
I think that it is important to
have an international component

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.760
to your portfolio.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.545
And so there are three
subsets, major subsets,

00:35:50.545 --> 00:35:51.670
to international investing.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:55.140
There's developed
markets, emerging markets,

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.790
and frontier markets.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.430
And I would argue
that, at a minimum,

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.640
developed markets, which
are well-established,

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.270
stable markets, should be
a piece of your portfolio.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:10.068
Emerging markets,
probably, you know,

00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:11.860
they tend to be a little
bit more volatile.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.590
But if you have the stomach
to withstand that volatility,

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:18.270
I think that's also
an excellent addition.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:23.280
Frontier markets might be
a little bit too volatile

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.150
for a lot of people.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.360
So I wouldn't
necessarily go there.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.850
DAVID MOLTZ: Gotcha.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:29.670
And several of
your episodes have

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:32.520
gone into kind of
behavioral finance, which

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.560
I know a lot of us
find very interesting.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.630
And so can you kind of
share some key lessons

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.020
you've learned on how
psychology impacts investing

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.520
and maybe what we
should do about it.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.210
PAULA PANT: So first, there's
this notion of loss aversion.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:50.940
And loss aversion is the
concept that losing money

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:56.420
feels worse than making the
equivalent amount of money.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.630
If you invest $5,000,
and you lose $1,000,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:06.810
and now you're down to $4, that
feels a lot worse than the joy

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.560
that you would feel if that
$5,000 went up to $6,000.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.640
And so loss aversion
and, you know,

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.810
its closely related
cousin negativity bias,

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:23.940
highlights how we often can
spend more time playing defense

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.460
than we do playing offense.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.000
Right?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.330
We spend more time and energy
trying to protect ourselves

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:36.640
from the downside than we do
trying to pursue opportunities.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:42.000
And that's something, as you
feel yourself emotionally

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.540
reacting to your investments--
like if you make a practice

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:51.168
of tracking your net worth,
and you do this quarterly--

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:51.960
DAVID MOLTZ: Daily.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.665
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:54.665 --> 00:37:56.040
PAULA PANT: You're
probably going

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.130
to have some quarters--
unless you're very lucky,

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.730
there might be quarters where
your net worth goes down,

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.500
perhaps significantly.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:09.600
And when that happens, you
will feel that sense of that.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.025
Seeing your net worth
decline feels a lot worse

00:38:13.025 --> 00:38:15.150
than the joy you felt the
previous quarter watching

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.290
it go up.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.690
And that's that moment to
check in with yourself and say

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:21.840
am I about to do
something stupid.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.250
Am I about to make an impulsive
decision based on this feeling

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.937
that I have right now?

00:38:28.937 --> 00:38:30.270
So that's one of the components.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.570
Loss aversion is one of
the behavioral components

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.010
of managing yourself
as an investor.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.100
I would argue that managing
yourself and managing

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:45.090
your own mindset is the
precursor to managing money.

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.520
You can't effectively
manage your money

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.150
until you've managed
your mental space.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.940
So in addition to loss
aversion, sunk cost

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.720
fallacy is another
popular fallacy

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.460
that people get hung up on.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:03.690
Sunk cost fallacy is this
notion that I'm already in it.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:08.100
I may as well stay in it.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.400
I've already put in so
much time and effort.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.265
I may as well keep doing it.

00:39:13.265 --> 00:39:15.390
I see this a lot when people
buy rental properties.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:16.800
Right?

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.930
You'll make 10
offers on properties.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:20.110
None of them get accepted.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.900
You make the 11th offer.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.060
It finally gets accepted.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.760
And then you send an
inspector out to the property,

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.200
and the inspector
finds something

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.420
completely unanticipated.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.470
And you think to yourself I've
put in so much work just trying

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:39.540
to find this property, plus I've
paid $400 for the inspector,

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.800
you know, this has already cost
me so many hours of my time.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.460
Let's just buy the thing.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:45.960
Right?

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.693
And that's sunk cost fallacy.

00:39:48.693 --> 00:39:50.110
Now that you're
this deep into it,

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.620
you don't want to give it up.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:56.260
But that's not an
effective framework

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.620
for making that type
of six-figure decision.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.050
Anchoring is another one.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.280
So anchoring is this
notion of, well,

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.380
I paid $100 for this stock.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.830
And so now I'm price
anchored to it at $100.

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.440
The stock has dropped to $70.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.440
I'm just going to wait until
it gets back up to $100,

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.550
and then I'll sell it.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:16.660
Right?

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.500
That's a tempting
thought to have.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.920
But in reality, it's
completely illogical.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.120
The stock does not care
what you paid for it.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.110
So those are all examples
of very, very common

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.230
mental fallacies that we
can fall into as we think

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.858
about how to manage our money.

00:40:36.858 --> 00:40:38.650
DAVID MOLTZ: And so
knowing that psychology

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:41.040
has such a major
influence on investing,

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.060
one thing I'd like
to hear from you

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.000
is, so going back to
the asset allocation,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.040
if you're young, if
you're in your 20s or 30s,

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.983
you should be
predominantly all stocks.

00:40:49.983 --> 00:40:51.400
So it seems like--
and some people

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.120
are even preaching be
100% stocks for example.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.010
And that's extremely
aggressive, especially

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.050
because a lot of
millennials have never--

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.000
they haven't gone through
2008, for example,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.650
with money and the market.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:05.130
So I guess my
thought is knowing--

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.630
again, going back to the loss
aversion and things like that,

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.672
do you actually recommend
maybe young people have

00:41:09.672 --> 00:41:13.780
a more conservative allocation
until they see how they react

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.450
going through volatility
or a bear market

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.540
and making sure they can
handle that sort of, you know,

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.137
volatility or loss?

00:41:21.137 --> 00:41:22.720
And then once they
do that, maybe they

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.230
could actually then take on
a more aggressive allocation,

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.670
knowing they can handle it.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.260
PAULA PANT: I
would not recommend

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.840
that for all young
people, but I would

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.760
ask each individual
person to know yourself.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.590
If you think that there is a
reasonable likelihood that you

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:46.040
might panic the next time
that we have a recession,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.550
then put those
safeguards in place

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.690
that will save
you from yourself.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:53.210
And so the tactic
that you just cited,

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:57.940
which is have a heavier bond
allocation or a heavier cash

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.570
allocation when you're
young so that you

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.210
can see how you react at
the next recession, that's

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:07.930
an example of a way that you can
build a safeguard in which you

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:11.090
protect yourself from yourself.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.430
That's one of many examples.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.400
You could also work
with an advisor

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.580
and give them clear
instructions to like no matter--

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.070
when we have our next
pullback, no matter

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:24.460
what I tell you,
right, don't let me

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.620
shoot myself in the foot.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.120
Right?

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.480
Don't let me be my
own worst enemy.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:32.258
That might be another way,
another tactic that allows you

00:42:32.258 --> 00:42:33.550
to save yourself from yourself.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.008
But at the end of
the day, what you

00:42:35.008 --> 00:42:40.840
want to do is really know
yourself and then put

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.960
those safeguards in
place that allow you--

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.926
that they compensate
for your weaknesses.

00:42:46.926 --> 00:42:47.822
DAVID MOLTZ: Great.

00:42:47.822 --> 00:42:48.883
I have one more question.

00:42:48.883 --> 00:42:50.300
And then I think
we actually might

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.935
have time for a few
audience questions

00:42:51.935 --> 00:42:55.340
so if you want to think about
anything you might want to ask.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.400
But first, before we get
there, let's talk about habits

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.360
because that's a huge component.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.110
You chat a lot about that on
your podcast, habits and habits

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:03.610
building.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:06.168
You've had some great guests
come on and talk about that.

00:43:06.168 --> 00:43:08.210
And one of the things you
said that stuck with me

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:12.930
is that basically habits
beat willpower any day.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.540
And I think that's fascinating.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.040
Right?

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.530
It's like it's very hard to walk
by like a donut or something

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.520
and not grab it.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.750
But if you, in advance,
develop a habit to not walk

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.500
by the donut, it's very easy.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.190
So can you chat more about
that, building the habits.

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.820
PAULA PANT: Oh, this is
one of my favorite topics.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.100
OK, so first of all, yes,
habits beat willpower.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.872
The notion is willpower
is kind of like a muscle.

00:43:36.872 --> 00:43:38.330
It tends to be,
for most people, it

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:41.250
tends to be strongest in the
morning and weakest at night,

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.130
which is why a lot
of people have--

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.440
they stick to their eating
plan for the whole day,

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.190
and then they have
that late night snack,

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:51.260
you know, that they
never intended to have.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.080
But it's 11:00 PM.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.130
And you're tired.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:59.410
And this seems like the perfect
moment to eat that donut.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:01.370
Right?

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:06.630
When you create habits, those
habits are largely unconscious.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:07.130
Right?

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:12.860
When I wake up in the morning,
when I pick up my toothbrush,

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.070
the next thing that I do is I
pick up my tube of toothpaste.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.990
And I put the toothpaste
on the toothbrush.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:19.647
That's not a conscious thought.

00:44:19.647 --> 00:44:21.230
I don't pick up my
toothbrush and then

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:24.780
stand there looking at it
wondering what to do next.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.120
It's muscle memory.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.520
It's a habit.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.530
This is the trigger or cue--

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.350
picking up my toothbrush
is the trigger or cue

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:37.970
that precedes the next immediate
action, which is picking up

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:40.250
that tube of toothpaste.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:44.660
And so in order to form a
habit, things to be conscious

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.300
of-- and this comes from Charles
Duhigg in his book "The Power

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.200
of Habit"--

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:53.660
is time, location,
immediately preceding action,

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.780
emotional state.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:55.280
Right?

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.810
And if there's a
particular habit

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.610
that you're trying to break--

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.440
he gave the example
of he would always

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.740
get up and start, around 3:30 in
the afternoon, he would get up,

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.270
and he would eat a cookie.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:06.470
And he just kept doing this.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:07.803
And then he kept eating cookies.

00:45:07.803 --> 00:45:10.070
And he started gaining weight.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:14.660
And so then he noted the time.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:15.660
He noted the location.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.230
He noted the emotional
state that he was in,

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:20.830
which was kind of bored
or restless or wanting

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.220
a break around that time.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.900
And he was able
to replace getting

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.760
a cookie with just taking
a walk and, you know,

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.950
satisfying that emotional
state, satisfying

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:35.930
the state of like
boredom restlessness

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:37.730
without the cookie.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:41.720
So he kept the cue or
trigger, and then he

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.080
kept the reward, which
was the satisfaction

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.490
of his restlessness, like that
entertainment and distraction.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.300
And he replaced the
action in the middle.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.750
So if you break down
a habit into cue,

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.630
action, reward,
then keep the cue.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.040
Keep the reward.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.900
Switch out the action.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:03.020
There's this notion also
called habit stacking.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:08.000
And that is to build habits
on top of other habits.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.430
And so the reason that
habit stacking works so well

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:17.390
is, because every habit
needs a given cue,

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:20.360
if you have a cue already
because that cue is

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.250
a habit that you're
already doing,

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.380
then, since you're
already doing it,

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.080
you know that you can stack
another habit on top of that.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.670
So for example, every morning
I make a cup of coffee.

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:33.770
Earlier this year,
I decided that I

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:37.260
wanted to create a habit
of writing in a journal.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.660
And so I now stack my
journal writing habit

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.160
with my coffee habit.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.890
I will never forget to
drink coffee in the morning.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:48.180
That's impossible.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.330
And so when I have
that cup of coffee,

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:54.320
that is now the cue or the
trigger that tells me time

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.420
to write in a journal.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.240
And then the next habit
that I will form--

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.400
and it's typically most
effective to only form

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.590
one habit at a time.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:06.920
A lot of people try to stack
on too many habits all at once.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.720
And then the whole
thing collapses.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.880
So choose one habit.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.190
For me, it was
writing in my journal.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.290
Stick with that
for 30 to 60 days.

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.320
And then at the end of that,
then add in another one.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.713
So right now, it's
the end of February.

00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:22.880
I started the journal habit.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.650
It's been about 60 days.

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:27.210
And now that that has
been pretty consistent,

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.670
now I can add on the next habit.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.170
And so the next
thing I'd like to do

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.570
is meditate for
about 10 minutes.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:36.470
And my intention is, again,
that habit stacking, coffee,

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:37.790
journal, meditate.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:41.290
So each one is a cue or
a trigger for the next.

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:44.680
AUDIENCE: How do you think
about cash flow investing

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.460
with real estate?

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.190
Are you like an LP in a fund?

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:48.970
Or are you a sole proprietor?

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.850
And you buy apartment buildings,
and you manage them yourself.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:52.630
What do you do?

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.850
PAULA PANT: So I personally--

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:57.460
again, I want to
spend as little time

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.892
on real estate as
possible for myself.

00:47:59.892 --> 00:48:01.600
And of course, every
real estate investor

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.390
is going to have a
different strategy based

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:07.660
on what your career is, what
your business is, you know,

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.430
how much time you have.

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:13.335
For myself, with that
passive philosophy,

00:48:13.335 --> 00:48:15.460
I want to spend as a little
time on it as possible.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.685
So I only buy residential
rental properties

00:48:19.685 --> 00:48:20.560
in the United States.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.390
That's the only thing
I'm interested in.

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:24.400
And that does not
necessarily mean

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:30.040
that that is better or
worse than any other type.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.420
You know, so I'm
in no way implying

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.460
that that's better than
commercial buildings

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:40.340
or warehouses or storage units.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:44.380
It's just I want to keep
it as simple as possible

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.190
so that I can focus the vast
majority of my time and energy

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:52.390
on my business and my
career because that's where

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.997
I can make the biggest gains.

00:48:55.997 --> 00:48:56.830
AUDIENCE: Hi, Paula.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:01.570
I have a question going back to
the asset allocation discussion

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.130
that David started.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:06.760
And it's also coming off
that real estate comment.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.400
What is the
recommended percentage

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.530
of your net worth that
you would invest in index

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:13.720
funds versus rental properties?

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.430
Because it seems
like all the research

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:18.760
I've done on all the dialogue
from the financial independence

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.700
community is basically
split into those two schools

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.270
of thought.

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:25.130
Like do index fund investing,
or buy rental properties.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:28.660
And if I may outline, it
seems to be the rule of thumb

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.600
for index fund investing is
the 4% safe withdrawal rate.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.480
And then the rule of thumb
for rental property investing

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.640
would be the type of cap
rate you're going for.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.170
And a going rate for the
cap rate might be like 7%.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:44.320
So is that a 7% rule
versus a 4% rule that

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.730
accelerates your date to FI?

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:46.810
Or am I off there?

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:47.790
Just curious.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:49.790
DAVID MOLTZ: That is a
pretty specific question.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:51.403
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:51.403 --> 00:49:53.320
PAULA PANT: So first of
all, to the first half

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.920
of your question, which is what
is the proper asset allocation,

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:01.360
again, I don't think that there
is any specific correct one.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:01.860
Right?

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.590
Like at the end of the day,
at a big picture level,

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:08.310
what you're trying to do
is increase your net worth

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:10.920
in a risk-managed way.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.550
And so however you can
increase your net worth

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:20.160
in a way that is comfortable
to you is the way to do it.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:20.660
Right?

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:24.320
The best, the quote unquote,
"best strategy" in the world

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.870
is the one that you'll actually
stick to because, ultimately,

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:28.953
regardless of whether your
contributions are going

00:50:28.953 --> 00:50:32.300
to rental properties
versus index funds,

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.610
your contributions are going
to be the single biggest

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.810
determinant of your success.

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:38.960
And so if you--

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:44.917
and again, humans can play
these psychological tricks

00:50:44.917 --> 00:50:45.500
on themselves.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.650
Like we have this tendency
to compartmentalize money.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.060
Like if you think about
it, money is money.

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.500
You've got this big pool of
assets, and it's all money.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.620
But if we compartmentalize
it mentally,

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.870
if we think this
is the batch that's

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.360
going to be used for
my kids' college fund,

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.170
well, we're less likely to take
the kids' college fund batch

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.110
and spend it on
caviar and champagne,

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:13.430
even though we might take a
batch from this other bucket

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.750
and spend that on
caviar and champagne.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:16.250
Right?

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.870
Ultimately, it's
all your net worth.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:19.640
It's all your money.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.000
But compartmentalizing
is very powerful.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.670
And so that really, in
terms of asset allocation,

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.320
is what I would
encourage you to do.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.680
If you can
compartmentalize like,

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.744
you know, maybe the
income that I make from--

00:51:35.744 --> 00:51:39.500
the income that I make
from this freelancing

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.803
that I do on the side goes
towards rental properties,

00:51:42.803 --> 00:51:44.720
but the income that I
make from my primary job

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.240
goes towards index funds
or vise versa, whatever.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:51.140
You know, it doesn't matter
what the decision is.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.870
That compartmentalization
can often

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:58.130
be a motivator that helps
you increase contributions.

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:01.940
And I think that is far more
important than the tactic

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.110
of nailing a proper
asset allocation.

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:07.242
DAVID MOLTZ: Nice, all
right, one last one.

00:52:07.242 --> 00:52:08.200
AUDIENCE: Who wants it?

00:52:13.381 --> 00:52:16.990
AUDIENCE: Hi, first, thanks for
coming out and talking with us.

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:20.880
So my question has to do with
asset allocation to a degree,

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.560
but also real estate and equity.

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.430
So ultimately--

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:24.960
PAULA PANT: Popular topic here.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
you know, if you're

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.210
noticing that a substantial
portion of your net worth

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:34.547
is in home equity, what
are kind of the key points

00:52:34.547 --> 00:52:36.130
to factor into the
decision of whether

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.920
or not to pull the
equity to invest?

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.557
So you know, ultimately,
you discussed 4% and change.

00:52:41.557 --> 00:52:43.140
If it's a home equity
line, if there's

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.750
a variable versus fixed, what
are you looking for as far as--

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.200
you know, you mentioned
7% or 8% return--

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.413
kind of that gap?

00:52:50.413 --> 00:52:52.080
What's that spread
that you kind of look

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.530
for to decide whether or not
it's meaningful to actually

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:56.860
pull money out of investments?

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.930
PAULA PANT: Oh, that's
an excellent question.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:02.310
So the concept of, if you
have a significant amount

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:05.790
of home equity in your
personal residence,

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:08.605
pulling that home equity
out to invest-- now

00:53:08.605 --> 00:53:10.230
first thing I'll say
is a lot of people

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.033
have a knee-jerk reaction
to this where they think,

00:53:13.033 --> 00:53:13.950
oh, no, don't do that.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:14.908
That's not a good idea.

00:53:14.908 --> 00:53:16.710
But if you think
about it logically,

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.825
right, what is the
difference between--

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:25.190
what is the difference
between taking money

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.550
that you would otherwise use
to make accelerated mortgage

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:32.768
payments and using that for an
alternate purpose versus having

00:53:32.768 --> 00:53:34.310
a good amount of
home equity and then

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:38.270
borrowing against it for
same said alternate purpose.

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:39.160
Right?

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.670
At a functional level, those
are exactly the same actions.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:46.640
But a lot of people will say--

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.918
you know, person A will say
I'm not making any accelerated

00:53:50.918 --> 00:53:53.210
payments towards my mortgage
because I would rather put

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:56.030
that money into investment x.

00:53:56.030 --> 00:54:01.070
And person B would say I am
making accelerated payments

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.390
towards my mortgage.

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:05.178
And now, look, I've got
all of this home equity.

00:54:05.178 --> 00:54:07.220
I'm going to borrow against
it and put that money

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.250
towards investment x.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:08.750
Right?

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:10.118
Like it's the same thing.

00:54:10.118 --> 00:54:11.660
So the first thing
I'll say-- and I'm

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:14.077
saying this for the sake of
everyone who's listening-- is,

00:54:14.077 --> 00:54:16.220
you know, don't have
that knee-jerk reaction

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.440
against borrowing
against the equity

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:24.380
in your personal residence
because, in many ways,

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:29.340
many of us are already doing
it through opportunity cost.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.250
So then to answer your
specific question,

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.010
how would I think through
whether or not to do it

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:35.510
for a given investment?

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.270
The first thing that
I would ask is not

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:43.050
the potential return
on that investment,

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.960
but I would ask what
is the risk of ruin.

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:46.460
Right?

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:50.600
What are the chances that
that money that you withdraw

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.760
could go down to zero?

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.930
On something like a
broad market index fund

00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:02.160
or a rental property, the
chances of that falling,

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.560
sure, that's there.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:07.730
But the chances of that
dropping by 50%, you know,

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:12.620
or losing a very
significant amount of money

00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:18.265
is, historically speaking,
not that likely to happen.

00:55:18.265 --> 00:55:22.700
You know, so in that regard,
your downside is, at least

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:24.950
historically speaking, limited.

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:29.410
And to that extent,
that makes it

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:32.950
safer than say taking
out that same HELOC

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:36.725
and using it to start your own
business, which could go down

00:55:36.725 --> 00:55:37.225
to zero.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:42.080
So that's the way
that I would approach

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.270
it is manage the downside.

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:45.950
Manage the risk of ruin.

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:51.630
Because so long as that money,
in a worst case scenario,

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:54.770
so long as even if you
don't make any returns,

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:57.205
if at the end of the
day, you break even,

00:55:57.205 --> 00:55:59.330
and then you're mad at
yourself because you've just

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:02.480
paid a bunch of closing
costs, that's not

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.300
going to be a deathbed regret.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.320
Right?

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.100
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.790
DAVID MOLTZ: All right, well,
that's all the time we have.

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:09.207
Last question for
Paula, for those

00:56:09.207 --> 00:56:11.390
that are interested
and want to learn more

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:14.390
about you and "Afford
Anything," where should they go?

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:17.210
PAULA PANT: So my podcast
is called "Afford Anything."
