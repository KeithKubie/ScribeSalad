00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.100
Babies require a lot of attention in order
to stay alive, but when they’re all wrapped

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.070
up in a nice cozy blanket, they could be in
a lot of danger.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.799
Hello all you nurturing parents out there,
Catie Wayne here for DNews.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.090
Infants are adorable.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.390
I don’t know that there are many people
who could in all honesty disagree.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.660
But something else that we all agree on is
that they are a huge responsibility.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.050
Keeping another human alive is no cake walk.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.759
In fact, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention approximately 4,000

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.649
infants die suddenly and unexpectedly.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.000
This is often attributed to Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome, or SIDS.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.660
SIDS is defined as a sudden death in an infant
under one year old, that cannot be explained

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.789
after a thorough investigation is conducted.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.129
A thorough investigation includes an autopsy,
an examination of the death scene and a review

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.100
of the infant’s medical history.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.200
This is obviously a very scary thought for
expecting and new parents.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.449
That your baby could just, die for no apparent
reason.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.329
But according to a recent study conducted
by the National Institute for Child Health

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.300
and Human Development, and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, among other

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.230
institutions, nearly 50 percent of American
infants sleep with unsafe bedding that can

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.280
increase the risk of SIDS.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.890
Unsafe bedding, by the way includes loose
blankets, toys in the crib, pillows, quilts--

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.030
you get the idea.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.320
These objects increase the risk of SIDS and
accidental suffocation.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.810
The recommend way to put a baby to sleep,
according to the NICHD, is to place the baby

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.000
on its back, on a firm, safety approved mattress
with a fitted sheet.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.250
And that, is IT.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.770
No extra bedding, no unmonitored swaddling,
no baby toys, Nothing on top of OR under the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.540
baby, a detail that the researchers report
escapes many new parents.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.170
To keep the baby warm, you can dress them
in layers so you can remove or add clothing

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.170
as needed.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.710
Keep the room at a comfortable temperature,
and in winter if the baby is not yet crawling

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.980
you could use a space heater.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.320
There are also these adorable baby sacks;
they’re like sleeveless dresses, with the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.050
bottom sewed closed so it mimics the sensation
of being swaddled or a blanket, but doesn’t

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.180
pose a risk of suffocation.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.570
And they’re loose around the hips so there’s
no risk of inhibiting hip development (something

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.930
that swaddling can do).

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.640
But you do need to think about overheating,
because contrary to popular belief, babies

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.380
don’t need any more warming than adults.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.400
Now to be fair, the researchers also believe
that new parents are given a lot of mixed

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.400
information.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.670
Many magazines aimed at women of childbearing
age contain images of infants with lots of

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.510
cozy blankets and pillows.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.219
This could easily reinforce the impression
that obeying your desire to keep your baby

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:33.659
cozy and warm with blankets is not only normal,
it’s the best way to go about things.

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.060
Unfortunately, that is not the case.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.819
But fortunately, now you know.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.111
Thanks for joining me for DNews guys, be sure
to share this video with people you know who

00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:41.111
have their newborns sleep with bedding so
they can be informed.

00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:42.920
