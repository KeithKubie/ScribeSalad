00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.860
In this section on social behavior, we've discussed attraction, liking, and

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.180
love. We see that we tend to be attracted to people with average and

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.184
symmetrical faces. And on a side note, we tend to be attracted to be people and

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:16.480
gravitate towards people who are as attractive as we are ourselves. We also

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.110
discussed the fact that when choosing mates, we tend to select individuals who

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.355
are similar to us, in a variety of characteristics, such as ethnicity,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:28.942
socioeconomic status, even religious affiliation. And finally we talked about

00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:33.050
what is love, and the different types of love. Now we're going to end this

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.110
lesson with an interview with Dr Markie Blemer/g, who is going to talk to us

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.170
about two fast-growing areas of discussion in psychology. That's gender, as

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.070
well as technology and relationships.
