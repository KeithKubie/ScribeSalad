00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:01.983
- [Instructor] Erin was asked to find

00:00:01.983 --> 00:00:05.651
if f of x is equal to x squared
minus one to the 2/3 power

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:07.997
has a relative maximum.

00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:10.110
This is her solution.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.642
And then they give us her steps,

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:12.641
and at the end they say,

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:14.057
is Erin's work correct?

00:00:14.057 --> 00:00:16.425
If not, what's her mistake?

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:17.424
So pause this video

00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:18.864
and see if you can figure it out yourself.

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:20.605
Is Erin correct or did she make a mistake

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:22.207
and where was that mistake?

00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:23.647
Alright now let's just do it together.

00:00:23.647 --> 00:00:25.481
So she says that this is the derivative.

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:27.757
I'm just going to
reevaluate here to the right

00:00:27.757 --> 00:00:28.848
of her work.

00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:31.193
So let's see, f prime
of x is just going to be

00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:32.308
the chain rule.

00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:33.817
I'm gonna take the
derivative of the outside

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:34.909
with respect to the inside,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.463
so this is going to be 2/3 times

00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:39.971
x squared minus one to the

00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:43.570
2/3 minus one, so the negative 1/3 power,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.334
times the derivative of the inside

00:00:45.334 --> 00:00:46.820
with respect to x.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.910
So derivative of x squared
minus one with respect to x

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.998
is two x. (fire truck ringing)

00:00:51.998 --> 00:00:53.499
There's a fire hydrant, fire,

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.077
not a hydrant.

00:00:55.077 --> 00:00:58.398
That'd be a noisy hydrant,
there's a fire truck outside.

00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:00.116
But okay I think it's passed.

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:02.299
But this looks like what
she got for the derivative

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:05.480
because if you multiply two times two x,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.454
you do indeed get four x.

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:10.681
You have this three right
over here in the denominator,

00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:13.282
and x squared minus one
to the negative 1/3,

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.163
that's the same thing
as x squared minus one

00:01:15.163 --> 00:01:16.997
to the 1/3 in the denominator,

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:18.553
which is the same thing as the cube root

00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:20.387
of x squared minus one.

00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:22.640
So all of this is looking good.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.822
That is indeed the derivative.

00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:28.584
Step two, the critical
point is x equals zero.

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:29.629
So let's see,

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:32.508
a critical point is where
our first derivative

00:01:32.508 --> 00:01:34.551
is either equal to zero

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:36.502
or it is undefined.

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:39.497
And so it does indeed seem

00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:42.539
that f prime of zero is
going to be four times zero,

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.576
is going to be zero over three times

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:48.431
the cube root of zero
minus one, of negative one,

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:50.799
and so this is three times negative one,

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.471
or zero over negative three,

00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:53.934
so this is indeed equal to zero.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:55.350
So this is true.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.067
A critical point is at x equals zero,

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:00.644
but a question is, is this
the only critical point?

00:02:00.644 --> 00:02:02.665
Well a critical point as we mentioned

00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:04.754
is where the function equals zero

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:06.426
or where it is undefined.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.795
And this is the only one where
the function equals zero,

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.047
but can you find some
x-values where the function

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:12.487
is undefined?

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:14.135
Well what if we make the derivative,

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.457
what would make the
denominator of the derivative

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:18.036
equal to zero?

00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:20.381
Well if x squared minus
one is equal to zero,

00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:21.960
you take the cube root of zero,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.795
you're gonna get zero in the denominator.

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:27.138
So what would make x squared
minus one equal to zero?

00:02:27.138 --> 00:02:29.623
Well x is equal to plus or minus one,

00:02:29.623 --> 00:02:31.852
these are also critical
points because they make

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:34.019
f prime of x undefined.

00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:39.561
So I'm not feeling good about step two.

00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:42.394
It is true that a critical
point is x equals zero,

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:44.855
but it is not the only critical point.

00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:46.597
So I would put that there.

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:47.943
And the reason why it's important,

00:02:47.943 --> 00:02:48.942
you know you might say well,

00:02:48.942 --> 00:02:50.939
what's the harm in not noticing
these other critical points?

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.286
She identified one,

00:02:52.286 --> 00:02:54.631
maybe this is the relative maximum point.

00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:57.185
But as we talk about in other videos,

00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.530
in order to use the first
derivative test so to speak

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.293
and find this place where
the first derivative is zero,

00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:04.778
in order to test whether it is a maximum

00:03:04.778 --> 00:03:07.425
or a minimum point is
you have to sample values

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:10.049
on either side of it to make
sure that you have a change,

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.067
a change in sign of the derivative.

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:15.111
But you have to make sure that
when you test on either side

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.154
that you're not going beyond
another critical point

00:03:17.154 --> 00:03:19.337
because critical points
are places where you can

00:03:19.337 --> 00:03:21.218
change direction.

00:03:21.218 --> 00:03:23.075
And so let's see what
she does in step three

00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:24.538
right over here.

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:26.837
Well it is indeed in step
three that she's testing,

00:03:26.837 --> 00:03:29.345
she's trying to test values on either side

00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:32.712
of the critical point that she,

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.987
that the one critical
point that she identified.

00:03:34.987 --> 00:03:36.357
But the problem here,

00:03:36.357 --> 00:03:38.470
the reason why this is a little shady,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.721
is this is beyond another critical point

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.486
that is less than zero,

00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:45.390
and this is beyond, this is greater than,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.572
another critical point
that is greater than zero.

00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:49.639
This is larger than
the critical point one,

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.586
and this is less than the
critical point negative one.

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:57.255
What she should've tried is x equals 0.5

00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:59.879
and x equals negative 0.5.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.363
So this is what she shoulda done is try

00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:04.035
maybe negative two,

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.118
negative one,

00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:09.213
negative 1/2, zero,

00:04:09.213 --> 00:04:11.466
1/2, and then

00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:13.602
one, we know is undefined,

00:04:13.602 --> 00:04:15.251
and then positive two.

00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:17.247
Because this is a candidate critical,

00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:18.850
a candidate extremum,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.173
this is a candidate extremum,

00:04:20.173 --> 00:04:23.099
and this is a candidate
extremum right over here.

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.746
And so you wanna see in
which of these situations

00:04:25.746 --> 00:04:28.161
you have a sign change of the derivative,

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:29.415
and you just wanna test in the intervals

00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:31.342
between the extremum points.

00:04:31.342 --> 00:04:34.964
So I would say that really
the main mistake she made

00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:36.241
is in step two,

00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:39.401
is not identifying all
of the critical points.
