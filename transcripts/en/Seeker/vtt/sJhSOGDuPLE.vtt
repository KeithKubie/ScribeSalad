00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
What is sexy?

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.840
What do Angelina Jolie and George Clooney
have in common?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.840
Symmetry.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:12.200
According to some researchers, symmetry is
super sexy.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.919
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.190
Pair-bonding is a trademark of the human animal.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.160
We flirt, we fall in love, we marry.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.570
But what is it that attracts us to someone
else?

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.930
Is it their eyes?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.930
Their lips?

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.930
Their smell?

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.340
Well researchers keep looking for answers.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.430
While some say it’s all in the scent, that
humans responded largely to pheromones, or

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.710
chemicals released to signal things like fertility.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.380
We’ve covered that in an earlier episode,
check out the link to that video here.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.850
Or if you’re on mobile there’s a link
in the description.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.120
But what about looks?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.190
Well according to Tina Fey in her book bossypants,
a modern attractive women has to have so many

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.670
different attractive body parts, like a cut
and paste doll out of a magazine.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.710
But do all those individual pieces add up
to a sexy whole?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.100
Maybe not so.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.730
Recent research from Queen’s University
says humans’ attractiveness is based on

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.830
consistency of the whole, rather than attractive
individual parts.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.320
Basically the whole is greater than the sum
of its parts.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.860
The researchers said that older studies tend
to focus on individual features like face

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.080
shape or lip color.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.080
Things like that.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.040
So they wanted to try something a little different.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.580
In their study they focused on movement and
body shape.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.470
Yeah how sexy someone sashayed.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.380
The researchers showed participants dots based
on someone’s movement and shape and were

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.850
asked to rate their attractiveness.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.370
Then the researchers blended those movements
to create a hybrid “person”.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.310
The strange thing was that participants found
the hybrids to be less sexy.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.260
The researchers think that internal consistency
-- whether the movement and the shape match

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.700
each other or not, matters a whole lot.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.119
And that we can detect if anything seems…
well off.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.920
They say “Our visual system is a sensitive
lie detector that perceives even the slightest

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.060
inconsistencies and responds negatively to
them."

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.520
So what is sexy?

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.420
Well depends really on who you ask and even
their culture.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.990
But there is one consistent trait that most
cultures find sexy.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.619
Most studies repeatedly show that people find
symmetry attractive.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.840
Over 20 years ago, researchers from the University
of Albuquerque suspected that symmetry had

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.369
a lot to with sex appeal.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.380
They asked students to rank how attractive
faces were and found that those with higher

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.479
symmetry were at the top of the list.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.710
So why is symmetry sexy?

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.370
Well the idea is that symmetry somehow signals
genetic fitness or how likely you are to toss

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.950
your genes into the future.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.099
or it’s a sign of health, and they might
be on to something.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.950
The same researchers continued studying symmetry
and sex appeal, and a more recent study in

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.980
the journal Animal Behaviour found a link
between symmetry and oxidative stress.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.260
Oxidative stress can be caused by free radicals,
molecules produced as cells use oxygen.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.360
Sometimes these molecules can cause cell damage.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.620
If a person is exposed to oxidative stress
in the womb, it might mean a less symmetrical

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.620
face.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.760
And the researchers found results which suggested
just that.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.620
They found that men with low levels of oxidative
stress were more symmetrical and ranked as

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.390
highly attractive by women.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.140
Yet it might mean more than just good genes.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.099
One study published in the journal Psychonomic
Bulletin &amp; Review found that those with symmetrical

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.480
faces tended to be more extroverted and friendly,
character traits a lot of us like in our potential

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.480
mate.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.629
As for other physical traits like big lips,
round hips, or jaw size?

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.850
Well those really depend on culture.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.180
Women in wealthier nations prefer weaker jaws
and less masculine looking men for example.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.541
While these kinds of traits seem to be rated
as “sexy”, there’s some debate as to

00:03:12.541 --> 00:03:15.420
whether that’s the result of our culture
or our biology.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.420
So what do you think is sexy?

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:25.299
Tell us about it down in the comments below.
