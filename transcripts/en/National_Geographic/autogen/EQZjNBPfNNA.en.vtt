lot in acorns and I found out there was
 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.670
lot in acorns and I found out there was
a whole ecosystem within an acorn and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680
a whole ecosystem within an acorn and
 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.680

little things at its feet and these are
my newt plants and if you could blow

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:18.700
my newt plants and if you could blow
 

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.250
my newt plants and if you could blow
them up it would look something like a
