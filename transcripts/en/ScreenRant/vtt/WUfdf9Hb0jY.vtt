00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.330
It took a few years, but Captain America has
finally become the same iconic leader of the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.420
Marvel Universe on film as he has been in
the comics for decades.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.770
As Civil War stands poised to deliver the
most world-changing story in the MCU yet,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.380
that doesn't mean every great detail, secret,
or twist takes place in front of the cameras.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.840
There's no better time to run down some of
the coolest facts about Marvel's Captain America

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.050
to let fans appreciate the chaos and wars
behind the scenes.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.890
Here are 20 Captain America Secrets From Behind
The Scenes.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.800
Ending The War
The Civil War comic series had to be changed

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.289
for the movie, but in a weird twist of fate,
it's Avengers director Joss Whedon who actually

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.789
deserves credit for the comic's climactic
ending.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.730
Originally, Iron Man and Cap stopped fighting
when bystanders, like the readers, begged

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.989
them to, making the fight an unsatisfying
draw.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.800
The writers knew a more satisfying finish
was needed, so when Whedon came by, taking

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.789
a break from his own "X-Men" series, they
told him their problem, and he gave them their

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.210
new ending exactly as it appears.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.749
Or, in the words of writer Mark Millar: "the
bugger was there ten minutes and he solved

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:01.749
everything."

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.229
Redwing
The Falcon has upped his game since The Winter

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.710
Soldier, having added a recon drone to his
arsenal, which he refers to as 'Redwing.'

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.860
The name is a nod to his actual trained falcon
sidekick from the comics, since the directors

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.180
figured a bird he can telepathically communicate
with would be too hard to believe.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.540
Community Alums
The Russo Brothers may have taken the reins

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.720
of the Marvel Universe, but they haven't forgotten
where they came from.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.800
The duo made sure to give cameos to some friends
and Community alums in The Winter soldier,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.750
with DC Pierson a friend of Donald Glover
and Danny Pudi nabbing tiny roles.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.680
In Civil War, it's actor Jim Rash who gets
the nod, playing yet another annoying intellectual

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.970
vying for Tony Stark's attention.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.890
Launching Ant-Man
When the trailers highlighted the airport

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.971
showdown between the Avengers, it was Ant-Man
and Hawkeye combining their powers, with the

00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:43.310
archer firing Scott Lang into action on the
end of his arrow.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.110
It's a great idea, and one lifted straight
from the cover of The Avengers #223, released

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.470
in 1963.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.160
Sharing The Spotlight
Although it's a Captain America movie, Civil

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.240
War is pulling double duty, introducing both
Black Panther and the New Spider-Man - but

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.840
that wasn't the original plan.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.960
Panther's role was added to the story, and
made an even bigger part when Marvel thought

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.550
that Sony might not agree to let Spidey into
the MCU.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.110
By the time a deal was reached, Panther had
a serious part, which meant Spider-Man's role

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.280
had to be a smaller one.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.670
But that's still hard to actually complain
about.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.310
Audition Tapes
Spider-Man and Marvel's Punisher aren't likely

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.599
to cross paths on film, but the actors already
have.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.700
While filming the independent movie Pilgrimage,
actors Tom Holland and Jon Bernthal actually

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.420
recorded audition tapes for Marvel together,
hoping to land the roles of Spider-Man and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.580
The Punisher, respectively.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.870
When Holland joined Chris Hemsworth's In The
Heart of the Sea, he asked the Avenger to

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.640
put in a good word, sealing the deal, as Bernthal
joined Daredevil.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.560
Signing on RDJ
The original plan for Civil War was to have

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.480
Robert Downey Jr make a small appearance,
but knowing the story potential, he had his

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.970
sights set on a much bigger role - which meant
a much bigger paycheck.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.200
Having already delivered a massive paycheck
for The Avengers, the CEO of Marvel Entertainment

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.870
Ike Perlmutter refused the idea.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.780
Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige eventually
convinced the higher-ups that it really was

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.300
the way to go for Civil War, and the entire
structure of Marvel's movie and entertainment

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.680
chains of command were shifted as a result.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.170
Sneaky Double Cast
It's an unspoken, but official rule that no

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.810
actor can play two different characters in
the Marvel Universe.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.030
But when Robert Downey Jr. suggested his former
co-star Alfre Woodard for a smaller role in

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.200
Civil War, nobody checked with the TV side
of the MCU.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.430
Having already been cast as a completely different
character in Netflix's Luke Cage series, Woodard

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.190
introduces one of the MCU's biggest wrinkles
so far.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.280
A Real Ship&nbsp;
Cap showed he had adapted to modern military

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.110
when he singlehandedly took down a satellite
launching ship in The Winter Soldier's opening

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.110
scenes.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.780
The action is staged, but the ship isn't - it
really is a ship used to launch satellites

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.780
from the equator.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.320
When the production got access to the vessel,
the entire subplot involving satellites was

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.930
added to make the most of it.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.220
Aging Peggy Carter
There's good chance that some fans never realized

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.770
that the elderly Peggy Carter really was Peggy,
as in actress Hayley Atwell.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.630
It wasn't makeup, either, or CG aging, but
a combination of both.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.319
Atwell performed the scene in costume and
a grey wig, and an older actress performed

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.910
the same lines and movement.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.170
Digital artists then took the skin and muscle
movements from the older woman, pasted them

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.320
onto Atwell, and massaged them into the finished
effect.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.819
Chase Scene
The Nick Fury chase scene through city streets

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.360
was a hit with fans because it actually seemed
realistic - but they didn't know just how

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.580
realistic it was.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.810
The sequence was based on a 2010 Brazilian
police chase that looks exactly the same,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.510
and the directors even played the police video
as part of their original pitch to Marvel.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.610
Widow’s Plot Hole
Widow's showdown with the Winter Soldier ended

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.380
with her getting the upper hand, but it originally
would have caused a massive plot hole.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.129
The plan was for Widow to put her shoes beside
a car to ambush the villain, but when Scarlett

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.571
Johansson pointed out that her character would
be barefoot for the rest of the movie, the

00:04:26.571 --> 00:04:29.040
directors realized the mistake, and used a
phone instead.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040
Close one.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.630
Brubaker’s Cameo
Steve and Bucky's reunion lifts a few images

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.570
right from the comic, but that's not the only
tribute that Marvel paid to writer Ed Brubaker,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.800
who penned Bucky's return as the Winter Soldier.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.310
Look closely, and you can catch Brubaker's
cameo as one of the technicians overseeing

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.160
Bucky's brainwashing.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.910
Smelly Locations
Marvel tends to find unique locations for

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.800
their films, but none is stranger than Nick
Fury's hideout.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.490
The cement bunker is actually an old sewage
treatment plant that was a perfect backdrop

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.120
when location scouting was done in the winter.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.680
But when the crew arrived to film in the summer,
the warmer temperatures brought the smells

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.680
to life.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.280
Luckily, the audience can't tell - but the
cast sure could.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.060
Director Cameo
Sometimes it takes a director, not an actor,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.090
to know just what a tiny role needs to deliver.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.000
That, or they just want a cameo where it fits:
make sure you don't miss Nick Fury's doctor

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.180
giving Widow some treatment, since it's director
Joe Russo playing the part.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.680
Scrawny Soldier
It's still incredible to see how digital artists

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.080
turned Chris Evans into a scrawny soldier
in the First Avenger, but they had some help

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.500
from his small-scale body double Leander Deeny.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.901
Fans don't need to go digging, either: the
nicknames "Skinny Steve" appears in the film,

00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:30.830
as the bartender serving Cap and his Howling
Commandos.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.840
Evans and Johansson
By the time The Winter Soldier came around,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.180
actors Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson
had appeared together in four different films,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.620
the earliest being 2004's The Perfect Score.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.120
The two were so familiar as friends, they
actually wrote large portions of their own

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.100
dialogue drawing on their own personalities.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.580
Fake Headstone
It turns out the history of Nick Fury is a

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.280
secret even to the directors.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.480
When the former SHIELD director's birthdate
couldn't be shown, the directors needed to

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.470
put SOMETHING on his fake headstone at the
end of Winter Soldier.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.320
Remembering a certain Bible verse made famous
by Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction, their

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.790
problem was solved.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.360
The Winter Soldier
Everyone knows that Marvel loves to keep their

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.669
secrets - but apparently, that includes the
actors, too.

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.180
Sebastian Stan was probably a bit confused
when he was told that he'd be appearing in

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.100
The Winter Soldier, but had signed on for
nine film appearances after the First Avenger.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.741
It wasn't until the sequel was announced as
The Winter Soldier that he realized he would

00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.540
be playing the villain of the movie, paving
the way for an even bigger role in the MCU.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.259
Cap’s Shield
Director Joe Johnston first brought Cap to

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.970
the big screen, but he made sure to do some
spy work in a local comic book store during

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.970
pre-production.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.940
When he asked the clerk what was most important
to get right about the hero, the man claimed

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.600
it was the shield, certain that a movie would
upgrade it with guns or electrical attacks

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.940
instead of keeping it simple.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.190
As a joke, Johnston included those exact versions
for Cap to choose from, hoping the fans would

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.110
be groaning and rolling their eyes before
Cap spotted his classic weapon hiding underneath

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.110
the table.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.750
Those are some of the cooler secrets and stories
from behind the scenes of Marvel's Star-spangled

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.889
Man, but what cool details have we missed?
