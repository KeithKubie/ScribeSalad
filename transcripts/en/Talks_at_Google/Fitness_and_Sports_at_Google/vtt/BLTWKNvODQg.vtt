STEFAN SCHMAGER: Please
give a big round of applause

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.235
for Bastian Schweinsteiger.

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:46.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.526
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:52.755
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Thank you very much.

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:54.255
STEFAN SCHMAGER:
Welcome to Chicago.

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:55.260
Welcome to Google.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.570
I just said, [SPEAKING GERMAN],,
which is a way

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.537
to say, hi, in Bavaria.

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:00.120
Is that right?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.117
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
That's true.

00:02:03.117 --> 00:02:05.200
It's like I always say
when the people are asking,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.950
what does it mean?

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.850
I always say it's like
the Italians say, ciao.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.670
They say ciao for good
morning and ciao for goodbye.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.170
That's the same in Bavarian.

00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:15.090
STEFAN SCHMAGER: I'm
from Germany myself,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.910
so I'm very excited to have
Bastian here at Google.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.733
We'll be talking about a
few things around Chicago.

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:22.650
We're going to take a
look back at your career

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.410
and the hardships and
bumps along the way

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.020
and how we can look forward to
the next Chicago Fire season.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.800
So, in preparation
for this talk,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.030
we looked through your talks
on YouTube and we actually

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.950
saw that Ana, your wife--

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.020
former French Open champion and
former number one in tennis--

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.980
was at Mountain View.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.703
So I wonder, did you guys
talk about her experience

00:02:46.703 --> 00:02:47.370
at Google Talks?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.435
And what did she tell you
about Google and the culture?

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:53.700
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: Yes,
we were talking about it,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.880
and I remember she was saying
that she was very impressed how

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.040
big the complex is over there.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.950
And, also, she had a good chat
over there with the employees--

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.820
some of them also
are playing tennis,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.830
so that was also the subject.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.390
And also she was mentioning
that she played bowling

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.730
with the CEO, and
that she made--

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.160
she never played
before, but she made--

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.930
somehow she made a strike
with the first try.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.230
So, yeah, she had a
good time over there.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.355
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Very nice.

00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:26.430
So Ana is from Serbia, you
are from Germany originally.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.190
It seems that this
city-- this second city

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.960
has become somewhat
of a new home.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.810
Would you consider Chicago
as your second home

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.620
away from home?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.110
And what makes the
city so great for you?

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.600
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: Yes,
it's definitely our home

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.660
for right now--

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.200
where my wife and our
son is-- my family as.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.450
I call it our home.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.280
I must say when
we came over here,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.230
I'd never been to
Chicago before.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.820
I think once with
Manchester United,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.710
we came in, we played a game.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.040
It was kind of a
12-hour stay in Chicago,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.530
but I couldn't see the city.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.790
But when we came over
here, I still remember.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.320
I like the people on
the street like how they

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.570
were talking to each other.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.480
They had a kind of a humor
as well which I like a lot.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.540
And, of course, Chicago is a
big sports city as well, which

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.655
matches our family quite well.

00:04:20.655 --> 00:04:23.760
STEFAN SCHMAGER: I have this
weird memory about soccer

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.580
games, and I think you
came here for the preseason

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.990
game against Paris.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.120
So you played here
against Ibrahimovic,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.700
whom you played
again last Saturday.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.550
You guys both played
at Manchester United.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.120
Do you guys say hi?

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.740
Do you have a short chat or do
you guys meet after the game?

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.450
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yes, of course we say hi.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.277
But it's kind of
like in the game--

00:04:48.277 --> 00:04:49.110
it's actually funny.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.240
When you play with
a former teammate--

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.430
when you play
against each other,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.970
it's tricky because
he's a guy which--

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.070
I admire him a lot.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.410
He's one of these
players who think

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.220
about a third option when they
play football-- soccer, sorry.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.180
So you usually have some--
they pass the ball from here

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.505
to here.

00:05:10.505 --> 00:05:11.880
Then you have some
smart players,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.402
they already see
the second station.

00:05:13.402 --> 00:05:14.610
And some, they see the third.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.140
And you don't have many of
those players in the world,

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.600
and that's why it's very
tricky to play against him.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.540
But I always try to
be smarter than him,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.310
and that's kind of a
challenge on the field.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.885
And it's actually--

00:05:26.885 --> 00:05:28.260
I don't know why,
but actually it

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.400
was always working quite well,
but, at the end of the day,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.780
he always scored the final goal.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.940
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Yeah.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.232
It's amazing to see each other.

00:05:34.232 --> 00:05:35.970
You always see each other twice.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.460
If we take a step
back and look at 2015

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.390
when you signed with
the Fire, I wonder

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.180
after your stops in Munich
and in Manchester United,

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.060
what was it that you were
looking for at your new club?

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.850
What were factors
that you considered

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.215
before joining your next club?

00:05:52.215 --> 00:05:54.257
If you can tell us a little
bit about the process

00:05:54.257 --> 00:05:55.615
around the time.

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:57.990
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: Yes,
I remember that I was always

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.110
interested in the MLS.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.860
And then when the possibility
came up to play for Chicago,

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.600
I really was
straight interested,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.060
because I also like to
have challenges in life.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.690
And this is a huge opportunity
playing here for Chicago,

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.300
and also experience
a new life as well.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.130
It's different than
being in Europe.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.940
And the league, I must
say, it's very interesting.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.040
It's still a young
league, I have to say,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.550
but there's a huge potential
for soccer in America.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.980
And that were kind of
the first thoughts I had.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.930
OK, the Bulls also--

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.130
Chicago Bulls played also.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.150
STEFAN SCHMAGER: We'll
touch on American sports

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.048
later on as well.

00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:41.340
So you've been playing with
the Fire now for two years,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.010
and you said that you want to
help the team become better

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.860
and do your part to
elevate the Chicago Fire.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.720
If you look at those
past two seasons,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.145
where do you see the
achievements of your time here?

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:54.770
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: I think
especially in the first season,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.390
it went quite well for us.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.640
We learned new things--
tactically things.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.180
I tried to give as my experience
I luckily got in Europe--

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.360
tried to help every
guy in our team

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.940
to get better every single day.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.350
Sometimes it's just small
things which changes the games.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.800
And I love when we play
as a team on a good level.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.350
And I love to see
ideas on the field

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.970
where when you sit-in
the stands you're like,

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.910
oh, I couldn't see that coming.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.700
That's kind of my goal
where I try to work on it,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.350
try to help the team
as much as possible.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.740
We had, unfortunately last
year, not our best season.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.830
We had a lot of injured players
from the beginning on which

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.010
doesn't make it easier for us.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.620
But now I think we
have a good team.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.730
We are very motivated
for this season.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:55.100
And I also must say
I love the crowds.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.130
The people in the stadium,
they are very passionate,

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.250
but still fair.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.495
And that's really nice.

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:02.870
And, yeah, I just
hope that we're

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.110
going to have a healthy
team and also success.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.780
STEFAN SCHMAGER: I
truly do not hope,

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.960
but this might be your
last season, possibly.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.800
What do you want achieve this
season with the Chicago Fire?

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.390
What's your goal
for this season?

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.390
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
First of all, I always--

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.790
I did the last two
years the same.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.970
I signed a one-year deal.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.020
And, at the end of the
day after the season,

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.440
I spoke with my wife, and
then she says, yes or no.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.510
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Happy
wife, happy life, right?

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.843
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: Exactly.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.270
But my goal for this season is--

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.700
our goal is to qualify
for the playoffs

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.880
and be competitive when we
play against a little bit

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.140
better teams.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.400
I still believe we can beat
everyone in this league

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.430
if we work on our small details.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.360
We have to improve.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.590
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Very cool.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.840
If we take a look at Major
League Soccer in total

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.540
as a league, you've
played for the Bundesliga

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.882
and for the Premier
League in the UK.

00:09:01.882 --> 00:09:03.590
How would you compare
Major League Soccer

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.330
with those two top leagues--

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.330
both from an aspect
on the field,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.420
but maybe also off the field if
you can draw a few comparisons.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.170
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yes, on the field,

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.560
I have to say it's a very
physical league-- the MLS.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.440
It's kind of close, I would
say, to the Premier League

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.650
than the Bundesliga.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.680
Some teams are
tactically really good.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.590
They try to do some new
things on the field,

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.420
and it's really
interesting to see.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.060
Off the field, I
must say-- which

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:42.180
I love-- is you don't
have hooligans, let's say.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.290
So there is no trouble off
the field, so that's really

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:49.230
a fair audience always when
you play away or at home.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.980
Of course, everyone
wants to win,

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.830
but there's nothing happening
around the stadium, which

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.910
I love, because you can
go with your family,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.310
with your kids to the
stadium and have a good.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.935
Time and I think
that's very important.

00:09:59.935 --> 00:10:01.980
STEFAN SCHMAGER:
Yeah, definitely.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.730
I would like to talk to you
about that picture over there--

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.310
we see you with the
World Cup in your hands.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.360
An amazing day of your life, an
amazing day for me in my life

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.263
as well.

00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:18.596
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: I'm
glad I could make you happy.

00:10:18.596 --> 00:10:20.846
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Unfortunately,
I was here in Chicago.

00:10:20.846 --> 00:10:22.770
I couldn't celebrate
back home, but it

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.187
was quite all right-- my wife
took really good care of me.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.750
If you think back
of that final day,

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.050
you guys won that
semifinal against Brazil--

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.410
another day that a lot of
people will never forget.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.690
If you could describe
your thoughts and emotions

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.520
around the World Cup Final--

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.980
if you can take us back
to that day and kind of

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.640
describe your emotions.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.440
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
You should not

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.828
forget that that was 2014.

00:10:51.828 --> 00:10:53.870
But when I started playing
for the national team,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.890
I started 2004.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.180
And actually every
tournament we had--

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.120
and we had some in between--

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.480
we always played the
semifinal or the final,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.210
but we never lifted
this golden capsule.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.990
And then when we played the
game in the Maracana Stadium

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.420
in Rio de Janeiro and
you have the chance

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.380
to win the World
Cup as a first team

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.950
from Europe in
South America, that

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.510
motivates as well a little bit.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:31.830
But finals are very
difficult to play.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.210
I remember that Argentine--

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:34.710
Argentine?

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.487
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Argentina.

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:38.820
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: They
had also very good chances,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.070
you know?

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.380
And they could score a goal,
and it would be different.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.930
But what I remember quite
well was when we finally

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.880
scored the goal, it was
like three minutes before--

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.930
it was in extra
time, minute 117.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.750
It was very tough, the
minutes after that goal,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.740
because I remember
when this goal happened

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.930
and when they put the
ball back in the kick off,

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.590
I had some tears in my eyes.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.830
And you get so emotional.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.500
And there was one
long ball and I

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.710
couldn't see the ball clearly,
so I had to do this and this.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.540
So that was not easy.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.000
But it's worked out--
everything, the hard work,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.290
which is where we
started 2004 until 2014.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.950
Sometimes you have to wait,
and there was a kind of moment

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:25.150
there.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.010
STEFAN SCHMAGER: You
mentioned that journey.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.950
The World Cups
before in 2006, you

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.710
were eliminated in the
semifinal against Italy.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.810
Four years later in
an amazing World Cup

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.550
that the German
national team played,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.430
eliminated yet again in the
semifinal against Spain.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.910
And then once you were so
close to that final World Cup--

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.100
the last three minutes--

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.800
did you have some sort of doubt
that this may slip away again?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.370
Or are you truly
focused, and do you truly

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.213
believe this time
we're going to get it?

00:12:53.213 --> 00:12:55.380
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: I
always believe in winning.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.810
And I never give up.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:03.250
And that's my personal
character towards the game.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.200
And even if we would
have been down 1-0, 2-0,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.540
you fight until the end because
in football-- in soccer--

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.930
everything is possible
even in 3, 4 minutes.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.310
You can change the game.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.100
And that's my mindset
in every game.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:24.270
But, of course, I also knew that
maybe this is my last chance

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.710
to win the trophy.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.520
And I asked myself,
how many times are you

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.340
going to play the
World Cup Final more?

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.398
And it's not four or five times.

00:13:33.398 --> 00:13:35.940
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Can I tell you
a secret around the World Cup

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.450
from my perspective?

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.387
So your good friend,
Lukas Podolski, he's

00:13:39.387 --> 00:13:40.720
been one of my favorite players.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.000
So, since 2006, I had his jersey
for every major tournament--

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.270
2006, 2008, all the way to 2014.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.640
And, before we made it--

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.756
before you guys made
it to the final.

00:13:51.756 --> 00:13:54.231
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
It's OK, it's OK.

00:13:54.231 --> 00:13:56.490
STEFAN SCHMAGER: I told
my wife and my friends,

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.340
I'm going to get the jersey
with the golden patch

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:04.500
of the player that's going
to score the final goal.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.860
It was not you, and,
yet, I bought your jersey

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.620
because I think that was
a magnificent performance

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.690
in the Final--

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.772
a lot of pressure by
the Argentines and just

00:14:14.772 --> 00:14:15.730
an amazing performance.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.910
So, there's five Podolski
jerseys and one Schweinsteiger

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.050
jersey.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.800
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Thank you so much.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.175
STEFAN SCHMAGER: So when we
talk about this achievement--

00:14:24.175 --> 00:14:26.550
the World Cup-- there is
another great achievement,

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.730
which is the Champions League
with Bayern Munich in 2013.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.320
In my opinion, a similar track--

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.500
the team took many attempts
to make it to the Final--

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.090
lost the Final in 2010,
yet another Final in 2012,

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.800
but then lift the trophy,
ultimately, in 2013

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.690
in another legendary stadium
at Wembley in London.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.742
How did your emotions compare
to the World Cup there?

00:14:53.742 --> 00:14:55.950
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: It
was a little bit different

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.712
because I remember
that we played 2012--

00:14:59.712 --> 00:15:01.920
the Champions League Final
in our hometown in Munich.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.837
And when you play in
front of your home crowd,

00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:06.270
you don't want to
lose the final,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:11.120
but we did in a very
unlucky way, I must say.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.660
But we lost the final,
so the team was down.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.580
And then to stand up and
straighten the next year

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.250
and to lift, then, the trophy,
that meant a lot for me--

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.540
but also we as a group,
we stick together.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.650
And I always say that
this kind of defeat

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.780
against Chelsea at
home 2012 was kind

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.750
of the base for the next steps--

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.120
2013 winning of the
Champions League

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.190
and also 2014 winning
the World Cup.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.020
But 2013 when we played
the Champions League Final

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.250
and we won it, finally
we played the final

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.250
against Borussia Dortmund,
which is the biggest

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.420
rivalry for us in Germany.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.420
And if we would
have lost this game,

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.030
that would be
very, very painful.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.290
And in the first 20 minutes
when we played this game,

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.110
there was a lot of
pressure in our game.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.410
And at half time, I asked
Thomas Muller and Phillip Lahm--

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.470
I asked them, guys, did you
also feel something the first 20

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.970
minutes?

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.703
Some heaviness on your back?

00:16:20.703 --> 00:16:22.870
And they said, yes, my legs
were completely blocked,

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.520
I couldn't move.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.100
It's happening-- these
kind of pressure situations

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.210
and we feel that.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.160
Luckily, we could get rid
of it and we won the game.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.210
It's almost the same like in the
World Cup-- in the last minute,

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.980
we scored a goal,
which is always better,

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.450
because then the other team--

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.880
they don't have 30
minutes more to play.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.150
They only have
five, six minutes.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.460
So that was the story about
Champions League Final.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.190
STEFAN SCHMAGER: So you talked
about pressure, especially

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.900
with those last finals prior
to the Champions League title.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.640
Your wife Ana at
Mountain View talked

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.370
about mental preparedness
and tenants that it helps her

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.440
a lot prepare for the games.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.180
I wonder if mental
training has been a success

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.410
factor in your career.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.190
Can you tell us a bit about
any type of mental training

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.480
that you would do personally,
or maybe even with the team?

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.220
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
So we had mental coaches

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.220
in our clubs, especially
in Munich and also

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.810
in the national team.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.339
I know that some of the players
used-- or the staff members are

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.569
used to the guys over there.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:33.660
I, personally, I think that
I kind of know what I want

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.400
and I'm kind of strong in a way.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.340
But I also know where
I'm weak, so I can really

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.650
adjust to it quite well.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.370
And, of course, sometimes
also talk to the guy,

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.700
but not as intensive
maybe than other players,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.170
but we definitely
have the options.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:54.130
And I think it's good to have,
because you have players--

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.070
they need someone to
talk to and maybe you

00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:00.220
don't have a family or
environment around you,

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.640
which is ideal for you.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.540
And I think nowadays in
sport on this high level,

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.890
you need to have also help
a little bit on the side as

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.610
well--

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.322
even if you are a
tough guy, you know?

00:18:14.322 --> 00:18:17.290
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Very good.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.710
I want to touch on one
more thing with regards

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.990
to those finals that you won.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.580
Prior to winning
those finals, I think

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.620
there was a notion in
the media that, yet

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.740
again, that golden generation
is losing another final.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.840
So players like you were
almost proclaimed as failed--

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.750
like that they can't make it.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.090
Yet these days, we
have this philosophy

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.337
with failure as
postponed success.

00:18:42.337 --> 00:18:44.670
And, in soccer, I think it's
a lot about trophies, a lot

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.320
about the titles that you win.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.360
Do you think that, in
professional soccer,

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.940
there is more of a
movement towards that idea

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.330
that we should celebrate failure
a little more, because that's

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.358
going to ultimately
lead us to success?

00:18:56.358 --> 00:18:57.900
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yes, exactly.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.250
So I remember in
my career, as you

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.490
said we lost some
games on a big stage--

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.470
finals and semi-finals.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.320
We fell down many times,
but it's very important

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.940
to stand up and try to
follow your dreams, you know?

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.980
And having your goals in
your mind and being ready--

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.500
and sometimes you have
those kind of moments--

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.570
not only in sport,
also maybe private--

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.350
where it's not easy
to handle your life.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.280
But you only have
one, and you should

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.820
try to make the best out of it.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:40.140
And that's why this was my
mindset is like, you can fall

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.640
down, that's not a
problem, but it's

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.640
more important to get
up and look forward.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.710
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Your
position is midfield.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.892
It's a leading
position on the field,

00:19:49.892 --> 00:19:51.600
but I would also
describe you as a leader

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.920
off the field for your team.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.420
You've been leader
of Bayern Munich,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.578
at the German national team.

00:19:57.578 --> 00:20:00.120
I think that we are a product
of the people that we work with

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.110
and that we live with.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.440
You've worked with many players,
many coaches at both Bayern

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.060
Munich and the national team.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.970
Who would you say are key
figures that shaped the leader

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.010
that you are?

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.180
And what are lessons that
you learned from them

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.770
along the way?

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.065
If you don't want to name
anyone, that's fine too.

00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:18.190
I think the lesson piece
is the more important one.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.280
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
I mean, I

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.070
was lucky to play with big
players during my career.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:30.990
And I had several guys like
Oliver Kahn guy, for example--

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:36.420
very much believing in his
qualities and fighting,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:41.970
motivated, extra hours
after the training session.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.620
But I always tried
to kind of get

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.933
from every great player or
leader some small things.

00:20:50.933 --> 00:20:53.350
I like some things off this
guy, some things off this guy,

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:58.290
and I tried to add
it a little bit.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.230
But being your own person,
that's very important.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.040
And I think that you have--

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.250
as a leader, I mean, leader
is a strong word in my eyes.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.990
But you can not
lead a group alone.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.170
You have no chance.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.690
So you need a ton--

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:21.190
more players, 5, 6 players who
play with the same tongue--

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.480
who speak with the same tongue.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.330
And that was very
important for me.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.300
And, still, you have
to be a human guy.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.600
Players are not
robots, you know?

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.300
They also have a
human side, and you

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.080
have to also see that
different players have

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.290
a different environment.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.580
They grew up in a different
country, different mentality.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.680
And you all have--

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.700
you have to seal all these
facts around the players,

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.070
and that's very complex.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.320
But if you want to
achieve something,

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.200
you have to be aware of
those kind of things as well.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.710
STEFAN SCHMAGER:
Definitely, yeah.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.550
So if I ask that same question
to one of the young players

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.970
on your team--

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.828
what is Bastian's
leadership style like--

00:22:04.828 --> 00:22:05.620
what would you say?

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.925
What are the pillars
of you and the team?

00:22:09.925 --> 00:22:11.800
What's important to you
to bring to the team?

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.300
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
I would love

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.120
some young player would sit
here and give you the answer.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.510
I would say that I'm focused.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.530
If I do something, I want
to do it in the right way.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.350
It's kind of a German
way I think as well--

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:34.280
being on time, disciplined,
motivated, focused.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.720
But also having a smile on
your face is very important,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.440
I think.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.330
We have some sessions
where we want to work

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.300
and we want to get
better, but then it's

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.010
also important to have some
funny moments as well where you

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.880
can laugh and have share of
some funny jokes as well.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.530
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Yeah, awesome.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.395
So here at Google--

00:22:54.395 --> 00:22:56.520
just to divert a little
bit-- we here at Google, we

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.630
care about technology,
we love technology.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.240
You played your
first game in 2002.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.630
I looked up the best-selling
or the most-selling device

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.340
at that point was
a cell phone that

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.280
had a color display
for the first time.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.920
Now in 2019, we
talk to speakers,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.660
we talk to our cell phones.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.490
And I would imagine
that in soccer, there

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.710
has been a similar
transformation

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.360
around technology.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.900
I wonder how technology,
both during training,

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.440
or in preparation for the game,
maybe even after the game,

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.057
has made a difference
in your career.

00:23:28.057 --> 00:23:30.140
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yes, throughout the years,

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.960
it became more and
more important.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.070
And you analyze everything--

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:42.700
how many sprints you make,
and how long you can run,

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.200
which distance you
can cover-- which

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.400
is, for me, sometimes weird.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.840
Because when a guy covers, let's
say, you run 14 kilometers.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.170
It averages around
11, 12 kilometers--

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.892
sorry I don't know
in miles exactly.

00:23:56.892 --> 00:23:59.256
STEFAN SCHMAGER: I still
don't get that right either.

00:23:59.256 --> 00:24:01.680
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: But
maybe of your 14 kilometers,

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.990
you run seven wrong.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.820
So using your energy
for the right things,

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.975
that is very important.

00:24:08.975 --> 00:24:10.350
And I think it's
going to be more

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.313
and more important for
the next years as well.

00:24:12.313 --> 00:24:13.980
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Is
it important for you

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.688
to look at those
statistics after a game?

00:24:15.688 --> 00:24:17.940
Does it help you improve
for the next game,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.640
or does it give you any
guidance going forward?

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.200
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Some things

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.890
are important-- for example,
all the positioning wise.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:30.750
Like maybe the goalkeeper cannot
run more than the fullback,

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.580
but the fullback can maybe run
more on a high intensity than

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.250
a center back.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:39.480
So there are some stats
where you can kind of compare

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.380
to the top teams in,
let's say, Europe,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.640
and I think that's
definitely a good thing.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.680
But sometimes have
lots of games where

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.570
you lead in all the stats and
everything, but, at the end,

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.330
you lose 1-0, you know?

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.540
So it's like both sides of it.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.370
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Very cool.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.120
So I could go on and
on with my questions.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.180
I could have a whole day
conversation with you,

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.070
but I also want to
make sure that we can--

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.980
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: My
wife wouldn't like that.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.290
STEFAN SCHMAGER: I know.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:08.640
She would give the thumbs down.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.980
I also want to make sure that
the audience is able to address

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.938
a few questions to you.

00:25:11.938 --> 00:25:14.610
So I can encourage you
to speak to the mic.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.770
The mic is actually over there.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.360
If you want a head
over there and let

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.860
us know about your questions.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.270
Chicago Fire was so generous to
provide swag-- a few giveaways.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.190
There's even tickets
involved, so I

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.578
would encourage you
to step up to the mic

00:25:28.578 --> 00:25:30.620
ask a great question, and
then, afterwards, we're

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.470
going to raffle out
prizes so to speak.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.900
So why don't we start with
the gentleman over there?

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.440
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.530
I'm curious-- when you
came up with Bayern Munich,

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.480
I remember you
were a wide player.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.060
And then I think it was
Louis van Gaal who moved

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.370
you to play center midfield.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:47.850
Because I remember watching you
when you were young because you

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.142
always used to beat Man United.

00:25:49.142 --> 00:25:50.414
It was horrible.

00:25:50.414 --> 00:25:52.414
And then you moved to
play center midfield, then

00:25:52.414 --> 00:25:54.956
all of a sudden, you were the
most dominant center midfielder

00:25:54.956 --> 00:25:55.590
in Europe.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.090
What was that
transition like for you?

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.718
And how did you make
that look so easy?

00:25:59.718 --> 00:26:01.260
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
It's actually

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.130
easy to give you the
answer, because I actually

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.530
grow as a midfield player.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.960
So at Bayern Munich
in the youth teams--

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.150
so when I joined
the club at 14 13,

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.450
I started always to play
as a midfield player.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.940
But as soon as I came
up to the second team

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.880
and to the first team,
they put me wide.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.690
You know why?

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:26.460
Because in the midfield
players were like huge players.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.280
We had Michael Ballack, and
it's not easy as a young player

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.080
to step in that role
immediately where

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.520
you have a lot of
responsibility,

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.985
because, in soccer,
if this is the field,

00:26:35.985 --> 00:26:37.480
a midfield player plays here.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.420
So you're always
close to the action,

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.480
and there you have to have
a player who is experienced

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.520
who understands the
game quite well.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.580
But I was very lucky
when and I was happy

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.230
when Louis van Gaal
changed me into the center

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.415
midfield position, because--

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.140
I shouldn't compare
it with my life--

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.090
my private life-- but I
like to be in control.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:06.860
So I like to just
dominate the game.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.440
And I don't like when
someone else tells me--

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.990
not tells me-- but if the other
opponent dominates the game

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.070
and I have to
follow their ideas.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:19.290
I want to give the ideas
and that's how it is--

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.646
at home, I'm different.

00:27:23.562 --> 00:27:26.910
AUDIENCE: I read a book
called "The Captain Class,"

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.370
and the German team
is featured in it--

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.040
especially Philipp
Lahm is a case study.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.250
And they talk specifically
about the controversy

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:39.030
around when he challenged the
board of the team and some

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.302
of the surrounding
fallout from that.

00:27:41.302 --> 00:27:43.260
Can you talk about maybe
some leadership skills

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.130
you learned from Philipp and
maybe around that time period

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.420
when I think the
board was like--

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.300
I don't know the full
details, but specifically

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.025
around some of the
controversy that he stirred.

00:27:57.025 --> 00:27:58.650
The book is called
"The Captain Class,"

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:03.030
and they do a case study on
the German team from 2010-2014,

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.050
and it's specifically around
the impact that Philipp Lahm.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.845
Can you talk about some
of the leadership skills

00:28:08.845 --> 00:28:09.720
you learned from him?

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.520
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
About his leadership?

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.660
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Yeah,
how did you play together

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.170
with Philipp Lahm.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:13.712
What do you--

00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:16.110
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
I didn't read the book.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.600
But Philipp Lahm-- it
was actually funny.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.350
The first game I played
with Bayern Munich

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.230
was the same time when Philipp
Lahm played his first game.

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:26.710
So it was 2002 in November--

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.260
I remember quite well.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.820
And so I-- and also we
know us from the youth,

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.200
so I know him as a person,
and and he's a great person.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.410
He was a great football
player as well.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.560
But what maybe is a little bit--

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.040
and what matches quite well--

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.220
we both kind of like,
in a way, are different.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.510
But together, we were kind
of really very strong.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.920
And we trust each other a lot.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.860
And on the field, we could
play the balls like this,

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.060
and so it was not
a problem at all.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.810
And I'm quite sure that
although Philipp will take over

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:07.680
soon a very important position
in the German Football

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.570
Association.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.970
AUDIENCE: So one of the things
that's happening at Google

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.560
right now is it's review season.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.260
So we're all kind of doing
our self evaluations,

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.692
we're evaluating peers.

00:29:17.692 --> 00:29:19.650
And I'm curious how you
evaluate your own game.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.470
What are things that you think
you are really strong at,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.565
and what's something that
you might want to work on?

00:29:26.565 --> 00:29:28.920
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
There are always--

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.510
everyday I think that
I can get better.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:36.480
And when I see something
not happening like I want--

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.330
like my brain sometimes
wants something,

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.780
but I cannot give it or
bring it on the field,

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.680
it makes me angry.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.790
And so, for example--

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:52.200
I mean, now I'm 34 years
old, which is not old.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.660
But, in soccer, you
say it's kind of old.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.225
But I told you before,
it's not about the age,

00:29:57.225 --> 00:29:59.970
it's about how many
games you played, right?

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:04.230
And so I try to be
still physically strong.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.150
My body is very
important and I know

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.670
exactly what I need to eat,
what I need for the games, what

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.940
I need for training
sessions, so that

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.760
became through the career
even more important.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.860
And on the field,
I just try to think

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:26.400
about ideas which other teams,
players don't have right now.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.110
So to create something new--

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.670
of course, it's a
game, 11 against 11.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.180
It's not one against
11, but I try

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:41.800
to find something where soccer
becomes easier for my team.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.240
So if I can compare, for
example with Pep Guardiola

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.220
at Manchester City--

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.820
so, of course, Pep Guardiola,
he was a coach at Barcelona,

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.490
Bayern Munich, and Manchester
Ciy, which are great clubs.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.620
But everywhere he has success,
and he dominates the games.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.340
And it's not a surprise.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.280
There is a plan
behind their ideas

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.960
which are very fascinating
to watch and see.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.900
And it makes me happy to see
some-- when I watch these games

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:16.190
and I see some new movements or
new ideas and new tactical ways

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:19.700
how to play the other team,
that's what I'm looking for.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.220
STEFAN SCHMAGER: It seems
you like the idea of coaching

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:23.720
as well.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.430
Is this something
that you can see

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.700
yourself doing in the future?

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.105
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: I
always say, no, because--

00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:30.890
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Your wife.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.348
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
No, no, no.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.960
No, no, no, as a coach, you
can get sacked, you know?

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.982
As a player, it's impossible.

00:31:43.982 --> 00:31:46.190
STEFAN SCHMAGER: One more
question from the audience.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:49.046
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
My wife is OK.

00:31:49.046 --> 00:31:53.030
AUDIENCE: Speaking about your
wife, I know you have a--

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.710
your son is almost
turning one-year-old.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.000
But let's say he becomes--

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.510
imagine the situation.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.010
He's a teenager now,
he's either asked

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.063
to play soccer or tennis--

00:32:02.063 --> 00:32:03.240
what does he play?

00:32:07.551 --> 00:32:10.470
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: I mean,
he's born here in Chicago,

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.950
so there are other
options as well, right?

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:17.420
Play basketball or for the
Blackhawks, you never know.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.430
So I leave it up to him.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:25.190
AUDIENCE: Hi, Bastian, it's
an absolute honor meeting you.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.550
I had two favorite players--

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.760
one is you and second is Messi.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.375
So welcome--

00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:32.052
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:32.052 --> 00:32:34.260
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Sorry, what was the question?

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.010
AUDIENCE: I haven't
asked my question yet.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.730
I have two questions.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.030
First is in a football match,
there is a lot of drama,

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.530
a lot of things
change very quickly.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.310
One minute you're losing,
then you win-- penalty.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:51.060
So during a match, how do
you keep your calm and peace

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.220
so that you're able
to play effectively?

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.890
And my second question is
of the current players,

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.113
who is your favorite player?

00:32:57.113 --> 00:32:58.530
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
The second

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.150
was of all the Italian players?

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.692
STEFAN SCHMAGER:
The current players.

00:33:01.692 --> 00:33:02.833
Current players.

00:33:02.833 --> 00:33:04.500
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Current players.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.875
I mean, there are
many out there,

00:33:05.875 --> 00:33:10.920
but when I recently watched
Juventus Turin, I liked--

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:16.620
you probably-- do you
know Leonardo Bonucci?

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.780
So I like this kind of player.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.840
Of course Ronaldo and Messi
are amazing how many goals they

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.770
score and everything, but I
personally think that also

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:26.850
players like--

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.530
I always say Manuel
Neuer and Frank Ribery,

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.090
for me, were the best
players I played with.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.910
Different position--
goalkeeper sounds weird

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:39.810
that I would say so, but
the goalkeeper position

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.970
is very important and
the center back position

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.080
is also important.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.727
STEFAN SCHMAGER: It's surprising
that you mention defenders.

00:33:45.727 --> 00:33:48.060
Is this a position you would
have liked to play or could

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.030
you see yourself playing
as a central defender?

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.780
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
I mean, you always

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.280
drop-- as a midfield
player, you come

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.488
into these kind of positions.

00:33:54.488 --> 00:33:57.270
But I think when
you have the ball,

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.330
the game starts many
times in the back--

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.240
so with the goalkeeper
or with the center back.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.510
And I was asking recently
when a friend of mine--

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:10.020
because we both are watching
the NHL-- and I was asking like,

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:16.110
did ever a player won the
MVP award as a defender

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.100
or goalkeeper?

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.199
And he said, it never happened.

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:23.739
And I'm questioning, actually,
why it's never happening.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:26.880
And maybe it will
change one day,

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.949
because I think
defenders or goalkeepers

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:31.690
or midfield players, they're
doing also a great job.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.300
It's not always about who
puts the ball in the net.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.280
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Yeah.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.989
You mentioned, if I can
interrupt the audience

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.447
questions for one moment-- you
mentioned the Chicago sports

00:34:39.447 --> 00:34:40.770
teams early on.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:44.610
You associate Chicago with
Michael Jordan and the Bulls.

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.710
You're very active
in the sports scene--

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:50.310
you like to go to see the
Bulls, to see the Blackhawks.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.525
What is your favorite Chicago
team and what do you like--

00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:54.900
what do you find
most interesting

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.989
about that particular sport?

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.531
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: So my
favorite team, it's easy to say

00:34:58.531 --> 00:34:59.970
is the Fire.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:03.540
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Except
for soccer, yeah.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.450
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
But I must say,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.500
I had never been at an
American football game

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.240
before in my life, and I really
enjoyed watching the Bears--

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.870
especially last season.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:17.670
But also the other sports is
very interesting to watch.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.735
Ice hockey, for
example, even baseball--

00:35:21.735 --> 00:35:22.860
I'd never experienced that.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.360
So my wife is a huge fan of
the Blackhawks-- huge fan.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.082
And I must say I also
like ice hockey a lot.

00:35:31.082 --> 00:35:32.790
STEFAN SCHMAGER: So
the Blackhawks it is.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.207
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: Yes,
there's only one team, right?

00:35:40.061 --> 00:35:42.120
AUDIENCE: Why did
you pick Chicago Fire

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.142
and of other teams?

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:45.725
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Good question.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.620
Because I actually was in the
kind of a moment in my life

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:57.580
where I tried to
do something else.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.820
And, in Europe, I
always wanted to lift

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.320
the Champions League with Bayern
Munich-- that was my dream.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.210
And then when that happened,
I had always Manchester United

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.570
in my head, in my
brain to play for.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:12.860
And that happened as well.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.190
And then I didn't want to play
for a different Cloud in Europe

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.300
and I wanted to
move somewhere else.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.770
And I think Chicago
is a great city--

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:22.910
as I mentioned before.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.730
And I had good talks as
well with our President,

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.590
Nelson Rodriguez.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.370
And also the owner--

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:33.050
at that time, it was
owner, now we have two.

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.920
And that was the reason
why I actually decided

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.417
to come over to Chicago.

00:36:38.417 --> 00:36:39.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.250
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
You're welcome.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.345
AUDIENCE: Chicago Fire
just signed Nicolas Gaitan.

00:36:45.345 --> 00:36:46.970
I was wondering if
you had any thoughts

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:49.265
into how he'll fit into what
you guys are trying to do?

00:36:49.265 --> 00:36:50.640
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yes, that

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.430
was just like 15 minutes ago.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:56.540
Now one hour and 15 minutes
ago, I got the information.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:02.510
I know him quite well from the
Benfica Lisbon time over there.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.400
But I never played
against him, but he looks

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.910
like a very talented player.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.560
I hope he can help us to
achieve our goals which we have.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.740
And I think he's a
very good player.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.290
AUDIENCE:
[GERMAN SPEECH],, Bastian.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:18.750
Thank you for making us
world champions, by the way.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.120
I joined that with the speaker.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.230
I moved with my son
recently to Chicago as well,

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.010
and I wanted to
ask you privately

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:29.075
what do you enjoy most about
the city outside of football.

00:37:29.075 --> 00:37:31.350
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
I enjoy the most of--

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.750
I walk a lot with my family
around the Lincoln Park area--

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:39.410
the zoo.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:44.540
My son loves these animals,
and elephants, and stuff.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:49.370
But I also like a lot that
here is a lake close by

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:52.580
and you can take, for
example, the bikes

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.050
and then go along the lake.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.400
That's beautiful-- and
very nice restaurants,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.590
I think, here as well.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.420
And what else do I like?

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.687
I love the botanical garden.

00:38:04.687 --> 00:38:05.270
Have you been?

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:06.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.260
We just went last weekend.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.530
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Here we go.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.030
STEFAN SCHMAGER: How
about Chicago deep dish?

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.326
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: I
love the trees over there.

00:38:12.326 --> 00:38:14.680
STEFAN SCHMAGER: How about
Chicago deep dish pizza?

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.622
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: I tried
it once, but it is too much.

00:38:18.622 --> 00:38:20.830
STEFAN SCHMAGER: For the
first time when you have it,

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:22.160
you think you can
eat a whole pizza,

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.300
but then you
realize really quick

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.250
that once slice is enough.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.246
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
That's true.

00:38:25.246 --> 00:38:26.788
AUDIENCE: I was
actually lucky enough

00:38:26.788 --> 00:38:30.080
to see you play against the
United States in Brazil.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.060
During that game, you
actually subbed out,

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.310
so I'm not really sure if
you guys were trying or not.

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.040
You're one of my
favorite players,

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.320
but question about the different
leagues you've been a part of.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.530
Obviously, two of the top
leagues in the world--

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.577
MLS is, obviously,
up and coming.

00:38:44.577 --> 00:38:45.660
We'll go back to your son.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.013
Let's say he turns into
this amazing soccer player

00:38:48.013 --> 00:38:49.430
and he gets to
that age where he's

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:53.480
10, 11, 12-- you can get picked
up by these clubs very early.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.640
Would you encourage
him to stay with MLS

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.920
or seek something
across maybe in Europe?

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.120
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
It's a lot of, if.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.160
For me, first of all,
I think that the MLS--

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.880
if the people who
work for the MLS

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:17.600
are making the right decisions,
you can create a huge league.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.570
I know that all the
players in Europe,

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.520
they come over to
the United States

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.560
and then go for vacations in
a lot of cities over there.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.360
And if you can somehow
use the opportunity

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.090
and use the potential
which you have here

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:37.070
to create a great
league, you can

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.570
even up with the leagues
in Europe, I think.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.300
And, of course, it takes
some years, for sure.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:46.730
But there's a
chance if my son is

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:50.810
going to be in MLS or
Europe, I don't know that.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:51.860
I also don't know if--

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.115
maybe he gets the talent--

00:39:58.972 --> 00:40:00.180
I'm not a good tennis player.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:06.710
So if he gets my talent from
playing tennis, it's not good.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:08.222
Let's see how he ends up.

00:40:08.222 --> 00:40:09.930
STEFAN SCHMAGER: I
have another question.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.170
So we talked about--

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.170
we touched on the time
after your active career.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:14.920
You said that coaching
is probably nothing

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.113
you would want to pursue.

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:18.530
We also talked about Michael
Jordan, who played basketball

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:22.000
first and then he turned
into a baseball player.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.750
One of the things that
people may not know

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:27.010
is that in your youth, you
were actually also a skier.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:29.420
You both played
soccer but also ski,

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:34.760
and you pursued both
on a quite serious way.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.100
Can you tell us a bit
about your youth sports--

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.553
how you picked
soccer over skiing?

00:40:40.553 --> 00:40:42.220
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yeah, it's true.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:46.166
My father was a skiing racer,
so actually first time I

00:40:46.166 --> 00:40:48.240
was in skis, I was like
2 and 1/2 years old.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.435
So I grew up like
close to the mountains,

00:40:51.435 --> 00:40:56.250
so that was ideal for me
being outside fresh air.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.075
And in winter I was skiing, in
summer I was playing soccer.

00:40:59.075 --> 00:41:00.450
But then there
was a moment I had

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:03.450
to decide between
soccer and skiing,

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.310
because I got kind
of the possibility

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:08.760
to move to Bayern
Munich when I was 14.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.840
And then I had to decide.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.410
And it's not easy at
that age to decide,

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.670
so it made it kind of simple.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:18.420
And when you are a
skiing racer, you

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.520
have to carry all these skis.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.820
And it's always cold outside.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.020
It's not really enjoyable.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.940
You have to get up early
and all this stuff.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.740
In football, you
just take the cleats

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.730
and you play with your friends.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:35.273
So then I decided
to go for soccer.

00:41:35.273 --> 00:41:37.440
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Another
question from the audience.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.528
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here today.

00:41:40.528 --> 00:41:42.570
I was wondering if there
were any special moments

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.340
from your childhood
or your youth

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.920
that you remember that were
important moments for you

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.910
as a player or as an individual.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.480
And I was also curious if
you had any thoughts on how

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.670
the United States might
improve their youth

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.530
programs to be a more
competitive nation

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.080
in the future.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.830
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: Yes,
to your second question,

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:03.860
I think there have to be
a rule where it says, OK,

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.760
in every MLS team,
the lineup has

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.880
to be players from
the United States--

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.500
or in the squad
maybe six players.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:15.230
And also, for example,
Christian Pulisic,

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.620
he plays for Borussia Dortmund.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.360
But the goal should
be for the MLS

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.820
to keep the American
players in the league

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.430
to make it more popular
for the people over here.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:33.000
So these kind of rules I
think is possible to do.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.370
But that's how
you would create--

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.890
would make the league
higher and also you

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:44.970
would keep the idols for the
kids in the United States

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.470
where they can look up to.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.680
And, to the first question--

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.250
the first question that--

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.670
AUDIENCE: Childhood moments.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.087
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yes, there

00:42:54.087 --> 00:42:59.380
was a childhood moment
when I was 15 years old.

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:04.140
I was 15, and I got an offer
from a different club--

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.510
and it was not Munich, it
was more north Germany.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:11.100
And they offered
me a lot of money.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.220
And I could train with
the first team over there.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.130
And I remember that I had--

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:22.050
in that time, my coach was
the son of Franz Beckenbauer.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.630
You all know Franz
Beckenbauer-- he has a son.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.850
And, unfortunately,
he died two years ago,

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:30.240
but I had a good
relationship with him.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.820
And he told me look,
Basti, maybe you

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.848
can earn more money
over there and you

00:43:34.848 --> 00:43:36.390
train with the first
team over there,

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.480
but to go through the
youth team at Bayern Munich

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.470
will give you more as a
player and as a person.

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:43.740
And I did that.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.930
So, I am very, very
happy that I had a voice

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.830
to talk to in that moment.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.183
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Good choice.

00:43:54.183 --> 00:43:55.630
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:56.190
Can you please talk--

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:57.370
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Nice jersey, nice jersey.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:58.670
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:59.170
Oliver Kahn.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.330
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Oliver Kahn, here we go.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.870
AUDIENCE: Can you please
talk about how you prepare

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:07.170
on gamedays physically
and, especially,

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.720
mentally for big
games-- finals matches--

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.203
what's your process before
you walk out onto the field?

00:44:13.203 --> 00:44:15.120
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yes before actually it

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.630
starts during the
week, but I always

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:23.830
try to eat the right way
two days before the game

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:25.215
so I have a lot of energy.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:32.220
But then also before I go to
bed a day before the match,

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.870
I always try to imagine
how the game could be.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:40.680
I always ask our kit man
which jerseys are the opponent

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.370
playing and which jerseys are
we playing so I can imagine.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.927
We have red and
Borussia Dortmund

00:44:45.927 --> 00:44:47.010
plays yellow, for example.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:51.750
And then I try to think about
all the players on the field--

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:55.020
what's their strengths,
what is their weakness.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.830
What do they like?

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.318
Some they don't like
to run with the ball,

00:44:58.318 --> 00:44:59.860
some they like to
run with the ball--

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.170
so these kind of things--

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:04.360
to be ready for the
moment when it happens--

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.290
and, actually, before it
happens that I'm ready.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.640
And I do this all the time.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.415
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:13.415 --> 00:45:14.790
STEFAN SCHMAGER:
This is probably

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:16.540
one of the "Talks at
Google" with the most

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.160
questions from the audience,
so thank you very much.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hi, Basti,
thanks for the opportunity.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.900
I'm also a huge fan of
Bayern Munich and yourself.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.620
I moved to Chicago a year
ago from Germany too,

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:33.690
and I'm interested to know what
do you miss most about Germany?

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:36.690
And also you have
played many games that

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:42.330
went all the way to penalties
and you've shot many penalties,

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:44.460
and I would like
to know what do you

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.140
think when you go to the ball?

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:50.130
Are there any thoughts at all,
or are you just cool enough

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.580
to go and shoot?

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.770
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER: Yeah.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.660
Usually the Germans always
win penalty shootouts.

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.270
I actually only lost the one--

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:02.850
2012 in the Champions
League Final, unfortunately.

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:06.390
But when you walk from
the halfway line--

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.070
from the middle line
towards the ball,

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:12.075
it can happen that
you lose your--

00:46:12.075 --> 00:46:13.950
there are too many kids
here, I can't say it.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:20.250
But you get a little bit
nervous, which is normal,

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.810
right?

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.620
But it's very
important that you know

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.620
what you're going to do
in this kind of moments.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:32.370
It's very important to
analyze also the goalkeeper

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.080
before maybe if you
have the chance.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.330
If you are the first one,
you're a little bit unlucky.

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:40.570
But that always
helped me-- and, yeah,

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:45.650
have the power in your
mind to take that shot

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:47.505
and take the responsibility.

00:46:47.505 --> 00:46:49.880
But it's sometimes when you
have 80,000 people around you

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.120
and they boo you,
it's not easy--

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.200
or it is quiet.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.390
I don't like when it's quiet--

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:58.970
sometimes it's so quiet you
can hear everything dropping.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.690
And the other question was
what I'm going to miss.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:07.070
There's a special food.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:08.590
It's called Kaiserschmarrn.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.340
I don't know, you
probably know it, right?

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.132
STEFAN SCHMAGER: How
would you describe it?

00:47:12.132 --> 00:47:14.660
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
It's a pancake--

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:15.955
a thick pancake, but cut it.

00:47:15.955 --> 00:47:18.080
STEFAN SCHMAGER: It's a
scrambled pancake in a way,

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:18.250
right?

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:19.833
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:19.833 --> 00:47:22.610
And that's what I
loved, actually,

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:23.930
when I was skiing races.

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:26.920
So this kind of food was always
available on the mountains.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.440
AUDIENCE: I know that
from the mountains.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.148
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Exactly, exactly.

00:47:29.148 --> 00:47:30.350
But I miss that one, yes.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:31.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.017
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Thank you.

00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:36.370
AUDIENCE: I'm nervous coming up
to the mic like a penalty kick.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:39.500
So this is my husband,
Stephan, and I'm so--

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.660
thank you so much for
making this dream--

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.510
I'm eight months pregnant,
so I'm also very.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:47.330
But thank you so
much for making--

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.570
making his dream come true.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.760
OK, so I want Stephan--

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.620
this is for you to give
Basti a little break

00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.832
to drink some water.

00:47:59.832 --> 00:48:01.290
Stephan, can you
share a little bit

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:05.138
about how this moment came about
and the idea that sparked it?

00:48:05.138 --> 00:48:06.680
STEFAN SCHMAGER:
Yeah it's actually--

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.307
Google is an amazing place.

00:48:08.307 --> 00:48:10.140
You come to Google and
see "Talks at Google"

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:14.020
and how your colleagues
bring in writers and authors.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:17.580
So it's a very empowering
culture to just give it a shot

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.005
and try to reach out
to the Chicago Fire

00:48:20.005 --> 00:48:22.380
and see if your favorite player
could come in for a talk.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:28.410
So, in that sense, I'm
really happy to be here,

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:31.171
to embrace that Google
culture-- and, yeah,

00:48:31.171 --> 00:48:32.546
just very happy
to have you here.

00:48:32.546 --> 00:48:36.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.860
STEFAN SCHMAGER: I also--

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.880
so what she's referring
to is a moment in our life

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.780
when you signed with
the Chicago Fire.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.170
It was a week before
my son was born.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.900
A week after my son was born,
I went to your first game

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.540
at Toyota Park back then.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.910
And I got him a
Germany jersey hoping

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.310
that you could sign it one day.

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:57.570
And I tried really hard.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:03.300
I set my mind to do it,
and maybe after this talk,

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.092
you could give one
more signature.

00:49:05.092 --> 00:49:07.050
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
No problem, no problem.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.960
For the next one as well, right?

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.850
STEFAN SCHMAGER: Exactly.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:13.770
AUDIENCE: Well, one of the
things you mentioned is at 14,

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:17.000
you already were
going for Bayern.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.490
And what's it like
knowing from a teenager,

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:28.425
having kind of a plan,
and then A, doing it--

00:49:28.425 --> 00:49:30.300
getting the Champions
League and then playing

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.180
for Manchester United,
and stuff like that--

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.450
A, having that course set.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:36.810
And then, what's it like knowing
that from such a young age

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.190
and having that course set?

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.590
And then once you
got all this done,

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:43.752
what is it like then having
to face what to do next?

00:49:43.752 --> 00:49:45.210
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Yeah, first

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:52.170
of all, I'm very grateful to
have actually the chance to get

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.980
picked from out of
1,000 young players

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:58.520
to play for Bayern
Munich when I was 14.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.860
And I remember that--

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:05.520
or I'm playing soccer because
I like the game and I have fun

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.313
every single day when I go
right now-- or tomorrow,

00:50:08.313 --> 00:50:10.230
I'm going to go to the
training session again,

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.730
and I just love the game--

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.890
being outside there.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:17.700
All these things what happens
around, that happens anyway,

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:21.330
so you cannot affect that.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:23.970
But, of course, when
you lift this trophy

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.730
or you lift the
Champions League,

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:30.900
you ask yourself, what's next?

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:35.820
I always tried to find an
answer in kind of challenges.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.440
That's why I also came here.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:43.870
I want to help the Chicago Fire
to be one of the champions--

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:45.400
to be winners.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:51.080
And that's what I try to give
to everybody in the club,

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.200
and I hope that once
it's going to happen.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.370
STEFAN SCHMAGER: At Google,
we like a challenge,

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:57.790
we are problem solvers.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:01.840
So if you want to consider this
as your first Google interview,

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.658
we can go from here and
schedule another one.

00:51:05.658 --> 00:51:07.200
I want to wrap this
up, because we're

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.080
getting close to the hour mark.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.150
Bastian, thank you very
much for coming in here.

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:15.360
There will be another game this
Saturday against the Seattle

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.290
Sounders.

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:17.856
So, for everyone who--

00:51:17.856 --> 00:51:21.440
I was going to switch this,
but it doesn't switch.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.090
Anyways.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.958
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
There we go.

00:51:28.161 --> 00:51:31.270
STEFAN SCHMAGER: So we
wish you all the best.

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:33.090
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Difficult, right?

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.486
Just press this button.

00:51:34.486 --> 00:51:36.580
STEFAN SCHMAGER: We
wish you all the best

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.950
at this coming game
against Seattle Sounders.

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:42.220
Thank you so much for coming
in, answering tough questions,

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.960
and spending a
little time with us.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.870
We do also have a
little jersey exchange.

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:49.960
So this is something we
would like to give you

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.520
from the Chicago office.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.520
Again, thank you very
much, and this is for you.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.353
BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER:
Thank you very much.

00:51:56.353 --> 00:52:01.470
[APPLAUSE]
