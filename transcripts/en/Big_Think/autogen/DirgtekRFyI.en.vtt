is um it's not actually because I'm so
 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.409
is um it's not actually because I'm so
fascinated with myself it's because I

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419
fascinated with myself it's because I
 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.450
fascinated with myself it's because I
can't think um you know I can't think

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460
can't think um you know I can't think
 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.080
can't think um you know I can't think
like have thoughts in my head you know

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090
like have thoughts in my head you know
 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.540
like have thoughts in my head you know
like juggling them up there and think

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550
like juggling them up there and think
 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.960
like juggling them up there and think
them through and come to a conclusion

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970
them through and come to a conclusion
 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.610
them through and come to a conclusion
it's like math for me I can't do that I

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620
it's like math for me I can't do that I

the wrong word in order to understand
 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.059
the wrong word in order to understand
them so I'll always right because it's

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069
them so I'll always right because it's
 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:26.939
them so I'll always right because it's
um I'm now at this point I'm kind of

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949
um I'm now at this point I'm kind of
 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:33.959
um I'm now at this point I'm kind of
trained to a to think that way but I um

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:33.969
trained to a to think that way but I um
 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:37.529
trained to a to think that way but I um
I like many other things many other
