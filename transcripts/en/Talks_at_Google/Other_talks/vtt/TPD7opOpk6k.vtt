HEATH ROWE: Good afternoon.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.730
My name is Heath Rowe.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.630
And we're happy to be
here this afternoon

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.710
for Authors at Google.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.670
We have a guest today by the
name of Tom Folsom, who's

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.080
written a recent biography about
Dennis Hopper called,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.950
appropriately enough, "Hopper,
A Journey into the American

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.690
Dream." It's an "LA Times"
best seller.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.570
And given that Hopper has such
a rich history in Venice and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.800
in Los Angeles, not just through
his movie making but

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.090
through his art collecting and
his life, we thought it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.750
totally appropriate
to bring in Tom.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.390
Hopper's house was just 0.3
miles away, on Indiana Avenue.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.640
And so if you haven't walked
past that three house number

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.590
compound, it's worth
taking a look at.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.310
And his first movie, "Rebel
Without a Cause," shot with

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.120
James Dean, was almost entirely
in Los Angeles, some

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.270
in Los Feliz, other
parts, including

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.320
Santa Monica High School.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.800
And so we're proud to have Tom
Folsom here today, to talk to

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.350
us about Hopper and his book.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.970
Mr. Folsom.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.396
TOM FOLSOM: Thanks.

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:02.146
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:03.390
TOM FOLSOM: Great to be here.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.180
So Hopper and LA, let's
get down to it.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.000
Hopper moved to Los Angeles
when he was 18 years old.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.350
He was born and raised in, of
all places, Dodge City,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.010
Kansas, where they would have
Wyatt Earp and his sidekick

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.120
Doc Holliday would shoot
it up in the Wild West.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.550
So this sort of sets the tone
for what I felt was Hopper's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.290
just improbably iconic life.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.170
I mean the thing about this
guy is, which you don't

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.470
realize, he pops
up everywhere.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.270
It's sort of like--

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.640
I don't know-- as one person
put it, like a

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.836
stoned Forrest Gump.

00:01:45.836 --> 00:01:50.280
But you'll see him in the
LA pop art scene.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.380
He's buying one of the first
Andy Warhol Soup Cans.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.420
You'll see him with James Dean
in "Rebel Without a Cause."

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.230
You follow this guy's trail, and
it's sort of extraordinary

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.560
where this journey took him.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.810
So I'm going to be talking about
the journey in a second.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.229
But let's get back to Hopper
at 18 years old.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.270
Now, he's moved from Dodge
City, Kansas, to, of all

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.730
places, San Diego, sort of like
that "Go West, young man"

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.410
sort of migration after
World War II.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.520
So he ends up in San Diego.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.400
At 13, he makes his professional
debut at San

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.810
Diego's Old Globe Theatre.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.120
It's a replica of the
Shakespearean theater.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.040
So by the time he's 18, he's
actually a classically trained

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.070
Shakespearean actor.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.900
He's won the National
Shakespeare Competition.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.200
Right after he graduated high
school, he was voted most

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.850
likely to succeed.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.190
I mean, when we look at Dennis,
we sort of have

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.630
different variations of this,
when we look back on him.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.120
Either that or sort of the
shaggy, pot smoking "Easy

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.930
Rider" guy.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.128
But in high school, he was
just totally clean-cut.

00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:12.960
From what I've heard from people
that went to school

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.140
with him, he wasn't really
that wild, either.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.950
All he was doing was acting.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.590
He knew what he wanted, and
that was to be an actor.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.330
So by the time, again, he's 18
years old, he's just landed

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.270
this role in this film, "Rebel
Without a Cause." It's his

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.330
very first film, because he's
been signed by Warner

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.100
Brothers, after doing sort of
this terrific television tour

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.920
de force in a show called
"Medic." It was a very real

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.240
hospital drama.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.820
And so Dennis played sort
of a young patient.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.600
And he's got those
haunting eyes.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.960
And so people loved him.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.990
So he had all these studio
offers immediately after.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.360
But his idea of acting was
Shakespearean, which was

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.070
really funny.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.290
I mean that eloquent diction.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.400
I mean his heroes were
really Orson Welles

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.620
and Laurence Olivier.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.860
So you can imagine just this
sort of strange looking,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.049
eerily handsome, young man
who's doing Shakespeare.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.339
This is the style
of great acting.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.260
So, well, what happens?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.070
He's on the set of "Rebel
Without a Cause," filmed

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.130
around Los Angeles.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.230
Up at the observatory,
he sees James Dean.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.160
And James Dean is doing these
things with acting that is

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.100
totally off the map.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.500
It's a little bit in the
tradition of Marlon Brando

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.480
and, before him, Montgomery
Clift.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.710
But it's very much every
take is different that

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.640
James Dean's doing.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.140
He's sort of almost
like animal in

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.960
the way that he moves.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.640
And he's got this thing.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.480
He wants it to be real.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.910
And so when they're doing this
switchblade scene in "Rebel

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.790
Without a Cause," up at the
observatory, it's James Dean,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.590
if you remember, and he's
against the bully gang leader,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.060
this guy, Buzz.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.640
So these guys are like
mano-a-mano.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.810
But like Dean wants to use
real switchblades.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.320
He wants that realism.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.970
And so, in the course of playing
around with real

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.660
switchblades, James Dean gets
cut behind the ear.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.450
And so Nicholas Ray, the
director, he yells cut.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.010
And Dean just freaks out.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.430
He's like, if I'm in
the moment, don't

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.900
ever tell me to cut.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.340
As Hopper put it, he almost
threatened to murder his

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.500
director with the switchblade.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.830
But that's the sort of
commitment that Dean had to

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.480
being real.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.480
And it totally changed
Hopper's way of

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.490
thinking about acting.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.020
I mean, by all indications, he
was really like the good boy

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.920
who wanted to please.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.760
He wanted to do the right thing,
act the right way.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.320
But Dean, he's doing something
completely-- he's arguing with

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.120
the director.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.810
He's pulling a knife
on the guy.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.040
So you have to think.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.240
When you're 18 years old, you're
that impressionable.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.550
I mean, this is your
first movie.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.010
And then considering what
James Dean became.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.260
I mean, at the point of "Rebel
Without a Cause," James Dean

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.910
was definitely like the
next big thing.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.800
But he'd only been in
"East of Eden." He'd

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.820
only been in one film.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.920
And so Hopper acts with him in
"Rebel Without a Cause." and

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.970
then his next film is "Giant,"
also with James Dean, and

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.010
filmed down in Marfa, Texas.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.970
So you can imagine, back to back
films with James Dean.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.260
Right after when he finished
"Giant" in the summer of 1955,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:48.050
James Dean is spectacularly
killed, in his Porsche Silver

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.350
Spyder, going off to a race.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.420
So by the time "Rebel Without
a Cause" comes out, I mean,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.570
it's a dead man on the screen.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.260
But audiences just couldn't
believe that

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.690
he was really dead.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.095
He was like the number
one movie star.

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:07.320
He was beating out
Rock Hudson.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.590
And we was getting tons of fan
mail, just like no one wanted

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.180
to believe that this amazingly
vibrant actor was dead.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.690
I mean, how could he be dead?

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:23.970
So Hopper, of all people, he's
about three or four years

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.770
younger than Dean, he's sort of
looked to, by the studios,

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.190
as the next James Dean.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.850
So that's pretty big
shoes to fill.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.020
Just because Hopper
had an intensity.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.390
He had worked with Dean
for two films.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.600
He was the natural
heir apparent.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:49.180
Well, he definitely got swept
up in that, I think, so much

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.790
to the point that he starts to
argue with directors, himself.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.060
And he makes himself sort
of known as being

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.620
difficult to work with.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.980
All of this in this sort of
attempt to live up to James

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.670
Dean's legacy.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.670
It gets to the point where, as
Hopper tells it, it's the

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.340
second year of his studio
contract, it's 1957, he has

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.260
this spectacular showdown with
his director, Henry Hathaway,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.650
on the set of this B-Western
called "From Hell to Texas."

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.570
And, as Hopper puts it, 86
times, the director's telling

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.830
him, no, I want you
to do it this way.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.220
And Hopper's like, no, I'm
not going to do it.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:26.950
I'm going to do it this way.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.140
And it just keeps going in this
epic showdown that Hopper

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.539
inevitably loses.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:37.770
Because he's not quite James
Dean, in terms of his star

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:42.190
power, how people project him.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.360
So anyway, Hopper's pretty
much, as he puts it, he's

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.610
blackballed from Hollywood.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.700
But he's still young.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.380
He's only like 20,
21 years old.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.250
So what are you going to do?

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.600
Well, he goes to the
Actors Studio.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.480
He follows sort of James Dean's
footsteps, wants to

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.190
teach at the Actors Studio.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.290
And then he sort of picks up
some work around Hollywood

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:13.640
doing a lot of television
and doing smaller films.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.990
One of which is this film filmed
right here in Venice.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.000
It's called "Night Tide."
Looking back, Hopper says it

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.690
was the first, real,
independent film.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.720
But then, it was just like a
couple of really strange

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:33.100
people, with cameras, filming
this really weird guy.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.310
Hopper plays sailor.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.460
And he falls in love with
a sideshow mermaid.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.900
And it's a very cult-y,
underground film.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.120
But it's extremely cool.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.495
I really recommend, if you
haven't gotten a chance to see

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:49.650
it, go check it out.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.690
And you'll definitely get
a sense of weird Venice.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:59.270
It's all filled with carnies
and fringe characters.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.980
It's a lot of fun.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.070
That's the film "Night Tide."

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.020
What else is he doing?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.115
Well, he's got some
time on his hands.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.880
I mean, Hopper was a
compulsive creator.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.240
He really wanted to work.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.210
He comes from good Dodge
City, Kansas, stock.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.240
So he gets involved
in the arts scene

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.310
that's percolating around.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.790
It's a counterpoint to what
they're doing in the East.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.000
And Hopper would hang around
with these abstract

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.190
expressionists at the Cedar
Tavern, when he was out at the

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.230
Actors Studio, in New York.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.110
But there was something else
going on in LA, too.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:42.340
And it's all about guys who want
to use the LA aesthetic,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.960
the aesthetic of the road,
of sleek new--

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.700
car culture.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:54.450
These guys are incorporating
that into their art.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.730
And it becomes a counterbalance
to what's

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.220
happening in New York.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.880
Now Hopper is extremely
active in this.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.230
He knows all of the players.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.490
He's actually making
art himself.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.070
He's taking a lot of
photos, as well.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.160
He's got some really terrific
photos of the pop

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.290
art scene in LA.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.500
Now people weren't even calling
it pop art then,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.560
because it didn't even
have a name.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.560
And one day, Dennis Hopper, he's
hanging out at the Ferus

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:32.150
Gallery, on La Cienega, and
he sees this comic strip.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.670
And why is there a comic
strip on a wall?

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.500
It's liked framed as art.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.410
Well, of course, it's
a Lichtenstein.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.340
But Hopper, he loses it.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:40.880
He goes nuts.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.810
He's like, wow, that's it.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.610
This is our reality.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.940
This is not, for Hopper, that
sort of brooding, abstract

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:55.230
expressionism that he'd been
introduced to in the East.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.910
That brooding thing also was
very much tied to the Actors

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.130
Studio and that style
of acting.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.830
And people see a lot of
parallels between Jackson

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.150
Pollock and Brando as well.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.460
I mean even just that tough,
macho thing, but just sort of

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.950
like creating strange
things from within.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.000
But all of a sudden, Hopper sees
this, and it's like pop.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.690
And Hopper's been doing, at this
time, looking back, like

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.670
cheesy TV but also groovy.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:30.530
He's playing the reincarnated
Nazi in "The Twilight Zone."

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.690
He's playing in Bobbie Jo and
the beatnik episode on

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.280
"Beverly Hillbillies."
He plays this

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.870
strange, beatnik guy.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.970
But Hopper is sort
of a pop savant.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.830
That was one thing
that he got.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.180
And in getting that, he bought
one of the first

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.080
Andy Warhol Soup Cans.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.170
So where does this
eye come from?

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.920
I mean he was not a classically
trained.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.300
I mean, he was from Dodge
City, of all places.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.810
And he grew up on a dirt farm.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.260
But looking back, people just
said, Hopper just got it, like

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.890
he really got pop.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:14.580
And at this point, James Dean
was also that great pop icon

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.110
after his death.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.300
So I think that has a lot to
do with Hopper's experience

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.170
under James Dean.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.440
I mean, for me, all things,
with Hopper's

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.400
journey, come from Dean.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.420
Where is this going
to take you?

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.510
Well, it takes Hopper to--

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.450
he wants to be where
the action is.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.150
He wants to see what's
happening.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.950
I think it's that awesome
documentary quality that you

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.950
find in "Easy Rider."

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.300
A lot of that movie was
just him and his

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.610
location scout guy.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.460
And they were riding around,
looking for locations, and

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.520
they put what they saw
into the movie.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.920
So that's sort of the thing, for
me, that really stands out

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.500
about Hopper, as a great
filmmaker, is just that

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.660
quality of wanting to be there
where it's happening.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.090
Well, this is sort of brings
Hopper everywhere.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.180
It takes him to Haight-Ashbury
in the '60s.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.230
It takes him to like Taos, New
Mexico, in the '70s, after he

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.780
does "Easy Rider," which
was, of course,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.440
a phenomenal success.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.250
And he gets involved
in this whole--

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.670
which is on the cover, here--

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.520
cosmic cowboy scene.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.870
This is the same thing, when
you think about like great

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.340
Kris Kristofferson songs, one
of which he actually wrote

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.700
about Dennis.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.030
And those two had a connection
as well.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.900
Dennis offering Kris
Kristofferson his first acting

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.440
gig in a film called "The Last
Movie," that was shot in Peru.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.150
So it keeps taking
him to where it's

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.170
happening in pop culture.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:59.480
But always wanting to be where
the action is also taking its

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.550
toll on Hopper.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:04.060
I mean, one of the things
that he followed

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.750
was the drug scene.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.750
And he would ingest copious
amounts of whatever the

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.500
happening drug was
at the time.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.600
The '70s being tons
of cocaine.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.620
Well, this sort of proves
unsustainable.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.350
And I feel that like, at the end
of every chapter, how did

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.000
Hopper live through
this chapter?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.410
But somehow he did it.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.920
And lo and behold, when people
thought, you know what,

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.100
Dennis, he's a goner.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.710
He was so far gone, you would
find him wandering around

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.410
Mexico, in the jungle, naked.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.850
What is up with this guy?

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.010
You know what, he gets sober.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.860
He gets to the point where
he can't do it anymore.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.120
He does the 12 steps.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.420
He gets sober.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.520
And, of all places, he leaves
Taos, New Mexico, and he moves

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:56.220
to Venice, Venice in the mid
'80s being a very different

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.400
scene from Venice today.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.570
So I'm going to read a chapter
about Hopper coming to Venice

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.090
and one of the more improbable
movies that you're like, wow,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.780
Dennis Hopper did that?

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.696
It's a movie called "Colors",
about the LA gang scene.

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:15.290
So I'm going to read
this chapter.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.890
It's called "Colors."

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.500
In a tweed suit, Hopper moseyed
through the land of

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.900
the unwanted, abandoned autos,
burned-down homes,

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.560
trash-littered sidewalks.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.490
He was accompanied by his
female, bodybuilder friend,

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.530
from Beverly Hills, who'd
recently appeared in Playboy

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.120
and was a muse for fine art
photographer Robert

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.570
Mapplethorpe.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.270
Hopper climbed over a
graffiti-littered wall at the

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.650
end of a dead-end alley.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.400
Three, silver, futuristic
bunkers loomed in the

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.350
wasteland of Venice
Beach, California.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.810
I love them, said Hopper.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:48.690
I just love them.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.150
These are so amazing,
ingenious.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.040
The trio of shacks seemed to
have been built for Hopper.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.300
He felt as if he'd commissioned
them, much to the

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.010
delight of Venice artists Laddie
John Dill and Chuck

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.670
Arnoldi, up a creek financially
on their artist

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.420
colony sinkhole in the ghetto
that they'd gotten budding

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.280
architect Frank Gehry
to design.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.119
Only the buildings were built
backwards, because the

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.670
blueprints were read that way.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.510
One would-be tenant, a UCLA
student, squinted at the

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.329
graffiti and deciphered a
death threat and split.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.880
And the only takers, so far,
were the cops, who'd been

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.880
using these bunkers for
surveillance to bust a crack

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.630
house across the street.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.570
Well, Hopper snapped one up in
1987, with plans to get the

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.310
other shacks when he could.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.720
So in gangsta style, he rolled
around his 'hood in a two-tone

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.920
brown Cadillac Seville with gold
wire rims, surveying the

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.050
turf for his new movie,
"Colors," staring bad-boy

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.250
actor Sean Penn.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.930
"We're here to learn about
gangs," announced Sean, at a

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.990
meeting of CRASH, Community
Resources Against Street

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.230
Hoodlums, which was
an LAPD gang unit.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.090
"Yeah, well good fucking
luck, pal," said

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.000
Detective Dennis Fanning.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.590
Detective Fanning was recruited
as the technical

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.120
advisor on "Colors." And for
three months, the LAPD stuck

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.980
Sean Penn in the backseat
of a squad car.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.716
Sometimes, when you're with
someone, says Fanning, you

00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:16.730
know, a partner, they could be
the greatest cop in the world.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.160
And you could be the greatest
cop in the world.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.220
But you two don't
have karma, when

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.150
you're in a car, together--

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.440
Fanning's explaining this to
me at an Orange County,

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.440
Starbucks--

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.640
you know, the thing
is, is just you're

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.610
always 10 minutes late.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:28.890
You know, the bad guy
just left, or the

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.200
shooting just went down.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.310
But there's other times, you get
in a car with somebody and

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.260
boom, it's right there.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.520
The karma's there.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.240
You turn the corner.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.260
There's the guy with the gun.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.210
You walk into the store.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:37.770
It's getting robbed.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.750
You pull up to the light.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.910
There's a stolen car.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.220
That's pretty much how
it was with Seany.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.520
Sean, he'd get in the car, and
he'd turned it into a shit

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.270
magnet, which is nice, because
guys who consider themselves

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.580
good street cops like to be
considered ship magnets.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.840
And, as a great shit magnet,
Sean wanted nobody else to

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.580
direct "Colors" but Dennis
Hopper, seeing as he and his

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.890
wife, Madonna--

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.410
Mo in cop talk--

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.210
were big fans of "Out of the
Blue," Hopper's sort of

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:11.790
forgotten, strange '80s punk
movie, shot in Vancouver.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.250
Now "Colors" was originally
scripted to be about cough

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.410
syrup abuse.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:20.830
But Hopper drastically recast it
to explore the volatile LA

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.930
gang scene, with Crips and
Bloods killing each other on

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.850
the streets of South Central,
like cowboys and Indians.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.560
His subject was considered so
outlandish at the time, that

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.490
some critics actually thought
he made it up.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.570
But living in Venice Beach,
homeboy Dennis got to know the

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.850
local gang kids on
a personal level.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.450
And he thought it was just a
waste of really meaningful

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.250
talent, thoughtfulness,
and energy.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.390
Well, Dennis told me his crazy
stories of when he left the

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.610
hospital and of walking down the
road in his fucking PJs,

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.070
recounted Detective Fanning,
of some of the war stories

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.680
that he and Hopper would tell.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.120
And Hopper would tell him
about his rehab and his

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.830
wanderings in the
Mexican jungle.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.380
Well, says, Fanning, me and him,
we had the same stories,

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.900
just different sides
of the fence.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.280
We got along famously.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.910
I got like 10 or 15 cops into
the movie, because Dennis, he

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.570
wanted the realism.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.880
But they also used real
gangsters, which made for real

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.010
fun breaking for lunch time on
the set, real cops on one

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.480
side, real gangsters
on the other.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.350
It's heavy, man, says
rapper Ice-T--

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.240
of course--

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.080
you got to think, OK, Dennis,
he's in "Easy Rider,"

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.730
rocked-out white guy, getting
high, riding motorcycles.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.500
You say, OK, he's on some
rebel white shit.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.020
But then he's doing
a movie only

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.910
about blacks and Mexicans?

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.910
Well, Hopper wanted Ice-T's
"Yo, Homeboy, Squeeze the

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.190
Trigger" on the soundtrack.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.560
So T went to a screening.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.850
OK, says T, the movie's good.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.140
And it had a kind of a fictional
line, because the

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.270
Mexicans and the blacks didn't
fight at the time.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.940
But overall, I was kind
of like pro it.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.110
But Rick James, he had
the title song.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.950
You know, look good, all these
colors, or some shit.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.210
And this is Ice-T giving me
his funkiest Rick James

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.660
impression.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.370
But without asking, says T, I
left the studio, and we laid

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.480
the song, "Colors." I just
submitted it cold.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.330
Then all of a sudden, this
ripple effect happens.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.530
And everybody was like,
yo, Dennis Hopper

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.210
wants to meet you.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:23.610
Yo, brother, this song
is the shit.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.920
It's what the movie is.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.610
It's all that.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.060
Yo, this is the essence.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:27.970
This is what it is.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.610
This is like beyond
what I meant.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.600
But this is, of course, homeboy
Dennis talking.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.970
And Ice-T is listening
to this guy.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.390
He suddenly thought he was in
"Apocalypse Now." He'd always

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.630
been a fan of Hopper's
rap in the movie.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.740
It's like he's talking about
Kurtz, you know, says T, the

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.570
way he just takes the words and
jumbles them, and he spins

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.910
them, and he drops them.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.360
And as a fellow artist, Ice-T
appreciated how Hopper always

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.230
really felt whatever
he was doing.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.100
No stranger to controversy,
himself, Ice-T thought it was

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.960
unfortunate when the media
lashed out at Hopper's

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.460
finished vision, with the
media calling "Colors" a

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.070
disgrace and accusing him of
fabricating a gang situation.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.410
Orion Pictures was afraid that
if they distributed "Colors"

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.110
in wide release that blood was
going to run in the streets.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.600
So the studio offered to pay
for some security guards in

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.510
all of the release
theaters, with

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.880
protection outside and inside.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.780
But still a lot of
theaters were too

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.390
nervous to open the movie.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:26.800
When "Colors" opened in LA, in
'88, cops arrested nearly 150

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.670
gang members.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.710
And a gang member was shot
to death outside of

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.750
a theater in Stockton.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.830
But "Colors" was hot.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.040
But unfortunately for the
producers, nobody really got

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.490
killed in the second week.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.830
And there was no real
controversy.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.570
So everything died, and
"Colors" was buried.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.090
But if only the suits, man,
if they'd only put in wide

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.550
release more aggressively that
first week, they could've made

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.580
a fortune off of Hopper.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.830
So where does this
leave Hopper?

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.030
Well, he's left with pack of red
bereted Guardian Angels,

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.010
who were outside his compound,
protesting his depiction of

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.190
inner city youth.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.150
Clearly, Hopper needs to
fortify at this point.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.920
So he buys the Gehry shack on
the vacant lot behind him.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.750
And he proceeds with phase
two of his compound.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.830
Up goes a silver, futuristic,
fortress skin, with a

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:20.320
wave-like, hyperbolic roof and
an asymmetrical, windowless,

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.460
industrial, corrugated
steel facade.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.340
Hopper connected his original
Gehry shack to the second he

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.700
procured, with a series of
jarring, heavy-duty catwalks.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.750
He bought a third bunker
a few years later.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.350
It was like a paranoid cocaine
drug lord's insane bunker,

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.860
only sober, in Hopper's case.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.330
But they had video monitors
playing for him, like an

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:49.230
ongoing surveillance loop,
which fed into Hopper's

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:53.950
paranoia and served as also
artful background footage.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.450
And all the lights in his
house would flash at any

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.500
unauthorized footstep.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.850
The compound was buttressed by
a handgun stuffed into one of

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.120
Hopper's socks and
a backup shotgun,

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.450
tucked away on the premises.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.250
Completing his American dream
home, Hopper put up a white

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.940
picket fence, just like the kind
that Auntie Em put up in

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.530
the "Wizard of Oz" or something
you'd see along the

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.850
streets of "Blue Velvet's"
Lumberton, separating him from

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.890
Venice's mean streets.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.880
There's a little door on one
side of the fence, in the

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.620
back, with razor wire all around
it, explained Hopper,

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.950
of one of the compound's
secret features.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.270
After I put it up, I went out.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.810
And I came back.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:37.250
And the guys had sort of just
taken the door off, and they'd

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:38.130
laid it down.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.680
It was still locked but
just laid down.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.700
Well, I'm living on their
turf, you know.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.770
I mean, it's my turf, too,
because this is America.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.890
That's my reading
from "Colors".

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.440
And again, where do
we find Hopper?

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.220
We find him wanting to be
where the action is.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.210
And he does this gang movie.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.820
And before, he wanted to be
where the action was in the

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.890
1980s, with this film, "Out of
the Blue." And it was about

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.180
punk music.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.960
It was really one of the first
movies about punk.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.370
He's not really into punk.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.460
He didn't really like punk.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.660
But he liked reality.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.770
He wanted to be where
it was happening.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:20.830
So he covers the punk scene.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.290
And he does this film "Colors",
like three years

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:28.320
before films like "Boyz in the
Hood" and that whole slew of

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.500
gang movies that came out.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:36.110
The guy had a ton of faults,
but the one thing you could

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.550
say about him was that, a,
he had this extraordinary

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.070
journey, which is why I
really wanted to write

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.700
this book about him.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.110
I mean, I really felt that this
was like a modern day Don

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.510
Quixote out chasing his
American dream.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.310
But he did, he had an eye.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.910
I mean he knew what was
significant and like what was

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.960
sort of garbage and crap.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.150
He definitely did a lot of
crap in his later years.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.870
But the guy wanted to work.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.320
He was happy working.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:15.480
The end of his life, I just
felt, he was like living,

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.750
breathing pop.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.530
He'd be like in a Super
Bowl commercial, doing

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.280
those weird Nike ads.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.520
And then you'd see him
in "Waterworld,"

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.690
with this eye patch.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:29.390
And then you'd see him
in "Speed" as this

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.200
crazy, manic guy.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.880
Someone told me later-- they
actually said that Hopper felt

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.240
that "Speed" was actually his
toughest acting role, because

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.610
he was basically locked
in a room on a phone.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.820
And I mean, that's your range.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.590
I mean he's just like, look.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.890
But you know what, he really did
bring some amazing talent

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.350
to these roles.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:58.560
But unlike a lot of actors,
whose lives are pretty much

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.185
just defined by the roles that
they do, and then, what do you

00:27:01.185 --> 00:27:01.890
do in your downtime?

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:02.480
Well, I don't know.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.620
I just hang around
and do lunches,

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.280
this, that, the other.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.050
I mean I really felt the
Hopper's life, what came

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:11.250
between those roles, was really
greater than any of the

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.150
roles he'd ever played.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.850
I think his greatest role
really was his own.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.180
So thank you for listening
to me.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.210
If you guys have any questions
or anything like that, I would

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.598
like to see where it goes.

00:27:23.598 --> 00:27:25.086
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:25.086 --> 00:27:26.078
TOM FOLSOM: Yeah.

00:27:26.078 --> 00:27:29.045
AUDIENCE: Were you concerned at
all, did you hear anything

00:27:29.045 --> 00:27:32.282
about this, having a really
miserable marriage in the last

00:27:32.282 --> 00:27:34.274
years of his life
hit him hard?

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.430
TOM FOLSOM: Even when he got
sober, I mean he was still the

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.680
same person.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.780
This was a guy who, I felt,
wanted to literally live that

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.540
two-dimensional life
on the screen.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.480
He wanted to be that cowboy
riding off into the sunset.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.840
So the guy lived his
life like a movie.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.710
And so when you do that, you're
going to have all these

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.310
tumultuous ups and downs.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.950
But it's also tremendously
exciting.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:10.370
I mean that's what
got him off.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:15.940
It was really just wanting
to be always

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.190
where it was happening.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.620
I never got the sense he
was really miserable.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.180
He had those moments where
it was like a lot of--

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.480
at one point, he tells Charlie
Rose that he really considered

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.980
his whole career a failure.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.550
But then there's also that side
where, maybe, he's just

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.640
playing the acting role of the
great, failed genius, like an

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.490
Orson Welles.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.910
There's something really
romantic about that.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:46.320
But who knows?

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.800
What a strange journey.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.660
You forget, when "Easy Rider"
came out, he was on the cover

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.720
of the biggest magazine,
"Life" magazine.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.540
And he was a bona fide icon.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.440
And then what happens to this?

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.640
He's there for that moment.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.580
He is the guy in 1969.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.230
And then he goes to Peru, and
he shoots this really acid

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.590
cowboy movie.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.100
And he sort of disappears.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.480
And then we see him pop up in
"Apocalypse Now" in the

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.690
jungle, doing this crazy rant.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.720
What a life.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.600
And I just think the guy,
he never stopped.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.240
And at the end of his life, he's
literally watching the

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.540
old cowboy movies.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.320
It's just reconnecting
with that

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.150
original myth of his childhood.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.600
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
his early success as a

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:45.260
director hemmed him in and made
him kind of afraid of

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.920
being able to get back
to where he was?

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.840
TOM FOLSOM: His first movie,
just from a financial

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.730
standpoint, take $300,000, you
and your buddy, and you go to

00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:59.275
New Orleans.

00:29:59.275 --> 00:30:01.730
You start shooting
on Mardi Gras.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:06.060
And then from these sort of
beginnings, trying to chase a

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.680
parade down, with these little
16 millimeter cameras, and

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.700
everybody's sort of an acid
and going nuts, and this,

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.650
that, the other.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:17.850
That makes $40 million
at the box office.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:21.000
So studios are, basically,
like, whoa.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.250
I mean, he really does
revolutionize Hollywood.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:26.250
It's sort of the idea that, if
this guy's not going to be

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.320
able to come through the front
door and be like a Paul

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.880
Newman, like a good boy actor,
and like the shining star,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.320
he's going to change the system
so it works for him.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.770
It was sort of a product
of his time.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.460
I mean a movie like that
was bound to happen.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.610
In some ways "Midnight
Cowboy" did that.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.750
But it was really "Easy
Rider" that did that.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.370
And so Hopper gets the chance
to do, basically, any movie

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:50.430
that he wants to do.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.870
And he's really passionate,
though, about this sort of

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.750
trippy Western that he'd written
called "The Last

00:30:55.750 --> 00:31:01.100
Movie." And they gave him
$1 million for it.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.620
He had final cut.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.200
It's a really personal vision,
but it's very strange.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.850
I, personally, think it's super
groovy, but people at

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.640
the time, critics,
sort of hated it.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.290
But it did win the Venice
Film Festival.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:21.380
It's like one of these films,
that if you talk in film

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:26.950
circles, it's like this
great lost work.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.640
Because it was edited so many
times, and no one knows what

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.700
exactly the definitive version
of "The Last Movie" is.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.880
But he wanted it to be the
great American art film.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.660
And he banked it all on that.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.870
I mean all this creative capital
went into making "The

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.680
Last Movie." And it
was shelved by the

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.300
studios within a week.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.430
Because he wouldn't recut
it to the way they

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:52.890
wanted to cut it.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.280
So it's an experimental film.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.760
But I think after that, Hopper
was lucky to have ever made

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.050
another film again.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.580
But the films that he would make
after that were like--

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.060
he wanted narratives that
people could follow.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.605
So I think he lost some of
that, we're going to make

00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:17.930
something that's totally crazy,
totally nuts, for the

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:21.080
sake of, I can do a really
straight-up Hollywood movie.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.630
And if you look at "Colors",
it's a Hollywood movie.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.880
It's a buddy cop movie.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.460
It's very mainstream.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.740
It's just the subject matter
was just about three years

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.015
before its time.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.810
I think he probably still really
harbored dreams of

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.870
making that sort of great
film, at the end.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:46.304
And it just proved really
elusive to him.

00:32:46.304 --> 00:32:50.180
AUDIENCE: How would you contrast
or compare that

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.660
personal vision of "The Last
Movie" with his connections

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.730
with pop art?

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.790
It seems like there's something
slightly disjointed

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.850
about this personal artist's
vision and the very

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.200
commercialized, generic?

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.470
TOM FOLSOM: Absolutely.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.770
Hopper really believed that "The
Last Movie" was going to

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:10.040
change things.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.970
This was a guy who thought that
"Easy Rider" was just a

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.400
warm-up for his grand plans.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.500
I mean, who could blame
him for thinking

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.560
that at that time?

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:25.020
This was a guy who was so well
versed in what was happening

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:31.300
in art, and he wanted to
bring that sensibility.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.980
He thought that people
were to going to

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.900
love "The Last Movie".

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.550
He thought it was going to
be another revolution.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:41.180
But like he just found out
that people weren't

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:41.610
interested.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:45.840
They wanted that easy ride of
"Easy Rider," this very

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.090
straight narrative.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.040
That's sort of the one thing
that I didn't know about

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.760
Hopper when I came
to this book.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.120
And that's the one thing that
became the centerpiece was

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.730
"The Last Movie." And to
me, I thought that

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.520
was his heroic gesture.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.220
I mean this was a guy who
could've done anything.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.679
And he banks it all on his
personal vision, in a really

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:15.010
hostile environment of the
corporate studios.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:18.080
Just the fact that he was able
to do it, I think it's pretty

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:18.659
extraordinary.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:22.480
But really, just the fact that
he stuck behind his vision.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:28.600
And I think it's a vision that
you can't totally write off to

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.850
cocaine and drugs.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.940
That was the movie he
wanted to make.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.760
I mean just like "Easy
Rider" was a film.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.219
It wouldn't have been the same
film without pot, so it's part

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:42.120
of the fabric of it.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.340
And cocaine was in
"The Last Movie."

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.620
But it was his vision.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:55.260
And so I thought was, again,
a pretty epic thing, a man

00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:00.180
against the corporate
studio system.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.000
And he took them on.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.310
And he was totally fearless.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:05.980
He paid for it.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:06.972
AUDIENCE: I have one question.

00:35:06.972 --> 00:35:07.454
TOM FOLSOM: Yeah.

00:35:07.454 --> 00:35:08.900
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
Linda Manz.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.346
What is she like?

00:35:10.346 --> 00:35:12.760
What's her story, there?

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.150
TOM FOLSOM: Linda Manz
is just really cool.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.660
I mean it's just, you
can imagine her--

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.420
a lot of people know her from
the film "Days of Heaven", the

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.520
Terrence Malick move.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.080
She provides the voiceover
for that.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:31.750
We all kind of grow older,
and maybe we lose

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.030
some of that intensity.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.750
But you know, it's
still there.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.740
You can't change who you are.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.090
But it was pretty magical
getting to spend some time and

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:45.910
look through old photo albums,
Polaroids from "Days of

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:51.105
Heaven" and her showing
up to like her first--

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:57.530
not job interview--

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.370
acting gig in like
a Fonzie t-shirt

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.530
and smoking a cigarette.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.490
That's how she would show
up for the audition.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.170
It was amazing.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.960
But yeah, just one of the
characters that you get to

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:15.100
meet in Hopper-land,
here, in the book.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.440
Cool.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.430
It's been a lot of fun.

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:18.630
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:23.000
[APPLAUSE]
