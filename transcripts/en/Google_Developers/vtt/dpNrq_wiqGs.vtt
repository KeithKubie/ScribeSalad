00:00:03.528 --> 00:00:05.820
BRAD ABRAMS: If you're new
to developing for the Google

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.160
Assistant, you have
come to the right talk.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.860
And if you're an experienced
Assistant developer,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.610
don't worry.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.100
We're going to tell
you what's new.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.140
Our mission for the
Google Assistant

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.560
is to be the best way
to get things done.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.440
That is an ambitious mission.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.990
I think it sort of
rhymes with organize

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.440
the world's information and
make it useful and accessible.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.040
And just like Google Search's
mission from 20 years ago,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.680
our mission today
for the Assistant

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.820
requires a large and vibrant
ecosystem of developers.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.930
And that's where
all of you come in.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.770
So whether you're joining
us here at the amphitheater

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.160
at Shoreline watching on the
live stream or on YouTube

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.800
later, this talk is
going to tell you

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.070
how you can make your
experiences shine on the Google

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.540
Assistant.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.700
If you're a content
owner, this talk

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.430
is going to tell you
about [INAUDIBLE] markup,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.860
and templates, and how
you can make your content

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.380
look great on the Assistant.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.390
And if you're an Android
developer-- wait.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.550
I hear there's a few Android
developers here today.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.870
Where are the
Android developers?

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.320
Where are you?

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.920
Yes.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.295
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:14.253
BRAD ABRAMS: Thank you.

00:01:14.253 --> 00:01:16.250
If you're an Android
developer, this talk

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.610
is going to tell you how you can
use App Actions to voice-enable

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.530
your Android apps.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.380
And if you're an innovator
in this new generation

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.230
of conversational
computing, this talk

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.080
is going to cover
Interactive Canvas

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.610
and conversational actions--

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.600
how you can use HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript to build rich,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.810
immersive actions
for the Assistant.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.300
And if you're among
the few, the proud,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.140
the hardware developers at
I/O-- any hardware developers?

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.000
A couple?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.970
This talk is going to tell
you about the new innovations

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.220
in the smart home SDK.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.550
But before we do
any of that, Naomi

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.300
is going to tell us a
little bit about why

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.120
now is the right time for you to
invest in the Google Assistant.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.650
NAOMI MAKOFSY: All right.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.290
So we're going to start
by going back in time.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.400
I want you to think about when
you first used a computer.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.060
For some of you,
it was the '80s.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.630
Maybe you played a game,
or stored a receipt,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.750
or if it was the mid-80s,
even used a word processor.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.940
For others, it may
have been the '90s.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.800
Games were a little bit better.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.850
And you navigated via the mouse,
instead of the command line.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.640
10 years after computers
entered our home,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.890
cell phones entered
many of our hands.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.810
And by the mid to late
'90s, communication

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.820
was more portable than
it had ever been before.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.505
But it was still very early.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:37.380
You remember the days
when text messaging was

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.338
a game of back and forth
between the inbox from

00:02:39.338 --> 00:02:40.410
and the sent folders?

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.420
Yes, we've come a long way.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.020
Now another 10 years
later, in about 2007,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.760
the first smartphones
entered the market.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.340
And then mobile
computing exploded.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.020
So you may notice a trend here.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.760
About every 10
years or so, there's

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.470
a fundamental shift
in the way that we

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.650
are computing-- from
desktop, to mobile, and now

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.070
to conversation.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.490
So what does these shifts mean
for all of you, as developers?

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.720
Well, it means that you
have a lot to think about,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.570
a lot to build on, and a
whole lot to build with.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.130
And this is because
each new wave

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.470
is additive to the
one that came before.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.490
We're still clicking.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.570
We're still typing.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.830
We're still tapping.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.530
And yes, now we're also talking.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.960
We're looking for more
assistance in our daily lives,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.020
and we're turning to the devices
around us to get things done.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.710
Now, Google's approach to this
era of conversational computing

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.060
is the Google Assistant.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.220
It's a conversation
between the user and Google

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.890
that helps them get things done.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.600
In addition to the
Google Assistant,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.430
there are also
assistant-enabled devices,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.320
like Google Home,
Android phones, and more.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.710
And finally, there's
Actions on Google, which

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.270
is our third-party platform.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.850
This enables developers to
build their own experience

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.230
on the Assistant.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.020
It's an entirely new way
to engage with your users

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.720
as they're using conversation
to get their things done.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.090
And it was announced on
this very stage just three

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.950
years ago.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.780
Now in just a few
short years, we've

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.540
seen an incredible evolution
in terms of how users

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.980
are talking to the Assistant.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.990
And this presents
opportunities for developers

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.815
across the globe.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.440
Now think back to
those first use cases

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.030
on conversational platforms.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.520
They were very, very
simple and straightforward.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.279
They were limited to things
like, turn on the music,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.850
turn on the lights, turn off
the music, turn off the lights.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.070
Again, it's simple
straightforward commands

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.300
that fulfilled users' very
low and limited expectations.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.700
But there have been
three incredible shifts

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.870
in querying that have occurred
over the last couple of years.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.430
First, we're seeing
that users are

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.510
having longer conversations.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.560
In fact, query strings on
the Assistant are about 20%

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.380
longer than similar
queries on search.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.490
Second, they're
more conversational.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.000
They're 200 times more
conversational than search.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.840
So queries are going
from weather, 94043,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.150
to something like, do I
need an umbrella today?

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.550
Like you might ask a friend,
a family member, or even

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.860
a real life assistant.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.530
And third, queries
are action-oriented.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.650
It's 40 times more
action-oriented than search.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.870
So users aren't just
searching for information,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.298
but they're actually
looking to get things done.

00:05:10.298 --> 00:05:12.340
They're finding that
restaurant for Friday night,

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.660
and they're booking
that dinner reservation.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.110
And the evolution
of the query is

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.930
due to a couple of things
happening simultaneously.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.900
So first, we're seeing that
technology is improving.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.600
Natural language processing
and understanding improvements

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.310
have actually decreased
the word error

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.320
rate, which is a key metric
for speech recognition.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.610
It's now better than what
humans can understand.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.070
Simultaneously, the number
of Assistant-ready devices

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.120
has soared.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.428
So it's turned this new way of
computing into an ambient one.

00:05:40.428 --> 00:05:42.970
It's always there when we need
it, no matter what environment

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.950
we're in or what
device we're on.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.070
It's magical, but it poses
a really new challenge

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.870
for all of us,
which is how do we

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.150
reach the right user
with the right experience

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.670
in the right moment
all at the same time?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.323
So synced to a
pretty typical day.

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:58.990
We'll talk about some
of the touchpoints

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.100
where the Assistant
might be helpful.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.440
So first, you wake up.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.310
Good start.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.890
Now if you're anything
like me, you really

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.990
would love to keep your eyes
shut for that extra 20 seconds,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.690
but you also need to
kick start your day

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.820
and find out where you
need to be and when.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.903
Well, the Assistant
can help with that.

00:06:15.903 --> 00:06:17.320
Now you're waiting
for the subway.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.090
You're in a crowded,
loud station.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.890
You have a couple of
moments of idle time

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.587
before that train comes to maybe
preorder your cup of coffee

00:06:23.587 --> 00:06:25.420
or buy your friend that
birthday gift you've

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.390
been meaning to send them.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.140
The Assistant on your
mobile or your watch

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.430
can help in those
moments as well.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.310
And finally, you're
sitting on the couch

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.840
at the end of a long day.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.477
Your laptop or your mobile phone
are probably not too far away,

00:06:38.477 --> 00:06:39.810
but neither is your Google Home.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.940
It's there to help you.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.900
So across these
moments and more,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.650
Google is handling
the orchestration

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.870
that's required to
deliver that personalized

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.410
experience for the user with
the context-appropriate content.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.940
So you, as the
developer, don't have

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.640
to worry about which experience,
which device, which manner.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.140
You can just leave that to us.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.600
So what does this mean
for the developer?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.000
Well, you have more ways than
ever to be there for your user.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.090
You can reach users across
the globe in over 19 languages

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.680
across 80 countries on over
1 billion devices today

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.230
with over one million actions.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.570
But more than that,
it's actually easier

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.840
than it's ever been.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.200
And this is something we're
all really excited about.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.270
I know we're all balancing
far too many projects

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.530
for the numbers
of hours in a day.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.320
So today, we're going
to talk about how

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.810
you can get started if you
have an hour, a week, or even

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.050
an entire quarter to
build for the Assistant.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.630
We'll talk about how to
use existing ecosystems,

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.840
as well as how to build
net new for the Assistant.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.420
And we'll focus on
four major pillars.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.420
So first, we'll talk about how
to use your existing content.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.580
This leverages what you're
already doing in search.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.080
So web developers,
we're going to be

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.970
looking at you for this one.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.540
Second, we'll talk about how
to extend your existing Android

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.270
investments, leverage the
continued investments you're

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.740
making in your mobile apps.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.370
And app developers,
I heard you before.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.600
So you're going to want to
pay attention to that section.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.100
Third, we'll talk
about how to build

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.020
net new for the Assistant.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.360
So if you're an innovator
in the conversational space,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.580
we will share how
to get started.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.580
And finally hardware
developers--

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.630
saw a few hands go up before--

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.270
if you're looking to control
your existing device cloud,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.685
our Smart Home section
will appeal to all of you.

00:08:19.685 --> 00:08:22.310
Within each section, we'll talk
about what it is and how to get

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.250
started.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.450
But before we do, Dan is going
to tee up a very sweet example

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.590
that we will use throughout
the rest of our presentation.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.500
DANIEL MYERS: So a
single unifying example

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.240
that shows all
the different ways

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.490
you can use Google Assistant.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.620
Now, this gets me
thinking about two things.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.740
One, I love s'mores.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.300
I have a sweet tooth.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.770
and I'm also an engineer
here in Silicon Valley,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.900
home of tech
startups of all kinds

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.430
and the tech hub of the world.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.030
So how can I combine
my love of s'mores

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.250
and my love of technology?

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.430
Talking it over with my
colleagues, Brad and Naomi,

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.030
we thought of the idea of
using a fictional example

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.000
company that you,
as a developer,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.850
can show all of
the different ways

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.380
that Assistant can help you
and your company with things

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.150
like building a global brand
through Google Assistant,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.140
increasing your global
sales, customer growth

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.460
and acquisition, and even
things like user re-engagement,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.130
like the very important
metric of daily active users.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.340
And so the first
pillar that we have

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.080
is how you can
leverage your existing

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.048
content with Google Assistant.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.910
NAOMI MAKOFSY: So like
many of your companies,

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.910
SmoreSmores has a lot
of existing content

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.350
that's ready for the Assistant.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.340
They have a website.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.350
They have a podcast.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.740
And of course,
they have recipes,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.990
so that we can all understand
how to make that perfect

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.570
s'more at our next bonfire.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.940
Also, just like you, they
spend a great deal of time

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.792
optimizing their
site for search.

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:03.000
So we're going to talk about
how they and, of course,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.080
how you can extend existing
efforts and optimizations

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.450
to the Google Assistant.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.930
Now, Google's presented ways
to optimize your content

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.670
for search since the '90s.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.860
We work hard to understand
the content of a page,

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.170
but we also take explicit
cues from developers

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.500
who share details about their
site via structured data.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.570
Structured data is a
standardized format

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.670
for providing information
about a web page

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.010
and classifying
that page content.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.480
For example, on a
recipe page, you

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.180
can disambiguate the ingredients
from the cooking time,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.190
the temperature, the
calories, and so on.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.460
And because of this markup,
we can provide users

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.680
with richer content on
the search results page,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.870
answers to questions,
and a whole lot more.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.372
And this brings Google search
beyond just 10 blue links.

00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:46.330
And over the last year,
we've been hard at work

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.230
to enhance the Google
search experience

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.250
and enable developers to extend
their content from search

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.280
to other Google properties,
like the Assistant.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.370
So for sites with
content in popular areas,

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.507
like news, podcasts,
and recipes,

00:10:59.507 --> 00:11:01.090
we have structured
data markup to make

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.640
your content available
in richer ways on search.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.340
And those same optimizations
that you make for search

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.370
will also help your content
be both discoverable and

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.360
accessible on the Assistant.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.830
And it's just standard RSS.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.090
You've seen this before.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.250
And that's the approach
we've always taken.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.260
We're using industry
standards and ensuring

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.230
those optimizations are ready
for search and the Assistant

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.970
too.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.140
And I'm so excited now to
announce two brand new programs

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.010
that we're adding--

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.330
how-to to guides and FAQs.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.780
So the additional optimizations
that you make for search

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.970
will soon yield a
richer experience

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.520
and an automatic extension
to the Assistant.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.980
Let's dive into each.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.230
So how-to guides
enable developers

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.940
to mark up their
how-to content and make

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.390
it discoverable to users on
both search and the Assistant.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.000
What displays is then a
step-by-step guide to the user

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.630
on anything from how to change
a flat tire to, of course,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.280
how to make that perfect s'more.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.130
So on the left here, you can
see a nice image-based preview

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.710
of the how-to content
in SmoreSmores site.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.750
It allows the user to
engage with your brand

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.220
further upstream
in their journey.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.810
And it differentiates
your results

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.370
on the search results page.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.120
And if you don't have
images, don't worry.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.450
We have a text-based version
of this feature as well.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.410
Now on the right, you can see
the full guided experience

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.220
on a home hub device, again,
all powered by the same markup

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.830
on SmoreSmores site.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.590
Now the best thing about
creating a step-by-step guide

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.590
is that you actually don't
have to be technical to do so.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.890
Now I know we're at I/O, and
I/O is a developers conference.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.400
But if you have one hour to
dip your toes in the Assistant

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.620
pool, and you don't
have a developer who

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.920
can devote the time to adding
the markup, don't worry.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.440
We have ways for you to get
your content onto the Assistant,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.870
even as simply as
using a spreadsheet.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.560
So now, you can combine
your existing YouTube

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.840
how-to videos and a
simple spreadsheet

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.270
and actions console to get
a guided how-to experience

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.940
across many
Assistant-enabled devices.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.600
So smoresmores.com now has two
ways for how they can get there

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.720
step-by-step guides on how to
make that perfect s'more onto

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.773
the Assistant.

00:13:04.773 --> 00:13:06.690
If they have a developer
with some extra time,

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.010
they can add the markup.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.630
Or they can use a
simple spreadsheet

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.040
to extend their existing
YouTube content.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.270
Now, we're going to
switch gears a little.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.250
I want you to think about
how many times you've

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.763
turned to search for
answers to questions.

00:13:19.763 --> 00:13:21.680
Maybe some of you are
even doing it right now.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.678
That's OK.

00:13:22.678 --> 00:13:24.720
Maybe you're trying to
find out the return policy

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.460
to your favorite
store, or if there's

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.680
a delivery fee for your
favorite restaurant,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.100
blackout dates for travel--

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.590
the list truly goes on and on.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.670
Well, our FAQs markup enables
a rich answer experience

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.060
on search, giving users answers
directly from your customer

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.350
service page.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.570
So the same
optimization will then

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.580
enable queries on the
Assistant to be answered

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.610
by the markup you already did.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.420
And it's so easy to implement.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.350
So when a user queries
something like what's

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.540
SmoreSmores delivery
fee on the Assistant,

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.040
Google will soon
be able to render

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.575
the answer from that same markup
on your customer service page.

00:14:00.575 --> 00:14:02.700
And here's some developers
that have already gotten

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.660
started with FAQs
and how-to guides.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.920
And we'd love to have you
join us tomorrow at 10:30

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.012
in the morning to
learn more about how

00:14:10.012 --> 00:14:11.970
to enhance your search
and Assistant's presence

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.312
with structured data.

00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:15.270
Of course, the talk will
also be live-streamed,

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.190
or you can catch it
later on YouTube.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.800
So as you've seen, there
are three main ways

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.090
that smoresmores.com and you
can leverage existing content.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.700
First, you can ensure the
hygiene of your structured data

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.000
markup for podcasts,
news, or recipe content.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.660
You can add the new FAQs markup
to your customer service site.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.300
Or you can use the new
template to bring your content

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.720
to the Google Assistant.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.580
We're so excited about
the ways that we're

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.500
making it even
easier for developers

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.010
to extend existing content
from search to the Assistant.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.560
But we're also making it
even easier for companies

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.710
to engage their existing
ecosystems, like Android.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.362
So let's talk more
about App Actions.

00:14:54.362 --> 00:14:55.320
BRAD ABRAMS: All right.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.550
Thank you.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.480
How about that sun, huh?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.672
You enjoying the
sun in Shoreline?

00:15:00.672 --> 00:15:02.130
I can't see anything
without these,

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.930
so I'm going to go with this.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.310
So where are my Android
developers again?

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.480
Android developers?

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.380
Yes.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.590
Just like many of you,
the SmoreSmores Company

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.600
has a popular Android app.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.210
They want to make it as
easy to order s'mores

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.720
as it is to enjoy them.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.560
But just like many of you,
they face the high cost

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.520
of driving app installs,
coupled with the reality

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.980
that users are using fewer
and fewer apps each year.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.940
The sea of icons found
on many users' phones

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.400
might be a contributing factor.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.800
It's hard for users
to remember your icon,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.090
and much less find it.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:49.220
What we need is a new way
for users to find and launch

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.430
your Android apps, one
that's focused more

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:58.990
on what users are trying to do,
rather than what icon to click.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.370
Last year at I/O, we gave a
sneak peek at App Actions,

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.980
a simple way for
Android developers

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.930
to connect their apps with the
helpfulness of the Assistant.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.450
And with the Google Assistant
on nearly one billion Android

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.240
phones, App Actions
is a great way for you

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.130
to reconnect with your users.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:23.350
App Actions uses Google's
natural language understanding

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.750
technology, so
it's easy for users

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.080
to naturally invoke
your application.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.620
And finally, App Actions
doesn't just launch your app,

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.900
it launches deeply
into your app.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.680
So we fast-forward users
right to the good parts.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.440
Now to help you
understand this concept,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.870
let's walk through an
example, of course,

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.330
using our SmoreSmores app.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.160
Let's first take a look at how
this looks the traditional way.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.980
So first, of course, I
find the SmoreSmores app

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.660
in the sea of icons.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.490
Does anybody see it?

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.070
Next, I select the cracker.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.940
OK, that makes sense.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.589
And then I have to
choose in marshmallow.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:07.970
All right.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:12.260
And then I get to pick the
chocolate and, of course,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.720
the toast level.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.440
OK, I've got to say
how many I want.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.300
That's important too.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.560
And then finally, I can
review my order and confirm.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.069
Now that's a long
intent-to-fulfillment chain.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.720
It's a long way
from my first had

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.180
the desire for a warm
delicious s'mores

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.670
before I got it
successfully ordered.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.670
And that means there's
opportunities for drop-off

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.040
all along the way.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.800
Now, let's take a look
at what this looks

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.710
like once SmoreSmores
has enabled App Actions.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.250
First, you'll notice I
get to naturally invoke

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.870
the app with just my voice.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.350
I can say, order one milk
chocolate from SmoreSmores.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.620
And then immediately, we
jump right to the good part

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.320
of this application,
confirming that order.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.900
Notice, we got all the
parameters correct.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.720
And then we just
confirm, and we're done.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.590
We're ordered.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:07.130
It's a short path from when I
had the intent for the warm,

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.030
delicious s'more before
I got it ordered.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.000
But of course, we didn't
build App Actions just

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.220
for building s'mores.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.230
We had a few partners
that have already

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.180
started to look at App Actions.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.970
So for example, I can
say to the Assistant,

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.202
order a maple glazed
donut from Dunkin' Donuts.

00:18:27.202 --> 00:18:28.910
Of course, I might
need to work that off,

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:33.050
so I can say, start a
run on Nike Run Club.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.650
And I might want to settle that
bet from last night by saying,

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.660
send $50 to Naomi on PayPal.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.590
So let's take a look, though,
at what enables this technology.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.450
What's going on under
the covers here?

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.510
Foundationally at
Google, we connect

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.630
users that express some
intent with third-parties

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.330
that can fulfill it.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.000
And App Actions is the mechanism
that you, as app developers,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.200
can use to indicate what
your Android app can do.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.670
Each built-in intent
represents an atomic thing

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.130
a user could want
to do, including

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.690
all possible arguments for that.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.470
So you just need to implement
that built-in intent

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.830
and handle the arguments
that we pass to you.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.830
The cool thing about
built-in intents

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.380
is that they model
all the different Waze

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.700
users might express an intent.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.600
For example, these are
the ways users could say,

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.320
start an exercise.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.320
Notice, as an app
developer, you don't

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.450
need to handle all
of this complexity

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.210
with these different
kinds of grammar.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.980
We handle all of that for you.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.340
You just implement
the built-in intent.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.350
So speaking of which,
let's take a look

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:50.320
at how it looks for you, as a
developer, to implement that.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.370
Well, the first thing you'll
do is open up Android Studio

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.370
and add an actions.xml file.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.060
You notice on that second line
there it's, ORDER_MENU_ITEM.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.980
That is the name of
the built-in intent

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.310
that we have implemented
for our SmoreSmores app.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.440
And then in that
fulfillment line,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.140
you'll notice a
custom schema URL.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.630
So you could, of course,
use an HTTPS URL as well.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.050
This just tells us
where in the application

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.780
we should fast forward into.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.690
And then you'll notice we
map the arguments there.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.520
So the menuItem.name
is the argument name

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.690
from the built-in intent.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:33.340
And then notice our URL is
expecting the item name.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.200
And then finally at
the bottom there,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.330
we're giving some inventory.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.100
What are the kinds
of things users

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.680
might say for this application?

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.230
And just for brevity,
I put THE_USUAL.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:49.540
Now we just need to handle
that in our onCreate function.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.040
So very simply, we parse
that item name parameter out

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.330
of the URL.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.400
We check to see if
it's that identifier.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.330
And if so, we just
prepopulate the UI

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.380
with exactly what we want.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.990
This is a very
simple integration

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.331
that you can get done very
quickly on the Assistant.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:15.930
So the good news is that you can
build and test with App Actions

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.880
starting today.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.110
We're releasing built-in intents
in these four categories--

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.590
in finance, food ordering,
ride sharing, and fitness.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.650
So if your app is in
one of those categories,

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.523
you can build and
test right now.

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:32.940
And of course, the
team is already

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.190
working on the next
set of intents.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.920
So if you have ideas or thoughts
on what intent would be great,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.100
we'd love it if you gave
us feedback at this URL.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.880
But there's one more thing.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.530
App Actions and built-in
intents also enables slices.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.160
Slices is a way that you,
as an Android developer,

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.360
can create a declarative version
of part of your application

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.790
and embed it into
Google surfaces,

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.470
like the Google Assistant.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.850
So in this case, we're
implementing the Track Order

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.140
built-in intent.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.470
And then you can
see inline there,

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:16.850
that's our Android slice showing
up right in line in the Google

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.620
Assistant, making
it quick and easy

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.540
for users to get
that information.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.430
And then launch into
your app, if they need

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.930
more advanced functionality.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.410
So what did we see here?

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.310
You can enable users to invoke
your app with just their voice

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.080
with App Actions.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.120
There is a simple
integration model.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.360
All you need to do is map
the intents in your app

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.330
to a common set of
built-in intents.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.950
And then the good
news is you can

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.850
build and test starting today,
with more intents coming soon.

00:22:49.916 --> 00:22:53.470
DANIEL MYERS: So we've seen how
you can leverage your existing

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.530
content with Google Assistant.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.740
We've seen how you can integrate
your Android applications

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.390
with Google Assistant.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.940
Now I want to talk about
conversation, specifically

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.730
conversation
actions, that is how

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.090
you can build new custom
experiences for the Google

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.860
Assistant.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.310
So why are conversation
actions so important?

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:21.340
Well for one, it's a way
that you can natively control

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.450
the device's capabilities.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.720
So if the device has a
screen, show an image.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.400
If the device supports
touch, show a suggestion chip

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.110
that they can tap.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.290
It's a way that you can
increase your brand awareness

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:39.460
through things like custom
dialog and agent personas.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.860
You can grow your
user re-engagement

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.130
through well-crafted
conversation design and things

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.780
like action links.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.660
And furthermore, you can
drive habits and interactions

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.090
with features like
routines, daily updates,

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.600
and push notifications.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.970
Now what exactly are
conversation actions?

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.800
It's the idea that
you, as a developer,

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.460
have full control
over the dialogue,

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.610
the back and forth
of what's said.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.070
This is distinctly
different than that

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.550
of App Actions or content
actions or even smart home

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.280
actions where you have
some type of fixed markup,

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.740
or maybe you're using a
built-in intent, something

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:21.120
that somehow defines already
the material that you're

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.070
trying to access.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.110
Google Assistant takes
that fixed markup

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.590
and adjusts it, applies its own
natural language understanding,

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.870
and matches what the
user says automatically

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.940
to the access of that material.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.360
With conversation
actions, that's flipped.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.990
You, as a developer,
define custom intents.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:45.690
You define the types of
phrases that a user might say

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.880
to match that customer intent.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.510
You even define the information
that you want extracted out

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.190
of what they say for
those same intents.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.530
So with conversation actions,
we need some type of tool

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.390
that can help us do this.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.690
And that is Dialogflow.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.410
Out-of-the-box, it
provides two key elements--

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:15.260
the concept of user intent, or
what the user actually wants,

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.450
and the concept of
entity abstraction,

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.730
the way that you
glean information out

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.060
of what they say.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:26.290
Let's dive in a little
bit with a small example.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.390
So we take s'mores--

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.710
I would like a large
s'more with dark chocolate.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.040
And I want it to go.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.710
Dialogflow can take
this phrase as a whole

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.980
and match it to the user intent,
that they want to purchase

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.210
a snack of some kind.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.530
Now you see here a few words
highlighted in the sentence.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.000
Large-- Dialogflow
can understand

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.670
that they want a large snack.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.560
S'more-- the type of snack.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.240
Dark chocolate-- the
topping of that snack.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.680
And they want it to go, rather
than for delivery or for there.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.740
So when we take a look at
this at a sequence of dialogue

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.170
and expand it a little
bit more, the user

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.490
might say something like,
hey G talk to SmoreSmores.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.740
SmoreSmores, in this case,
is the invocation name

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.690
of your action.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.360
Google Assistant
takes that audio,

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.930
transcribes it into text,
applies its natural language

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.130
understanding, and invokes
your conversation action.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.650
From that point forward,
it's between you,

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.200
as a developer, and
Dialogflow that's controlling

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.340
the responses back to the user.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.450
And so let's take a
look at a live demo.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:48.980
Here, I have Dialogflow
and a few intents

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.410
that I've already defined.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:53.840
I have a s'more shop where
you can order a snack.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.850
You can order whatever you
last ordered, a gift card.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.970
And so let's take a deeper
look into ordering a snack.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.680
When I look at this,
I have a things.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.200
I have my contexts.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.840
I have my training phrases
that I've already supplied.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.210
These are the phrases that
I think, as a developer,

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.380
the user might say that
matches the intent of them

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.760
wanting to purchase
a snack of some kind.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.540
If I scroll down, I can
see the types of parameters

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.660
and the relating entities
of those parameters--

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.300
specifically things
like delivery pickup,

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.440
the type of snack, the size of
the snack, toppings, et cetera.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.720
Now if I scroll
down further, you'll

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.740
see the responses that I've
created as well that reference

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.880
the entities that
I've also defined.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.710
If I scroll down even further,
you'll see the fulfillment.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.870
If I wanted to have
a custom fulfillment,

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:51.140
I can have a standard web hook
call for this type of intent.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.630
Now let's look at
an example here.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:28:03.050
If I say, one large s'more
with milk chocolate,

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:07.650
you'll notice instantly, without
additional input from me,

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.270
Dialogflow has highlighted
several key elements within

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.680
this phrase.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.100
Large-- it knows that's the
size of the snack that I want.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.570
S'more-- the type of snack.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.903
Chocolate-- type of milk.

00:28:19.903 --> 00:28:20.570
So there you go.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.310
That's pretty powerful stuff.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.280
Now let's take a look
at it in the phrase

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.260
of a full conversation.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:33.380
If I say, I would like to
order a large s'more with dark

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:40.710
chocolate, instantly it
gets the information.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.720
It has the various contexts.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.050
It matched it to the
intent of ordering a snack.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:50.370
And we scroll down, it also
still has the various entities

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.380
and parameters that
it's extracted.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.750
Now the default response
here is that I've

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:59.340
defined a required parameter
of delivery or pickup.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.070
And so it's asking me, will
it be for delivery or pickup?

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.437
I respond, delivery.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.660
And there you go.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.300
It understands you've ordered
a large dark chocolate

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.670
s'more, and you want
it for delivery.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.720
There you go.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.897
So this is powerful stuff
for Google Assistant.

00:29:18.897 --> 00:29:20.230
Now let's go back to the slides.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:31.970
Here, what we have is a
way to build conversation.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:34.730
Now Google Assistant
supports a huge array

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.200
of devices and surfaces.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.900
And we want to be able
to scale across them all.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.110
Different devices support
different capabilities.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.060
A smart speaker is voice-only.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.370
A car-- voice forward.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.720
It has a screen, but you still
want to have voice control.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.860
To intermodal, like
your cell phone.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.740
To maybe your smart watch,
which is screen-only.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.080
We need some type
of feature that

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.830
can fully utilize the screen.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.850
And in the case of
SmoreSmores, they

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.760
want to be able to build
a rich game, something

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.533
that's voice first, custom
full-screen visuals.

00:30:08.533 --> 00:30:10.700
They want to build a turn
based battle system that's

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.130
multiple surface and supports
all these different kinds.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:18.830
So today, I'm happy to announce
the brand new API called,

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.970
Interactive Canvas.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.080
This is an API that
enables pixel-level control

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.842
of rendering any HTML,
any CSS, and JavaScript.

00:30:27.842 --> 00:30:28.550
Let me reiterate.

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:32.900
That is a full web view
running on the device.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.080
It supports full-screen
visuals, animations,

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.561
even video playback.

00:30:37.561 --> 00:30:42.870
Now, it wouldn't be Google
I/O without another live demo.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.860
Let's take a look here.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.730
What I have is a hub.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:52.200
And for this demo, I'm going to
need some audience interaction

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.740
here.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.870
I'm going to be
playing a trivia game,

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.800
and it's going to be a
really hard question.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.950
So I need you guys
all to scream out

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:03.080
as loud as you can the
answer to this question.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.530
Hey, Google.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.985
Play HQ University.

00:31:11.223 --> 00:31:12.390
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: All right.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.714
Here's HQ University.

00:31:13.714 --> 00:31:14.381
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:17.150
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:18.310
- Oh, hi there.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.110
Scott Rogowsky here.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.600
Recognize this voice?

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.820
It's the voice of HQ Trivia.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:28.950
Yes, that's me, the host,
Quiz Khalifa, Host Malone,

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.170
the [INAUDIBLE] Trebek.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.540
And I'm here to welcome
you to HQ University.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.880
You've been accepted
into this elite program

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.490
to help smarten up and
sharpen up your trivia

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.370
skills to help you win HQ.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:43.327
The rules are very simple.

00:31:43.327 --> 00:31:44.910
My assistant, Alfredo,
is going to ask

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:49.230
you a series of questions
that, just like HQ, start easy

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.490
and get harder.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:54.020
You will respond with the
answer you think is correct.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.270
And the HQ universe
will reward you.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.620
Let's get down to
the nitty-gritty.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.620
Let's get this show
on the road, baby.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.730
Alfredo, hit him with
qumero numero uno.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:06.360
- Ready.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.500
Question 1-- if you put on a
hoodie, what type of clothing

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.970
are you wearing?

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.943
Your choices are-- cloak,
sweatshirt, or cape.

00:32:15.943 --> 00:32:17.859
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:17.859 --> 00:32:19.317
DANIEL MYERS: So
what's the answer?

00:32:19.317 --> 00:32:20.722
AUDIENCE: Sweatshirt.

00:32:20.722 --> 00:32:21.764
DANIEL MYERS: Sweatshirt?

00:32:26.704 --> 00:32:27.700
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.510
- Yeah, baby.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.037
You did it.

00:32:29.037 --> 00:32:29.620
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.670
DANIEL MYERS: We did it.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.580
Awesome.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.860
So that is Interactive
Canvas, a way

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:42.200
that you can build full-screen
visuals and custom animations.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.360
So how does something
like this work?

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.840
Well first off, we have to start
with a regular conversation

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.690
action where the user says
something to the device.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.730
That in turn goes to the
Actions on Google Platform,

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:55.760
in turn to Dialogflow,
and finally

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.220
your custom fulfillment.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:01.040
Your fulfillment supplies
a certain type of response.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.400
In this case, it needs to
supply a rich response.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.640
When we add the web
application to Canvas,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.560
it supplies an
immersive response

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:15.000
which tells the Google
Home to load the web app.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.220
Your web application in turn has
a specific JavaScript library

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.010
called, the
Interactive Canvas API.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.840
Let's look at some
code for this.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.530
When we look at this, this
is the custom fulfillment.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.360
You can see here, I have
the default welcome intent

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.100
that's supplying a new
immersive response that

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.470
supplies the URL of
the web application

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:43.070
and the initial state
of that web application.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:46.000
What does this look like on
the web application side?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.880
Well when we see this,
there's two main elements

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.690
that you need to include.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.230
There's the CSS style sheet--

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.450
this supplies the
specific padding

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.520
for the header on the devices
and things like that--

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.690
and then the actual
JavaScript library.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:06.180
This library itself manages the
state of your web application

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.520
with the state of
the conversation,

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.969
so that you can
control both in unison.

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:16.540
So some key takeaways
around conversation

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.900
is that Dialogflow is the tool
for developers to where you

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.330
can build custom conversations.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.449
You control the back and
forth of your dialogue.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.989
And two, we've announced
the Interactive Canvas API,

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:32.699
the pixel-level control
over the display for games

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:38.469
where you can run any HTML,
any CSS, and any JavaScript.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.739
Now, I want to switch
it up a little bit,

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:43.290
talk about smart home,
the ability for you

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:47.600
to control any hardware
with your voice.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.659
Now traditionally,
smart home has

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.699
been all about
cloud-to-cloud communication.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.330
So when I turn on my
Philips Hue light bulbs,

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.460
what's actually happening
is that Google Assistant

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.490
takes in the audio,
transcribes it into text,

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.470
applies natural
language understanding,

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:06.490
and sends a specific response
to Philips Hues servers.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.430
Philips Hue, in turn,
controls the light bulb.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:15.710
And so now, I'm glad
to announce a new API--

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.290
the Local Home SDK.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:22.730
This provides new local
control over your devices

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.390
with post-assistance latency
of under 200 milliseconds.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.530
Supports local discovery
protocols, like UDP broadcasts,

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.850
mDNS UPnP.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.890
For actually
controlling devices--

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.440
UDP, TCP, and HTTPS.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.370
Now with Smart Home, there's
device types and device traits.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.500
It supports all of
them out of the box,

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.900
with the exception of
two-factor authentication.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.840
Now my favorite
part is that it's

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.930
come as you are,
meaning you don't

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.540
need to change the embedded
code on your device

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.118
for the messages.

00:35:55.118 --> 00:35:56.660
What's actually
happening is that you

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:03.010
develop a JavaScript application
that runs on the home device.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.200
That's pretty awesome.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.730
So let's take a look
at how this works.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.320
When the user says
something like,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.750
hey, G turn on
the lights, again,

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.700
that audio's sent up
to Google Assistant.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.230
Transcribes it into text.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.720
Applies natural
language understanding.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.520
Google Assistant creates
a execution intent

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.060
and sends this intent, this
structured JSON response,

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:31.350
down to the Google Home
where the home is running

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.150
your JavaScript application.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.430
Your JavaScript
application in turn

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.590
understands the intent
of trying to turn it

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:42.880
on with the exact device
ID, things like that,

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.970
and constructs the
specific message

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.590
that your device supports--

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.000
in turn, turning on the light.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:01.080
So I want to show more
traits and more types today.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.090
We're always adding
more device types

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.030
that we support with
the Smart Home APIs.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.430
And today, we're
releasing even more

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.260
with things like
Open Close, StartStop

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.350
with zones, Lock
Unlock, even devices

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.820
and types like your door,
boiler, garage door.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.800
Now again, we're adding
these all the time.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.340
And today, we're releasing
a huge number more.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:30.530
So I want to show now how
SmoreSmores can use Smart Home.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.300
So what I have here
is a toaster oven.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.660
Some of you might have already
seen this up here and wondering

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.110
what it's used for.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:42.640
So I have a toaster oven
here with, inside of it,

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.100
some s'mores that I want to eat
and I want to toast perfectly.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:53.950
I also have a Google AIY Vision
Kit which, inside of that,

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.710
is a Raspberry Pi 0.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:01.810
And I'm using this to control
the power to this toaster oven.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.150
And so let's take a look.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:09.380
Hey, Google, turn on
my s'mores toaster.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.433
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: OK,
turning s'mores toaster on.

00:38:11.433 --> 00:38:12.350
DANIEL MYERS: Awesome.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.030
So there you have it--

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.970
a smart home device that's
being controlled via voice

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:18.920
with Google Assistant.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:24.670
And so let's recap
some key takeaways.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.420
One, we announced
the Local Home SDK

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.030
where you can control
real world devices using

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:33.340
local Wi-Fi with your voice.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.410
And second, we've
announced a huge number

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.570
of new traits and device types.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.820
These are available
today that you

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.190
can use in your own devices.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.558
And so what to do next.

00:38:45.558 --> 00:38:46.600
NAOMI MAKOFSY: All right.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.940
So we have covered
a lot today, but we

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.880
are so excited to
share with you all

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.210
of the ways you can get started
building your first action.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.310
So to quickly recap, you can use
your web content and leverage

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.650
what you're already
doing in search.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.280
You can use App Actions and
leverage the Android ecosystem

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.260
you're already participating in.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.200
You can build a custom
experience for the Assistant

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.660
by building a
conversation action,

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.420
or you can extend your hardware
and build smart home actions

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.300
to control the devices
around your home.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.080
But this is just the beginning.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.840
There are 12 more
sessions this week

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.510
that will dive into topics we
only had a chance to introduce

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.680
in our time together today.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.400
So these additional talks will
be geared toward Android app

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.420
developers, web developers,
hardware developers, or anyone

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.000
who just wants to learn how
to build with conversation

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.860
or some insights around
this new ecosystem.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.910
So please check them out live,
watch them on the live stream,

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.400
or of course, tune
in later on YouTube.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.070
Now for those of you
here with us this week,

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.670
we have a Sandbox outback,
Office Hours, and a Codelab.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:51.280
Now, I think I heard
our toaster is ready.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.440
So it's time for us
to go enjoy s'mores.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.213
But visit our developer
site, talk to us on Twitter.

00:39:57.213 --> 00:39:59.380
And we can't wait to see
the rest of I/O. Thank you,

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.670
so much, for joining us today.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.553
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:01.553 --> 00:40:02.470
DANIEL MYERS: Bye-bye.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.370
Thank you.

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.820
