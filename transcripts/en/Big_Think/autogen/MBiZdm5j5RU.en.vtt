00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.709
the one thing that impresses me every

the one thing that impresses me every
 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.000
the one thing that impresses me every
time I go into the sea and it should

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
time I go into the sea and it should
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.120

impress everyone is the abundance of

life the ocean is not just rocks and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
life the ocean is not just rocks and
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.970

it's all about water and water of course

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500
it's all about water and water of course
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.270

but because most of Earth's water is
