what professor Wallace doctor also said
this morning about the importance of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
this morning about the importance of
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.580
this morning about the importance of
really keeping that a equals B dynamic

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590
really keeping that a equals B dynamic

really keeping that a equals B dynamic
it is so important to make sure that we

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
it is so important to make sure that we
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.689
it is so important to make sure that we
are talking to each other that we

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
are talking to each other that we
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.849
are talking to each other that we
engaging in dialogue that we are really

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
engaging in dialogue that we are really
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.670
engaging in dialogue that we are really
addressing all of the issues on an equal

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
addressing all of the issues on an equal
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.149
addressing all of the issues on an equal
basis that we are not looking at the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
basis that we are not looking at the
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.920
basis that we are not looking at the
hierarchy and as I decided to create a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
hierarchy and as I decided to create a
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.760
hierarchy and as I decided to create a
copper coil focus on familiar I'll

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
copper coil focus on familiar I'll
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.440
copper coil focus on familiar I'll
charge you to really think about what

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
charge you to really think about what
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.899
charge you to really think about what
that actually means focus on failure we

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
that actually means focus on failure we
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.700
that actually means focus on failure we
could look at it in two different ways

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
could look at it in two different ways
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190
could look at it in two different ways
we could say we're focusing on the areas

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
we could say we're focusing on the areas
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899
we could say we're focusing on the areas
that don't work just for the sake of it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
that don't work just for the sake of it
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.780
that don't work just for the sake of it
giving us all the opportunities to make

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
giving us all the opportunities to make
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.240
giving us all the opportunities to make
excuses for what we are unable to do

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
excuses for what we are unable to do
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.490
excuses for what we are unable to do
because of lack of funding because of

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
because of lack of funding because of
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.429
because of lack of funding because of
lack of staff to available to do what

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
lack of staff to available to do what
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410
lack of staff to available to do what
they need to do because of many

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
they need to do because of many
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539
they need to do because of many
different reasons however I really

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
different reasons however I really
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.100
different reasons however I really
challenge you to look at the second

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
challenge you to look at the second
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.170
challenge you to look at the second
component of that because when we're

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
component of that because when we're
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.450
component of that because when we're
focusing on failure it's really looking

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
focusing on failure it's really looking
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.039
focusing on failure it's really looking
at the different opportunities that we

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
at the different opportunities that we
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.080
at the different opportunities that we
may have to find oil

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
may have to find oil
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.810
may have to find oil
areas where we have weaknesses I really

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
areas where we have weaknesses I really
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789
areas where we have weaknesses I really
take those weaknesses and create some

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
take those weaknesses and create some
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.740
take those weaknesses and create some
strings from that we're going to look at

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
strings from that we're going to look at
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690
strings from that we're going to look at
the areas that haven't worked and then

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
the areas that haven't worked and then
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730
the areas that haven't worked and then
change those so that we could learn from

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
change those so that we could learn from
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.950
change those so that we could learn from
them gain experience from them and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
them gain experience from them and
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.779
them gain experience from them and
collaborate with other groups in order

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789
collaborate with other groups in order
 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.219
collaborate with other groups in order
to make the real models of success if we

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
to make the real models of success if we
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.869
to make the real models of success if we
start looking at what those models of

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
start looking at what those models of
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.699
start looking at what those models of
success are looking at two kinds of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
success are looking at two kinds of
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.949
success are looking at two kinds of
failures and we know that they're those

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959
failures and we know that they're those
 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.320
failures and we know that they're those
who think and never do theoretical

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330
who think and never do theoretical
 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.490
who think and never do theoretical
constructs are really important we need

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500
constructs are really important we need
 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.410
constructs are really important we need
to know what's behind it we need to be

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
to know what's behind it we need to be
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.870
to know what's behind it we need to be
able to plan things appropriately

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880
able to plan things appropriately
 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.059
able to plan things appropriately
however if we remain forever in the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069
however if we remain forever in the
 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.430
however if we remain forever in the
planning stage and we are afraid to take

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
planning stage and we are afraid to take
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.559
planning stage and we are afraid to take
the next step to implement those things

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569
the next step to implement those things
 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.720
the next step to implement those things
that we're actually planning then it's

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730
that we're actually planning then it's
 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.190
that we're actually planning then it's
really a moot point what are we actually

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
really a moot point what are we actually
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.619
really a moot point what are we actually
accomplishing we're really not able to

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629
accomplishing we're really not able to
 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.289
accomplishing we're really not able to
learn because as we know from all of the

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299
learn because as we know from all of the
 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.520
learn because as we know from all of the
different discussions that have taken

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
different discussions that have taken
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.369
different discussions that have taken
place many things that happened that

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379
place many things that happened that
 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.569
place many things that happened that
were able to put together theoretically

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579
were able to put together theoretically
 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.720
were able to put together theoretically
are really not able to be we're not able

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
are really not able to be we're not able
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.819
are really not able to be we're not able
to fix them we're not able to evolve

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829
to fix them we're not able to evolve
 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.589
to fix them we're not able to evolve
with them we're not able to change them

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599
with them we're not able to change them
 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.170
with them we're not able to change them
without the opportunity to really

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
without the opportunity to really
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.750
without the opportunity to really
practice what we are talking about to

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
practice what we are talking about to
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.370
practice what we are talking about to
really focus on some of those different

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380
really focus on some of those different
 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.309
really focus on some of those different
areas and using all of those things

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319
areas and using all of those things
 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.440
areas and using all of those things
those failures those things that have

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450
those failures those things that have
 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.240
those failures those things that have
not worked well to really move forward

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
not worked well to really move forward
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.699
not worked well to really move forward
and propel us in another area and then

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709
and propel us in another area and then
 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.030
and propel us in another area and then
again those who did and never thought we

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
again those who did and never thought we
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.410
again those who did and never thought we
are talking about health disparities

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
are talking about health disparities
 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.099
are talking about health disparities
we're talking about all of the different

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109
we're talking about all of the different
 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.960
we're talking about all of the different
the cultural issues the many things that

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
the cultural issues the many things that
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.390
the cultural issues the many things that
are closed barriers for people to

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400
are closed barriers for people to
 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.849
are closed barriers for people to
receive the services that they need

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859
receive the services that they need
 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.319
receive the services that they need
however when we do things without

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329
however when we do things without
 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.589
however when we do things without
thinking it is the formula for failure

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599
thinking it is the formula for failure
 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.629
thinking it is the formula for failure
and we want to make sure that not only

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639
and we want to make sure that not only
 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.400
and we want to make sure that not only
do we take the time to think about it

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410
do we take the time to think about it
 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.930
do we take the time to think about it
and organize things that need to be

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940
and organize things that need to be
 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.030
and organize things that need to be
organized but then we also take the time

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
organized but then we also take the time
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.800
organized but then we also take the time
to take those things and put them to

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
to take those things and put them to
 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.300
to take those things and put them to
practice so that we make the work so it

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310
practice so that we make the work so it
 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.520
practice so that we make the work so it
really becomes the balance of the two

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530
really becomes the balance of the two
 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.320
really becomes the balance of the two
and as remember that

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330
and as remember that
 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
and as remember that
there are two benefits to the failure

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340
there are two benefits to the failure
 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.610
there are two benefits to the failure
first that it gives us the opportunity

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620
first that it gives us the opportunity
 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.400
first that it gives us the opportunity
for to find out what does it work we try

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410
for to find out what does it work we try
 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.290
for to find out what does it work we try
this we try to win a certain population

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300
this we try to win a certain population
 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.020

maybe was a great formula when working

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030
maybe was a great formula when working
 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.200
maybe was a great formula when working
with children when working with one

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210

special population when working with the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460
special population when working with the
 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.730
special population when working with the
highest population but when we tried

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740
highest population but when we tried
 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.970
highest population but when we tried
that same formula that same plan and we

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980
that same formula that same plan and we
 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.940
that same formula that same plan and we
work with a homeless population where an

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950
work with a homeless population where an
 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.830
work with a homeless population where an
adult population we find that it may not

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840
adult population we find that it may not
 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.380
adult population we find that it may not
work so well so it is really again

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390
work so well so it is really again
 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.310
work so well so it is really again
taking the idea and telling the program

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
taking the idea and telling the program
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.990

to the population that we're working

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
to the population that we're working
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.880
to the population that we're working
with and secondly it gives us the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890
with and secondly it gives us the
 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.220
with and secondly it gives us the
opportunity to try a new approach if it

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230
opportunity to try a new approach if it
 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.230
opportunity to try a new approach if it
didn't get work this way let's try it a

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240
didn't get work this way let's try it a
 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.330
didn't get work this way let's try it a
different way let's modify it just that

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
different way let's modify it just that
 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.070
different way let's modify it just that
little bit to make sure that we're

different ideas different needs but when
we're working with organizations do we

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:10.369
we're working with organizations do we
 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.709
we're working with organizations do we
actually turn around and look at

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719
actually turn around and look at
 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.079
actually turn around and look at
ourselves as staff members what do we

ourselves as staff members what do we
need to do within the organization to

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979
need to do within the organization to
 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.759
need to do within the organization to
make sure that those programs are not a

an idea from them our third from them so
 

00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:41.829
an idea from them our third from them so
that it becomes a very collaborative

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.190
budgets you realize that there's a lot
of spending that goes on everything from

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200
of spending that goes on everything from
 

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.100
of spending that goes on everything from
incentives to program a management that

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.110
incentives to program a management that
 

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.390
incentives to program a management that
does not have to deal with the actual

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:17.400
does not have to deal with the actual
 

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.270
does not have to deal with the actual
salary of an individual and sometimes we

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:20.280
salary of an individual and sometimes we
 

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.100
salary of an individual and sometimes we
may not lose people that we lose our

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.110
may not lose people that we lose our
 

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.530
may not lose people that we lose our
ability to have programs because we

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:24.540
ability to have programs because we
 

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.150
ability to have programs because we
don't have that other than personal

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:26.160
don't have that other than personal
 

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.890
don't have that other than personal
funding and that core so becomes an

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:27.900
funding and that core so becomes an
 

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.840
funding and that core so becomes an
issue but again it's about rising above

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:29.850
issue but again it's about rising above
 

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.610
issue but again it's about rising above
the challenges and doing the best that

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620
the challenges and doing the best that
 

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.220
the challenges and doing the best that
we can with as little as possible

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:34.230
we can with as little as possible
 

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.810
we can with as little as possible
because sometimes that is where we can

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820
because sometimes that is where we can
 

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.330
because sometimes that is where we can
do acknowledging the maybe it will not

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340
do acknowledging the maybe it will not
 

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.970
do acknowledging the maybe it will not
be within the next hour or it will not

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:40.980
be within the next hour or it will not
 

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.000
be within the next hour or it will not
be something that we can do within the

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.010
be something that we can do within the
 

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.800
be something that we can do within the
next day or the next year or even the

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:45.810
next day or the next year or even the
 

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:48.290
next day or the next year or even the
next decade but eventually if we have

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:48.300
next decade but eventually if we have
 

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.330
next decade but eventually if we have
the patience and we have the vision it

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340
the patience and we have the vision it
 

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.740
the patience and we have the vision it
is something that collectively we

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:51.750
is something that collectively we
 

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:56.030
is something that collectively we
probably will be able to achieve and as

probably will be able to achieve and as

in the discussion about what we fail to
 

00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:33.680
in the discussion about what we fail to
do what are some of the areas that we

do what are some of the areas that we

population one of the wrong things that
I have engaged in the past is really

00:32:55.659 --> 00:32:55.669
I have engaged in the past is really
 

00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:58.039
I have engaged in the past is really
engaging families and focus groups

00:32:58.039 --> 00:32:58.049
engaging families and focus groups
 

00:32:58.049 --> 00:33:00.109
engaging families and focus groups

working with them providing support for

working with them providing support for
them because if I teach someone how to

00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:03.659
them because if I teach someone how to
 

00:33:03.659 --> 00:33:06.680
them because if I teach someone how to
do something and I know that they have

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:06.690
do something and I know that they have
 

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:08.779
do something and I know that they have
learned what they need to do and they

00:33:08.779 --> 00:33:08.789
learned what they need to do and they
 

00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:11.060
learned what they need to do and they
are empowered to complete the task I

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:11.070
are empowered to complete the task I
 

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.310
are empowered to complete the task I
could step away from that with the

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320
could step away from that with the
 

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.989
could step away from that with the
feeling that they will be able to

00:33:14.989 --> 00:33:14.999
feeling that they will be able to
 

00:33:14.999 --> 00:33:17.330
feeling that they will be able to
consider that process even I'm not there

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:17.340
consider that process even I'm not there
 

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.729
consider that process even I'm not there
because there are changes in funding

00:33:19.729 --> 00:33:19.739

because there are changes in funding
you're going to find us some of the

00:33:21.379 --> 00:33:21.389
you're going to find us some of the
 

00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:23.539
you're going to find us some of the
programs are only going to be able to

00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:23.549
programs are only going to be able to
 

00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:26.450
programs are only going to be able to

follow families or or people for a short
 

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.339
follow families or or people for a short
period of time and then we need to step

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:28.349
period of time and then we need to step
 

00:33:28.349 --> 00:33:30.469
period of time and then we need to step
away when you step away what have you

00:33:30.469 --> 00:33:30.479
away when you step away what have you
 

00:33:30.479 --> 00:33:32.570
away when you step away what have you

put in place to make sure that it can
 

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.539
put in place to make sure that it can
continue to grow but the resource even

00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:35.549
continue to grow but the resource even
 

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:37.639
continue to grow but the resource even
though you are not there will still

00:33:37.639 --> 00:33:37.649
though you are not there will still

programs with poor management structure

00:33:44.779 --> 00:33:44.789
programs with poor management structure
 

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:48.619
programs with poor management structure
are usually the first to fail and as we

00:33:48.619 --> 00:33:48.629
are usually the first to fail and as we
 

00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:51.019
are usually the first to fail and as we
really think about the issues

00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:51.029
really think about the issues
 

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:53.359
really think about the issues
surrounding health disparities we

00:33:53.359 --> 00:33:53.369
surrounding health disparities we
 

00:33:53.369 --> 00:33:56.539
surrounding health disparities we
realize that all too often the program

00:33:56.539 --> 00:33:56.549
realize that all too often the program
 

00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:59.719
realize that all too often the program
is that for our first are usually those

00:33:59.719 --> 00:33:59.729
is that for our first are usually those
 

00:33:59.729 --> 00:34:02.389
is that for our first are usually those
for disadvantaged populations moving to

for disadvantaged populations moving to
 

00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:04.129
for disadvantaged populations moving to
additional increases in health

00:34:04.129 --> 00:34:04.139
additional increases in health
 

00:34:04.139 --> 00:34:06.469
additional increases in health
disparities and we need to be able to

00:34:06.469 --> 00:34:06.479
disparities and we need to be able to
 

00:34:06.479 --> 00:34:08.599
disparities and we need to be able to
provide equity and health we need to be

00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:08.609
provide equity and health we need to be
 

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:11.690
provide equity and health we need to be
able to address those issues and very

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700
able to address those issues and very
 

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.089
able to address those issues and very
honestly to talk about those issues so

00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:14.099
honestly to talk about those issues so
 

00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:15.980
honestly to talk about those issues so
that we are addressing them as they need

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:15.990
that we are addressing them as they need
 

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:18.020
that we are addressing them as they need
to be addressed good management and

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.030
to be addressed good management and
 

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.940
to be addressed good management and

structure together with the necessary
financial resources are really crucial

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240
financial resources are really crucial
 

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.960
financial resources are really crucial
it is to focus on failure that

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:25.970
it is to focus on failure that
 

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:29.139
it is to focus on failure that
is a true model of success but it was

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:29.149
is a true model of success but it was
 

00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:31.540
is a true model of success but it was
not focusing on merit and failure and

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:31.550
not focusing on merit and failure and
 

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.089
not focusing on merit and failure and
conjuring on that failure it is focusing

00:34:34.089 --> 00:34:34.099
conjuring on that failure it is focusing
 

00:34:34.099 --> 00:34:36.369
conjuring on that failure it is focusing
on the areas that don't work focusing on

00:34:36.369 --> 00:34:36.379
on the areas that don't work focusing on
 

00:34:36.379 --> 00:34:37.690
on the areas that don't work focusing on
those failures that will make us

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:37.700
those failures that will make us
 

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.399
those failures that will make us
stronger because we have actually

00:34:39.399 --> 00:34:39.409
stronger because we have actually
 

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:44.849
stronger because we have actually
learned our lesson and the simple truth

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:44.859
learned our lesson and the simple truth
 

00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:48.909
learned our lesson and the simple truth
so many of us say afford because it's

have because I couldn't do because of
 

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.460
have because I couldn't do because of

those areas that really need just that
 

00:39:27.719 --> 00:39:29.959

for everything that you are not able to
accomplish with one program just leads

00:39:55.939 --> 00:39:55.949

not to do when your funding new programs
 

00:40:00.689 --> 00:40:02.809
not to do when your funding new programs
really come together it may not be you

00:40:02.809 --> 00:40:02.819

stones for something that's bigger and
 

00:40:13.529 --> 00:40:15.829
stones for something that's bigger and
better and that's really what I'm trying

00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839
better and that's really what I'm trying

to accomplish by this so by when you're
 

00:40:18.959 --> 00:40:21.499
to accomplish by this so by when you're
talking about that focus on failure and

00:40:21.499 --> 00:40:21.509
talking about that focus on failure and
 

00:40:21.509 --> 00:40:23.209
talking about that focus on failure and

00:40:29.549 --> 00:40:31.819
we're going to use it for our benefit
and as to hope that all of us as Public
