00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.000
Identify the most
reasonable units

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.970
to measure the weight
of the choices below.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.100
So we have an average
adult, a slice of bread,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.090
a kitchen table,
or a pack of gum.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.200
So I am an average
adult, and I know

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.020
that I weigh about 160 pounds.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.240
So I know that pounds are
a pretty good measurement

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.710
for about something
the weight of an adult.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.430
So I'll put adults in that
category right over there.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.820
Now we have a single
slice of bread.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.610
So even a full loaf of
bread doesn't weigh a lot.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.010
Maybe that gets close to a
pound, but a slice of bread

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.680
is going to be
less than a pound.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.000
So I would do this in ounces.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.880
A kitchen table.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.160
Well, a kitchen table
kind of weighs the same--

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.460
it could, if it's a very
large kitchen table,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.350
could weigh the same
or more than an adult.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.780
So I would do this in pounds.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.950
And then a pack of gum.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.190
So once again, a pack
of gum is fairly light.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.050
If you've ever been
to the gym and held

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.290
even a 1-pound or
2-pound weight,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.100
it weighs more
than a pack of gum.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.960
So a pack of gum is going
to be less than a pound,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.880
so ounces seem to
make sense here.
