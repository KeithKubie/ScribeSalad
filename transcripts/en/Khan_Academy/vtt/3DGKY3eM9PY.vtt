00:00:00.854 --> 00:00:02.174
- [Voiceover] Hello Grammarians.

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:03.007
Hello Paige.

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:04.296
- [Voiceover] Hi David.

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:06.148
- [Voiceover] I say hello to you

00:00:06.148 --> 00:00:08.415
and I say hello to the grammarians.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:11.137
- [Voiceover] That was an
interesting thing to say.

00:00:11.137 --> 00:00:12.925
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it's cause
there's a compound sentence.

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:13.758
- [Voiceover] I see.

00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:17.476
- [Voiceover] So there's this
distinction made in grammar,

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:21.162
between simple and compound sentences.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:22.869
And today Paige, you and I are going

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.535
to cover those differences.

00:00:24.535 --> 00:00:25.583
- [Voiceover] Let's do it.

00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:29.127
- [Voiceover] So, a simple
sentence is really just

00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:31.333
what it says on the 10.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:35.295
A simple sentence consists of one subject

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:37.721
and one predicate, and that's it.

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:38.554
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:39.387
- [Voiceover] So in the sentence,

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:41.817
I bought my friends some candy,

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:44.650
alright we got our one subject, I.

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:47.912
And then we have our one predicate,

00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:49.566
bought my friends some candy.

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.553
- [Voiceover] Mhmm.

00:00:50.553 --> 00:00:51.639
- [Voiceover] Now all of this together is

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:55.023
what we call an independent clause.

00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:56.953
I don't wanna hit that too hard right now.

00:00:56.953 --> 00:01:00.203
But you know, when you have this set of

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.106
subject and a predicate together,

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:04.476
and it can be a sentence, that's called

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:06.643
an independent clause.

00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:08.084
I'm not even gonna write that down.

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:08.917
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:12.493
- [Voiceover] But a compound
sentence is basically

00:01:12.493 --> 00:01:16.109
two or more simple
sentences joined together.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.276
So that would be two
subjects plus two predicates.

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.785
Or more, two, three, a bajillion.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:27.618
- [Voiceover] Sure.

00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:29.171
- [Voiceover] That would be
a very long sentence to read,

00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:30.085
but you could do it, it would be

00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:33.199
a very very compound sentence.

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:37.366
So I visited the beach and
I got a really bad sunburn.

00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:42.418
When we're looking at this,
this is really two sentences

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:46.034
together, joined by
the comma and this and.

00:01:46.034 --> 00:01:48.701
Alright, so we have our subject,

00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:53.888
I visited the beach, I
got a really bad sunburn.

00:01:53.888 --> 00:01:55.360
And we have our two predicates,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.193
I visited the beach, got
a really bad sunburn.

00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:01.832
- [Voiceover] So the
subject in both these cases

00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:04.401
is I right, but it's sort of separate.

00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:07.684
It's like, I'm doing
two different actions.

00:02:07.684 --> 00:02:08.830
- [Voiceover] Correct.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.016
- [Voiceover] What's
important is even if it's

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:14.746
the same subject, if it's I both times.

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:15.741
Well I don't know how to say this,

00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:18.565
but just, if it were, I visited the beach

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:20.170
and got a really bad sunburn.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.215
- [Voiceover] Then it
would be a simple sentence.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:22.597
- [Voiceover] Then it's simple.

00:02:22.597 --> 00:02:23.868
- [Voiceover] Okay so
Paige, I'm looking at this

00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:25.351
and I see I twice.

00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:27.972
What if I wanted to condense
this sentence further?

00:02:27.972 --> 00:02:29.293
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:31.650
- [Voiceover] What does that give us?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.970
Is this a simple sentence
or a compound sentence?

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.140
Because this looks like
what you would call

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.590
a compound predicate.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.165
- [Voiceover] Right, since
there's only one subject

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:47.158
in this sentence, there's only
I and it's only said once.

00:02:47.158 --> 00:02:49.224
Right, you don't have, I visited the beach

00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:51.633
and I got a really bad sunburn.

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:53.035
That whole thing, visited the beach

00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:54.396
and got a really bad sunburn,

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:58.570
is you're right, it is
a compound predicate.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.550
- [Voiceover] But what
you're saying is I couldn't

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.792
divide this up into two sentences,

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.632
unless I put in another subject.

00:03:05.632 --> 00:03:08.212
Right, you can say, I visited the beach,

00:03:08.212 --> 00:03:11.501
and that could be a sentence on its own.

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:15.483
But you can't say, and
got a really bad sunburn,

00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:16.978
as it's own sentence.

00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:20.623
- [Voiceover] Okay, so both
of these things are simple.

00:03:20.623 --> 00:03:23.509
So even though this is
a compound predicate,

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.780
it's technically one predicate.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.694
- [Voiceover] Right, it's --

00:03:28.694 --> 00:03:32.117
- [Voiceover] And even if I'd written,

00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:33.804
Paige and I visited the beach

00:03:33.804 --> 00:03:35.559
and I got a really bad sunburn,

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:38.241
that would still be a compound subject,

00:03:38.241 --> 00:03:40.517
but it wouldn't be two
sentences squished together,

00:03:40.517 --> 00:03:43.260
it would be one kind of long sentence.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.337
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:48.504
You can have a compound subject
or a compound predicate,

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:52.310
but that doesn't make
it a compound sentence.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.378
What makes it a compound sentence,

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:56.629
is you have two parts that
can stand on their own

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.701
as individual sentences, and they're

00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:01.493
sort of being put together.

00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:03.423
- [Voiceover] So let me
change what I wrote here,

00:04:03.423 --> 00:04:06.300
to just say, instead of two
subjects and two predicates.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.661
Cause I think that's confusing in light of

00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:11.828
this information, let's just
say it is two simple sentences.

00:04:13.716 --> 00:04:17.646
- [Voiceover] Right, or
two independent clauses.

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:19.149
You know, that terminology.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.071
- [Voiceover] Or two, yeah.

00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:23.549
And if you don't, never
fear, we'll cover it,

00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:26.008
and you can learn anything.

00:04:26.008 --> 00:04:26.841
David out.

00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:28.581
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
