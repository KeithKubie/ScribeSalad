00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.870
Rounding is a way to take a number and
say what it's about equal to.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.490
If someone asks you for the time and
you look at your watch and

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.940
it says 6:01,
you may just say 6 o'clock.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.145
When you do this,
you are rounding to the nearest hour.

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:17.756
Whenever we round,
we are taking a number and

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:19.896
saying what that number is close to.

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:23.602
Let's take a look at
numbers with a single digit

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:28.245
after the decimal point like 2.6,
3.4, or 1.5.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.520
How do you think we would round these?

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.033
For example, let's look at 2.6.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.921
Looking at the number line,

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:40.035
we know that 2.6 is somewhere in-between
2 and 3, but the question is,

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:44.930
is 2.6 to the right or to the left
of the midpoint in-between 2 and 3?

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.410
First, let's figure out
what the midpoint is.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.796
What is the midpoint between 2 and 3?

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:52.560
Enter your answer in this box.
