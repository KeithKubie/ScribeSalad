00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.389
It smells.

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:02.440
It gets on you.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:11.160
But that's okay because to me urine is exciting.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.540
This is William Tarpeh, an Environmental Engineering
PhD student from UC Berkeley.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.890
His field of study basically harnesses the
principles of engineering, biology, and chemistry

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.770
to develop solutions to problems that negatively
affect our environment.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.020
So Environmental Engineers tackle things like
air pollution, contaminated water and reducing

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.340
garbage waste.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.000
But like with any field, there are outliers.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Like Will.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.280
Will spends all day, every day, transforming
pee into liquid fertilizer, attempting to

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.230
spin gold out of something that the rest of
us flush away without a second thought.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.240
I mean.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.660
It's gold in color but… it's also valuable.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.020
I'll just let him tell you.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.130
We focus on the nitrogen in urine because
it's in fertilizers that people buy and it's

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.870
also in urine.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.149
Our big idea is to extract the nitrogen preferentially
out of urine into a product that we can sell.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.389
Now, Will doesn’t plan on becoming the world’s
first pee-millionaire.

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:05.929
Uriillionare?

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:11.280
Anyway, his motivation for making pee profitable
is actually toilets.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.479
Because while basic sanitation is something
that many of us in the West take for granted,

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.249
for 2.4 billion people around the world, it’s
a very real public health issue.

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:22.140
...sanitation to me is really fundamental.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.689
It affects so many parts of life that we don't
think about.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.340
The big purpose is to find ways to make sanitation
self-funding.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.810
That's the really big idea; how can we create
value from something that's normally waste

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.259
and in doing so generate the money that will
help us proliferate more toilets, help us

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.409
build more toilets.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.130
To build toilets you need money, so you need
a product to make dat money.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.979
Fertilizer contains nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium, all chemicals that are naturally

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.819
found in your pee.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.979
So, for four years, Will has been working
on transforming regular old urine into a nutrient-rich

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.979
fertilizer.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.119
Of course, in order to do that, he needs a
steady stream of pee for his research …

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.960
When I'm here in Berkeley we have to file
paperwork to basically get urine from my lab

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.960
mates.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.939
We're a pretty enterprising bunch.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:14.939
We're environmental engineers.

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.090
It's not a hard sell….

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.569
Once Will has collected enough, he then has
to let it sit for one week… he called it…

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.919
"curing" *disgust face* Amazing.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:29.750
... when we excrete urine, the nitrogen is
present as something called urea.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.450
That's an organic compound.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.600
Then throughout about a week's time, that
gets hydrolyzed, meaning in the presence of

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.330
water and an enzyme called urease, that urea
gets turned into ammonia,...

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.290
That's our starting point because the ammonia
we can work with.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.580
It's more mobile.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.860
Ammonia is a compound of hydrogen and nitrogen,
but as it’s still mixed up with lots of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.819
other chemicals present in uc-rine, so Will
had to develop extraction methods in order

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.670
to isolate the valuable nitrogen to make it
into fertilizer -- so far he’s created two.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.430
The first method is called electrochemical
stripping.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.159
Will uses an electrochemical cell with three
chambers that can selectively filter nitrogen

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.700
out of the urine.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.140
This is how it works: Pee goes into the first
chamber.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.630
Then, into the middle, goes a really dilute
salt solution.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.870
When electricity passes through the electrochemical
cell the ammonium, which is positively charged,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.709
is pushed through a membrane -- out of the
pee and into the salt solution.

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:25.709
There we've selected first for charge.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.239
Then we get things like ammonium, sodium,
and potassium.

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.780
We've gotten just 3 things out of the urine.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.900
Now our job is not done.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.400
We still have to get just the ammonium out.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.500
So once the pee party has moved into the middle
chamber, the electrical charge forces the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.270
solution to form hydroxide ions.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.659
This changes the nitrogen from a liquid to
a gas which moves allows it to move into the

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.030
third chamber.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.040
The gas is then mixed with water and voila
- liquid fertilizer!

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.760
The second method seems to be a bit more efficient.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.879
It's called an ion exchange column.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.670
Basically, it's a tube filled with a resin
material that is negatively charged….

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.580
Think of it like a water filter.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.200
The nitrogen is part of the ammonium, which,
by the way, is positively charged so…

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.819
We pass urine through a column, this time
the nitrogen goes onto the resin beads, those

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.319
spheres, and then the rest of the urine passes
through.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.830
Now we can take a really dilute acid and pass
it over those resin beads and now the nitrogen

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.630
will go back into solution.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.200
Now, this all works perfectly well in the
lab, but Will wanted to see if his innovations

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.040
could work in a real world setting - somewhere
where sanitation is a real problem.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.420
So he partnered with Sanergy, a company that
build toilets in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.110
Sanergy already collects feces and turns it
into fertilizer, but before Will’s innovations,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.500
they were disposing of thousands of liters
of urine EVERY DAY.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.590
This past summer we were actually testing
both of these technologies side by side and

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.390
doing it in the field with real urine that's
collected every single day.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.970
I love being in the field, and for me I like
being close to the people who use the technology.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.600
I like looking at the toilets and seeing,
okay, how would I actually use this?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.890
That changes your design process so much.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.780
And after testing his innovations in Nairobi,
Will is definitely thinking about the future.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.120
The biggest challenge -- how to turn those
thousands of liters of urine into fertilizer.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.190
[WILLIAM]
I'm really good at doing this in lab on my

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.600
small filters and my small test kits that
I've built, but then it's how do I make this

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.250
big enough to treat 5,000 liters of urine
a day in comparison to right now we treat

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.300
about 5 liters a day.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.430
how do we scale up the costs of making sure
the process still works at the same efficiencies

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.640
that we've gotten it to work at in the lab?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.300
If Will is able to scale up his idea, his
work could help transform the lives of billions

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.490
of people on the planet.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.210
I wanted to do things that had environmental
implications and that had impacts on people's

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.210
lives.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.700
Combining those 2 things, it's no surprise
that I ended up doing environmental engineering

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.820
and basically ended up researching the chemistry
of urine.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.110
Yeah, those are the things that excite me,
but I think it's really how I can bring my

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.960
training and my passions to bear on an important
problem.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.060
We want to take a moment to thank our partner
the Blum Center for Developing Economies at

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.340
the University of California, Berkeley, an
innovation and research hub that is tackling

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.490
issues in global poverty.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.040
Make sure to check out some their incredible
work by visiting blumcenter.berkeley.edu.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.810
Technology is really changing life in the
developing world.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.690
For example: now cell phones can be used as
hand-held microscopes to diagnose malaria

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.740
in just 30 seconds!

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:41.470

video from Seeker Stories.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.250
We've all heard, one man's trash is another
man's treasure, right?

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.590
That's totally this story.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.100
Have you ever reused something that was once
trash?

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.080
I found a great couch in the garbage once.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.280
Let us know in the comments.
