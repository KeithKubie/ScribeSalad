00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:13.897
All right.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.530
Yeah.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.982
I like the groove.

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:20.232
Let it run some more.

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:24.461
Yeah.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.140
Yeah, you know what?

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.590
I need more space
for this one.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.940
OK.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.610

No.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.370
Wait.

TIFFANY T'ZELLE: You're
not feeling it, right?

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.350
DARIEN DEAN: My thing is, if it
was Ground Hog's Day, that

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.414
level of enthusiasm would
have been fine.

00:03:19.414 --> 00:03:20.240
TIFFANY T'ZELLE: But?

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.775
DARIEN DEAN: This is Black
History Month.

00:03:21.775 --> 00:03:22.520
TIFFANY T'ZELLE: That's right.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.820
DARIEN DEAN: So the sign
is-- you're right.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.810
The sign is right there.

TIFFANY T'ZELLE: It says
it all over the place.

DARIEN DEAN: So I
got to be real.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.230
I got to be real.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.060
I wasn't feeling that.

TIFFANY T'ZELLE: Something
like that.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.750
DARIEN DEAN: About 44.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.270
So we're going to have
to get that other--

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.170
let me do the math--

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.510
56%.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.730
Did it.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.600
We're going to have to get the
other 56 from you all.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.370
But it could be that the problem
is me and my delivery

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.350
and the way we doing this.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.440
Or probably maybe
you all, too.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.490
So, I mean, I'm not trying
to point fingers.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.250
I'm not.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.260
So let's try this
again, shall we?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.440
Let's try it again.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.910

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.340
DARIEN DEAN: So maybe if I
give you all the message

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.180
differently first, and then we
try, can that work possibly?

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.960
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.630
DARIEN DEAN: OK.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.602
Maybe.

00:04:09.602 --> 00:04:10.095
OK.

I'm sure everybody--

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.170
some of you all look confused.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.990
All right.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.870
We'll try.
