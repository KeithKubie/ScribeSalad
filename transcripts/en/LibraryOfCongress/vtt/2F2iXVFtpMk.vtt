00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: My name is Steve
Winick and we're here at the Library

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.850
of Congress with Billy McComiskey
and his friend Myron Bretholz

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.950
and his son Sean McComiskey.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.800
And we're here to talk about
Billy's career in music.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.970
And it's on an occasion that's
sort of a dual occasion.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.640
Number one, we're celebrating
the 40th anniversary

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.760
of the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.750
And Billy was one of the
performers who played

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.860
at the party celebrating our
creation back in February of 1976.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.130
So we're very happy to have
Billy here for that reason.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.850
And the second reason is--
this hasn't been announced yet

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.960
but by the time this video
is available it will be--

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.960
Billy is a recipient this
year of the National Endowment

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.670
for the Arts National
Heritage Fellowship Award.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.910
And we're really happy to have
Billy here to sort of continue

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.350
to document his life and
his career as a musician.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.040
And of course we're very happy also
to have Myron who's been active

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.390
in Irish music for all
these years alongside Billy.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.400
And Sean, because one of the
reasons for having this concert was

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.180
to show how the tradition had
continued to develop over 40 years

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.320
and we thought there was
no better symbol of that

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.440
than to have Billy here
with some of his children

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.180
who also play Irish music.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.230
So, welcome to all three of you.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.530
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Thank you.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Thank you, Steve.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.130
Pleasure to be here.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.430
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And
I guess we'll start

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.730
with some general questions
for Billy.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.890
I know your music career
started in your original hometown

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.940
which was Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.970
So, talk a little about
Brooklyn and that scene.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: It-- We started
kind of right at the beginning,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:12.310
my grandfather emigrated out
from Ireland from Nenagh--

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.550
near Nenagh, let's put it that way.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.340
Actually, he was actually
from Newport in Tipperary

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.740 position:56%
and his wife was from Castleconnell,
which was in County Limerick.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.580
And so, their daughter
Mae McComiskey,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.300
that's-- that would be my mom.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.550
So she was actually
the first to the--

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.360
of the Brooklyn-- of
our Brooklyn family.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.660
She was the first daughter.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.900
She had two brothers, one
older and one younger.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.000
And they were all crazy mad in
love with Irish traditional music

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.620
and it had an awful lot to do--
Nora-- Nora was just a great mother

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.580
but it was my grandfather
was Andrew Caplis

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.920
from Newport in County Tipperary.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.000
And he was a lovely fiddle player.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.340
The great Larry Redican from Dublin
came to visit my grandfather.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.410 position:56%
As soon as he landed, as he landed
in New York, he found my grandfather

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.760
and he just wanted to meet him and
talk a little bit about the music.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.640
So it was kind of like that.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.440
But it was-- We grew
up in a row house,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.150
I don't know how my
grandmother did at first.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.910
They were right in the depths
of the depression somehow.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.610
And they bought a house right

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.040
in the neighborhood called
Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.120 position:56%
And my mother was just-- They were--

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.080
She was just so close and just
loved her parents so much.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.450
We ended up living
exactly right next door

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.460
to them, which is no easy feat.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.450
Brooklyn is a-- Brooklyn
is a tough town.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.160
She met-- she met my father--

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.180
She met my father on
the Catskill Mountains.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:07.210
Her brother had a-- he
had a-- I'm slipping.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.530
You'll have to edit
that a little bit.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.570
A boarding house, in...a
boarding house called the Overlook

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.870
in the Catskill Mountains.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.610
And my father had come
out from Northern Ireland.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.010
My father was an Irish Catholic
from Northern Ireland and he chose

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.000
to defend the crown during
the Second World War.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.480
He had a good talk with his
father and his, and they agreed

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.850 position:56%
that what was going on in Northern
Ireland, what the British were doing

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.600
to the Irish Catholics, the natives

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.390
of Ireland just wasn't--
it wasn't right.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.590
But it was nowhere near
as bad as what was going

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.280
on with the-- in Nazi Germany.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.510
So somehow or another, my
father actually became a pilot

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.890
for the Queen's Royal Air Force.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.960 position:56%
And he came out to Oklahoma to train
and he made a pact with himself

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.920 position:56%
that if he survived the war, he
would make his way back to Oklahoma.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.060
Or may-- I mean, maybe,
maybe just America.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.050
But he kind of, well, I'd really
like to get back to Oklahoma.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.990
When he got one look at it,
all of these land that was here

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.830
and all you had to do is work
for it and you could have--

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.350
you could do anything you wanted.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.930
It was what I loved when he would
talk about it when he first came

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.830
out here because this as a-- You
know, as a member of the old world,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.380
you know, Northern Ireland,
it just wasn't the case.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.680
So he did, he came out.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.550
And he only made it-- He only
made it as far as Brooklyn

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.110
and he was staying at his aunt's
house and there was a burned

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.740
out house down the
street from her house

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.370
and he just couldn't
stand it and he bought it.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.900
So, it was in Brooklyn
that he decided--

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.940
There was a couple there
on the street that said,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.140
could you bring us
up, we want to go--

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.490
We're going to stay in the boarding
house in the Catskill Mountains.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.440
Could you drive us up there?

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.410
And he did, he went with
his best friend Pat Thompson

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.910
and Pat McComiskey hopped
in their '39 Chevy and drove

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.420
up to the Catskill Mountains.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.490
And there was Matt
Caplis and he says, you--

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.560
you two fellows should
stay over tonight

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.260
because there's a great
box player in town.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.180
And there was a bunch of women
playing badminton out in the lawn.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.160
And he says, and you have your
pick of the Catskills right there.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.460
You can have anyone.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.260 position:56%
And my father said, I like that one.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.720
And this guy says, oh,
no, no, no, not that one.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.400
So that's my mother
that my father picked.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.660
And his best friend, Pat Thompson
picked Kathleen Thompson, his wife.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.260
And they all kind of
stayed in Brooklyn.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.760
So there was this lovely
little community.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.970
The box player that they went out
to hear that night was Joe Derrane

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:59.160
who it-- he has been
such an inspiration.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.780
I listened to Joe's
music at the house.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.370
My mother had all of Joe's records.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.010
My Uncle Matt played the accordion.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.960 position:56%
He couldn't play like Joe Derrane
and he just-- he adored Joe Derrane.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.960
And so it's amazing, these
crazy little connections.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.020
There was always-- So there
was always great music there

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.320
in Brooklyn.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.830
My grandma-- And my
grandfather passed away.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.690
I never got to meet my grandfather.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.190
But my grandmother and my mother
would take me up to 39th Street

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.700
and 5th Avenue to the Rainbow
Café on a Sunday and we would go

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.220
down to the back room
in the basement.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.650
And Paddy Sullivan, the Kerry
fiddler would be down there.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.070
And he'd all-- And as soon as I
came in and it was 25 cents to get

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:48.400
in to the Irish music club
and he would come up to us

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.980
and he would say, Mrs.
Caplis, you don't have to pay.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.680
It was 25 cents and that was a
lot of money for my grandmother.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.810
And he would bring us in and
we would get to just listen

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.770
to the great musicians
that were living in

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.210
and around Brooklyn in those days.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.600
And awful lot of-- Mostly fiddle
players and flute players.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.310
It was just a really--
It was a lovely thing.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.370
Sometimes we'd save the money
for the bus and we'd walk in.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.730
When my grandmother was younger,

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.140
we'd walk around Green-Wood
cemetery.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.300
So that's kind of how-- That's kind

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.500
of how Brooklyn was, I
guess in those times.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.600
My grandmother would not
let my grandfather go

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.770
out to play in the Irish bars.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.550
During the depression, she would
not let that happen because here

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.630
in Washington now with the
Dubliner or the Irish times

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.150
in the four province, all these
beautiful Irish restaurants.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.440
That was not the case in Brooklyn

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.090
when my grandfather
was hanging out there.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.050
It was like you kind of had-- You
kind of had to know how to fight.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.810
And you kind of had
to know how to run.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.030
And it was just kind of how
Brooklyn was and so that--

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.850
No, it was a kind of a-- It was a--

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.440
There wasn't a whole lot to do
with Irish music at the time.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.470
You know, we're talking
about very modest people.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:14.050 position:56%
We were, you know, we were the
Latino speaking people of their day.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.860
I don't know how, I don't know is
that the right way to phrase that.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.910
But we were kind of-- We were
the downtrodden, you know,

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:26.660
just kind of coming out of
this whole traumatic experience

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.960
with colonialism, you
know, and all that,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.780
just trying to figure their
way through the war --

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.300
for independence over in Ireland.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.700
So it's a pretty-- It was
pretty hard for that generation

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.550
of players-- generation of people
that were coming out in those days.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.890
You could see how relieved
they were to get to America.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.630
Lovely, quiet people.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.280
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So how
about when you were growing

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.850
up a few years later was--

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.010
the music, had it taken off a
little bit more in Brooklyn?

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.930
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: I
didn't realize it at the time

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.120
but the music was actually
on the verge of extinction.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:08.070
It was-- There was very,
very little of it left.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.420
My Uncle Matt and my Uncle
Andy were on a mission.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:18.150
They went and found the bars
in the Catskill Mountains

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.750
that would host the great
musicians of the time.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.260
My uncle-- There would be fellows--

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.180 position:56%
song and dance kind of guys that
would playing in these guys' places.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.170
And my Uncle Matt would be
determined to get the likes

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.910
of maybe Paddy Killoran,
the great sligo player.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:40.090
Maybe get him a gig or just
when he-- somehow or another,

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.700
he was able to get Joe Cooley to
come up to my godfather's bar.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.190
Again, and I would-- I might have
been like 11 or 12 years old.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.270
So when you would go and nobody
was paying these people to do this,

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.080
they would go because-- They would
go because Joe Cooley was there.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.220
Bobby Gardiner, the great Clare
box player from Lisdoonvarna,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.170
after he won the All-Ireland, he--

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.730
He ended up in the Catskills
because he wanted to--

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.080
he wanted to hear Joe Cooley.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.600
So it's funny how it, how
it kind of-- and kind of--

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.090
it was this inside kind of thing.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.260
It was like a-- it was
before the internet

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.800
but there was somehow they
were able to communicate

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.630
to Boston players,
the New York players.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.790
So that was kind of it:
Boston, New York, maybe Chicago.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.030
In these little modest
Irish communities,

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.750
there would be these
unbelievably talented players.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:35.600
I was stunned and mortified to
learn that the great Joe Heaney,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.800
the great sean nós singer,
actually lived in Bay Ridge.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.030
It wasn't even 10 minutes
from my house.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.410
But we just didn't know.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.130
We didn't know.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.850
It wasn't until the National
Council for the Traditional Arts

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.790
that we realized that we're
in the presence of genius.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.720
It was an amazing-- It was an
amazing thing that happened.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.180
A lot-- people like Larry Redican,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.540
Larry Redican actually
would have gotten

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.670
to play on the Ed Sullivan Show.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.270
He would have played
for the McNiff dancers.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.020
Maybe it was Jerry-- I think
he played with Jerry Wallace,

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.700
the pianist from Northern Ireland.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.000
And this would-- That
would be about--

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.430
that would be a really great gig.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.770 position:56%
He wouldn't get any money from that.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.300
There was no money in playing
Irish traditional music.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.090
And there were just a few old men

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.790
that were just incredibly
good, you know.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.180 position:56%
And it was kind of-- the funny thing
was it was the same in Ireland.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.800
We would get over there.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.970
When I finally had the money, when
I had my little job in the Bank

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.110
of New York, I managed to come up
with enough money for my air fare.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:43.240
And all I had to do was get over
there and in between my relatives

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.660
who also love the music, the whole,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.540
the Limerick players
and people, family.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.560
And then the people that just loved
the music, so all I had to do is

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.070
to come up with the air fare and
I can get to stay for three weeks.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.810
And again, my Uncle Matt, he'd be a
couple of steps ahead of me trying

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.060 position:56%
to figure out, well, maybe we can
go to Feakle tonight, maybe a couple

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.360
of the old fellows or may--

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.080
You know, maybe we can
find some of these guys.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.610
Maybe Matthew Ryan will be in town
until maybe we can work this out.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:20.150
So this was say 1969-1970, and
for where I was in, I just--

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.860
well, to me, it's just
like this little secret,

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.090
this beautiful little jewel.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:32.020
And I was too young to
realize it was almost vanished.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Well, so
at some point before this,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.050
you actually started to play
and you started to play,

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.990
you've been mentioning the box.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.920
And of course that's typically
the button accordion--

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.220
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: That's right.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Typically
BC tune like yours.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.820
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.050
Maybe not-- I guess that the tuning
kind of came later but, yeah,

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:55.940 position:56%
we would be like I like it here, you
know, hey, I like that squeezebox.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.860
But the Irish never really
called it a squeezebox.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:04.120 position:56%
It would be a box or a melodeon, you
know, is another lovely expression.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.820
My cousin John Sweeney
really admired my Uncle Matt.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.660
So he went in the--
He was in the navy.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.150
He was a-- His mother passed away,
so he had to fend for himself.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.720
He went into the navy and he
went to Germany and he decided

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.020
to bring back an accordion.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.250 position:56%
And just completely out of the blue,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.780
he bought what's called
Hohner blackdot,

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:34.270
which happens to be a BC
semitone button accordion.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.130
And it's an interesting thing that
was-- that they, an Englishman,

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.430
of course, I can't
think it was back--

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.640
back in around 1910 discovered
that if you take two old scales,

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.090
two major scales, two
diatonic scales,

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.990
if they are a half a
step apart, you more

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.830
or less have the full
circle of fifths.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.850
It doesn't make for a great
harmony playing instrument

00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:00.830 position:56%
but it was just ideal for the
lovely way that the Irish tradition.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:05.520
And Irish music is kind
of like pre-G clef.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.280
It's pre-chromatic.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.180
It's a diatonic kind of music.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.990
So when they figured
out what if it takes--

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.370
It's kind of like what
the Cajun fellows play.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.710
And it's exactly the same
except there's two rows

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.760
and one will be a half step
apart from the other one.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.720
Or up in Quebec, it was a
little single row accordion.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.770
So you get that lovely pulse.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:29.760
But when it's a semitone like that,
it's a little bit more capable.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.060
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.800
Well, it helps you play in
more keys so you can play

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.170
with other people among
other things.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.560
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Well,
again, like yeah, it-- what I--

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.600
Irish music is we don't
really know--

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.580
We don't really know how old it is.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.640
My friend, Jerry O'Sullivan
made a couple of--

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.920
He's a great piper up in New
York, scholar, and he did a couple

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.680
of recordings that he just
called O'Sullivan Meets O'Farrel.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.470
So the O'Farrel collection
was like the early 1700s.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.830 position:56%
O Carolan's music is mixed in there.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.720
I guess that the amazing thing
about this-- And we would--

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.910 position:56%
Patrick Street, Patrick, what is it?

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.110
Something, so-- What's
the name of the record?

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.410
Fisher's--

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.710
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz:
Oh, Fisher Street,

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.010
that I mentioned today, right ?

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.310
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah, did
a whole bunch of tunes from--

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.610
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Yeah, right.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.910
That's right.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.210
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: They
found this O'Farrel collection,

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.850
and the amazing thing about, as you
listen to these lovely old tunes

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.920
from the O'Farrel collection,
your immediate think--

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.000
You immediately think, well, that
sounds like so and so, you know.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.990
That sounds just like
so-- that other tune.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.480
But it turns out the other tune
might have been written 200 years

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.630
after this one from the
O'Farrel collection.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:36.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.340
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: So that
stuff is really, really old.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.010
It might not be as old as the music

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.660
from the Middle East,
or maybe it is.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:48.450
I don't know, I'm not an
ethnomusicologist or a folklorist.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:53.920
But it goes back there and it
exists in these beautiful modes

00:16:53.920 --> 00:17:00.300
that the pipers were--
are able to interpret

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.340 position:56%
and it's just a-- it's-- it goes up.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.300
It goes up like a do, re, mi, so
these whole steps and half steps.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.290
And the little modes that
existed around there.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.750
So, the one that saw the
pipers play these tunes.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.230
And so there's little blind
spots in the pipes that kind

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.600
of identified the music
and it gives it--

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.810
It makes it sound the way it does,
just like the little blind spots,

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.370
the open strings on the
fiddle and stuff like that.

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:32.290
So this is what the people
that were composing this music.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.070
I don't think we even
regard it as composing.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.790
We kind of-- we were talking
about making up a tune, you know,

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.720
you kind of-- not really say
compose, you know, that's too fancy

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.970
for Irish music because
we're just regarded

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.360
as a folk, as a people's music.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.750
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, one
thing that you tend to mention

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:55.250 position:56%
when you mention an Irish musician's
name is where that person was from.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.290
So let's talk about the
regions a little bit and how

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.460
that influenced the music or
in your experience anyway.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.450
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: I'd be
kind of identified as a--

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:10.990
and more loosely defined, as an
east Galway style accordion player.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.620
And the place, the reason that
would get a little dicey is Irish

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:23.250
accordion as I understand it came
into being, it started to exist in

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.240
and of itself someplace around
maybe 1950, the instrument--

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.700
that Paolo Soprani built--

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.550
well there was this black
dot Hohner accordion.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.850
But it wasn't complete.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.430
They hadn't quite figured
out how to make--

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.860
Help the left hand to
accompany these tunes.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.200
So Paolo Soprani took
this idea from Hohner.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.290
Paolo Soprani from Castelfidardo,
pre-- and I guess beforehand,

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.110
before and maybe even-- I'm not--

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.200
I don't know about
during but definitely

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.970
after World War II Paolo Soprani
was-- when Paolo Soprani went--

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.510
from Castelfidardo was
considered like a national hero

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.780
because he was a-- one of
these people that were able

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.420
to get his countrymen employed.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.390
You know, we were talking
about the Chinese fiddle maker

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.910
and it's kind of-- This is--
It's a beautiful craft, you know,

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.570
being able to just come

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:23.760
up with these little simple
inexpensive little bits of things

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:30.290
and put them together so that these
lovely regular common people can

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.870
make this beautifully--
beautiful, beautiful music.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.200
It's just a lovely gift.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:44.780 position:56%
So, I don't know, I-- So, somehow in
the course of that and around 1950,

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.540
this Irish style accordion--

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.370
this Italian accordion
just became adapted--

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.770
adopted by the Irish people.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.540
And there'd be a couple
of different semitone.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:57.840
There's two.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.200 position:56%
Basically there's a BC and a C sharp
D. Joe Cooley would have played a C

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.500
sharp D.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:08.760
So he would be from
Peterswell in east Galway.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.100
Paddy O'Brien, this is where
it gets a little dicey.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.660
Paddy O'Brien is from
Nenagh in County Tipperary.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.920
So it would be-- It'll be
like more of a-- It would be--

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.210
If you are cycling from
Nenagh up into Galway,

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.710
it would take you a little while.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.300
But this is kind of
what happened there.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.320
When they talk about-- So when they
talk about this east Galway style,

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.530
it's not particularly
accordion music.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:39.980
It's the music that
existed in east Galway

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.950
when the fiddle players would play.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:46.720
The great Paddy Fahey, that's still
alive, a very prolific composer,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.060 position:56%
would be writing these absolutely
stunning beautiful, beautiful tunes.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.660
There-- and sometimes there would
be-- and it would be like an--

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.630
if you take the scale, maybe
a Mixolydian scale or a kind

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.050
of combine a major scale with
this modal one and get a--

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.180
all this beautiful stuff
going on with the fiddle.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.360
And the flute players
ended up having to resort

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.920
to chromatic flutes, which
is so, you know, the--

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.340
all right, the old Irish players
would have the six hole diatonic

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.640
flute, the transverse flute,

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:21.040
and all of a sudden it
became borderline chromatic.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.760
It is like a really
interesting thing to happen.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.680
And the accordion players
picked up on it.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.280
So it would have been
maybe Joe Cooley would be--

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.750
that this is the person that
everybody immediately thinks

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.320
of with East Galway music.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.630
And Kevin Keegan, who
was a BC player,

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:40.380
Kevin Keegan adored the playing
of Paddy O'Brien from Nenagh.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:46.570 position:56%
And Paddy O'Brien from Nenagh is
the man that kind of showed the way.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:52.240
He started creating a
technique for the BC accordion.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.910
That Joe Cooley was
able to bring that--

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.720
bring the accordion a
step closer to what--

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.410
to the essence of the music so that
pipers and fiddlers would want to--

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.430
They wanted to play with Joe.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:15.680
And then Paddy took that and the
technique grew because of that.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:21.580
Kevin Keegan would never play
in front of Paddy O'Brien.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.540
He just wouldn't, he just wouldn't.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.810
But he was able to
be around Joe Cooley

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.440
without being totally
intimidated by him.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.410
And then shortly after that-- So
that's the ground works up there

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:41.510
and then people like Raymond
Roland from the town of Loughrea

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.770
where Paddy Fahey would have--

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.010
would have met up with the great
Paddy Carty, the flute player.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.830
Loughrea was just one of
these great towns and-- but--

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.600
So, Raymond Roland would be there
and then he ended up in London

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.850
and this whole thing
started in London.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.380
The great Raymond Roland
quartet was there.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.360
Liam Farrell -- It's
funny now my-- our--

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:12.150
my daughter-in-law is married to
the grand-niece of Liam Farrell.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.650
She was Lisa Farrell.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.350
So there's all these really
beautiful musical collection--

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.650
connections.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:26.610
So then from Raymond Roland came
these mighty, mighty players.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:36.880 position:56%
Sean McGlynn from-- right from the
town of Tynagh, he actually played--

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:42.650
and one of the oldest of the
gray Paolo Soprani accordions.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.950
It was just a beautiful thing.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.030
He bought it from a tanker.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.230 position:56%
His mother was ready to-- His mother
didn't talk to him for about a month

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.950
after he bought this accordion.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:57.650
He paid 50 pounds and gave the
tinker a brand new accordion

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.130
and his mother was mad.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.850
And then she realized
that he was right.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:07.550
So there are-- It kind of reflect.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.520
It kind of hearkens back almost

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:15.140
to where the Anglo concertina
is very similar to that.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.440
And of course the great Joe,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.890
the great Joe Burke also
from in around Loughrea.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:26.740
So there was a really
incredible really well-rooted,

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:34.170
highly respected group-- core group
of these musicians in eats Galway,

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.760
so-- And that's what I
was really privileged to--

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.430
John Joe Forde would be another
one of these box players.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.960
Ned Coleman was one of
the flute players there.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.880
The Ballinakill Ceili Band,
the Leitrim Ceili Band,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.340
these were beautiful dance bands

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.610
that actually got a
chance to record.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.140
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: But
it's probably fair to say

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.860
that McGlynn was the
most influential on you.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.210
Tell me about Sean McGlynn.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.510
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.760
I will have trouble
talking about Sean.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:08.750 position:56%
Sean was a carpenter and-- by trade.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.540
And when he immigrated to Boston
and he met his wife there,

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.360
Maura and he-- Well, he just
thought Maura had great style.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.000
Maura was also-- is
also from Galway.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.310
Maura is still alive and we--
He had gone up to the Catskills.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:31.670
There was this one-- Again,
my godfather had a pub

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.490
in the town of South Cairo.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:38.460
And my uncle was always coming
up with these little schemes

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.930 position:56%
to get people to go so he could make
enough money to hang on with a bunch

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:43.680
of kids, six or seven kids.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.580
Pat Murphy, crazy, completely.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.850
He was a great hurler but he
loved the Irish traditional music.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.810
And he loved the Tulla Ceili
Band and he was in love

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.690
with Bridie Lafferty, the piano
player with the Tulla Ceili Band,

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:05.150
and really the stories would
be hilarious, great fun.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:08.890
So in one of these-- one of these
summers, I guess this happened

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.860
on Labor Day or the Fourth of
July, he'd have these gatherings.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.100
And the one that really
stuck with me was the year

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.040
that Joe Cooley was there.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.020
It was just-- I was
only about 11 or 12.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.230
And then we didn't get
there the next year,

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:32.040
but Joe Burke had just won his
second All-Ireland championship.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:37.420 position:56%
Joe Burke was about 28 years old
when he first came to North America.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:45.760
Very, very, very-- a brilliant,
brilliant man, a great role model,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:53.530
you know, a little crazy, a little
crazy like a lot of us were.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.960
But he-- So he came to
the Catskills and just

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.700
as the way things turned out, Sean
was living in Boston and he heard

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.370
that Joe was going to
be in the Catskills.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.700
So he made a point to get there.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.650
And in the process, he met my Uncle
Matt and they became fast friends.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:16.350
My Uncle Matt played more in
Derrane's style as I said.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.260
But you could hear
in McGlynn's music

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.240
that it was really deeply rooted.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.250
You couldn't-- you couldn't
miss that about his music.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.820
And he reminded me very much

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.460
of Bobby Gardiner when
I first heard him.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.760
But again, different again.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:34.560
And he-- I mean just a
great and tremendous store

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.340
of music just floating
around in his head.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.340
And my uncle wanted
him so much to meet me

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:45.820
that he actually gave him
the down payment for a house

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.520
in the New York area just
so he would just be down,

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.140
just so we would kind of
have a chance to meet him.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.500
And he came over to the house.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:02.170
One day my Uncle Andy brought
Sean and Maura over to the house.

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:06.460 position:56%
And then when we were talking away--
And I'd gotten kind of frustrated

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.190
as I'd meet these players.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.150
Joe Cooley was an amazing
man to meet.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.390
He would take the time to talk
to a child, and I was only 11

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:16.010
when I met him and it really
had a big effect on me.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.060
But most of the guys were just
young and there would be beer

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:23.480
and a few shots and that would
be a little crazy and they did.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.090
And I actually asked one
of these players one time,

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.390
could you show me how to do that.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.250
And he goes, oh, I'm
sorry, my hand hurts.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.240
And it was like a joke.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.130
And I thought, well, never--

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.760
I'm never going to make
that mistake again.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.360
So I'd watch players
and I'd watch them play.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:46.010
But when Sean came
over, he was just great.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.500
He was just a really great,
great guy and he just--

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.750
He told me that day in the house,
he says you're going to be--

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.130
You're going to be a great player.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.970
I was so intimidated when I met
him there that I actually went

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.150
up to my room and did homework.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.440
This is not my style at all.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.970
It's like the only
time I ever did that.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.940
And he came up and he came up

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.030
and he said you're going
to be a great player.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.050
And it's funny, Joe Cooley
told me that same thing.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.240 position:56%
They were so anxious, they were so--

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.440
it was so important to
them to share this culture.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.500
And then as I got to know
Sean, I was up in there--

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.620 position:56%
I went to the Catskills and there
is Sean McGlynn up my uncle's house.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.920
He had a pickup truck.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.380
And we went for a ride in
the pickup truck just driving

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.100
around up in the mountains.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.400
Where do you live?

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.080
And then next thing, we stopped
at this little gas station.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.180
I remember this stuff, I was
maybe 14 and a half years old

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.480
and it had a clutch in it.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.250
I was going, boy, this is terrific.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.450
And by the time we got back to
the house, he was my best friend.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.240
And it's just-- That's
just kind of how it was.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.830
So, yeah, it was really
something-- He loved coming down.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.130
He loved coming down.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.480
When he meet Dr. Moloney.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.270
I guess Mick was probably-- I
guess he had gotten his scholarship

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.980
to do his graduate work over at
Penn-- that's where you went.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:11.330
And Sean just loved
coming down and he was--

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:15.200 position:56%
He'd come down and just enjoy the
couple of pubs that they would work.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.690
And then-- And they got to play the
19...the bicentennial folk festival

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.890
and Jimmy Carter was in it.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:27.410 position:56%
My God, but-- Think about the people
who there, and the Irish that came

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.620
out it was, it was--
I mean just the Irish.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, you must
have gone to that, right?

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.340
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: We?

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.640
Yeah. Mick got us.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.160
He got us to go and we were like
we were doing the Dubliner gig

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.400
and we werent well behaved at all
and we missed half of everything.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.700
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So
we're talking about the--

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.000
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
We were frustrated.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.300
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: -- what's now
the Smithsonian Folklife Festival

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.260
but then was the Festival
of American Folklife

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.420
in 1976 was a particularly
big festival

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.720
because of the bicentennial.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.020
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
It was unbelievable.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:01.010
And the great Junior Crehan
came out from Milltown Malbay.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.490
And Sean was the featured--

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.200
Thought that it was great
that I was his student there

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.220
but Sean was the box--
Sean was the box player.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.400
They brought Denis Doody,
the great Kerry box player

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.390
down as well, and De Danann.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.590
Michael Flatley was
actually the featured dancer.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:26.590
It was like, what is going
on here, you know, so.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:30.530
And we were-- we were very lucky
at the time just playing there

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.380
in the Dubliner-- thank
goodness, nobody got hurt.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.680
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.980
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: You know,

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.720
there is no harm done
really, I don't think.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.710
So, but before that happened, I
mean you had to first of all--

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.320
So you met McGlynn and
became good friends.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.620
And--

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.920
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
And he was my mentor,

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.190
he was my absolute--
He was my best friend.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.630
And he was my best man.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.980
And did you take formal
lessons with him

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.960
or did you just watch him
play and play alongside him?

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.260
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
There was no such thing

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.620
as getting a formal lesson on-- for
the Irish accordion at the time,

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.330
which is really something
in Brooklyn,

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.200
that there were a bunch of them.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.550
Not a bunch but a few
Italian immigrants

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:14.920
that were able to play
the accordion.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.440
So there are a bunch of
young kids playing "Lady

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.040
of Spain" on the piano accordion.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.340
I never quite got that.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.760
I didn't want to do that.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.910
But I loved-- I just loved
the way McGlynn played.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.510
It was-- He said there's
a-- There is a roughness,

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.640
there's a certain roughness in it,
he says, and the people liked that.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.960
And he had-- he had big-- He's
a very strong man but the tips

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.760
of his fingers were very small.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.250 position:56%
He had great dexterity in his hands.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:47.550
And he loved continental
accordion music and we--

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.490
if you heard the great
jazz players now,

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.500
the great chromatic jazz players,

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.050
I mean all over the place,
a lot of stuff going on.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.640
And there was a book called "The
Bourbon Method" [assumed spelling].

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.510
So you could open this book
and sit out there and you go--

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:05.040
[ Singing ]

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.810
And he just ended it
with that, lovely.

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.330
And I-- that he'd-- He
was able to read it.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.860
He went to -- Mario Tacca
was the great accordionist

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.240
in the Upstate New York area,
and Sean would drive up there

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.430
for a lesson when he had the time
and he got a continental accordion.

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:29.930
And he loved that technique
that the Italians had figured

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.230
out for the continental accordion.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:35.720
But there really wasn't technique
for the Irish accordion and he--

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.350
Sean said, well, it's
great for the Irish music

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.100
but it's really-- it's just a toy.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.520
It's not a real instrument.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.810
And I guess in a way
he's kind of right,

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.490
you know, because that's true.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.250
It's older, it's an
older type of music.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.790
And there was no technique.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.460
But that's kind of--
that kind of spark there.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:58.380
I remember sitting in my
uncle's house and up in Leeds

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:03.230 position:56%
and Sean's wife and the Leonards
and my uncle, they were all down in,

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.900
down in Gilfeather's Sligo
House and having a great time

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.730
with the show bands
and it was great fun.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:12.550
And Sean and I were sitting
in the kitchen talking away.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.530
You can hear the crickets
outside of the screen and the door

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:20.990
and the moths were coming
up against the door.

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:23.180
Then the little things you
can hear going on out there.

00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:26.840
And we were sitting there trying to
figure out the fingering for a tune

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.690
that was written by
the great Martin Wynne

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.620
from Sligo who lived in the Bronx.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.590
And we were trying to-- the fiddle
player, we're trying to figure

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:38.120
out how can you take-- how-- and
we just sat there trying to figure

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.320
out how to cover about
an octave and a half--

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:47.790
octave and a half and about
eight, you know, nine notes to get

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.970
down there, how are you
supposed to do that.

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.270
And we finally figured it out.

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:54.310
And Sean says, he says, there's
the difference right there.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:55.610
And I said, what's that?

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.040
He says that-- there they are,
they're all down there in the bar

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.120
and they're having a great
time singing and dancing

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.470
and here we are worried
about one note.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:09.240
And there was just a great-- there
was just great logic to that.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.540
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: There's
a lesson in it.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.840
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: So-- yeah.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.880
So we had a-- he had a great love
for technique and he was fascinated

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.830
by it, and he would then show me
show so much as, well he'd go,

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.260
how do you think we--
how could you--

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.460
you know, after we knew each
other for a little while,

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.460
how do you think-- what
would you do there?

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.760
And we would sit and just figure

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.330
out these finger patterns
kind of like dancing.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.140
I'm like instead of using two
feet to dance, you have fingers,

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.580
which is kind of nice, yeah.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.300
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Now, you mentioned
McGlynn's beautiful accordion.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.790
And if I'm not mistaken,
you inherited that.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.090
Is that--

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:44.390
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: I did.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.690
We had an argument one night.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.000
We had a little-- We had a little
bit too much to drink when the--

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.210
when the first Green Fields
tour came to this area

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:56.960
and they were performing
at Georgetown University.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.300
And it was a great night.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.330
And back in those days, they'd stay
with whoever would put them up.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.550
And they all got kind of bored.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:10.390
So they decided-- one by one, they
would say, Billy, can I come over?

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.520
It's OK. I think I have room
at your-- at the apartment.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.960
So, we ended up-- I ended up
with the whole Green Fields.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.260
The first Green Field--

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.570
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: There's
like 12 people in that or--

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:23.020
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
Yeah, Liz Carroll,

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.140
Michael Flatley, Donny Golden.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.350
It might have been the second
Green Fields tour, sorry for that.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.910
Sean McGlynn, Jack Coen.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.000
Who else? There was a great piper.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.680
Of course, Mick was-- he
was out paving the way.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.530
All the other guys were
partying like way too much.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:46.510
And so, we got in an argument, Sean
and I, about who loved who more.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:49.810
[ Laughter ]

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.270
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey:
It's pretty adorable.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:53.570
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.410
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Who won?

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.960
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: And he
said, he said, "Well, OK."

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.270
He says, "You think you love me."

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:04.200
He says, "The day I die you're
getting my gray accordion."

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.550
And that was the end
of the argument.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.850
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:10.400
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: That was-- And
Flatley, Michael Flatley was like,

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.980
"Come on, where's--
what's crackin'?"

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:16.020
They were having 902s,
they had gone to Jamaica.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.320
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: 702s.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.620
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: 702s.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.920
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: It's all right.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.220
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: So
you knew the actual name?

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.520
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: I
named the drink , so--

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.820
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: You named it?

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.120
So they-- So they would take
a bottle of rum and Coca-Cola

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.420
and a scoop of ice cream.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.720
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: Gosh.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.410
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: And they
were talking about these 702s,

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:33.040
and then Sean actually made one
with all the drama, you know,

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.370
you'd think you were watching one

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.800
of these cooking shows,
on public television--

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.100

was in it on that too.

It's Jack and Mike and Sean.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.370
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah, and the
big scoop of ice room plopped right

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.980
in the middle of it and we all
thought it was terrific, 702s.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.280
Well now--

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:48.990

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.550
whether he would never
ever think-- nobody.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.640 position:56%
Well, there were a couple of fellas.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:38:00.170
Martin Mulvihill, again, again, you
know, another National Heritage--

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.650
and I pled for years down
hear with Brendan Mulvihill,

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.140
still one of my best friends.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:09.870
But Martin managed to make a
modest living teaching Irish music.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.340
And my friend Maureen Glynn--

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.120
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: -- inherited
her father's music school.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.820
There was another fella,
Pete Kelly from Galway.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.190
And he did pretty good at it too.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:29.090
But Sean would never, in a million
years, take any money from anybody

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.880 position:56%
if they wanted to learn Irish music.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:37.610
It was not an issue, it just
wasn't-- it wasn't how it is done.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:38.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:42.460
So, did you, when you were living
in New York, did you know Martin?

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.730
Did you know of his
teaching and all of that?

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.540
That that was going on?

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.740
Because I remember, when I was
growing up, he was still active,

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.040
but he must have been active.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.340
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Oh,
Martin is a great guy.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.940
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.780
Martin was such a gentleman
from Glin.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.930
Yeah. And he did-- he
had a natural gift.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:03.550
He's kind of like Mick Gavin.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:08.020
That's who-- that's how--
Mick Gavin from County Clare.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:13.800
Sean is great friends with Mick's
sons, Mick would be about my age.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.630
But he is of these gentlemen, he
can-- he's a lovely fiddle player.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:22.980
He's a nice box player in this
Cooley-- in the Cooley style,

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.870

He can get an old tune

out of a whistle and a flute.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.230
But the thing-- he's kind of like
Mitch Fanning, who's right here.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.530
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.700
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: He's one these
people that is just so generous

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:42.750
with his art, you know,
with his music.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:50.470
He doesn't allow himself to impede,
you know, a student's growth.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:54.420
So, you know, Gavin--
Mick Gavin is that way.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:40:01.410 position:56%
But Martin, Martin Mulvihill would--
he would just grill these students

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:06.780 position:56%
with all the competitions were
getting, were gaining an importance.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.980
My nieces are all into
this competition.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.900
But you had a real good
chance back in those days

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.410
if you were a student
of Martin Mulvihill.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.350
You were going to do all right.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:24.020
I'm a huge repertoire, a huge
store of music, and really, really,

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.700
really highly, highly regarded
and respected in Ireland.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.410
Martin Mulvihill was hilarious.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:38.800
So, at some point, you ended up
moving first to the Washington area

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.330
and then you settled in Baltimore?

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.630
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: How
did that come about?

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.230
How did you come to
Washington first?

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.090
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Well, it
started a little bit before that.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:50.340
Johnny Cronin from Gneeveguilla
from County Kerry, one of the--

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:54.390
Sliabh Luachra player, Paddy--
the brother of Paddy Cronin.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.580
Paddy Cronin is probably are--

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:03.880
he's arguably the most renowned
of the fiddlers of our time.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.250
He passed away recently.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.190
He gets-- It wasn't that he
was a whiz kid or something,

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:11.970
but Paddy just played
the music so right,

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.340
and it was like so
close to what it is.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.560
And so Johnny, Johnny was
a sandhogger in New York.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.100
And he was great friends
with Joe Cooley.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:26.260
He was, again, hilarious
kind of guy.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.210
And he's been in a bit of drinking
problem I guess you would say,

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:32.880
but a huge, huge, huge, huge
heart, very, very generous man.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.400 position:56%
And he said to me, "Billy, you come
and get my Irish accent is no good."

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.220
"Billy, you'll come to--
you'll come and you'll pay.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.850
You'll play in the Bunratty Pub
with me and they'll give you $50

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:46.210
and all the Heineken
that you could drink."

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.290
And this was like unheard of
that you could go out on a Friday

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:53.810
or Saturday night and play
and people would be in there,

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:57.140
they wouldn't like
tell you to be quiet.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.690
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: They'd pay you.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:01.980
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: The
pay part was unheard of.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.280
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: You know, you--
the only place we ever played was

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.720
in the basements in the back where
we weren't bothering anybody.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:16.960
So to be playing in, you know, on
a stage, and as I first started

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.930
to cut my teeth there, I ended
up filling in for Joe Burke.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.760
Filling in for Joe Burke,
you know, with Andy McGann.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:35.400
Andy McGann and Joe Burke and
Felix Dolan created the sound

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.660
that Irish music still
has to this very day.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.540
Myself and Joanie Madden and
Brian Conway and Brendan Dolan.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.220
We have a recording out,
"The Pride of New York,"

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.520
and I talk about this Irish style.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.940
It was Joe Burke and Andy
McGann and Felix Dolan.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.150
So, all this crazy stuff is
going on in the Bunratty Pub

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:57.990
or maybe they would go out and
play ceilis or something like that.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:06.870
But this was a real gig in an Irish
bar that, you know, I would say I--

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:10.650
for the year-- the two years
that I played there, maybe three

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:15.560
or four really, really fantastic
fights, you know, the immigrants.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.120
There was one night these
two guys were arguing

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.550
about who was the better
football team.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:23.760
Was it the Irish football,
was it the Longford team,

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.220
or was it the Roscommon team,
whatever they were arguing about,

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.520
and they started to fight.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.670
But they were gentlemen, so
they brought the fight outside.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:35.170
And there was-- and it was a-- and
then-- and it's kind of tragic.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.540
There's a-- they went out and they
go down and they found a vacant lot

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.880
so they wouldn't be disturbing the
traffic when they have the fight.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.400
And then finally, one of them
won and the other one was dead.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.700
So, this was kind of new.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.240
It was-- This was the
real Irish bar.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.540
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.650
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: And
so, it was a pretty fight.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:56.720
One night, Johnny Cronin, I
went in looking for Johnny

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.310
and I found them asleep
under one of the tables.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:06.010
He had an expression that well, the
ceiling in this house is very low.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.380
And so it was like pretty funny.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.680
He was a pretty funny guy.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.350
But I was in there playing in
the bar and there was a fiddler,

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:17.850
an Irish-American fiddler
named Jack Riordan.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:22.320
And you wouldn't know if
he was an Irish-American

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.980 position:56%
and you wouldn't know an
Irish-American might be an immigrant

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:33.070
that's a citizen or it might
be the child of an immigrant.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.650
It was kind of shady.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.560
But I kind of think--
I mean Jack was--

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.970
I think he was an Irish-American
and he played the fiddle.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:44.410
And his daughter, Peggy Riordan,
was a lovely fiddler player too

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:48.870
and she knew all the fellows
like in the various ceili bands

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:50.170
that would come out,

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:54.480
the old Liverpool Ceili Band,
she knew all these guys.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:02.970
But Lou-- So, Peggy came up to the
Bunratty on a quiet kind of night

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:06.890
and she brought this fellow
with her and she said,

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:11.030
this is my friend Lou Thompson.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:13.840
And she brought this guy to
meet me and they'd come up.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.150
Peggy at-- Peggy wasn't
living in the Bronx

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.280
for a while, so how are you doing.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.580
Where did you go?

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:20.880
I went to Washington.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.180
Oh, that's nice.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.480
How-- Do you like Washington?

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.780
And the next time I'd
see her, she's say well--

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.850
oh, well I live in
northern-- I live in Virginia.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.180
I was going, I thought
you lived in Washington.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.930
I didn't do well in geography.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:33.850
She said, I thought--
now I moved in Virginia.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:35.150
Oh, really.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:36.450
The next time I saw her, I live

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.750
in Washington and--
or, I live in Maryland.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.360
I was going, wow, she's
really moving around.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.730
I didn't realize she's just
hopping around this tri-state area.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:48.680
She said-- so, she said, one or
two-- She introduced me to this--

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.510
Father Lou Thompson, the priest,

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:56.550 position:56%
who was stationed here I guess I
would say or he was in a pretty kind

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.560
of progressive Catholic order.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.650
And it was very small order.

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:05.790
And he did his-- he actually
did his undergraduate work

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.740 position:56%
in community organization, so he's
pretty really interesting character.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.810
And again, he played
kind of in this style

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:18.540
that Joe Derrane played the old
Walters and Baldoni accordion.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:25.380
So she wanted me to meet Father
Lou and he said, you know, he said,

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.590
why don't you come
down to Washington to--

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:32.420
sometime and we can have
a ceili and you can come

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.970
down to see what it's like.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:40.700
So I did and I got to fly from
LaGuardia into national airport.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:44.990
So if you can picture LaGuardia,
I drove across the Bronx

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:49.090
through Queens with all that
stuff going on, you know,

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:50.390
and made it to LaGuardia.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:54.130
I left the car there,
paid a fortune to park it,

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.250
just the whole experience
you're doing--

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:59.600
and I got off at national
airport and it was sort

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.630
of like the Wizard of Oz.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:04.490
All of a sudden everything
in color and I was like,

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:06.160
what's all this going on?

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:13.570
And she picked me up in a
brand new 1976 Chevy Malibu.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:14.870
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.170
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
I remember that.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.470
I remember that.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.540
And we drove up along the Potomac
and I was going, what's going on.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.010
And we went and I played the ceili

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:29.420
and I met the Winch brothers,
Jesse and Terry Winch.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:34.470
And of course Peggy had Terry
and they are from the Bronx too.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:38.010
Jesse and Terry were both
very, very well educated.

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:40.520
Very, very intelligent men.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.700
Terry is a poet and a box player.

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.720
Jesse is a lovely bodhran player.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.020
And there was a couple
of other guys.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.670
Mark Quinn played the accordion
and he was from Rockaway.

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:56.280
Mark had actually got tired of
living in New York and he went

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:00.360
to the train station and
he goes, I have 50 bucks.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.030 position:56%
He said, you know, where can you go?

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.840
And the guy, the guy said,
you can go to Washington.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.140
So he did.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:10.660
And he went into the bar
on 13th, Matt Kane's.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.800
And he told the bar-- And he told
the cabbie, is there an Irish bar?

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.100
And he brought him to Matt Kane's.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.710
And he went in and he found his way

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:21.410
and became a resident
with his accordion.

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.500
So, they have this
little nucleus and that--

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.800
I guess they were talking about it.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.260
How can we get-- What
do you think we can do

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.150
to get the real music there
because Peggy really--

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.690
Peggy was homesick for the music.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:34.000
And so they invited me.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.430
That's kind of what happened--
I came down and played the ceili

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:39.100
and I told Father Lou,
I said, if you could--

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.020
if you can swing me a job
down here, a clerk's job

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.650
or something, I'll come down.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:53.280
And it was right then that this
Irish pub phenomenon was starting

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.100
to take shape.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:59.200
It was between Guinness
and Harp breweries,

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.870
they came up with this
idea where you're going

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.060
to have an Irish themed
bar and it would be just

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.720
like Dublin, blah, blah, blah.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.260
And he called it the
Dubliner and terrific.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.720
And Matt Kane's was the first.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.570
There was another one in New
York, the John Barleycorn.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.190 position:56%
I played there in midtown Manhattan.

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:16.680
It looked like a little pub and
it was in the middle of Manhattan.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:21.110
But the Dubliner was
like serious business.

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:25.010
And I guess though at that point,
on Capitol Hill was like, well,

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:26.370
kind of-- well, kind of tough.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:28.250 position:56%
We never had any trouble there but--

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:30.640
there was kind of more
postal workers

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.940
and stuff hanging around there.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.520
There was nothing cool about it,

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.130
except that the Capitol
Building was right there.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:44.300
But we really had a tremendous
amount of fun and these various--

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.000
I guess the other thing that
was so cool about it was people

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.790
like Alan Jabbour, am
I saying that right?

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:53.690
It was--

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:54.990
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Rinzler.

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:56.290
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Ralph Rinzler.

00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:00.000
Mick, Mick Moloney again was
coming back and forth and working

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.420
on his degree in Georgetown.

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.860
So there were these really
interesting folklorists

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.390
and ethnomusicologists, and
it was like a whole new thing.

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:15.020
And, you know-- But I
was there and, you know,

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.420
I was playing with
Brendan Mulvihill.

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.910
I asked Brendan Mulvihill
to come down.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:22.870
Brendan was-- especially
at that time,

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:28.310
he was one of very best Irish
fiddlers in Irish music,

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.000
of these young Irish players.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.300
And Andy O'Brien--

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.680
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And we should say
he was the son of Martin Mulvihill,

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.980
the great teacher that
we were talking about.

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.280
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: A son
of Martin Mulvihill, yeah.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.770
So that's kind of how-- That's
kind of how we came down.

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:41.700
And then Lou wanted to start
a music school and we did.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.000
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Well,
you would also just went

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.910
about to mention Andy
O'Brien and how he got it all.

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.120
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Andy
O'Brien was from Kerry,

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.420
kind of like Johnny Cronin.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.150
And Johnny told me, he says,
you have to meet Andy O'Brien,

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:54.710
he's a great singer and he is
a really good guitar player.

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:58.380
And I-- My friend Pat Keogh and I
needed a guitar player one night

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:02.820 position:56%
up in the Bronx before I moved down
and I asked Andy to do-- do the gig.

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:07.020
And it was the first time I
ever played for money anywhere

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:10.290
in New York City where
anybody actually clapped.

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:15.050
And it was Andy-- or Andy
got to play with people

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.960
like Johnny Leary or Denis Murphy.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.430
He was from this whole
Sliabh Luachra thing

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.350
that was going on in County Clare.

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:31.020 position:56%
But at the same time, he was stone
mad for the Scottish song tradition,

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:35.070
the Scottish-- the Scots were
like really, really interested

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:37.750
with this DADGAD tuning
on the guitar.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:39.830
Archie Fisher, Andy O'Brien--

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.130
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Dick Gaughan--

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:42.780
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: And between
Archie Fisher and Dick Gaughan

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:50.510 position:56%
and Andy Irvine was kind of this,
you know, with Planxty or, you know.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:54.330
This whole thing that was going on,
Andy was like a huge fan of that.

00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:57.800 position:56%
And he had come out, he wanted--
Andy wanted to get a job as a welder

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.190
when he came out and he was
just about ready to give

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:04.310 position:56%
up when we got-- when we called him.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:09.880 position:56%
In fact, the first time, the first
week that we played in the Dubliner,

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.280
Andy used a subway token and--

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.580
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: From New York,

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.880
because there was no
subway on DC that--

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah, and he
used the subway token to do the gig.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.820
And when we got paid, we got $300.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.050
It was really very
big money at the time.

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:27.410
We thought anyway.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.610
And Andy counted it and counted it.

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:30.960
And I said, Andy, what
are you going to--

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.620
because he was from County
Kerry, there is nothing there.

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:38.560
There was cows and, you know,
we're talking Kerry-- woo!

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.950
And he was going-- He was
counting it like that.

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:43.400
And I said, Andy, what are you
going to do with all your money?

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.220
And he says, I'm going to go
out and I'm going to buy a pick.

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Nice.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.820
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: He's just--
it was just a subway token.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.120
He never let on.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.570
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, one of the
tricks to that by the way is

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:54.920
if you have a whole bunch of
tune players on the stage,

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.540
the music never stops
so no one can ever clap.

00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:01.120
But if you have a singer, that
song is going to end, right?

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.420
So--

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.190
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah, I
guess the cool thing about it was

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:09.900
to survive in the bar scene,
and none of us were, you know,

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:15.600
it's a kind of-- it's a
trade, it's a skill, you know.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.940
Seamus Kennedy is a
crackerjack down there.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.240
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Sure.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.540
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
He's very funny.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.840
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: The Henny
Youngman of Irish music.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.390
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: But-- And
again, he's also one of these guys

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:27.370
who has a phenomenal
repertoire of songs.

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:30.380
But he can identify
immediately with the crowd.

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.820
Andy and Brendan and I, we really--
we just sat there and played

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.960
and it was kind of rough
going for a little while.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.450
Pat Troy, one of the
publicans in Georgetown.

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:41.750
Remember he had the
bar in Georgetown,

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.050
and he had a radio show--

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:44.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:45.650
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: --
and he came and he says,

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:46.950
you guys are going to
have to jazz it up.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.190
He goes, get them to clap
along and this kind of stuff.

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.600
So we added a little
bit of theatrics then.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:58.570
And we had to-- we had to do
songs that would be associated

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:01.510
with Irish bars, Irish
drinking songs, "No, Nay,

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.170 position:56%
Never" songs and this kind of stuff.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:07.670
And then-- But every once in
a while, the way it evolved

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:11.040
in the Dubliner, because of
all these other goings on

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.770
and people coming in
and out, it kind of--

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:19.050
people started realizing
that Andy was really good.

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:23.540
So, there was a really nice, a
really interesting thing that went

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:28.240
on in the Dubliner back
then in the mid-70s.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.870
Especially, you know,
Myron had WGTB and he--

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:35.260
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: College
radio station of the year.

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:36.560
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah.

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.860
So, it was like totally awesome.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.160
What-- when was-- What
time was that?

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.860
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: It was 12
noon on a Sunday for three hours.

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:44.740
And it was college radio,
free form, no formulas, no--

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.940
nobody making dictates
on what we should play.

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.500
And I said, well, I
have a folk music show.

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.970
But I like all kinds of folk music
and I have my own folk records

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:57.100
and it was records
vinyl, pre-CD and--

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.420
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
And it was just so--

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.720
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz:
I play a few Irish

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.940
and then the phones would
light up, play more of that.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.390
I didn't have more of that.

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:06.130
But I got the bug and
I got more of that.

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:07.430
So, it built up there.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.090
That was more or less my
introduction to it through that.

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:11.390
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Well,
it was interesting.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:15.050
I was over at the Smithsonian
a couple of weeks ago listening

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:17.130
to some tapes of the
Irish tradition--

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:18.430
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah.

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:19.730
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: -- which
was the group that you--

00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:21.030
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: That's right.

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.330
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: -- and
Andy and Brendan had formed.

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:27.010
And it was-- They were tapes from
the Smithsonian Folklife Festival.

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:28.310
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Wow.

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:29.610
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And one
of the members of one

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:31.650
of the line ups there
was Myron here.

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:32.950
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah, oh yeah.

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:34.250
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz:
Oh, well if it was--

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:38.140 position:56%
in '86 they had an anniversary, 10th
year anniversary of the festival.

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.580 position:56%
And at that point, the Irish
tradition was a five piece including

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.340
the people you mentioned,
as well as Chris Norman.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.830
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Chris Norman
was there as well, yeah.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:45.130
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: -- flute player.

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:47.700
And we were fortunate enough and,
you know, privileged enough to play

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.310
in that festival those
two weeks in '86.

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.320
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: And it was
kind of a story-- Well, you kind--

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.150
you kind of-- Linda Hickman
would have been one of the first.

00:55:55.150 --> 00:56:01.730
So, she might have been the first
flute player to actually, you know,

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:04.840
just want to play the music.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.420
It's one thing to play the flute
because it might, you know,

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:10.700
bring a-- if you want to play a
flute at a contra dance, let's say.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.000
That's one thing.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.680
And somewhat, you know, the
Irish flute playing is distinct.

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.080
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz:
It's very specific.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.380
It's--

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.680
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: There's Galway
style-- There's the Galway style,

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:29.230
you know, Galway, Clare and really
Roscommon and Mayo and Sligo,

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.190
these are real great flute places.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:37.560 position:56%
So, Linda would have been maybe the
first one to take an interest in it.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.450
There's a few-- a good few folks
taking an interest in the fiddle

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:41.820
because how could you not?

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:43.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.420
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: You
know, here at the foothills

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:45.840 position:56%
of the Appalachians, that's amazing.

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:49.440
There's another whole
story there with Sean but--

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.140
So, Frank-- Dr. Frank Claudy.

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:54.980
I think he-- He's a
Washingtonian, right, I think.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.280
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Correct.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.640
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: And he decided
he wanted to go to medical school.

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.310
He was-- He had some
kind of regular old job

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:04.650
and he decided he want
to go to medical school.

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:08.290
But he came in with
a whistle one day

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:13.600
and then the next day he had some
kind of recorder thing and trying

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.890
to play it and I was
using my Brooklyn humor.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:19.690
So, why don't you get you--
Why don't you get yourself--

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:22.670
you get yourself a flute and
start playing some real music.

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:24.040
And I'll be darned, he did.

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.580
So, he ended with a
black transverse flute.

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.850
And Chris Norman kind
of came, after that.

00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:32.600
And Chris has had a
pretty interesting career.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.270
He's a brilliant, brilliant
musician.

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:37.390
But he was, you know,
right from here.

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:42.780
They just honored Linda
Hickman up in the New York area.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:48.990
Ceoltas Ceoltoiri Eireann would
have their annual gathering

00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:51.180
and they'll pick some--
they pick a--

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:56.850
Brendan Dolan this time and
Brendan Dolan and Linda.

00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:58.150
And it's just a lovely thing.

00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:00.260
They didn't even know that, well--

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.730
Linda has been living
up there for 25 years.

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:04.030
Nobody really asked her--

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:05.330
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:06.630
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: -- where
did she learned how to play.

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:07.930
She learned right here, here.

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:09.230
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz:
And they've got the--

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:10.760
They're the latest Hall of Famers
up there for mid-Atlantic--

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.060
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.360
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: -- and the CCE.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.480
And good for them, good for them .

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah,
that's another sort

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.540
of second generation story
because Brendan is the son

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.150
of Felix whom you were
mentioning before,

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:26.440 position:56%
one of the great accompanists of all
time in Irish music on the piano.

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.810
And Brendan is too now, I mean.

00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:29.110
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Outstanding.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:30.910
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Brendan,
you know, they are all--

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:37.290
When Felix came up with the--
with that style of accompaniment,

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:39.340
there was-- If you listen to
the old Michael Coleman records,

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.710
they'd have to have a union
musician in the studio.

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.870
So, some pretty god-awful
piano playing on there.

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:46.170
There is a--

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:47.470
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: They were
reading in front of them, right?

00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:48.770
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:50.070
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: -- just they'd
never seen it till that day.

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.370
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah.

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:52.670
And there was a joke going
around that they were able

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:53.970
to isolate the piano accompaniment,
made a record out of that,

00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:57.910
going to be a really big
hit and was, you know,

00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.840
sadomasochist kind of thing.

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:05.230
Horrible stuff but yeah,
so-- But Felix just heard it.

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:11.550
He heard the spot where Irish
music exists and he was able

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:13.580
to show the world how
much he loved it.

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.880
And it was really good.

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.010
And he actually used this
1-6-2-5 and, you know, and--

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:19.570
[ Singing ]

00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.900
-- heart and soul that time.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:23.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.500
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
And he was actually--

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.630
And he told me, he was papering a
room in his house and he heard that

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:29.140
and he goes, let's see if I
can work that into a tune.

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.440
And he did.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.740
So, you can hear it there.

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.040
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: And it worked.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: You can hear it
on "A Tribute to Michael Coleman."

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.400
It's like [whistling] and, you
know, really, really-- right.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.030
And it caught on in Ireland.

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:40.960
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: That's a whole
discussion too about the role

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.260
of accompaniment in Irish music.

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:43.560
That's for another day.

00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:44.860
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: But Felix made it
OK to do that because it's suppose--

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:50.180
it has been some cases still
is frowned upon, its melody.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.540
That were the only, and
accompaniment doesn't belong there,

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:53.840
according to some purists.

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.140
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yes, I-- And
so like I have the tunes would have

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.970
like a harmonic inference,
let's say.

00:59:56.970 --> 01:00:01.130
So, depending on how the, you
know, the melody will flow

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.500
and it's really lovely to hear.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.490
What's the brilliant
guy with the Bothy Band?

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:09.550
I always have trouble
thinking of his name?

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:10.850
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Oh, Donal Lunny.

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.510
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
Yeah, Donal Lunny.

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:13.810
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Love the guy.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:16.910
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
Yeah, and he is able to--

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.180
he made these Bothy Band records
but he produced the record kind

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.890
of like how a rock and
roll producer would.

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:24.190
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:25.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: So-- And it's--

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:27.280
So he presented Irish
music like Rock.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.140
Actually my own, "Outside the
Box," it's kind of like that.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.120
Kind of like this good
road trip record.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.840
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, here you--
So now you're in a band with--

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.140
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Those guys.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.650
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: --
with Brendan and Andy.

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:45.570
And that lasts for a while
like 10-15 years, right?

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:51.600
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah, I
think we managed to-- We did--

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.120
We managed to survive
in the Dubliner

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.310
for about three and a half years.

01:00:56.310 --> 01:01:01.260
And, you know, they were time--
and they were ready to move on.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:05.710
And there was an influx
of these singer,

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:07.540
guitar player, entertainer type.

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:11.160
So, if you have, you know, you
have a saloon on Capitol Hill,

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.450
you want that square footage

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:17.030
to generate X amount
of, you know, dollars.

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:18.330
So it made all the sense.

01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:20.630
You know, it's not a
folk club, it's a bar.

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:23.920
Have to get, you know, it takes
a-- takes players a little while.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.800
There's no loyalty in this.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.270
It's a bar.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:31.370
It's not the Smithsonian.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:33.290
It's not the National Council....

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:36.150
It's a bar, you know,
that they can make money,

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:37.450
that they can make money.

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:39.940
And then they'll do these other
things to try to make more money.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.250
So, I guess then we
played next door.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:44.990
Hugh Kelly was opening
another bar, you know,

01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:48.830
we played there for
another two years.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:53.550
And somewhere in and around there,
Lou and Peggy, that the order

01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:58.860
that the-- The order that
Lou was a priest in whatever

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:04.150
that he vowed allegiance--
whatever Catholic stuff they do.

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:08.890
And the order lost a whole pile of
money on bad real estate holdings.

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.550
So, he was off the hook.

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:11.850
He was done and they-- You know,

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:13.160
I guess they wanted
him to sign up again.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.460
No, that's fine.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.640
So he married Peggy.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.740
And so he asked Brandon and Andy
and me to play at the wedding.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.540
And we were a little late to
the wedding because we were--

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.910
You know, well, I guess we moved--

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:31.400
probably still at the
Dubliner at the time.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.970
Yeah. And right before
we got fired from there.

01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:38.750
And we got to play for
them at the wedding

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:42.420
and they would teach ceili dancing.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.840
Lou loved to teach ceili dancing
and Peggy just loved everything

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.390
about Irish culture, she just
loved it and just wonderful person.

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:53.980
She was an actual Irish
step dance teacher.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:58.430
She was accredited and
all these kind of things.

01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:00.320
So, they had all their students--

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.290
After they had their wedding
ceremony, then we went to the hall

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:07.100
and we have a lovely meal
and it was really nice.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.130
And we-- And Jesse and
Terry and a few of the guys,

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:14.010
we threw together a
kind of wedding band.

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:15.420
It was pretty funny.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:19.720
And then all of these really
nice people showed up.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.240
And next thing, everybody is
dancing all over the place.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.460 position:56%
And it was all these people that Lou
and Peggy had showed how to dance.

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:30.670
And these two girls
went by like that

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:34.960
and I said to Brendan, that's it.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.050
And one of them was my wife, Annie.

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:39.350
From Baltimore.

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:41.680
and I was like no question
about it, it was like, whoa,

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.620
I got to try to get her attention.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.380
And she didn't care
anything about her sister.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:50.240
Franny loved to go to the ceilis.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.210
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Was that
Franny with her that day or?

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:54.850
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Franny asked
her to go, so the two of them went.

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:56.660
And the odd thing was
they had learned--

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.960
They both learned to
dance from Peggy.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.500
They learned to waltz from Peggy.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.130
So they-- She danced-- Annie
danced like an Irish-American girl.

01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:07.290
I was just unbelievable.

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:10.010
But the other thing that was really
funny about it was Peggy used

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:15.360
to say, you should come up to
Baltimore because there's a girl

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.460
up there and you really should meet
her because you'd really like her.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.760
And I was, really, what's her name?

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.100
And she says her name
is Franny Caskey.

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:26.730
And so, what I-- after
the wedding was over,

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.030
how did you enjoy the wedding?

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:32.010
I said, I met this really-- It's
great, I met this great girl

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:34.020
and then her name is Annie
Caskey, isn't that the one that?

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:37.070 position:56%
She says, no, we wanted you-- We
were-- We thought just about Franny.

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:40.630
So they were off by one
genome thing, you know.

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:41.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:43.230
Right.

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.530
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
Whatever that thing is.

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:45.830
The only one biological thing.

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:47.130
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: But--

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:48.430
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
It was really good.

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:49.730
Took me a little while to get
her attention and then, you know.

01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:51.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Worked out.

01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:52.330
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: She
knew she was out of luck,

01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:53.630
what are you going to do?

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:56.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, yeah, I mean
as you said that during the concert,

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.770
without her maybe, you know,
none of these would have happened

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:02.160
but certainly some of these
wouldn't have happened.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.460
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: She is--

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.760
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey:
Technically speaking.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.060
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:07.360
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: She is the--

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.660
She is the rock, you know,
you can ask the boys.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:12.490
She works for the Sisters of
Mercy at the Mercy Medical Center

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:17.310 position:56%
in Baltimore, which are-- which
were founded by the Sisters of Mercy

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:19.700
on Baggot Street in Dublin.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:24.540
Her father was from the old
10th ward up in Baltimore.

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.880
They were that dirt
poor, and that poorest

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.190
of the poor from the famine times.

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:34.790
So, yeah, they are a real, you
know, a really great family.

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:37.720
Her mother is a Polish-American.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.520
And it's just a real
lovely, good solid,

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.050
good solid churchgoing
Baltimore family.

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:47.050
Like they were completely like
that's all about education

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:49.560
and health, you know, kids--

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.570
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Giving back
to the community for sure.

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:54.320
And if I could put something there
about Annie, which I've observed

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:58.480
about many people but Annie would
be prominent who follow the music.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.420
There are people who
have instruments

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.790
who aren't really musicians
but they have instruments.

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:04.090
And I'm not naming names.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:05.720
No one anywhere in our vicinity,

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.460
but they're out there
and God bless them.

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.780
There are other people who
don't have instruments,

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.890
they're around instruments
but they don't play,

01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:13.800
but they're musicians
through and through.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.890
And to me Annie is exhibit
A. She's got more music

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.190
in her than a dozen people.

01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:19.490
She doesn't happen
to play an instrument

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:23.360
but that's just mechanics, but
she's got the music right here.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.660
How can she not, being around them.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:25.960
She knows it.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.690
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: She was
the one that spotted today here

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:30.980
that we hadn't-- we didn't have
the concertina, right, among these

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.740
and she's going that--
There's something wrong there.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.040
We have to have one.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.340
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: You
mean the sound of it.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.640
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah, so--

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.940
And it was just a matter
of getting another mic.

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.480
But she brought that,
we think, oh, it's fine,

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.780
but she heard it, you know.

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.080
Yeah.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.380
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: She-- Her
ear is as good as anybody

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.680
who plays the instrument.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.110
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: She
connects-- she connects people.

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:49.510
Yeah, it's really good.

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:53.220
That our little community, our
little Irish music community.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.560
We call that the Celtic corridor.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:58.700
They are on Harford Road, there's a
whole bunch of us that play there.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:03.670
And Annie is like-- Well, what
would Annie say about that?

01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:06.040
She is like doesn't--
She thinks, you know--

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.340
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: OK, so if
Annie says it's good, it's good.

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.640
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah, she
has a tremendous listening ear.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.220
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: You
don't need a second opinion.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.040
You can take her to the bank.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.340
That's what I think of Annie.

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.640
I think she's awesome.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.780
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Except she has
zero interest in money, you know.

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:18.220
It's not--

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.170
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: It's a
figure of speech, you know, so--

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So I guess
jumping off from discussing Annie

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:27.220
and the fact that we have
this concert specifically

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.900
to showcase your children as well

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:32.770
as your own playing
and we have Sean here.

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:36.900
So let's talk to Sean for
a minute and ask, you know,

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:41.730
what elements of your music did
you draw from your dad's tradition

01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:45.120
and what have you done
with it that's different?

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.240
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: Well, I
mean, he was my primary influence

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.190
as you can obviously imagine.

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:53.870
I was not in a situation

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:57.160
where I immediately wanted
to play the accordion.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.850
When I was younger I was kind of--

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:04.510
which is some trend in my life
that I've come to realize,

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:06.730
I tend to be a bit of
a late bloomer in terms

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:08.790
of figuring out what I want.

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:15.790
And I played piano, I learned
piano from Donna Long before

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:20.310
and then took some fiddle
lessons from Brian Conway,

01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:22.500
who I just saw this weekend.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:28.110 position:56%
Who made a funny joke, he was like--
and he said this, he said he likes

01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:32.190
to joke around on the stage with
you guys, that he's responsible

01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:34.970
for my playing the
accordion because he gave me--

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:36.270
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz:
He's a fiddle player.

01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:38.830
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: -- he gave
me my very last fiddle lesson.

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:42.960
And after that-- after the--
after that I started playing--

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.800
I kind of waffled for another
couple months or a year,

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.890
I forgot exactly how long.

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:51.420
But I started playing the
accordion in the Catskills

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.960
with my cousin Noreen,
Noreen Murphy outside

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.990
of Stack's pub in East Durham.

01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:02.670 position:56%
And actually it was John Redmond who
gave me and taught me my first tune.

01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:03.970
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Yeah.

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:05.270
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: I
still tell him that.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:06.570
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz:
Yeah, Wexford man.

01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:07.870
Great, great man.

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:10.030
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: And from there
just kind of organically happened.

01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:15.140
I was around it and it came easily.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.440
So-- and then I would
kind of tag along and go

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.640
to the Augusta Weeks
and the Catskill Weeks.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.820
And there was a good
10-year stretch,

01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:24.720
where I did that every year.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:28.770
So, through that I,
you know, I got hooked.

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:30.130
I made a bunch of friends.

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:34.720
I started meeting girls
and kind of once you do--

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:38.110
once you experience that sort of
dynamic, you kind of get roped in.

01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:43.080
And, you know, through that,
obviously, I learned a lot

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.160
of what I-- very wide majority

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.740
of my musical technique
and style from him.

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:56.850
And in recent years, I've kind
of taken that and kind of gone

01:09:56.850 --> 01:10:01.010
in different directions
with it, experimentally.

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:04.990
Because one thing that I did when
I was younger I found to be sort

01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:09.350
of intimidating, growing
up in the shadows,

01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:13.910
so to speak of, you
know, all of this.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.660
And how do I kind of figure
out what I want to do?

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:19.030
Do I want to copy that?

01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:22.730
Or do I want to do something else?

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:26.420
And so, I, you know, I'm from
Baltimore and I'm an American

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:30.110
and around me is a lot
of American music so some

01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:32.400
of the collaborations I've
done in the past few years,

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.560
in addition to my traditional
Irish collaborations with people

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:44.960
like Sean Gavin from Detroit and
Tony Smith, his daughters which--

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.120
that's a whole story that
we didn't really cover.

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.610
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
There's a hundred.

01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:49.910
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: Yeah.

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:52.740
That's a tangent I'm trying
not to go down but, you know,

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:59.230
I've taken what I've learned
in my, you know, lessons

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:04.730
or whatever you want to call it
from my father and gone, you know,

01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:07.930
collaborations with people
like Christylez Bacon.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.680
I don't know if people
know him in DC.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.660
Christylez Bacon is a resident
DC pop artist and I've done a lot

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:17.230
of stuff with him over
the past few years.

01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:22.820
And playing different kinds of like
go-go and jazz and hip hop music

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:29.760
and playing more recently into
Appalachian music and Bluegrass

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.190
and that sort of stuff, so.

01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:32.830
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Tell them your
band name too for the record.

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:34.680
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: The past
couple years, I've been playing

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.260
with the group called Charm
City Junction which is the name,

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:41.540
you know, is getting back
to Baltimore, the Charm City

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.810
and the junction point of our
different music coming together.

01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:46.270
So, it's a collaboration
with Bluegrass

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:50.370
with a player named Patrick
McAvinue, full time banjo player,

01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:53.220
Brad Kolodner, who's the
son of Ken Kolodner who's

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.200
in Helicon with Chris Norman.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:04.310
All that. And jazz
bassist Alex Lacquement.

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:10.190
So, he's a military brat, he
comes from all over the place.

01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.660 position:56%
So, it's kind of taking me all sorts

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.110
of different places
that I, you know.

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:17.700
And one of the interesting
things about that, for me,

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.930
I remember being a little kid
is going to these festivals.

01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:25.590
And you know, I would say,
"You never know, you never know

01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:27.150
where music is going to take you."

01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:28.450
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Yeah.

01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:30.010
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: And wherever
you go you have a friend.

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:33.590
So yeah, you know, in the
past between the past 5

01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:36.270
and 10 years I've, you
know, toured in Germany

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:39.520
with Josh Dukes and quite in Spain.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.660
All of the country here.

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.370
It's pretty interesting.

01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:45.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Great.

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:48.460
So, you know, one thing you're
talking about these webs

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:51.480
and it was funny because when you
brought up the Bothy Band Billy

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.260
and were asking "what's
the name of the guy."

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:57.280
I thought you were referring
to Mícheál Ó Domhnaill,

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.220
because he added in a
lot of the harmonics.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.520
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
Yeah, all those guys.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Although
obviously Donal was--

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.160
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: He could--
But he could pick either one,

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.120
I picked Donal but
it could be Mícheál.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.420
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And the reason I--

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:07.720
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
Was it Kevin Burke?

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.400
But I thought of him because,
you know, you weren't in a band

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.750 position:56%
with Mícheál but you were in a band
with someone very closely associated

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:18.660
with Mícheál early on
with who was Dáithí .

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.960
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: That's right.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And so,
that style of guitar playing.

01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:27.140
Yeah. So talk a little bit about
Trian, just because we didn't get

01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:30.820
to it, and you mentioned
Liz from the stage today?

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:33.510
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
I remember being in--

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:37.310
But before I moved down here,
I went to a feis in Manhattan

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:41.070
and then we thought it was a
really a big time at the feis

01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:45.580
and that's an Irish
dancing competition thing.

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:52.720
And that there was a few musicians
I actually went to and a couple

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.270
of friends of mine said,
"There's some girl, she's tall,

01:13:55.270 --> 01:14:00.010 position:56%
she's really crazy she and she's
been asking, she wants to meet you."

01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:01.310
I said, "Really?"

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:02.610
I said, "What's her name?"

01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:03.910 position:56%
They said, "Her name is Liz Caroll."

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:05.210
I said, "Really?"

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:07.660
I said, "That sounds great and I
think I'm going to have to look."

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.120
And they say, "Yeah, she's really
tall, she's about six foot tall."

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.420
And she's a basketball.

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:14.800
She's like a softball player,
she's an athlete, you know.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.100
I said, "Really?

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.400
That's really something."

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.700
So I was just-- We were
just kind of walking

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.270
around and having a few tune.

01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:24.540
Eugene O'Donnell was there, Michael
Flatley was there playing a tune,

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:29.300
he sounded very much like a
Seamus Tansey, he plays in Sligo--

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.810
who was the great Sligo flute
player that lives in Chicago now?

01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:34.110
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Kevin Henry.

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:35.410
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Kevin Henry.

01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:36.950
He was a student of Kevin Henry
and I was looking for her,

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:41.880
I thought Mike Flynn was there and
it was this kid, Michael Flatley.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.610
And the next thing, where
all of the, all these nuts,

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:46.500
everybody is on the
elevator and you should--

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.970
nobody, you shouldn't have beer
in the hotel because, you know,

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:51.860
you get in trouble for
having beer walking around.

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.950
You're spilling all over the rugs
and it was stupid and a big mess.

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:59.110
And the doors open and this girl,
Patty Moriarty, a box player,

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:06.070
very well educated, but again,
totally crazy, great, great person

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:08.560 position:56%
and a lovely player for the dancing.

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.870
And the door is open and
she goes, "There he is."

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:14.490
And this girl, she's
about 6 foot 2, she goes,

01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:17.450
"Is that Bi-- " and
the doors closed.

01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:20.090
So, that was the first time
that I met Liz Carroll.

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:22.150
I was like, you got
to be kidding me.

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:27.680
And we-- And so-- And I didn't
see her again that weekend.

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:30.260
And then, something
was going on here.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.730
One of those, there was a
while when there was a couple--

01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:39.940 position:56%
There was a fellow, Sean -- what the
hell, it was Sean or Brian, what--

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:43.720
Brian that's always with
the concertina Copley.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.910
Sean Copley [assumed spelling] got
himself a little three-year grant

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:50.130
to have a folk festival.

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:52.810
And we go, "What are
you going to do?

01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:54.740
Someone's going to give you money."

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.040
You know, he's like, "This is--

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.170
My Uncle Matt would have
love that, you know."

01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:00.190
So, he gets in and he calls
up, he says, "Who do you think,

01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:01.490
who do you think is a good player?

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.790
Who should we get?"

01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:05.050
I said, you know, "Liz Carroll,
you know, she's really good."

01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:09.400
The next thing, she
started being places.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:15.760 position:56%
But the real big one, again, was
the 1976, the bicentennial festival.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.130
There she was.

01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:21.620
And it was like between herself
and Michael, there was kind of,

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.640
you know, the rest of us
were feeling a little rusty,

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.260
a little we-- we kind of have to
start practicing a little bit.

01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:30.220
Liz is like, you know,
I think she's a genius.

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:36.350
I think she would be pre-eminent
player, period, you know.

01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:38.380
She's just-- She's unbelievable.

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.730
I don't even know how many
solo recordings she have.

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:44.430
But that should, you know, and
then, you know, when I got married,

01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:45.730
I ended up in Baltimore then.

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:50.140 position:56%
You know, I didn't want to be coming
down here going crazy all the time

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:55.820
and trying to figure out, you
know, how to be a man, you know.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:02.600
And so, we all kind of
changed what we were doing.

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:07.900 position:56%
One of the big things that I managed
to do was I just stopped drinking,

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:12.420
I thought-- I love to drink
but I love to play more.

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.720
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.020
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: So,
I figure, OK, I'll just--

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.320
I think I'll just be a player.

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.200
So, I did my best in AA,
you know, things are sort

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.830
of like calming down, realizing
what it is, I asked where I was

01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:23.880
and all these kind of stuff.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:29.950
And Liz was nesting in Chicago.

01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:32.990
She had a couple-- She
had a son and a daughter,

01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:34.790
great kids, really lovely.

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:37.140
And her husband is terrific.

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:41.480
And he was a carpenter and he would
play blues, Charles, Charles Lacey.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Great
blues harp player?

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.080
You know, harmonica.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.730
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: And then
she just gave me a call one day

01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:49.950
and she says, "Billy, why
don't we have a group?"

01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:52.900
And I said, "Well, OK.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:54.200
Works for me."

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.390
I had a little job, it was
a little tough getting away,

01:17:56.390 --> 01:18:00.650
but as I was starting to get
little bits of vacation time

01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:02.810
and maybe could go on
the weekends and we go--

01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:04.370
and really go on the
way again as we could.

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:10.540
And Dáithí had-- Dáithí had come
out with a box player from Offaly,

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:12.200
again named Paddy O'Brien,
named, you know,

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:15.380 position:56%
the same as the great Paddy O'Brien.

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:18.960
And-- But James Kelly
was the fiddle player.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.300
So, it was the three
of them that came out.

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:25.040
And the first time I heard
them was at the Dubliner.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.380
You know-- I could--
I was like, my Lord,

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:30.980
their repertoire was really great.

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:35.940
Paddy was the box player
in the Castle Ceili band.

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:40.830
He took the James Keane seat
when James immigrated to America.

01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:45.760
James Keane is the brother of
Sean Keane from the Chieftains.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.440
So, Paddy came out
and I think it was--

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.990
I got the feeling that it might
have been James Kelly's idea.

01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:54.000
He'd been out the year
before on a Ceoltas tour

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.340
and he came in to Dubliner.

01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:59.190
And he saw what was
going on over here.

01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:00.850
It was pandemonium.

01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:08.570
It was mobs of people-- it paid
a weekly cash, you know, we've--

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:12.770 position:56%
some of us paid taxes, I think, you
know, everybody was all pretty good.

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.090
And he's like, "Maybe
I'll try this."

01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:20.030
And his father, John Kelly
would be one of the pillars

01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:24.180
of Irish traditional music,
the great West Clare fiddler.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:30.800 position:56%
He was one of those founding
teachers for the Willie Clancy Week.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.170
I think, I'm pretty sure
John was still alive

01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:35.490
on the Willie Clancy Week start up.

01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:38.620
So, James is like-- James is
living down in Florida now.

01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.860 position:56%
And I just learned so much from him.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:45.750
He's like-- He would be
defined as a fiddle--

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.300
the fiddle player's fiddler.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:50.080
You know, a fiddler
player's fiddler.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.380
That's James.

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:54.200
And he asked Dáithí Sproule.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.620
And Dáithí had been--
he was living in--

01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:00.150
I guess, he was living in
Dublin and he was going to--

01:20:00.150 --> 01:20:03.120
he'd finished college and he was,
I guess, was a little bit angry.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:09.100
He was from Derry and all his
stuff was really interesting.

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.470
When he gets to-- It's
just now that he's starting

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:12.770
to talk about it, you know.

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:17.800
All these idiotic, awful
stuff, this murderous stuff

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.460
with the British army
there in Derry.

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:20.980
And so, he was there.

01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:27.000 position:56%
He saw some of this, but he was--
he's a totally not a violent person.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.830
But he absolutely fell-- He fell
in love with this DADGAD tuning.

01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:34.390
And I never-- I'm not sure,

01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:37.370
but I think Arty McGlynn
might have been the first

01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:40.370
of the great guitar accompanists.

01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:43.580
He was the first really, really,
really great guitar player.

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:49.920
Andy O'Brien knew his music inside
out and he was able to interpret it

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.850
with the skill that he had acquired
from watching other players.

01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:54.900
I don't know if I'm
saying that right,

01:20:54.900 --> 01:21:01.210
but Arty was an unbelievably
great guitar player.

01:21:01.210 --> 01:21:02.510
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:04.860
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: With
a natural love and respect

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.850
for Irish traditional music.

01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:09.350
And what's his wife--

01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:10.760
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Well,
ex-wife Nollaig Casey

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.060
and they still work together.

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.360
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
They're still great.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.660
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:15.960
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
Brilliant, brilliant,

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.260
brilliant player, brilliant
accompanist.

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:18.560
So, these would have
been the people--

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.090
kind of like the people that
Dáithí would have been listened to.

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:23.020 position:56%
So the three of them came out and
we heard them there in the Dubliner.

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:25.450
And they went on to
make two records.

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:29.790
And Liz was gotten so-- the
Irish tradition, we were kind--

01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:31.540
we would kind of had our time.

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:35.960
We were-- We weren't
a very good bar band.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:40.000
We-- everything worked really,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.610
really well for us
there in the Dubliner.

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:47.240 position:56%
We were very, very lucky that the
audience that we had on Capitol Hill

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:52.050
at the time was as
attuned as they were.

01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:57.600 position:56%
It was just a magnificent thing that
happened, again, Myron with WGTB

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.590
and then National Council
for the Traditional Arts.

01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:02.180 position:56%
We had tremendous support, you know.

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.890
And then, all of a
sudden, we didn't.

01:22:05.890 --> 01:22:08.410
And it was-- We couldn't
really take it.

01:22:08.410 --> 01:22:11.230
We wanted a concert, we
definitely were not travelers.

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:14.280
We were-- We did not have that.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.770
We didn't have that.

01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:18.660
And so-- And Liz was
the one-- that Liz--

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:21.590
when the kids got a little
bigger and then she just said,

01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:22.890
"Why don't we have a group?

01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:24.190
We'll start a group?"

01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:25.490
And we did.

01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:29.150
And we did gigs in the Midwest
while we're figuring out how to--

01:22:29.150 --> 01:22:31.670
I'd figured out how
to accompany Andy.

01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:35.920
Andy liked all these
flat keys, you know.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.720
The great singers will
sing in the key

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.910 position:56%
that suits the song suits the voice.

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:47.490
So, we are able to come up with
some really nice settings of tunes

01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:52.150
and we-- Liz and I were
both composing tunes.

01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:55.820
Liz still is, Liz is a
really prolific composer.

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:57.520
So, yeah, so we made
the two records.

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.940
And it was really good.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.510
We got quite a couple
of-- the national fest--

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:05.650
folk festival and we
played in Ireland.

01:23:05.650 --> 01:23:07.370
We played at the Ennis
trad festival.

01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:10.060
We got to do some really
interesting things.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:14.020
I just-- I was just talking with
Dáithí and just played a couple

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:17.050
of gigs with Joanie Madden
with the Pride of New York,

01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:23.110
which is our little-- my
little band with Joanie Madden

01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:27.130
and Brandon Dolan and Brian Conway.

01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:28.450
And Dáithí joined us.

01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:30.280
It's such a great band.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:36.760
And he had a really
stellar career with Altan.

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.550
So, he really knows he fits
right into this lovely ensemble.

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:42.850
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:44.800
And that Pride of New York just,
again, shows that connection

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:48.990
to the previous generation
because you think of Brian Conway,

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:52.700
learning from Andy McGann and
you learning from Sean McGlynn

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.500
and Joanie learning from
her father, Joe Madden,

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.130
just such great connections
there and--

01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:58.430
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: I
guess the incredible thing

01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:59.880
about the record was we made--

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:04.290
we recorded it in a
weekend in Joanie's house.

01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:07.040
And so, the idea was, "Well,
what should we play first?"

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:10.230
And we all thought (Sings tune).

01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:11.530
We all thought of this.

01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:14.940
They call it "The Dublin Reel"
now with Larry Redican, right.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.240
And so, when we were--

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.540
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Galway Reel.

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.840
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
The Galway Reel.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.140
What did I say?

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.440
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Dublin.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.740
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: The Dublin.

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.040
So, here, you know, he's-- So,
we started-- No, it's fine.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.940
So we started playing the tune and
then we go, boy, Larry wouldn't--

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.310
oh, Larry was just terrific.

01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:29.720
And we'd sit there
and talk about it.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.490
Well, what would be good with that?

01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:32.790
Well, you know.

01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:34.590
Why don't we put that
one in the tunes?

01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:38.460
That tune that James Keane...oh,
yeah, those are really good.

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:43.700
OK. And we never really
rehearsed the record, you know.

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:48.370
It's just-- We put them together
and it's great fun with the--

01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:52.080
I got the chance where I butt
heads there with Brendan,

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.620
you know, or how should, you know.

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.950
How do you see this and what do
you think we could, you know,

01:24:57.950 --> 01:25:00.890
lilting little chord ideas he had.

01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:04.200
And he's so fast he never--
he never had to punch.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.160
He never had to edit anything,

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.470
anything that Brendan
Dolan did on that record.

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:11.190
"How do you like that Brendan?"

01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:13.150
"Oh, it's fine."

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:15.420
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, I'm afraid
we're running low on time.

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:20.030
So, I would like to just
ask Sean and Myron quickly

01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:24.640 position:56%
to give a little comment about Billy
and his playing and maybe his--

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.950
the award that he's going to
be picking up in a little bit.

01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:31.010
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Can I go first
because I think it will be right

01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:33.810
to end with Sean being Billy's son,
that would be very valedictory.

01:25:33.810 --> 01:25:35.240
Is that OK Sean?

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.540
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: Gives me
time to think some thoughts.

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.650
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: You
differ the age here.

01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:41.940
I do believe McComiskey
coming on 40 years.

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:44.950
I met him not long after he
started playing at Dubliner.

01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:51.740
And he is a massive,
massive musical influence

01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:55.110
on me playing the humble
lowly Irish drum.

01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:58.560
But, you need an education
to play anything

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.990
and I had the best teacher alive
and that's Billy McComiskey.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:05.160
And I also feel-- I've
said it anyone who--

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.480
anyone who's ever asked, they go,

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.220
"What's it like playing
with Billy McComiskey?"

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:09.520
I always said.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.820
I'll tell you what it's like.

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:13.580
I'd rather get on the stage with
Billy unrehearsed and unprepared

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.980
than with anyone else
with 10 rehearsals.

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:18.070 position:56%
That's how sure I feel around Billy.

01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:20.670
It just going to be right.

01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:23.580
Not that we don't rehearse, not
that we don't keep our game up,

01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:27.940 position:56%
but I know that if he says something
it's going to lay down just right.

01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:31.630 position:56%
And it's going to be-- it's going to
have integrity, it's going to last,

01:26:31.630 --> 01:26:37.260
it's going to be musically viable
and it might even be some fun.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:40.550
Billy is-- I have two wonderful
sisters, I didn't happen to grow

01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:43.740
up with a brother, but I
consider Billy a brother.

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:46.520
So, that's me and Billy McComiskey.

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.580
I differ to Sean now.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.990
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey:
On the spot now.

01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:54.560
&gt;&gt; Sean McComiskey: Well, I can go
down the road of being meaningful

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.460
and profound, but I think
probably just the simplest thing

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:06.320
that I can say about my father
is thank you for teaching me

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.580
and my brothers and my
cousins all the good things

01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.100
that you taught us about music.

01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:15.630
And the value-- when I
was listening to you talk

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:16.950
about Sean McGlynn it was--

01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:19.330
I was kind of reminded of some of
the things that you do in terms

01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:23.800
of like never taking money for
teaching lessons or, you know,

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.980
it's all about passing it on.

01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:30.180
It's not about, you know,
anything more than that.

01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:32.420
It's about keeping it
going and sharing it

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:35.940
because that's the
most important thing

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:37.400
and being open-minded about it.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.630
So, thank you.

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:40.930
Congratulations.

01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:42.230
&gt;&gt; Billy McComiskey: Thank you.

01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:43.530
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Yeah.

01:27:43.530 --> 01:27:46.580
And congratulations on the newest
award, too, as what Sean said.

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.880
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Well,
thank you all very much.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.880
&gt;&gt; Myron Bretholz: Steve,
thank you for your time.

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.580

of the Library of Congress.
