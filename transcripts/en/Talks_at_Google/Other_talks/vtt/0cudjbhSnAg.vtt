00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Good afternoon and welcome.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.280
It's an honor and a privilege for me today
to introduce one of the world's greatest contemporary

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.920
artists and Seattle native son, Dale Chihuly.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.390
Dale has popularized and revolutionized the
Studio Glass Movement, bringing this new American

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.370
art to international fame.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.910
His work is included in more than 200 major
museum collections, which has to be pretty

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.410
close to setting the record for number of
installations for a living artist as he's

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.170
exhibited in numerous prestigious museums
and galleries all over the world, such as

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.420
the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and
other exhibitions, including Chihuly in the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.850
Light of Jerusalem, which broke a record for
a million visitors.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.560
He's also well-known for his garden installations.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.310
He studied here at University of Washington,
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Rhode

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.500
Island School of Design.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.661
And he's been the recipient of many awards,
including eleven honorary doctorates and two

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.450
fellowships for the National Endowment of
the Arts.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.920
Dale and his team, working in a boathouse
by the water here in Seattle, continue to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.340
push the limits of glassblowing craftsmanship
and glass art.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.999
And I have to say, it was seven years ago
I was lucky enough to get to visit the boathouse

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:17.950
here in Seattle.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.030
And I was there with my mother.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.409
And as we left, I think we drove about five
blocks without saying anything.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.289
And then, my mother stopped and said, "That
is the closest experience anyone will ever

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.520
have to being at Giverny with Monet when he
was painting the water lilies."

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.639
[laughs] She said it was just amazing to be
with an artist of that caliber and quality

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:43.930
and inspiration while he's doing some of the
best work of his career.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.310
And the most amazing part of all of this is
that Dale is opening his own garden here in

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.560
Seattle next month.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.509
And he's gonna give us an overview of that
exhibit.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.490
It's Chihuly Garden and Glass.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.609
And after that, we'll also be joined by his
wife, Leslie Chihuly, and Michelle Bufano

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:01.889
for some questions.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:07.130
And with that, Dale Chihuly.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.179
[applause]

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.200
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Thank you.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.670
Leslie and I are happy to be here and we're
going to give you a little sneak preview of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.879
Chihuly Garden and Glass.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.760
I'm gonna start with a seven-minute video
that will give you a history of my work.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.420
So, if we could queue that up.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.420
[pause]

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.420
[plays video]

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.870
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: I've often been asked what
would I like to do that I haven't done.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.510
And the first thing that comes to mind is
that I'd like to build a conservatory or a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.370
glass house and to design everything that
goes inside it.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.960
[upbeat music with drum and guitar]

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.010
I think ideas come a great deal from being
alone.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.739
And even though I work with a great team of
people all day long, I happen to be an early

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.739
riser.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:13.030
So, I'm often up at four, five in the morning
and have several hours to be on my own and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.209
think about things.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.170
There's just all sorts of possibilities with
glass.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.799
I can't think of too many materials that haven't
been exploited except for glass.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.739
One night I melted some stained glass 'cause
I had this little kiln 'cause I was fusing

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.840
the glass together.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.749
I put in a piece of iron pipe that I probably
bought at the hardware store, and blew a bubble.

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.550
I had never seen glass blowing before.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.400
Like there was a picture on the wall.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.430
I remember the picture clearly of a glassblower
with his cheeks all puffed out, like he was

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.430
blowing a trumpet.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.080
So, from that point on, I wanted to be a glassblower.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.700
[drum beats]

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.810
In 1971, myself and some friends started Pilchuck
Glass School.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.659
Pilchuck Glass School really is what established
Seattle as the preeminent glass center of

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.510
the world--not just Seattle.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.569
This is spread out into much of the Northwest.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.290
And every summer, we went back to Pilchuck,
which was an experimental glass workshop.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.750
It was kind of a school, but more than, I
would say more than anything, it was a place

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.100
where we developed ideas and experimented,
back when we didn't really care about sales

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.410
or anything like that.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.260
So, nothing held us back from doing a lot
of experimentation.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.950
The whole idea of making art, as far as I'm
concerned, it comes from just doing it over

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.960
and over and over.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.100
We just have to be making a lot of mistakes.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.000
And finally, you've just done so many thousands
of pieces that it becomes sort of natural

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.410
but you gotta go through five or ten years
of making mistakes all the time before you

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.410
can develop that.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.410
[hissing]

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.420
Don't worry about the form quite so much.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.660
Worry about the speed and worry about the
ease of the operation.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.170
Once you get all of that going, then everything,
the form comes.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.170
You got it down now.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.170
Let's get it down.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.680
Once we get it down, let's keep it there and
roll it.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680
Nice.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.800
Over and over and over and over.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.160
And then those forms will get better and better
and better.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.970
I've been working with glass now for 40 years.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.530
And, of course, the work started small.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.350
And it got larger and larger.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.180
And then, at a certain point, the pieces were
just big enough.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.700
They became hard to handle if they were any
bigger.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.100
And around that same time, I started architectural
installations.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.730
I have a degree in interior design and architecture.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.710
And so, that was very comfortable working
in the spaces.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:52.580
Even my smaller objects often had--I think
of them as architectural because they'll have

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.970
one part inside another.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.910
It was a very smooth transition to--.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.780
The installation started small.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.400
And then, as we learned how to put things
together, we quit making the parts big and

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.400
we went back to making the parts small.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.750
And so, it's massing all that color together.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.240
When you look at the sun, and there's a thousand
or more parts in it, there's that much yellow

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.620
and the sun is coming through it.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.411
No artificial light is going through it.

00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:28.500
It just, it's just a massive amount of yellow
color and it's in this big, simple form.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.030
It just has a lot of power when you see it
in that way.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:41.500
So, it was a natural thing for me to go from
the smaller works to the larger works.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.270
[jazzy music]

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.770
I couldn't do one-tenth of what I'm doing
if I didn't have a big team.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.530
So, the complexity of the big shows takes
a great deal of people.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.660
And I've been very fortunate to, over the
years, build that team.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.870
Maybe I got a little bit of that organizational
ability from my dad, the butcher that was

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.870
a union organizer.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.870
I don't know what.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.840
But I got very fortunate in being able to
work with great people.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.720
[Spanish music]

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.910
I woke up one morning and said that I wanted
to hang chandeliers over the canals of Venice.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:27.130
And then, from that came the concept of working
in different countries--making chandeliers

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.010
and taking them to Venice.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.510
The first country was Finland.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.830
The second was Ireland.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.140
The third was Mexico.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.290
[Spanish music]

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:42.610
It gave me an opportunity to build the chandeliers
or make installations.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.720
And then, right outside, there were woods
or rivers to work in.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720
[splash]

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.980
And I always worked outside to some degree,
but since 1995, it's become a more important

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.850
part of my work.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.850
[splash]

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:57.850
Three.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.850
Three.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.850
[splash]

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:06.920
You take that idea, make the decision to go
with it and go down that road and see what

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.080
happens.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.080
And sometimes, it doesn't work.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.060
Most of the time, I've been fortunate that
a lot of the projects have worked or ideas

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:26.940
have worked.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:39.810
[Spanish music]

00:08:39.810 --> 00:09:09.650
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey Wright: My family and I have been
admirers of Dale and his work for many years.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:15.440
And his art has been symbolizing to visitors--the
creativity and the inspiration that lives

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.990
and breathes in our city.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.760
Dale has designed something truly beautiful
and inspiring for our community and the world.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.440
And personally, I can't wait to see the finished
product.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.280
[classical music]

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:43.630
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: So, thanks again for coming.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.710
See you here next spring.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.710
[applause]

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.550
[end video]

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.840
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: I guess it's springtime.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.840
We're gonna open in 29 days, I think it is.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.630
May 21st.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:14.680
Right next to the Space Needle is about 100
feet over here and it's gonna be this long

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.410
building that's called the Exhibition Hall.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:27.320
And that will have nine rooms inside the hall.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.660
This is the glass house.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.020
This is the garden.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.060
[pause]

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:40.680
I'll go through a couple of the rooms with
you.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:50.580
This is an installation I did in 1971 for
a museum in Switzerland.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:57.890
And it's one of the first large-scale exhibition
that's about 30 feet across.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:06.290
And I've always loved this piece, so I decided
to do it over for the project.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:14.400
The next slide is the Northwest Indian room,
which is a take-off from a room that I have

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.870
in my studio in the boathouse in Seattle,
showing Pendleton Blankets, Northwest Coast

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:31.110
Indian baskets, Edward Curtis prints on the
wall that you can't see, and some of my glass

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:36.200
work that's influenced by the Indian baskets.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.070
[pause]

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:46.210
The Glasshouse, by the way, we started this
project last August.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.160
So, it's just gonna be--.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.320
It'll take nine months from start to finish
on the project.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.740
And the Glasshouse is just about finished.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.280
You can see part of the piece that's gonna
be inside there.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:09.630
It's the piece will be a hundred feet long
and 25 feet high inside the Glasshouse.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.930
And then, you come out of the Glasshouse.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.089
We went by the Temple of the Sun.

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:19.120
Over here is an installation of blue pieces.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.120
[pause]

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:29.160
Now, we're gonna go to the Collection Café
where there's 28 different collections shown

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.500
in the Café.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:36.740
There'll be 23 tables, each table having a
sheet of glass on top.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.640
And you look down through it into a collection.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.640
[pause]

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:51.500
Now, I'm gonna bring up my lovely wife, Leslie,
to talk to you about the partnering we're

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.480
doing with other institutions around the project.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.670
[applause]

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.420
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: Got reverb?

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:07.170
It is all OK?

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:12.630
I hear a little something there.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.470
It'll settle down.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.070
I just wanna thank Google for inviting us
here today.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:25.360
And I wanna thank you for the extraordinary
work that you're doing in featuring and championing

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.120
artists and creative thinkers by having talks
like this.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.600
I know Dale did one before and we're just
very honored to be invited back.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.820
So, thank you all for having us on the campus
today.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.220
I'm Leslie Chihuly.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.649
I'm president of Chihuly Studio and Portland
Press.

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:46.840
I'm also the Board Chair of the Seattle Symphony
Orchestra.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:52.120
And like many of you, Dale and I are very
proud of the city we live in.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.130
We wanna make a difference and we think that
this is really one of the great cities on

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.150
the planet.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:02.089
It's a very special place in that it's big
enough to have a rich and diverse cultural

00:14:02.089 --> 00:14:05.830
scene, and small enough where people feel
they can make a difference.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.900
We're starters and builders.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:13.170
Many of us in Seattle are newcomers drawn
by spectacular nature and beauty and kept

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:18.660
here by work, careers, families, and the opportunity
to participate in meaningful ways in the life

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.660
of the city.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:25.860
With vision, talent, capital combined with
philanthropy and volunteerism, we have created

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:31.350
a community that attracts some of the best
and the brightest in the arts and technology,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.250
medicine, business, and entrepreneurism.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:39.290
We're celebrating the 50th Anniversary of
the World's Fair, where the builders and thinkers

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:44.830
of that time pointed to a bright future, full
of possibility, innovation, exploration, and

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:45.830
achievement.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:52.920
In the last 50 years, Seattle has built the
cultural organizations we enjoy today.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:59.210
Imagine Seattle and Tacoma without McCaw Hall,
Benaroya Hall, the restored Paramount, the

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:04.920
expanded Seattle Art Museum and the sculpture
park, the Tacoma Art Museum, Museum of Glass,

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:11.500
the Northwest African American Museum, the
Intiman, the Rep, the ACT--so many other museums,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:18.149
galleries, and diverse organizations of all
sizes doing film, dance, music, and theater.

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:21.800
But another important anniversary is happening
right now, which you may not know of, which

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.580
is called the 50th Anniversary of the Studio
Glass Movement in this country.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.680
A two thousand year old technology was about
to be turned upside-down and inside-out by

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.720
a small group of artists who began to experiment
with the natural qualities of hot glass.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.980
They began to push the material beyond anything
that had ever been seen or done historically.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:46.930
Testing and failing, being willing to try
over and over again to achieve new scale,

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.990
to use old techniques in new ways, gave birth
to a new movement and a new period in art

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.110
history.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.209
We also celebrated the 40th Anniversary of
Pilchuck Glass School this past year.

00:15:57.209 --> 00:15:59.089
It was co-founded by Dale.

00:15:59.089 --> 00:16:03.529
And the school was built out of the dreams
of a few artists combined with the generosity

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:08.709
of philanthropists Annie and John Hauberg,
who decided to contribute lands and funds

00:16:08.709 --> 00:16:13.060
to some young people who had ideas, energy,
and passion to create.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.790
We're so proud that that school is going to
be one of the founding partners of Chihuly

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.850
Garden and Glass.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:24.290
What you will see when you visit Chihuly Garden
and Glass is the work of a lifetime by a Northwest

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.290
artist.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:31.550
It encompasses the education, the mentoring,
the influences, inspiration, travels and experience

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.830
of a lifetime spent looking at the world through
an artist's sensibility.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.500
When the Wright family, owners of the Space
Needle, invited Dale as an artist to look

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.910
at the old Fun Forest site, they invited me
and our organization, Chihuly Studio, to participate

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.259
in the process.

00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:50.500
We needed to make a case to the community
about how private use of public land would

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.750
be a benefit to the community as a whole.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:59.040
Person by person, group by group, at City
Hall, in private and public gathering places,

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.150
we began to speak to the importance of this
project for kids, for fellow artists, for

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:09.499
tourists, for families, for the city, and
for the Seattle Center as a place where everyone

00:17:09.499 --> 00:17:13.289
could come and see what is possible when you
have a commitment to making the world a more

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:16.049
beautiful and aesthetic place.

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:21.509
It says something about our city that we can
recognize how one person's success as an artist

00:17:21.509 --> 00:17:26.149
means that others can have that same opportunity
to imagine new worlds and to see them take

00:17:26.149 --> 00:17:28.199
shape in a lifetime.

00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:31.570
We need to continuously support our arts.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:37.929
We hope this project will provide more visibility
and success, not only to our founding non-profit

00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:43.200
partners, which include Pratt Fine Arts Center,
Pilchuck Glass School, ArtsFund an the Seattle

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.739
Public Schools, but to all of the arts organizations
in the community who exist to serve the educational,

00:17:48.739 --> 00:17:51.710
civic, and cultural needs of our city.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.990
We hope that it is a window into the very
creative life of our city and that it is a

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:01.210
gathering place where more discussion and
more advocacy for what we value can happen.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:05.239
Most of our arts organizations don't have
the endowments of older institutions around

00:18:05.239 --> 00:18:06.239
the rest of the country.

00:18:06.239 --> 00:18:10.850
So, our next push will be to endow the cultural
institutions we value so that we can sustain

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.059
them for the next generations.

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:17.320
Dale and I believe that exposure to the arts
should be a part of everyone's educational

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.419
experience, which is why we're excited about
Chihuly Garden and Glass and partnership that

00:18:21.419 --> 00:18:23.660
it will have with the Seattle Public Schools.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:28.769
A science curriculum is being developed for
all eighth graders in the Seattle area.

00:18:28.769 --> 00:18:34.100
We believe that the understanding of creativity
within one's self and seeing it in others

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.869
helps to build community and translates into
more fulfilling and productive lives.

00:18:38.869 --> 00:18:42.690
So, we need to continue to make the case for
arts in our community.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.169
We don't take it for granted.

00:18:44.169 --> 00:18:47.860
And we remember that is it our arts that give
the city its pulse.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.700
With the help and thinking of the many creative,
innovative, and entrepreneurial members of

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:57.249
our community, many of whom are in this room
today and in the virtual room we're experiencing,

00:18:57.249 --> 00:19:00.739
I imagine that we can be the leaders for the
rest of the world in terms of how to use our

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:05.809
existing public and private resources wisely
and to leverage those resources to a sustainable

00:19:05.809 --> 00:19:06.860
future.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.809
We hope Chihuly Garden and Glass will be a
source of joy and inspiration for everyone

00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:15.149
in our city and that people who come to visit
from other cities and other countries around

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:19.960
the world will see that Seattle is a place
that supports its artists, its businesses,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.580
and can dream big dreams and make them happen.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:27.309
We invite everyone to go out and participate
in all kinds of arts experiences in the community--music,

00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:30.429
screenings of theater, film, dance, and poetry.

00:19:30.429 --> 00:19:35.039
And we see that the beauty of creativity is
that it enjoys many languages.

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:38.330
And the more people are exposed, the more
they can make connections and lead creative

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.279
lives in all fields of endeavor.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.019
So, thank you so much for having us.

00:19:42.019 --> 00:19:46.490
I wanna also introduce you today to Michelle
Bufano, who's the executive director of Chihuly

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.490
Garden and Glass.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:20:08.780
And she'll join us for the Q and A.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.780
[pause]

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.780
[applause]

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.780
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I wanna thank all of you
for taking time out of your busy schedule.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.780
And I know just how busy it must be with just
23 to 29 days left here in the home stretch.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.590
But to kick off, I wanted to talk a little
bit about the new project, Chihuly Garden

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.610
and Glass.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:23.950
And it came up a bit in the video, but I'd
love to hear more about the inspiration behind

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.039
it, and also some of the challenges in Michelle's
day-to-day world.

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:33.519
So, Dale, maybe you can tell us a little bit
more about what inspired you around the project.

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:40.639
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Well, what inspired me was
to put together what I thought of was the

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:43.049
most important projects in my career.

00:20:43.049 --> 00:20:53.760
So, it starts with 1971 and goes forward and
has one room of chandeliers from Venice.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.710
And I just tried to make it as beautiful as
I could.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.669
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And Michelle, you, as
the Executive Director of Chihuly Garden and

00:20:59.669 --> 00:21:04.440
Glass, have been with this project every step
of the way.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:10.830
So, tell us a little bit about your day-to-day
role and some of what you really look forward

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.019
to once the museum opens.

00:21:12.019 --> 00:21:15.370
&gt;&gt;Michelle Bufano: Well, the main part of
what I've been doing is really focusing on

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.179
how each visitor will experience the exhibition.

00:21:18.179 --> 00:21:24.529
So, from the second they get on our website,
which is up and running, to buying their tickets,

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:28.659
coming in the door, and how they experience
and interact with the art in all the different

00:21:28.659 --> 00:21:30.659
levels--parts of the exhibitions.

00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:37.299
So, it's been really exciting to watch the
art being installed and watch how it changes

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:41.090
every day and being able to react to that.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.789
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And I think one of the
really interesting things about the exhibition

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:52.100
is that it brings together all these different
pieces of your career as well as an urban

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.330
landscape, as well as sustainable planning.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.889
And I know that one of the things that's really
important to you is how your work is juxtaposed

00:21:58.889 --> 00:22:00.600
against nature.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.559
Has it been different working in an urban
space?

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:06.029
I mean, there's obviously some elements of
nature there, but I'm wondering what some

00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:08.650
of the interesting challenges and opportunities
have been.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.909
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: It's been very different.

00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:16.620
To start with, it was pavement six months
ago.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:27.989
And Richard, our landscape designer, tried
to work with me with the installations that

00:22:27.989 --> 00:22:33.429
would be there and then the landscaping that
would go with it, but it's, I'm not used to

00:22:33.429 --> 00:22:35.960
working with landscape architects.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.669
So, it was a challenge.

00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:46.059
As you can see today, it's, some of the areas
look pretty good, but it's not gonna look

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:48.539
as good as it could for another year or so.

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:51.890
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I think that's one of
the great things about gardens, is that over

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.330
time, they grow and they change.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.330
And so-- [laughs]

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.330
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: Yeah.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.100
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I was lucky enough to
visit the site this morning and get to see

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.100
its progress.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.299
And it's already just spectacularly beautiful.

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:05.510
So, it would be really exciting to see how
it comes out.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.869
One of the other interesting pieces that's
different than other exhibits you've done

00:23:08.869 --> 00:23:11.070
is the length of this exhibit.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.090
You have the space for 30 years.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:19.559
And I'm wondering if that's changed at all
your thoughts on how to lay it out and how

00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:24.830
to design the exhibit because, rather than
just being there for one season, it's there

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.830
for a lot longer.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.830
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Yeah.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.559
It really changed everything.

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:36.200
We're used to having a show up for a month
or maybe three or four months.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:43.460
But when it's gonna be up for 30 years, you
really have to make sure that it works.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:50.000
And so, we made a lot of the glass specially
for that.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.740
Like the piece that's up on the screen now,
we've done other works that have, made out

00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:02.429
of these what I call Persian parts, but all
of these are like, twice as thick as they

00:24:02.429 --> 00:24:07.850
would normally be just to make sure that there's
no way that anything could crack.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.580
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And it's right there.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.030
You can see it in the picture in the back
of this image if you can see the screen.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:19.669
It's right there at the Space Needle, which
is celebrating its 50th Anniversary this year.

00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:23.100
Were there parts of the exhibit that were
inspired by the Space Needle itself?

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.100
[pause]

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.100
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Probably.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.100
[laughs] Yeah.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.090
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I noticed there were a
lot of towers.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.640
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: I love that.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.640
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:36.220
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: You know, there are these
iconic towers in restaurants all over the

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.799
world.

00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:43.940
And except for maybe the Eiffel Tower, this
is the tower that's most known.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:48.220
I'm not quite sure why, but it, everybody
loves the Space Needle.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.360
There was a time, 30 years ago, when people
wanted to take it down.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.250
It was never meant to be up.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.870
It was only supposed to be for the World's
Fair.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.860
It cost three million dollars to build in
1962.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.639
And last year, it cost four million dollars
to paint it.

00:25:06.639 --> 00:25:07.639
[pause]

00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:08.639
[laughter]

00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:11.629
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I think that happens a
lot with the World's Fair exhibits, the same

00:25:11.629 --> 00:25:13.149
is true for the Eiffel Tower.

00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:16.101
The Golden Gate Bridge, which I think was
also built for one of the World's Fairs, but

00:25:16.101 --> 00:25:19.049
obviously, that was meant to be more permanent.

00:25:19.049 --> 00:25:23.399
But tell us a little bit about your connection
to Seattle.

00:25:23.399 --> 00:25:25.309
It's, you're almost synonymous with it.

00:25:25.309 --> 00:25:27.529
I think each of you has your own special connection.

00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:32.940
And I'd like to hear a little bit about, I
think this exhibit is really a celebration

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.220
of Seattle, itself.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.200
And so, maybe you can talk a little bit about
your relationship with the city.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.200
[pause]

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.600
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Well, I went to college in
Tacoma for the first year.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.769
I didn't wanna go to school.

00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:47.529
I was not a very good student.

00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:51.859
My mother talked me into going to school.

00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:57.619
And that winter, I decorated her basement
and thought I could be a great interior designer.

00:25:57.619 --> 00:26:04.720
So, I transferred to the University of Washington
in Seattle.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.749
And I got a degree in Interior Design and
Architecture.

00:26:09.749 --> 00:26:19.580
And it was during that time that I was beginning
to work with glass and weaving and tapestries.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.999
And one night, I melted some glass and blew
a bubble.

00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:27.880
And from that point on, I wanted to be a glassblower.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:34.989
And I went to Alaska and became a commercial
fisherman to save money to go to graduate

00:26:34.989 --> 00:26:38.970
school at the University of Wisconsin.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:42.299
And I went to Venice, Italy after that.

00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:48.019
And I then went to the Rhode Island School
of Design to start a glass department there,

00:26:48.019 --> 00:26:50.999
but at the same time, we started the Pilchuck
Glass School.

00:26:50.999 --> 00:26:56.899
So, every summer, I would come back to Seattle
to Pilchuck and every winter, I would stay

00:26:56.899 --> 00:26:58.039
in Rhode Island.

00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:00.409
And I did that for ten years.

00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:08.679
And when my sales of my glass matched my income
as a professor, which was 18 thousand dollars

00:27:08.679 --> 00:27:17.289
a year in 1980, I quit teaching and came back
to Seattle and have been here ever since.

00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:20.950
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And Leslie, I know you've
been working with numerous partners, some

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.970
of whom are, most of them are based here in
Seattle.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.580
Maybe you can talk a little bit about your
connection to the city.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.580
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: Sure.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.830
Well, I moved here in '85 and went to graduate
school at U Dub in Russian Studies.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.590
And at that time, you couldn't find a restaurant
that was open past nine.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.590
We didn't have--.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.840
I mentioned a lot of the halls and the things
that have happened really that have been built

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.840
since I moved here.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.679
And I think what I saw was a city with a future,
the fact I didn't even think it really was

00:27:44.679 --> 00:27:45.679
a city.

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:46.679
I thought it was a town.

00:27:46.679 --> 00:27:48.909
And I think it's become a city in this period
of time.

00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:54.320
And so, it's a really exuberant and hopeful
place in terms of being able to build and

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.490
do new things.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.690
We're not burdened with a lot of the traditions
and history of older cities.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.889
And so, it's a city where everything is possible.

00:28:02.889 --> 00:28:08.609
What's exciting to me about this project in
the context of Seattle is not only the aesthetics

00:28:08.609 --> 00:28:13.389
and the fact that we're celebrating a local
artist, as it were, but that we're going to

00:28:13.389 --> 00:28:17.659
be a convening place for all of the arts and
for certainly the community partners.

00:28:17.659 --> 00:28:19.429
And we hope that list will grow over time.

00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:22.919
And I'm working with Michelle and many of
us are working hard to think about how the

00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:27.590
space will be used over time to really bring
more attention to the incredible arts that

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.809
we enjoy in the city.

00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:32.690
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And Michelle, you're now
the Executive Director of this exhibit that

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:37.739
really celebrates the city itself, some of
its wonderful landmarks, like the Space Needle.

00:28:37.739 --> 00:28:41.299
Tell us a little bit about your experience
here in Seattle.

00:28:41.299 --> 00:28:47.070
&gt;&gt;Michelle Bufano: Well, just to build on
what Leslie said about building our partnerships

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:52.309
with this city, and we're also building partnerships
on the campus--on the Seattle Center campus.

00:28:52.309 --> 00:28:55.059
And it's really exciting right now because
of the 50th.

00:28:55.059 --> 00:28:57.090
There's so much going on.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:00.080
King Tut is opening in a month as well.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.390
We have the symphony, the ballet.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.460
But it's really becoming a focal point, the
whole campus.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:11.039
And this project is spearheading a program
called "Center Nights," where people will,

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:17.240
everyone who's on campus will develop programming
and we'll open up our doors to great programming,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.640
at least once a quarter for people to come.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:25.840
So, I see it as really an opportunity to build
excitement and to bring people to one center

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.090
place for the arts.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.610
So, that's been an exciting part of it.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:36.359
Personally, I've been involved with Dale's
work since I worked at the Tacoma Art Museum

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:38.710
and then opened the Museum of Glass.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:44.549
So, I've been a big fan of glass and most
recently came for Pratt Fine Arts Center,

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:48.009
which is one of the community partners for
this project.

00:29:48.009 --> 00:29:52.750
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: One of the interesting
things of the museum is there's a café.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.580
And it's called Collections Café.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:00.220
And I think that one of the things that really
surprised me when I got to visit the boathouse

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:07.389
was all the different collections that you
have, Dale--everything from shaving brushes

00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:13.779
to accordions to Navajo blankets to something
I didn't even realize existed, but there were

00:30:13.779 --> 00:30:18.210
string dispensers, which looked like little
faces on the wall with pieces of string coming

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:22.570
out of their mouths because before there were
tape dispensers, there were string dispensers.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:27.279
And I know that collecting and just collecting
lots of different objects and looking at all

00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:30.519
the differences is a big part of your process
as an artist.

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:33.539
So, tell us what some of the collections that
you're more proud of.

00:30:33.539 --> 00:30:36.879
Maybe you want to give us a little bit of
background of the café and what people can

00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:38.049
see there.

00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:44.000
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Well, I mean, I started when
I was a kid.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:53.659
But I think a lot of kids collect things--marbles
or toy soldiers or beach glass.

00:30:53.659 --> 00:30:55.460
But I just kept collecting.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.409
Usually, you stop at a certain age.

00:30:58.409 --> 00:31:00.889
And I've always collected.

00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:12.159
Like, I have 500 accordions and 800 Pendleton
blankets, 400 Northwest Coast Indian baskets.

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:18.429
And I was down at the Pacific Galleries this
weekend looking around.

00:31:18.429 --> 00:31:27.239
I ended up buying four original posters of
the World's Fair from 1962.

00:31:27.239 --> 00:31:31.799
And Leslie asks me sometimes, "What makes
you collect?"

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:32.799
I don't know.

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:35.989
I can't explain what it is exactly that makes
me--.

00:31:35.989 --> 00:31:38.119
Some people like to collect.

00:31:38.119 --> 00:31:40.989
Other people, it's a bother.

00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:48.859
And the Collection Café was, we were gonna
have a café in the project no matter what.

00:31:48.859 --> 00:31:53.950
And it was just the perfect opportunity to
get rid of some of those collections.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:54.950
[laughter]

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:59.440
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, I was there this morning
and you'll be able to see 28 of Dale's collections

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.019
up close, including, actually, inside the
tables.

00:32:02.019 --> 00:32:07.399
So, each table will have its own collection
of some of the things that Dale has collected

00:32:07.399 --> 00:32:11.700
over the years, everything from miniature
dogs to bottle openers.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.469
There's antique radios.

00:32:13.469 --> 00:32:19.590
There's a lot of really interesting artifacts
that come with the café part of the museum.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:21.480
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: And that's been a lot of fun.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.840
We did a little--.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.859
I'll tell you what.

00:32:24.859 --> 00:32:26.610
We'll give everybody a little booklet.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:33.929
But you don't get them today, but I did a
little catalog from about the café, showing

00:32:33.929 --> 00:32:35.970
each collection.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:42.669
And I printed 20 thousand of them to be given
away at the café.

00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:43.669
And Leslie, no.

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:44.669
Yeah.

00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:45.669
Leslie just told me today--

00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:46.669
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: They're in.

00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:47.669
They're in.

00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:48.669
Big boxes full.

00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:49.669
All right.

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:50.669
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: they came in.

00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:51.669
It costs 51 cents each to print.

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:52.669
[Female Presenter laughs]

00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:54.749
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And I've heard they've
been a hot commodity.

00:32:54.749 --> 00:32:57.999
There's been two proof books today that people
keep wanting to take with them.

00:32:57.999 --> 00:33:03.279
So, it'll be interesting to see them, the
final product.

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:05.190
Your work really happens in series.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:09.429
And you have some series for which you're
very well-known--the Macchia, the Venetians,

00:33:09.429 --> 00:33:11.249
the Sea Forms.

00:33:11.249 --> 00:33:18.110
Do you have one series that you really love
revisiting, or one that you like the best?

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.110
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Oh.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.899
I've been asked that question before and I
don't really have a good answer.

00:33:22.899 --> 00:33:25.190
It changes, you know?

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:30.529
Right now, I've been thinking about a series
that I started a few years ago called "The

00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:32.649
Jerusalem Cylinders."

00:33:32.649 --> 00:33:38.840
And in the next couple of weeks, we're gonna
start working on those again.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.460
So, I'm thinking about Jerusalem Cylinders.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.759
Right now, they're a favorite.

00:33:44.759 --> 00:33:48.010
But sometimes, it's the baskets.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:50.100
Sometimes, it's the Sea Forms.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:55.239
It really does change because they were all--.

00:33:55.239 --> 00:33:59.469
I thought about all of them before I ever
developed them into a series.

00:33:59.469 --> 00:34:01.039
I didn't just say, "OK.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:06.649
I'm gonna make baskets and then make, work
for two years on baskets."

00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:13.099
I waited until I really felt that I had something
concrete before I pursued it.

00:34:13.099 --> 00:34:15.409
So, it's hard to say.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:18.520
I wish I could answer that better for you.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.460
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And in the exhibit hall,
there's eight rooms.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.579
And each of them map to one of the series.

00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:25.829
And they have different themes.

00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:33.510
One of the interesting pieces about the exhibit
is that it's in one of Seattle's highest traffic

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.510
areas.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:35.510
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Thank you.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:36.510
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Like, lots of people go
to the Space Needle.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:43.119
You've been really putting the Garden and
Glass together with the public watching.

00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:47.659
Have there been particular pieces in exhibits
that have been really hard to install?

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:49.619
Are there any good stories of assembly so
far?

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:51.740
&gt;&gt;Michelle Bufano: I don't know if we're allowed
to say those stories.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.740
[laughter]

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.740
No.

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:54.740
I think you're--

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:55.740
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: I'll tell you.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.740
&gt;&gt;Michelle Bufano: looking at--

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:57.740
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.740
&gt;&gt;Michelle Bufano: one of the most challenging
right there.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.920
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: That armature for the Glass
House was probably one of the most high-level

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.200
engineering feats of all time.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.760
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: That makes me think of that
story I told you this at lunchtime about difficult

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:13.510
situations, in that we blew glass in a little
village in France--Vion.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.539
And we made, I had the whole team over there.

00:35:15.539 --> 00:35:21.190
We had about 30 people working hand in hand
with the French glassblowers.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:29.390
And we made enough glass to fill two containers,
which we sent back to Seattle.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.490
Only one of the containers arrived.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:35.480
The other went over the side of the ship.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.630
And comes to find out that if you wanna ship
a container, if you want your container to

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:44.089
be below deck, you have to pay an extra tariff.

00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:45.089
[laughter]

00:35:45.089 --> 00:35:50.549
And somewhere, that container has got a lot
of bubble wrap in it.

00:35:50.549 --> 00:35:53.250
So, I'll bet it's close to the surface somewhere.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.250
[laughter]

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.000
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We talked that those containers
often float.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.190
So, that's the hazard of doing work abroad.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:04.950
But that said, I do think your time at University
of Wisconsin and Venice, more specifically

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.490
abroad, had really influenced your work.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:13.329
Can you give us a little bit of insight into
how each of those locations has shaped your

00:36:13.329 --> 00:36:14.849
work and your vision today?

00:36:14.849 --> 00:36:17.510
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Well, let's see.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:23.880
At the University of Wisconsin, I was coming
with a degree in Interior Design and Architecture.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:30.180
I really hadn't made any art to say.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:36.470
And so when I got there, I was gonna be in
a graduate fine arts program.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:43.270
And I was really lucky to meet a couple of
guys that were far more talented than I was.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.010
And I ended up, one of them was a roommate.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:52.049
And during that year, I really learned a great
deal about art, not from my faculty, but from

00:36:52.049 --> 00:36:54.450
these guys I was living with.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:58.410
And that set me off in the right direction.

00:36:58.410 --> 00:36:59.410
And when I went to the--.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:00.410
What did you ask?

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.410
The Rhode Island School of Design?

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.559
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That or Venice.

00:37:03.559 --> 00:37:05.880
Either one or both.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.970
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Both.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.049
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:37:10.049 --> 00:37:13.529
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Well, either one.

00:37:13.529 --> 00:37:14.529
I'll take Venice.

00:37:14.529 --> 00:37:15.529
[laughter] Venice, I arrived in Venice.

00:37:15.529 --> 00:37:22.170
I had a Fulbright, which pays, I think it
paid 450 dollars a month at that time.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:28.069
And I arrived in Venice feeling a little depressed
from graduating.

00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:34.819
And I finally made my way out to the Venini
Glass Works, one of the most famous glass

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:35.829
works.

00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:43.550
And I had a letter from them saying that I
could observe there for three weeks.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:50.170
And I met the owner and he had just gotten
a possibility of doing a commission--a large

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:55.339
commission--in a town square of Ferrara.

00:37:55.339 --> 00:38:01.270
And they didn't have any experience or anybody
there that could really design something like

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.270
that.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.540
And I talked him into letting me design it.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.980
And I used glass.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.150
I used plastic.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.880
I used neon.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.220
And so, I got set up.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:19.069
I was given my own studio up on top of the
factory.

00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:24.650
And there, I mean, I could have blown glass
there if I wanted to, but they were so much

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:25.740
better than I was.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.710
It was too embarrassing.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.640
But I got to watch all the time.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.539
And that's really one of the best ways to
learn about glassblowing and a lot of other

00:38:35.539 --> 00:38:38.920
skills, crafts, is by watching.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:44.600
And I learned, 'cause back in the States,
everybody had been working by themselves.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.980
And glassblowing doesn't work very well by
yourself.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.529
It really takes a team of two or three.

00:38:50.529 --> 00:38:55.609
We work with a minimum of about eight people
on the team at any one time.

00:38:55.609 --> 00:39:01.049
And up as many as 15 people on a team, working
on the same piece of glass.

00:39:01.049 --> 00:39:05.619
So, what I learned more than anything, what
I learned from Venice was teamwork.

00:39:05.619 --> 00:39:10.050
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And in addition, you're
best known for glassblowing, but you also

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:11.150
paint and draw.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.779
And one of my favorite things about Dale,
I don't know if you guys can see his shoes,

00:39:13.779 --> 00:39:16.760
but he always has paint-smattered shoes.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:22.510
[laughs] So, tell us a little bit about how
drawing and painting influences your inspirations

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.510
as an artist.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.829
And how is that part of your process?

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:29.010
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Well, I never really drew
that much.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:37.089
I mean, even though in undergraduate, I had
to make drawings of interiors and architecture.

00:39:37.089 --> 00:39:44.380
After that, I never drew that much, but I
lost the sight of my eye in 1976, which meant

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.829
I had no peripheral vision and no depth perception.

00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:54.289
And that made it difficult to work out there
with a team because for obvious reasons.

00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:59.750
And so, from that point on, I started having
one of the really great glassblowers on the

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:03.880
team, a young man named William Morris.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:11.910
I had Billy head up the team and I would make
drawings to show him what I wanted to make.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:16.250
And so, that was back in the late '70s.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.730
And I've been drawing and painting ever since.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:24.789
A lot of times it won't be necessarily about
what I'm gonna make.

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:27.839
It'll just be, I just like to paint.

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:34.099
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I think one of the things
that had really, in addition to the scale

00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:38.829
of your work, that really sets your work apart
is the thinness of the glass--how thin you're

00:40:38.829 --> 00:40:41.609
able to blow it as well as the vibrancy of
the color.

00:40:41.609 --> 00:40:45.970
And I imagine that some of those things are
advances that you've developed with your team.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:49.670
Are there other technological advances that
have come along in the past 40 years that

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.070
have really changed glassblowing?

00:40:52.070 --> 00:41:03.339
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Probably the thin glass, working
that way, was definitely innovative, but that

00:41:03.339 --> 00:41:04.960
allowed us to--.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.020
When it was thin like that, we could heat
it up in the furnace and it would begin to

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.119
collapse, or go asymmetrical.

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:15.769
Glass, if you let it go on its own, it wants
to be symmetrical.

00:41:15.769 --> 00:41:24.900
So, if you're gonna make it like these pieces
here, are perfectly round and without having

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.559
that scalloped edge, until the last reheat.

00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:32.190
Then, it's heated up and it's spun open.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.420
They're about two feet in diameter--a little
more.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.609
It's spun open and then it's spun harder.

00:41:39.609 --> 00:41:46.660
And the tips, because it had been blown in
what we call an optical mold, which is a ribbed

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:51.980
mold, we blew it in there at a certain point,
which made the glass go thick and thin all

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.250
the way around.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.460
And the thick parts remain hotter.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.690
And so, they come out and you get that scalloped
effect.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:13.290
And so, I suppose what I'm best known for
is asymmetrical glass using heat, fire, centrifugal

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:16.420
force, gravity.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.029
Those are the tools.

00:42:19.029 --> 00:42:20.700
We use very few hand tools.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.750
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And I think with that
question, what your answer is really about

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.230
is about innovation.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.971
And so, one of the questions I'd like to ask
all three of you is, are there things that

00:42:30.971 --> 00:42:35.470
you've learned along the way through the partnerships,
through developing the exhibit, and also through

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:40.130
your work, through the many schools--Pilchuck,
Rhode Island School of Design--are there lessons

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.819
that you think could apply to tech and to
other industries, things you've learned along

00:42:43.819 --> 00:42:47.880
the way that you think are true about pushing
a science or a medium forward?

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.510
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Well, probably teamwork.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.510
[laughter]

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:57.620
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: I'm just thinking about
the new model that this Chihuly Garden and

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:02.110
Glass represents because it's really privately
owned and operated by the Wright family.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:05.170
And it's called Wright Art, LLC.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:09.740
And so, this is the first time that something
like this has been done in the city and yet,

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.680
we're partnering with non-profit groups.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.680
We're not a non-profit.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.990
We're not building a non-profit board.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.990
We're not fund-raising.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:21.849
So, the fact that it's been in private investment
by a leading family in the community is new.

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:26.950
And the fact that it's being done, in some
ways, to feel like a museum, to feel like

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:30.970
a non-profit, and the kinds of programs and
commitment that we have to community.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:36.329
So, I think it's really a very innovative
approach to the organization.

00:43:36.329 --> 00:43:38.299
&gt;&gt;Michelle Bufano: That's great.

00:43:38.299 --> 00:43:47.279
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: You know, the most important
of all is being creative, which is, would

00:43:47.279 --> 00:43:53.039
be obviously critical to what you guys do.

00:43:53.039 --> 00:43:56.260
And obviously critical to what I do.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:04.109
And just being as innovative as you possibly
can.

00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:05.720
Get up early and have a lot of ideas.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.720
[laughter]

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:11.030
&gt;&gt;Michelle Bufano: So, as I've been reading,
though, about Dale's work, and preparing,

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.450
one thing is the way that you--you brought
it up earlier, Marissa--about he continues,

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:20.240
you continue to go back to a series and push
it a little bit further.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.410
And the end result of that ends up being something
completely different maybe than you started

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.640
with ten years ago or 20 years ago.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:34.160
And I think that is one thing that we could
all learn in our different disciplines that

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.160
we work in.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:41.210
And it's that pushing it, but also coming
back to it, revisiting the idea again in a

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:42.210
different light.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:49.780
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: I wonder if, I touched on
this a minute ago, but if I'm starting off

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:56.950
a new series, let's just say it happens to
be these Persians.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:03.000
And I'll work and I'll experiment and we'll
make them over and over, try different things.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.029
Then, at a certain point, I have a month or
two worth of work.

00:45:10.029 --> 00:45:17.150
And all through that process, I'm trying to
decide whether or not this work should become

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:23.920
a series for me, whether or not it's worth
investing the time and energy.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:31.610
On the other hand, if I keep investing time
and energy into something that's gonna be

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.030
a loser, that's a big mistake.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:41.400
And I have to decide at what point I cut it
loose, or at what point I decide that I'm

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.960
gonna exhibit it.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:47.579
Once I exhibit it, it gets locked in.

00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:52.440
And I would imagine that the same thing applies
to what you do to a certain degree.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.819
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: There's a lot of prototyping
and iteration in what we do.

00:45:56.819 --> 00:46:00.030
And then also figuring out when are we going
to take something and really scale it.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:01.030
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Yeah.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.150
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's the equivalent of
it, probably the technological equivalent

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:07.590
of having a series and when are we going to
just let an experiment go.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.950
So, I'm gonna ask one more question, and then
we'll go to the audience for a few audience

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:14.160
questions, if you guys have some.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.769
And my question is about, I think that this
piece that we're seeing here on the screen,

00:46:17.769 --> 00:46:22.529
which is the Glass House and the new Garden
and Glass House, is really innovative and

00:46:22.529 --> 00:46:24.090
it really is pushing the bounds.

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:25.090
And it is the centerpiece.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:31.440
It's a hundred feet long, 40 feet tall, 14
hundred pieces of glass.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.760
What was the inspiration here?

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.480
You said you always wanted to do it, but what
was it inspired by?

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:43.960
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Well, I always wanted to do
a glass house, which makes me think of a chapel

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.799
or a cathedral.

00:46:46.799 --> 00:46:54.350
And I just designed the Glass House along
with what was gonna be inside.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:47:02.460
And again, it was primarily to make something
that people hadn't seen before with the most

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:10.069
gorgeous color that I could do with the right
amount of work in the Glass House so that

00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:13.890
it didn't get overpowered because I love the
structure as well.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.690
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: One of our own--.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:18.859
Well, you could talk about this, the armature
itself.

00:47:18.859 --> 00:47:22.279
The structure of that was built in our studio.

00:47:22.279 --> 00:47:27.950
And I think over all of the years of the projects
that Dale's worked on, that particular aspect

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:31.849
has gotten more and more sophisticated--the
engineering that goes into having something

00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:37.150
that's a hundred feet long overhead, suspended
from glass is something that's really not

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:38.150
been done.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.540
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I think one of the things
that Googlers can really relate to is, in

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.193
your work, there's a ton of engineering.

00:47:44.193 --> 00:47:45.193
There's a lot of math.

00:47:45.193 --> 00:47:46.193
There's a lot of geometry.

00:47:46.193 --> 00:47:47.880
There's a lot of thinking through what will
work.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:51.529
And so with that, I'd like to invite some
of the Googlers to ask questions.

00:47:51.529 --> 00:47:53.990
Do we have any questions from the audience?

00:47:53.990 --> 00:48:00.930
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: One thing is that--you're
probably familiar with this--but if the chandelier

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:09.670
weighs, say, a thousand pounds--this one probably
weighs 25 thousand pounds--but if it weighed

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:15.240
a thousand pounds, we're gonna put it in Google
someplace.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.269
The engineers wanna rate it to hold five thousand
pounds.

00:48:19.269 --> 00:48:27.349
So, it's a five to one ratio, which is, which
can be a problem 'cause somebody wants a chandelier

00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:33.140
in their house and it just won't support the,
what's required from engineering.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.740
It would support it, but not the way the engineers
wanna support it.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:42.529
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Well, I remember in some
of your Persian ceilings, I remember reading--I

00:48:42.529 --> 00:48:44.480
was surprised by that the glass actually has
flex.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:49.480
So, over these long expanses of glass that
other pieces of glass sit on, you actually,

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.750
you need a five foot piece.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:55.900
You actually need five foot and a half an
inch because it actually will bow, which I

00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.539
didn't realize the glass actually had that
much play and flexibility in it.

00:49:00.539 --> 00:49:02.549
So, do we have a question?

00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:07.190
&gt;&gt;male #1: So, this is a beautiful exhibit.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.010
I have to know, what's next?

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:11.579
What other exhibits do you have in the pipeline?

00:49:11.579 --> 00:49:12.579
[pause]

00:49:12.579 --> 00:49:15.359
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Leslie, tell him what we're
doing.

00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:16.359
[laughter]

00:49:16.359 --> 00:49:20.059
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: Before we open this Chihuly
Garden and Glass, we've got a show at the

00:49:20.059 --> 00:49:22.630
Dallas Arboretum coming up first week of May.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.940
It'll be up through the summer, just during
tornado season.

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.480
So, we'll see how we fare on that.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.359
And then in the fall, we've got Virginia Museum
of Fine Arts.

00:49:32.359 --> 00:49:37.329
Coming up another, less than a year after
that is the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.

00:49:37.329 --> 00:49:42.589
And we're looking at some interesting projects
in Shanghai and in Beijing in terms of museum

00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:47.510
shows and interesting exhibition opportunities.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:48.510
[pause]

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:49.830
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Yeah.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:58.950
Dallas will be the, I think it's the 12th
Arboretum or Conservatory show that I've done,

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:02.260
starting about ten years ago.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:09.119
And that was a great deal to do because of
my interest in glass and glasshouses and greenhouses.

00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:15.279
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You've talked a lot about
mentorship and teamwork, both the way you

00:50:15.279 --> 00:50:20.890
were mentored early on by getting to watch
some of your fellow students and peers work.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:25.960
There's a really happening, burgeoning art
scene here in Seattle.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:31.810
How do you envision Chihuly Garden and Glass
and your studio interacting with that, with

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:34.299
that group of artists?

00:50:34.299 --> 00:50:37.200
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: One factoid that we've mentioned
in the past, I don't know if you're aware,

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.079
but it's that we actually have more people
working in glass in the Seattle area than

00:50:42.079 --> 00:50:44.690
in anywhere else in the world, including Morano.

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:45.690
So, this is the--.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:49.349
And we've also got an MFA and a BA program
in glass now, the UW.

00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:52.230
We've got the Pilchuck Glass School, which
I mentioned earlier.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:59.240
So, there's a constant evolution of the educational
aspects that are possible for people in this

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.579
area at all ages.

00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:05.309
We've got an at-risk glassblowing program
that's integrated into the Tacoma Public Schools,

00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:07.119
called the Hilltop Program.

00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:12.539
So, really at all ages, we're thinking about
glass and education around glass as an opportunity,

00:51:12.539 --> 00:51:16.890
sort of as a lift-off point for creative thinking,
for working with your hands, for thinking

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:19.319
about ideas conceptually.

00:51:19.319 --> 00:51:20.980
And who knows?

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:25.390
You think about the great history of glass
and what used to happen in Venice is that

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:30.019
if you escaped the island of Venice and you
made it to England with the secrets, you were

00:51:30.019 --> 00:51:31.019
knighted.

00:51:31.019 --> 00:51:33.380
But if you were caught leaving Venice, you
were beheaded.

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:39.730
So, Dale, one of his great innovations in
really generous gifts to the art community

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:42.220
is that he really opened up the community.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.559
He opened up the secrets.

00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:46.730
He invited the great glass masters of Venice
to come and work here.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:51.460
And so now, there's this passing of the torch
that goes back and forth between the people

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:55.339
who've worked in glass for a long time and
those who are coming into it now.

00:51:55.339 --> 00:51:57.210
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We have a few questions
here at the microphone.

00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:00.800
&gt;&gt;female #1: So, something in the lines along
education.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:06.910
So, you mentioned that you started out with
glassblowing pretty little.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:08.789
How little were you?

00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:12.769
And how little will be a kid to be old enough
to do glassblowing?

00:52:12.769 --> 00:52:16.019
And do you have any advice for kids that are
too little?

00:52:16.019 --> 00:52:22.980
What can they do at home or to start having
the creativity explored in them?

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:28.210
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: Well, our son started blowing
glass when he was about eight.

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:33.039
Unfortunately, he quit when he was about ten.

00:52:33.039 --> 00:52:35.019
[laughter]

00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:41.190
But there are a couple of other kids that
blow glass at around eight or nine years old.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:43.569
You can get quite good, actually.

00:52:43.569 --> 00:52:50.430
Something they can do at a younger age is
to, it's what I did when I was in college

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.070
getting my degree.

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.630
And I started putting those bits of glass
in tapestries.

00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:59.160
I needed to make it so that the glass wasn't
sharp.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:04.480
So, I got a little oven, about two feet across,
that would go up to--.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.549
It was a ceramic oven.

00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:09.890
It went up to about 25 hundred degrees.

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:16.339
And so, I would put them in the oven and take
it up high enough to round the edges.

00:53:16.339 --> 00:53:22.450
And then, I started putting one piece attached
to another, which is called fusing.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:27.040
And then, I started working with making little
three-dimensional sculptures.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:36.000
But you can have, I would imagine, you could
have probably from about the age of five,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.839
you could have kids start working with stained
glass, or glass fusing.

00:53:41.839 --> 00:53:47.059
Glass fusing would be easier, actually, than
stained glass.

00:53:47.059 --> 00:53:51.599
You have to figure out at point can they cut
the glass.

00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:55.029
Probably learn at a pretty young age.

00:53:55.029 --> 00:53:56.220
Was that your question?

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.990
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We'll take one more question.

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:02.640
&gt;&gt;male #2: So, an exhibit like this probably
takes a lot of planning for light.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.630
And how did you do that for, how do you plan
to have the lighting effect this exhibit when

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:09.130
it's not sunny in Seattle?

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:10.130
[laughter]

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:11.130
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: I couldn't hear.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:12.130
Could you hear it?

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:16.170
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: He's talking about light
and how did we plan it with the effect of

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:17.170
light, and--.

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:18.170
&gt;&gt;male #2: Yeah.

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:20.670
Like, you need a lot of light for something
like this to, with glass, right?

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:21.670
And--.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:22.670
&gt;&gt;Michelle Bufano: I can tell you this.

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:26.700
At different times of the day, you have a
completely different experience in the Glass

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:32.650
House and the way that the light of the day
reflects on the glass that's in there.

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:39.359
What's so amazing about it is that it actually
changes as there's sun or no light.

00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:43.289
It's just amazing to look at the different
qualities of the glass.

00:54:43.289 --> 00:54:46.980
And I think that's one of the reasons people
will continue to keep coming back is just

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.789
to see that difference.

00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:51.160
But as far as the planning goes, that was
all Dale's vision.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.160
[laughs]

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.859
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: You know, there are really
only three or four materials that transmit

00:54:56.859 --> 00:54:59.009
light of any scale.

00:54:59.009 --> 00:55:07.700
There are a few gems, like diamonds and things,
but materials of any scale there's only glass,

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:08.700
plastic--.

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.710
Actually, this is a good audience.

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.700
See if I'm wrong.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.700
[laughter]

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:21.200
You got glass, plastic, ice, and water.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.200
Those are--.

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.480
Alabaster would be one maybe.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:29.150
Those are about the only material that light
can go through.

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:33.740
And that's what makes glass so incredibly
mysterious.

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.009
If you have a little bit of--.

00:55:36.009 --> 00:55:41.420
If I put a piece of red glass on the wall
down there, a hundred feet down the other

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:52.030
end, one inch square, and I lit it from behind
with the sun or with a Par 36 light bulb,

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:54.790
you would easily see that one inch square.

00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:57.790
Any other material, you couldn't even see
it.

00:55:57.790 --> 00:56:00.540
There's something very magical about glass.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.109
Did anybody think of another material?

00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:04.109
See?

00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:05.550
It's tough.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:06.550
[laughter]

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:11.289
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Well, and actually going
through the exhibit today, I think that it

00:56:11.289 --> 00:56:12.799
actually merits a few visits.

00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:17.400
Like, I started noticing that at first, you
notice all the color and the shapes and the

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.400
forms.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.279
And then, you start to realize how many different
lights there are here and there--the actual

00:56:22.279 --> 00:56:26.359
engineering behind the exhibit, and the armatures
and things like that.

00:56:26.359 --> 00:56:30.650
And so, I definitely encourage all of you
to go to Chihuly Garden and Glass when it

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:31.650
opens on May 23rd?

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:32.650
May 21st.

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:36.271
So, definitely encourage you to go visit,
make multiple visits.

00:56:36.271 --> 00:56:37.420
There's a lot there to see.

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.569
It's like a combination of bringing together
an amazing career and a career that's still

00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:45.499
in progress that I'm sure we're gonna see
even more great things from in the future.

00:56:45.499 --> 00:56:49.390
And it's been a huge honor to have all of
you here today to talk about the project and

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:51.640
talk about your career and your accomplishments.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.670
&gt;&gt;Dale Chihuly: It's our honor.

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:53.670
Thank you so much.

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:54.670
&gt;&gt;Leslie Chihuly: Thank you.

00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:55.670
&gt;&gt;Michelle Bufano: Thank you.

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.671
[applause]
