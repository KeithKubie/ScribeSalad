00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.190
[ Applause ]

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.870

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.170
My name is Michael Cavna with

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.470
Riffs blog.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.190
I'm a cartoonist columnist
and I Trojan horsed my way

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.820
into the Washington Post, and
now they run Comics in a Blog.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.400
And that's what I do.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.890
You know, first of all, thank you
for coming to Graphic Novel Night.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.520
This is the third Graphic
Novel Night.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.200 position:56%
The first time we've had a sitting
congressman and a civil rights hero,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.510
so thank you, Congressman.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:59.400
[ Applause ]

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.790
You know what?

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.090
Yeah.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.400
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Thank you.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And thank you.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.830
And thank you, Andrew Ayden.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.370
So you didn't have much going
on this morning, did you?

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.670
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Not much.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Open a
little museum on the mall, and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.100
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sigh
and tuck a little bit.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.700
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Yeah.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well,
thank you for making it out.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.720
You know, this is a joy, a
passion for all of us who do this.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.560
So we're so thankful to
the Library of Congress.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.210
We're thankful to all the sponsors
you will find your program.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.250
Thankful to the Washington
Post, which is a charter sponsor

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.990
of this event since Laura Bush had

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.770
that idea 16 years ago saying
Texas has a book desk full.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.070
Why doesn't America?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.970
You know, we want to
thank Small Press Expo.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.640
They helped some of this talent
come in, so we're very thankful

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.220
to Warren Barnard,
and just everybody,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.580
you know, look at that panel.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.970 position:56%
You know, a little story, I mean, by
the way I should mention one thing,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.350
I'll plug this event wherever I go,
and I do the comic strip Warped,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.190
and so if you go to
GoComics.com tomorrow,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.390
I have put in a car my
comic strip is warped.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.340
You will see an author joke.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.080
You don't get a lot of author
jokes on the funny pages.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.400
The first person to send an email

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.140
to me
michael.cavna@washingtonpost.com

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.160
gets the original art
of this author strip.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.710
So just email me.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.930
Just email the name of the author.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.630
It'll go up tomorrow morning,
so you know, thank you.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.290
Now the reason part of what's

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.650 position:56%
so special here three years ago my
young relative came home from school

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.400
and said my teacher says
Graphic Novels aren't books.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.340 position:56%
My daughter had been reading Mouse,
and then so I went to the principal.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.640
This was a cause.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.800
And I said Graphic
Novels aren't books?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.480
She said Graphic Novels
aren't books.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.470
And so I spent a year
researching it.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.270
And the first person I went
to was Congressman Lewis with

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.390
"March: Book One" right here.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.380
If you haven't read it,
start with this with Selma.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.420
And pretty soon you came to
town to a small press expo.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.020
I brought my young relative, and
you gave her a civics lesson.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.770
And what you said to her, you
said Graphic Novels are books.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.700
So can I just hear it once?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.310
&gt;&gt; Graphic Novels are books.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.230
&gt;&gt; Michaela Cavna: Okay,
this has to make it out north

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.530
of here to the principal.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.830
Just one more time.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.780
I haven't forgotten.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.080
Long memory.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.380
One more time.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.460
&gt;&gt; Graphic Novels are books.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Thank you.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.060
This is about power.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.360
This is about perception.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.470
There are many kinds,
we have a diverse night.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.680
You know, this is more diverse

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.940
than I would say a
basket full of skittles.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.060
Any way you want to cut it.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.360
Take that any way you want.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.600
The whole night, and I
encourage you to stay.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.410
Noelle Stevenson, our political
cartoonist, Michael Ramirez,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.870
Darrin Bell, Gene Yang
the new ambassador

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.520
for young people's
literature for the library,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.700
Berkeley Breathed the whole
line of Ed Piskor family tree.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.790
It's an incredibly diverse line up.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.040
But first, I want to
say three years ago,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.620
I got to moderate this
man, awesome kind.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.920
Everyone was cosplay.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.200
Next door they were cheering
for Hercules, TV Hercules.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.270
The other room Superman, and I said

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.010
in this house you have
the biggest hero

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.360
in the whole hall, no disrespect.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.170
You have the man who was
preaching to the chickens,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.380
and he said they listened to him
more than the members of congress.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.870
You have the man who was reading
comic books as a young man.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.070
Reading about Rosa Parks
and Martin Luther King

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.350
in the Montgomery story,
and the ways of Gandhi.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.080
He got this from comic books.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.490
At a time when congress was trying
to stop comic books in the fifties.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.200
This a man, he's the youngest
speaker at the March on Washington

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.440
and continued through
Selma to this day.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.240
He tells me he's still
getting arrested,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.800
and he plans to get arrested a few
more times to make good trouble.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.990
A few years ago, his
staffer Andrew Aydin,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.360
right here said I'm
going to Comi-Con.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.840
The office teased him.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.840
They said you're going to
San Diego to go to Comi-Con.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.140
You're a geek.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.540
And the Congressman said, hold up.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.830
Comic books got me
to where I am today.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.640
Comic books led me to
non-violent protests.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.990
So they teamed on March.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.690
The Congressman said to Andrew
I'll do it if you write it with me.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.840
Two years ago, at the time
75 year-old congressman,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.810
dressed up in what he
wore to Selma in 1965.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.360
You got the backpack out.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.660
You got the coat.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.330
You got the apple and
the toothpaste in being

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.520
because you knew you might
spend the night in jail.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.920
You couldn't find an orange in
San Diego, I don't know why.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.610
But you dressed and you led through
the hall dozens and dozens of kids

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.570
because you are reaching the
next generation with these books.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.150
Please give a hand to
these two men and March.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.510
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Thank you.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:15.300
[ Applause ]

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Hello everybody.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.900
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.070
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis Hello everybody.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.370
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.670
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis:
My name is John Lewis.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.970
Thank you.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.050
Michael, thank you
for those kind words

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.410
of introduction my friend,
my brother, thank you.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.920
Now some of you know from
reading March, that I didn't grow

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:46.890
up in a big city like Washington,
DC, or Baltimore, or Silver Spring,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:52.770
or Buffalo, or Detroit,
or Philadelphia,

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.540
or Montgomery, or Birmingham.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.890
I grew up in rural Alabama 50
miles from Montgomery outside

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.930
of a little place called Troy.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.190
My father was a share
cropper, a tenner farmer.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.560 position:56%
But back in 1944, I was 4 years
old, and I do remember when I was 4.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.160
My father had saved 300 dollars.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:24.170
And for 300 dollars, a man
sold him a 110 acres of land.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.690
My family still owns
this land today.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:34.830
On this farm, we raise a lot
of cotton, corn, peanuts,

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.370
hogs, cows, and chickens.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.560
I know some of you have
read March: Book One.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.760
Know that as a little boy,
I remembered when I was 4.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:55.320
I remembered when we moved to
another house with my brothers

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.590
and sisters, and my
wonderful mother and father.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:07.860
And got to know my first
cousins who lived nearby,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:16.510
but on the farm it fell in
my lot to raise chickens,

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.290
to care for the chickens.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.620
We raised hogs and cows.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:28.850
We grew peanuts, cotton, corn, we
had a garden, but my responsibility

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.280
on the farm was to
care for the chickens.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.820
And I fell in love raising
chickens, but I never dreamed

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.220
that one day I would be at the
National Book Festival sponsored

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:44.200
by the Library of Congress talking
to all of you book collectors,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.560
and readers about raising chickens.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:56.870
So I'm grateful to be here
and grateful for the Library

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.510
of Congress, and for
the new librarian.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:10.040
[ Applause ]

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.800
My late wife was a librarian.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:25.230
She grew up in California,
attended LA High, UCLA undergrad,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:30.420
and USC Graduate School
of Library of Science.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:37.420
She went into Peace Corps and spent
two years in Nigeria, came back

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.210
and worked at the Central
Library in LA,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.500
she got a job in Atlanta in 1965.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:50.010
We met in 1967 and
got married in 1968.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.820
She taught me a great deal about
books, because when I was growing

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:02.380
up in rural Alabama, we had
very few books in our home.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:08.590
And I remember on July 5, 1998
by this time I'm in the Congress,

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:18.280
that I went to the local library
in Troy, Alabama for book signing,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.520
and they gave me a library card.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.770
But I had first gone there in 1956
when I was 16 years old with some

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:32.530
of my brothers, sisters and cousins
trying to get a library card,

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.100
and we were told by the
librarian that the library was

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.930
for whites only and not for colors.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:43.170
So I never went back there
until July 5, 1998 for a signing

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.260
of my first book Walking with
the Wind, and hundreds of blacks

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:53.050
and white citizens showed up
and they gave me a library card.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.620
It says something about
the [inaudible]

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.660
and the progress that was made.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.290
But I want to go back to
the chickens for a moment.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.770
Andrew would tell you that
when I was a little boy,

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:11.340
when the setting hen was set,
I would take the fresh eggs,

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.360
most of you don't know anything
about raising chickens, do you?

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.370
Some of you like to eat chicken,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.700
but you don't know anything
about raising chicken.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.030
How many of you know anything
about raising chicken?

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.120
Oh, a few of you.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.420
Why don't we compare notes?

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.200
Where when the setting hen was set,
I'm going to take the fresh eggs,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.820
mark them with a pencil, place
them under the setting hen and wait

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.400
for three long weeks for
the little chicks to hatch.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.030
Some of you may be asking, now John
Lewis, why do you mark those eggs

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.390
with a pencil before you placed
them under the setting hen?

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.810
Well, from time to time, another
hen would get on that same nest,

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.780
and there would be more fresh eggs.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.140
Had to be able to tell the
fresh eggs from the eggs

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.120
that were already under
the setting hen.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.290
Now you don't follow me, do you?

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.140
So when the little
chicks were hatched,

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.240
I would fool the setting hens, I
would cheat on the setting hens.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.500
I would take these little
chicks and get them to another,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.790 position:56%
or put them in a box with a lantern,
and raised them on their own,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.730
get some more fresh eggs, put
them under the hen and wait

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.300
for three long weeks for
the little chicks to hatch.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.350
I kept on fooling and
cheating on the setting hens,

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.290
and when I look back on it, it
was not the right thing to do.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.270
It was not the moral thing to do,
but it's not the most loving thing

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.830
to do, but it's not the most
non-violent thing to do.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.760
It was not the most
democratic thing to do.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.840
But I was never quite able to
save 18 dollars and 98 cents

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.850
to order the most inexpensive
incubator,

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.940
a hatcher from the
[inaudible] store.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.370
Any of you old enough to
remember the [inaudible].

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.800
No. Don't fool me.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.120
You don't remember that catalogue.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.710
That big book.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:03.480
Some people called
it an ordering book.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.310
Other people called it a wish book.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.610
I wish I had this.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.660
I wish I had that.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.960
So I just kept on wishing.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.820
But as a little child, about
eight or nine years old,

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.140
I wanted to be a minister.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.690
So with the help of my brothers
and sisters and cousins,

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.930
we would gather all of our chickens
together in the chicken yard

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.720
like you are gathered in this hall.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.410
My brothers and sisters and
cousins will line the outside

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.440
of the chicken yard, but along
with the chickens, they helped make

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.650
up the audience, the congregation.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.460
And I would start speaking and
preaching, and when I look back

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.510
on it, some of the chickens
would bow their heads,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.810
some of the chickens
would shake their head.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.100
They would never quite say amen.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.860
But I'm convinced that the great
majority of those chickens tended

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.120
to listen to me much better than
some of my colleagues listen

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.420
to me today in the congress.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:03.070
[ Applause ]

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:09.420
As a matter of fact, some of those
chickens would just little more

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.100 position:56%
productive, they would produce eggs.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.290
Well, that's enough of that.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.300
When we visited the little town
of Troy, visited Montgomery,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.520
visit Tuskegee, I would see
those signs that said White Men,

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.750 position:56%
Colored Men, White Women, Colored
Women, White Waiting, Color Waiting.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:32.270
To go downtown on a Saturday
afternoon to a movie,

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:37.690
to see a movie, all of us
little black children had

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.870
to go upstairs to a balcony.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.380
Upstairs to watch the movie.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.370 position:56%
And all of the little white children
were downstairs to the first floor.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.280
I would come home and ask my
mother, my father, my grandparents,

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.970
my great-grandparents, why?

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.670 position:56%
They would say that's the way it is.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.970
Don't get in the way.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.270
Don't get in trouble.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:06.870
But in 1955, 15 years old in the
tenth grade, I heard of Rosa Parks.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:12.180 position:56%
I heard of Martin Luther King Jr.
The words of Martin Luther King Jr.,

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:17.220
the leadership of Dr. King, the
action of Rosa Parks inspired me

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.450
to find a way to get in the way.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:25.440
I got in trouble, but I call
good trouble necessary trouble.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:32.090
March: Book One, Book Two,
Book Three, are same in effect

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.500
to young people and
people not so young.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:40.450
When you see something that is
not right, not fair, not just,

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.020 position:56%
you have a moral obligation to
stand up to speak up, and speak out,

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.380
and get in good trouble,
necessary trouble.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:59.640
I'm going to be very brief so
Andrew will come up and speak.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.590
Andrew has become like a son,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:08.910
and he will tell you how
he got on this journey.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:17.330
But in 1957, at the age
of 17, I applied to go

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.430
to a little college
called Troy State College.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.230
Not only Troy University,
submitted my application,

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.570
my high school transcript.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.240
I never heard a word from the
school, so I wrote a letter

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.900
to Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. I didn't tell my mother,

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.790
my father anything, and my sisters,
my brothers, any of my teachers.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:41.810
Dr. King wrote me back and
sent me a round bus ticket.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.320
And invited me to come to
Montgomery to meet with him.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.040 position:56%
In the meantime, I had been accepted

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.480
at a little college
in Nashville, TN.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.070
An uncle of mine gave me
a hundred dollar bill,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.240
more money than I had ever had.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.320
First part of September in
1957 gave me a foot locker,

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.150
one of these big upright
trunks, that you could open up,

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:15.320
bring it back together, had the
drawers, the drapers, the curtains,

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.880
which you could hang
your clothing on a rack.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:25.240 position:56%
I put everything that I owned in
that foot locker except the chickens

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.150
that I had raised a took a
Greyhound bus to Nashville, TN.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.510
And after being there
for about three weeks,

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.860
I told one of my teachers
that I had been in church

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.910
with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
This teacher had attended Morehouse

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:47.020
College with Dr. King, and later
he came to Howard University

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:52.010
for graduate studies, went
back, and became a pastor

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.750
of a church in Nashville.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:18:00.490
So he informed Dr. King that I was
there, and Dr. King got in touch

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.300
with me and said when you're home

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.270
for spring break, to
come and see him.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:13.660
So I took a Greyhound bus from Troy
to Montgomery in March of 1958,

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.920
at this time I'm 18 years old.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.580
A young lawyer, I'd never seen
a lawyer before black or white,

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:26.410 position:56%
by the name of Fred Gray who was
the lawyer for Rosa Parks, Dr. King,

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:32.770
and the Montgomery movement, became
our lawyer during the Freedom Rise,

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.120
and during the march
from Selma to Montgomery.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:41.470
Met at the Greyhound bus
station, drove me to the church,

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.150
asked about Ralph Abernathy,

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.800
a colleague of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.,

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.270
and ushered me into
the pastor's study.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.770
And I saw Martin Luther King Jr.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.610
and Ralph Abernathy
standing behind a desk.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.410
And Dr. King said are
you John Lewis?

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.150
Are you the boy from Troy?

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:09.740
And I said, Dr. King, I am John
Robert Lewis, I gave my whole name.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.560
And he started calling
me the boy from Troy.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:19.200
He told me that if I
pursued my interest and going

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.950
to Troy State College, not
Troy University, my mother

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:29.760 position:56%
and father would have to file a suit
against the Troy State University,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.050
Troy State College, against
the State Board of Education.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.880
Our home could be bombed or burned.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.600
We could lose the land.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.680
I went back home and
had a discussion

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.000
with my mother and my father.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.300
They were so afraid.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.890
They didn't want to have
anything with my attempt

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.670
to attend Troy State College.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.080
So I continued to study
in Nashville.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.000
And it was in Nashville that
we started studying the way

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.320
of peace, the way of love.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.670
Studying the philosophy
of the non-violence,

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.900
and we started sitting-in.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:12.100
And when you visit the new
African American Museum of History

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:23.730
and Culture, you will see a
long rural, a bunch of kind

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:32.390
of people sitting on stools similar
to what we faced in Nashville,

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:39.460
where students face, and in North
Carolina, and it reminded me today

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.990
when I was walking
through the museum

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.750
as I did a few days
ago of what happened.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.880
We were sitting there
in orderly, peaceful,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.790
non-violent fashion,
waiting to be served.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.450
Black and white college students
and some high school students,

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.680
and some would come up to spit on
us, and put a lighted cigarette

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:05.750
out in our hair, down our backs
pour hot water and coffee on us.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.600
And one day while we
were sitting in,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.990
I heard that we may be
arrested and go to jail.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:18.180
And if you notice, in March: Book
One, Book Two, and Book Three,

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.390
when I was being arrested
or going to jail or marching

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:27.490
for the most time, I
was sort of dressed up.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.710
But during those days we would
sit in or go on a demonstration,

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:36.610
young people wanted to be what
some people would called clean,

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.510
sharp, or fresh.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:43.060
I wanted to be fresh, but
I had very little money.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:49.470
I was a very poor student
in term of having resources.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.980
So a day or so before
the next sit-in,

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:59.000
I went down to a used men's
store, and bought a used suit.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.710
You know how much I paid for?

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.440
And a vest came with the suit?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.480
You know how much I
paid for this suit?

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.530
I paid five dollars.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:14.350
I still have the suit today,
and I probably could sell it

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.680
on eBay for a lot of money.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.850
This young man did some research.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.310
Andrew Aydin.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:32.930
He located a copy of the photograph
of me being arrested, had it,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:40.510
blew it up, and I tell you,
I look good in that suit.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:48.040
[ Applause ]

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.980
But the first time that I
was arrested, I felt free.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.510
I felt liberated.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:58.730
I felt like had crossed over,
and I have not looked back since.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.110
So during that six years
I was arrested six times,

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.160
and since I've been in
congress, five more times,

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.980
and I'm probably going
to get arrested and go

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.280
to jail for something else.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.790
So I know some of you saw this
is Sunday March, but Andrew,

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.310
maybe the next book
we'll have to include it.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.510
A group of us came together to try
to do something about gun violence.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:30.480
[ Applause ]

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.070
We wanted to get the majority
party to bring a bill to the floor

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.020
to do something about gun violence.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:47.500 position:56%
We lost too many of our children,
too many of our mothers and fathers,

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.630
too many of our young people.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:56.650
We have to stop it.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.580
So people came to me and
said what should we do, John?

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.290
I said we should find a
way to dramatize the issue.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.880
Make it real.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.730
Our leadership didn't even
know we were going to do it.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.420
So we made some one minute
and some five minute speeches,

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.760
and the time came to
enter my speech.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.380
I said it's time for action.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.090
And I took a seat on the
floor, and everybody else.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.760
First time in the history
of our country that a group

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:34.700
of members would occupy
the will of the house.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.030
We had to do something.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.250 position:56%
We're trying to get young people all

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.720
over America, and all
over the world.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.040
When you see something, stand
up, speak up, speak out,

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.760
and do it in a peaceful,
non-violent fashion,

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.360
and never give up, never give in.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.880
Keep the faith.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.100
I first came to Washington in
1961 when I had all of my hair

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.280
and a few pounds lighter to go on
something called the Freedom Riot.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.410 position:56%
Just think in 1961, the same year
that President Barak Obama was born,

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.300
that black people and white people

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:17.980
in this city could leave here
seated together on a Greyhound Bus,

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.220
or Trail Way Bus to travel through
the south, testing the decision

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.690
of the United States Supreme Court.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:34.030
Arrested, beaten, beaten in
Rock hill, South Carolina.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:43.170
The buses weren't bombed and burned
between Atlanta and Birmingham.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.890
The Greyhound bus.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:51.010
Those on the Trail Way bus
were beaten in Birmingham.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:56.570
We were beaten Montgomery,
left bloodied and unconscious.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:04.000
Over the summer of 1961, more
than 400 people were arrested

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.860
and jailed in Jackson, Mississippi.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.430
We filled the city jail, the county
jail, and later they transported us

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.730
to the State Penitentiary
at Sunflower.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.180
But President Kennedy and
his brother, Robert Kennedy,

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.670
the Attorney General, intervened
and got the interstate commerce

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:25.490 position:56%
to issue an order bringing down
those signs that said White Waiting,

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:35.110
Colored Waiting, White Men, Colored
men, White Women, Colored Women.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.070
Those signs are gone.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.130
The only place that our children

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:43.680
and their children will see those
signs today will be in a book,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.790
in a museum, or in a video.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.470
So when will people tell me
that nothing had changed?

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.150
I feel like saying, come
and walk in my shoes.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.950
I will show you change.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:07.070
[ Applause ]

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:14.690
So we went through the sit-ins,
the Freedom Riot, the whole fight

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:20.380
to right to vote, and Andrew
would tell you the March:

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:26.210
Book Three is really about
the voting rights act effort

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.290
in Mississippi, the
bombing of the church

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.130
in Birmingham, the
March on Washington.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.500
We're coming a distance,
we've made a lot of progress,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.560
but we're not there yet, but
we will get there as a nation

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:48.790
and as a people, and maybe with
the help of March, the new museum,

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:54.050
we get there, we will serve as a
model for the rest of the world.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:58.890 position:56%
And I said to the young people here,
never become bitter or hostile,

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:03.470
keep the faith, be
hopeful, never hate,

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.860
for hate is too heavy
a burden to bear.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.510
Okay? Thank you very much.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:16.360
[ Applause ]

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.660
Thank you.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Great Job.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.960
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: How
do you follow that?

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.750
My name is Andrew Aydin, and
I serve as Digital Director

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.160
and Policy Advisor in the
Congressman's congressional office.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:52.250
It means I tweet for a living.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.980
You might not recognize me.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.030
The last time I was here,
I had a clean shaven faced.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.760
And so let me come
out and tell you why.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.440
Several months ago, almost a
year now, someone started talking

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.200
about why we should not have
Muslim immigrants in this country.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.270
My father was a Muslim immigrant.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.780
Granted, he left my
mother very young.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.800
I was raised by a single mother.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.340
But when I got to be a teenager,

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.660
my mother would always
say, you need to shave.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.680
No, no. I'm serious.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:36.250 position:56%
Get that hair off your face, and I
listened to her my whole life until,

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:40.900
until I heard these
things being said.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.200
My mother was right.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.050
She didn't want to make
it harder for myself.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.200
I'm from Georgia, the
congressman has been my congressman

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.870
since I was three years old.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.290
Georgia is not a friendly place.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.830
When I was a kid, I
actually grew up in the midst

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.590
of a terrorist bombing
campaign committed

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.190
by a Christian fundamentalist,

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.620
and yet they're worried
about the Muslims.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.730
And so when I heard
these things, I had,

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.510
I felt like I had to do something.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:11.170
If I was going to spend the last
ten years of my life working

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:17.180
for John Lewis, I could
not do nothing.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.280
So in my small way, I grew a beard.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.560
Because I wanted the people
who are on Capitol Hill,

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.730
who are my colleagues to be
sensitized to who the children

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.530
of Muslim immigrants are.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.860
It is a non-violent act.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.780
It is a simple act of education.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.810
It is not hard or difficult.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.720
Maybe some people look at me
differently, but I am totally aware

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.320
that I am using my
privilege as a six foot three,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.910
whitish looking male, so
that for someone else,

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:53.570
for whom it is a little bit more
difficult or a lot more difficult,

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.980
they will have an easier
time being themselves.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.520
So that's why I grew my beard.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.320
Now,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:10.090
[ Applause ]

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.760
What a day to be on
stage with John Lewis?

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:19.120 position:56%
You know when he started pushing for
the museum, the Smithsonian Museum

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.900
of African American
History of Culture,

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.080
everybody thought it was
going to be too hard.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.040
Everybody thought telling that
story to the American people

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.220
in that way was impossible.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.750
People have been trying for a
hundred years to make it a reality.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:45.620
And yet John Lewis tried any way.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:53.590 position:56%
Just like eight years ago, I came to
him with an idea about a comic book.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.820
Everybody thought it was nuts.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.130
They all laughed at me.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:03.190
And yet John Lewis believed in
it, and he helped, and he pushed,

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.840
just like he pushed and
pushed to get the museum done.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.800
And so here we are on a single
day celebrating the opening

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.520
of a National Museum of African
American History and Culture,

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.250
and celebrating March: Book
Three being on the long list

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.050
of the National Book Award

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:30.070
[ Applause ]

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.190
So let me give you a brief
summary of what I have learned,

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.970
because I noticed we have a lot
of teachers, and we have a lot

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.270
of students in here, right?

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.940
How many of you all are teachers
or educators or librarians?

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.240
That's pretty good.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.540
That's pretty good.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.700
How many of you are students?

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.000
That's very good.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.810
Oh yeah, somebody brought
their class.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.080
So let me tell you the three
things I learned in doing March.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.380
You take this with you.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.670 position:56%
You tell them Andrew Aydin told you.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:55.180
Like that will make a difference.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:59.190
First of all, show your work.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.880
All right.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.790
In the process of doing March,
I had never written a book.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.770
You guys hold up March: Book One.

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:07.900
People talk about it
like its cannon.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.700 position:56%
That is the first book I ever wrote.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:15.520
I did not know what I was doing,
but the thing that stuck with me is

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.880
that over and over and over again
as I interviewed the congressman,

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:22.080
as I read these books, as I took
notes, I kept showing my work

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.990
so that I had a full notebook
of everything I needed to know,

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:29.760
and so when your math teacher tells
you you have to show your work,

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.450 position:56%
and you say but the answer is seven!

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.210
Why are we debating this?

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:38.380
I'm telling you, it's because
you need to build that skill.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.490
You need to build that habit

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:46.830
so one day you may be doing
something completely unrelated

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.570
and it will save you.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.110
So show your work.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:58.410
Number two, don't be
afraid to be laughed at.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:02.590
From the very moment I mentioned
that I enjoyed going to Comi-Con,

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:06.270
and yes, I love going to Comi-Con.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.970
My colleagues on the hill, a
very uptight, professional,

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:15.290
political operatives,
they laughed at me.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.890 position:56%
And every time I had a crazy idea,
John Lewis you should join Facebook.

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.500
That's silly, why would
you do that, you nerd?

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.500
And they laughed at me over
and over and over again.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.510
Well, who's laughing now?

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:33.650
[ Applause ]

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.760
And number three, question
your sources.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.630
I think, yeah right.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:44.220
Yeah. Yeah, how about have sources?

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.520
But that's another battle.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:52.910
Over and over and over again, I
was able to defer to John Lewis

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:57.710
for an answer, because what I
found is some of the works that are

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.610
in our classrooms, that
are in our libraries,

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.890
they don't really have
all their facts straight.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:11.010
And we're very lucky, because with
March, and the creation of it,

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:16.220
we experienced the
first digitization

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.850
of SNCC's primary records.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.540
And so when we had a question, and
John Lewis didn't know the answer,

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.050
and we couldn't find it in a
book, or there were more often

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.900
than not conflicting accounts
in two different books,

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.830 position:56%
we went to the after action reports.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.570
We went to the Watts line reports.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.520
We went to the meeting minutes.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.050
In fact, there's a long scene
in Book Three that you'll read

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.030
about where they decide the fate
of Mississippi Freedom Summer.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.990
Nate has dubbed it
the Council of Elrond.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.450
Lord of the Rings.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.750
But it is that moment.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.170
And people ask me, well, how
did you know what they had

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.920
to say on that in that meeting?

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.380
And I say well I had
the meeting minutes.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.530 position:56%
So I just wrote down what they said.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.930
It's not very hard.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.500
If you do those three things,
you're off to a good start.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:16.190 position:56%
But as I mentioned in the beginning,
I was raised by a single mother.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:20.640
I've been on scholarships
since the fourth grade.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.650
Another couple years of
this best seller status,

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.100
I might pay off my student loans.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.830 position:56%
But out of it all, the greatest gift

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:39.510
that I got was a father,
was John Lewis.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:51.200
[ Applause ]

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.860
I didn't know it when I
started answering his mail

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.630
that was my first job.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:37:02.350
There was a lot of Dear John
letters, but if you work hard,

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:06.520 position:56%
if you do what you believe in, if
you're not afraid to get laughed at.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.560
If you're able to do the work,

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:14.180
and find primary sources,
anything is possible.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:19.270
So I ask each and every
one of you join us.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.510
March. Thank you.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:40.080
[ Applause ]

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So we should

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.760
at least show the cover
so they can see it.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.430
Can we at least get the cover up?

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:53.890
And then, but any way, well,
that's our time for this evening.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.190
Thank you guys so much.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.750
You know, you first time we sat
down, you told me this was going

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:02.290
to be like the Star Wars
Trilogy, three books.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.810
And true to the Star Wars Trilogy,

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.270
and I guess Darth Vader
was Bull Connor

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:10.310
or Bull Connor I mean,
or make it a new one?

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:11.610
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: I don't know.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.910 position:56%
Vader became good at the end, right?

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh yeah.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:15.510
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: I don't think
I could be that generous.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.810
He's more Java the Hut.

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: We need more Java.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:22.360
Oh, I won't touch that any ways.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.910 position:56%
But now, like Star Wars, we're going

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:28.200
to get I hope future
books, future entertainment.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.980
Maybe JJ Abrams reboot?

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.480
Who knows?

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.240
But you know, you'll keep marching.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.360
You guys will keep
telling your story.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.160
Please keep telling it because it
needs to be heard in these times,

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.210
in this era when many
people want to be divisive,

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:49.800
all across the line we need people
who remember what it's like to try

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.320
to bring people together.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.830
Thank you guys so much.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:39:00.490
Congressman Lewis, Andrew
Aydin, a big hand please.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.700
Please, please stay in your seats.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.400
They're going to do a long
march down the right side,

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.880
and the signing will be
in about half an hour.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.180
Thank you.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.510
A huge hand, Congressman
Lewis, Andrew Aydin.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.240
[ Applause ]

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.660
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
