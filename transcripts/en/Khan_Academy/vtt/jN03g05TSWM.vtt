00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.680
Some of you might
be wondering, why

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.210
are we even worried about
this Drake equation,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.190
or why are we even tempted
to go through this thought

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.610
experiment of the number
of detectable civilizations

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.996
in the galaxy when we
don't have a clue of some

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:14.870
of these assumptions?

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.080
We don't know what fraction of
planets capable of sustaining

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.050
life actually do generate life.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.142
We don't know of all of
the planets that have life,

00:00:23.142 --> 00:00:25.725
what fraction of those planets
go on to have intelligent life,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.870
and what fractions of
those civilizations

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.460
go on to using
electromagnetic radiation

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.924
as a form of communication.

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:34.090
We don't know these answers.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.590
In fact, we probably
won't know some

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.620
of these answers for some time.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.430
So what's the point of
going through this exercise?

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.870
And that is a valid
point of view.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.870
The Drake equation, or
even this little equation

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.230
that we've set up here,
it's not an equation

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.770
in the traditional sense, where
we can immediately apply it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.590
to some engineering problem,
or some physical problem,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.010
or anything like that.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.800
I view it more as a bit
of a thought experiment.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.270
And what's interesting
about it is

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.332
it kind of can structure our
thought around the problem,

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:03.290
and I think that's where
it has the most value.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.220
We'll probably not get a solid
number on this any time soon,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.240
but it does lead us to thinking
about these interesting

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.050
problems of what
does it mean, or what

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.492
do we think has to happen for
a planet to start getting life,

00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:20.200
even if it has all
the right ingredients?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.990
And then what does it mean
for things to eventually get

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.360
to the point that you
have intelligent life?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.641
And in all fairness to this is
that probably 200 years ago,

00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:31.140
there would have
been no way to even

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.850
have a decent estimate of the
number of stars in the galaxy.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.940
Now we're starting to
do an OK job on that.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.620
20 or 30 years
ago, it would have

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.510
been viewed impossible to say
the fraction of stars that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.620
have planets, but now
we're finding exoplanets.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.409
We're seeing stars wobble.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.450
We're getting more and
more accurate instruments.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.310
So we can start to think
about planets that are closer

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.310
to the size of Earth's.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.790
We're making headway there.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.800
There's other indirect
methods to think about,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.370
well, some of these
exoplanets look

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.680
like they're in the
right zone, and they

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.930
look like they have the right
chemical signature based

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.870
on other information
that we're getting,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.560
and that maybe they are
capable of sustaining life.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.350
So as time goes on, and
as technology improves,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.022
we might be able to get better
and better and better at this.

00:02:13.022 --> 00:02:15.480
But with that said, it's not
going to happen any time soon,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.370
and the real value
of all of this

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.380
is really to
structure our thoughts

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.880
about really, a super,
super interesting topic.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.740
Now, the other thing
I want to talk about

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.650
is a slight
clarification of what

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.310
I talked about in
the last video.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.000
In the last video
for this l, I said

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.080
it's the civilization's
lifespan,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.120
but what's actually
relevant is the lifespan

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.990
of the civilization
while it is detectable.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.160
So, detectable.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.590
So it doesn't matter if the
civilization is around 100,000

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.310
years, but it's not
releasing any type of thing

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.190
that we can detect.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.480
That's not what we care about.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.630
We care about that the 5,000
years, or the 10,000 years,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.010
or the 100,000 years
when they are actually

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.850
using some type
of communications,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.800
or some type of
electromagnetic radiation

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.120
that we can eventually detect
once those things reach us.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.830
Now, the other thing
I want to make clear

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.350
is we're talking
about the number

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.080
of detectable civilizations
in the galaxy right now.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.620
And I'll write now
in quotation marks,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.380
because we're not talking about
a civilization that is maybe

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.580
even a peer civilization
with us that developed radio

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.890
communication on the
order of 100 years ago,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.080
because frankly, they
would have to be no more

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.840
than 100 light years
away for us to be

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.670
able to detect
those signals now.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.750
If they were on the
other side of the galaxy,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.650
we wouldn't be able to detect
their for tens of thousands

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.730
of years.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.230
So when I talk about
now, I'm saying

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.880
that the signals
are getting to us.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.530
Signals getting,
signals received.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.370
The signals are being
received right now.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.390
So you could have a civilization
that developed radio

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.460
70,000 years ago, but they're
70,000 light years away,

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.170
and maybe they collapsed
10,000 years later,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.220
but we're just receiving
their first radio signal.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.290
So that would be
as a civilization

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.130
that I would count in this
equation we're setting up.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.075
And so just to make
sure we understand it,

00:04:15.075 --> 00:04:16.700
and then we can play
with some numbers,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.720
let's remind ourselves.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.668
This is the number of
stars, our estimate

00:04:19.668 --> 00:04:21.209
of the number of
stars of the galaxy.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.480
Multiplied by this,
you now know the number

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.810
of stars in the galaxy
that have planets.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.040
You multiply by this n sub p,
the average number of planets

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.690
capable of sustaining life,
and these first three terms

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.140
will give you the average
number of planets--

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.520
or I should say the number,
the total number of planets

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.160
in the galaxy that have been
capable of sustaining life

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.310
at some point in their history.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.850
Multiply it by this.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.780
This is the number of planets in
the galaxy that have sustained

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.710
actual life, not just
capability of it.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.260
They actually had life on them
at some point in their history.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.680
Multiply it by this,
this is the fraction

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.219
that have developed intelligent
life on these planets.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.010
The number of planets
with intelligent life

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.810
at some point in their history.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.700
Multiply it by this fraction.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.530
All of these terms.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.380
We have the number of
planets in the galaxy that

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.340
have had intelligent life
that became detectable,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.685
that started emitting some
type of radio signature.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.060
We don't know,
some type of thing

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.970
like that at some
point in their history.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.700
So over here, all of
these first six terms

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.580
tell us the number of
detectable civilizations that

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.020
occurred at some point in
the history of the stars,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.740
the solar systems, the planets
that are out there right now.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.900
But we care about the ones
that are detectable now.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.990
We don't care about the
ones that came and went,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.850
and their radio signature went
past us while we were still

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.780
living in caves, or we
were hunter gatherers.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.080
We care about the ones
that the radio signatures

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.890
are receiving us now.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.740
And that's why we have this
little term right over here.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.737
So this is the
civilization of-- or I

00:05:55.737 --> 00:05:57.320
guess you could say
this is the length

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.900
of the detectable civilization.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.080
So while they were actually
releasing a radio signature

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.490
divided by the life of that
planet, or that solar system,

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.080
or that star.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.050
So for any given
star or planet that

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.740
meets all of these
criterion, what's

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.550
the probability that it's
releasing its-- so at some

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.630
point in the history, there
was a detectable civilization

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.600
or more that was releasing
some type of a radio signature.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.230
But what's the probability
that it's doing it right now?

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.740
And so that's the
detectable life span

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.870
of that civilization divided by
the life of that solar system,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.760
or of that planet.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.880
Because frankly, the
star and the solar system

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.880
and the planet, they're
all going to essentially

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.210
have, give or take, a few
hundreds of thousands of years,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.157
or even a few millions
of years, because we're

00:06:43.157 --> 00:06:44.740
thinking in the
billions here, they're

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.140
going to have roughly
the same life span.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.750
And so let's say, and just
to make this a little bit

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.269
more tangible, let's say
that the sun has a lifespan,

00:06:57.269 --> 00:06:59.560
and let's say that with the
Earth and our solar system,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.980
has a lifespan of
approximately 10 billion years.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.580
10 billion years.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.470
And let's say that us as humans,
let me be pretty optimistic

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.790
about it, let's say that we are
detectable as a civilization

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.540
for one million years.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.890
Our best days are ahead of us.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.330
We are detectable for
one million years.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.100
So this term right over
here will be 1 million

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.490
over 10 billion.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.730
So this will be 1/10,000.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.000
So even though we might
be around sending out

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.010
detectable signals
for a million years,

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.680
the odds relative to the
entire span of the history of--

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.830
And I'm making some
simplifying assumptions here,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.420
but relative to the
entire span of the history

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.420
of our planet and our
sun, if someone is just

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.450
randomly sampling
our solar system

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.220
at a random time in its
history, in a random part

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.430
of this 10 billion
years, there's only a 1

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.100
in 10,000 chance that they'll
be sampling us at a time

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.610
that we are releasing signals.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.670
Assuming that there weren't
any other civilizations on Mars

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.350
or Venus, or whatever
else, that there

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.010
weren't any other civilizations
on Earth hundreds of thousands

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.390
of years ago that
were doing this,

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.170
they'll definitely only
have a 1 in 10,000 chance

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.352
of detecting us, assuming
that they're sampling.

00:08:18.352 --> 00:08:20.060
There could have been
a civilization that

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.400
was around three
million years ago,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.050
and they did this whole search
for extraterrestrial life.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.180
Maybe they're 20, or 100,
or 1,000 light years away,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.910
and they pointed their
radio telescopes at us.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.570
But a million or two
million years ago,

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.819
they would have pointed at
the direction of our sun,

00:08:35.819 --> 00:08:37.860
and they would have not
gotten any radio signals,

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.610
and they're like, man, when
is extraterrestrial life going

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.360
to show up?

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.420
Even though the sun and Earth
does eventually develop us,

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.290
they weren't able to observe
us because when they sampled

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.190
was outside of that
1 in 10,000 window.
