00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.960
I realized I made a slight
error in the last video,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.920
when I talk about the
population and the sample mean.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.210
So I will rewrite the equations.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.037
I realize I made a
slight notational error,

00:00:11.037 --> 00:00:12.870
and it might have
confused you a little bit.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900
So just to review a little
bit, it never hurts.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.210
The mean of a
population-- once again,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.330
that's mu-- the mean of
a population is equal to,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.620
you take the sum of
each of the data points.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.220
So you take the sum--
that's that big sigma is

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.880
for-- of each of
the data points.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.760
So x sub i.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.380
I had written x sub n, before.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.937
And if you review
that last video,

00:00:33.937 --> 00:00:35.770
you can see why might
be a little confusing.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.680
And you start with
the first data point.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.921
So i is equal to 1.

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.420
You start with the
first data point,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.510
and you take the sum all the
way to the n-th data point.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.010
Right?

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.630
Where we have a big
capital N, where

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.370
N is the total number of
elements in the population.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.740
And then you divide that by N.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.080
So that's another way of writing
x sub 1 plus x sub 2, plus--

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.130
and you just keep
adding, bum, bum, bum,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.980
however many there
are-- x sub N.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.550
And then, you divide
that by N. And I think

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.140
that's what you're familiar with
as just the arithmetic mean,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.841
or the average.

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:11.340
You just add up all
of the elements,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.715
and you divide by the total
number of elements there are.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:15.620
That's just a fancy
way of writing that.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.476
And then, the sample mean is
essentially the same thing,

00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:20.350
although you use slightly
different notation.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.140
The sample mean is written
as x with a line over it.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.920
And that's equal to,
once again, the sum

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.130
of the elements in
the sample, right,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.810
and then you have a slight
notational difference.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.910
You start at the first
element in the sample.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.750
And you go to the number
of elements in the sample.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870
And that's why they
use that lowercase n.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.610
There are a big N elements
in the whole population.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.600
And if you took some
subset of that-- we're

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.912
assuming that small n is
less than or equal to big N.

00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:52.870
And anyway, you divide
that by the total number

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.980
of elements in the sample.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.500
So once again, this would be
x1 plus x2, plus dun, dun, dun,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.150
plus x lower case n,
divided by lowercase n.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.120
These are essentially
the same thing.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.404
If your sample was the
entire population, then

00:02:09.404 --> 00:02:11.070
these ends would be
equal to each other.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.028
And these numbers would
be equal to each other.

00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:14.730
But just the
notational difference,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.820
if you ever see this, you know
you're dealing with a sample.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.250
Here you know you're dealing
with the entire population.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.160
And similarly, big N,
entire population, small n,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.620
the sample.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.610
Fair enough.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.780
I think we're now ready to learn
a little bit about measures

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.400
of dispersion.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.670
So the mean, and the
mode, and the median,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.910
that we covered in the first
video in this playlist,

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.625
were all ways of measuring the
central tendency of a data set.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.000
Or kind of, picking
a number that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.046
is most representative
of all of the numbers.

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:44.420
But we lose a lot
of information.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.340
We don't know whether all of
the numbers in the data set

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.355
are close to that number,
close to the mean.

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:50.480
Or maybe they're all really
far away from the mean.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.063
And that's why we want to come
up with measures of dispersion.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.650
And let me tell you, let
me show you what I mean.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.290
So let's say I have one set,
and let's say, I don't know,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.699
let's say it is a 2,
a 2, and a 3, and a 3.

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:10.990
Let's say this is a population.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.844
Let's just deal with
population means and population

00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:15.760
disbursements for now.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.570
So what's the mean here?

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.800
The mean here is going to
be 2 plus 2 plus 3 plus 3,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.900
all of that over 4.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.680
And what is that?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.890
That's equal to
2 and 1/2, right?

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.180
4 plus 6, divided by 4, right.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.730
That's equal to 2.5.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.650
Fair enough.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.650
Fair enough.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.660
Now what if we had this?

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:48.970
What if we had the numbers, I
don't know, 0, 0, and 5, and 5.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.470
So these are the
numbers in the set.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.230
I'll put commas,
just so you know

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.200
these are separate numbers.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.850
What's the mean here?

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.920
Well, the mean here-- let's
say this is the population

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.700
that we're sampling,
This isn't a sample,

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.020
this is the entire population.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.620
And you'll see why I'm making
that distinction later--

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.485
so it'll be 0 plus
0 plus 5 plus 5.

00:04:08.485 --> 00:04:13.120
Well that's 10, divided
by 4 is equal to 2.5.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.100
So the arithmetic mean of
both of these populations

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.060
are the same number.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.230
They're both 2.5.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.470
Right?

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.480
But you see that these sets are
kind of, they are different.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.240
Here, all of the numbers are
pretty close to 2.5, right?

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.620
Well, here, sure their mean,
their arithmetic mean, is 2.5,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.710
but they're further
away from 2.5.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.310
Or the distances of
each of these numbers,

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.960
each of the numbers in the set,
their distance from the mean

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.645
is further.

00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:46.020
So you can kind of view them
that they're more dispersed,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.460
they're further
away from the mean.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.960
Or another way you
could think of it

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.790
is, the mean, although it does
measure its central tendency,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.620
it's not quite as indicative
of all the numbers.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.900
The numbers are much further
away from the mean, on average.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.390
So how do you measure that?

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.930
Well, you measure
that with a variance.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.150
And this is something I
found, and even in my own,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.220
it seems complicated when
you first look at it.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.930
And most statistics textbooks
use fairly complex notations.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.270
But the idea is almost
as straightforward

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.159
as the arithmetic mean.

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.700
So what they'll do is, they'll
write, you know, the variance.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.550
And they'll write it
as this letter sigma,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.800
this Greek letter-- I wrote
the top part too long.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.389
Let me actually undo that.

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.680
I don't want you to spend
the rest of your life writing

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.316
with a big top part-- they
write it as sigma squared.

00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:32.690
And we'll talk,
in a few seconds,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.856
about why it's written as--
you know, why don't they

00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:36.210
just write v for variance?

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.310
Why do they write this
weird letter squared?

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.720
I'll talk about it in a second.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.640
But the variance of a
population is defined--

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.020
and once again, these are
just human-derived constructs

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.490
of trying to get our
minds around data, being

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.860
able to describe a set
of data, without having

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.004
to list all the numbers.

00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:54.420
And then, being
able to understand

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.590
what that data might
represent, or what

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.380
can represent that data.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.990
So what you do is,
you take the sum,

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.460
and you start with all of
the points in the population.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.420
But instead of taking
the sum of the points,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.764
you take each point, x sub i,
and you subtract from that--

00:06:16.764 --> 00:06:19.180
and actually, it doesn't matter
if you subtract from that,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.580
or you subtract
that from the mean,

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.710
the population mean,
and then you square it.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.460
So what is this?

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.062
This is the distance between
each number and the mean.

00:06:30.062 --> 00:06:32.520
And then, when you square it,
it becomes a positive number.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.940
So you can kind of view it as
the squared absolute distance

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.780
between each number and
the mean of that set.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.550
And then you take the
average of all of those.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.920
You divide that by n.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.260
Now that might seem like
a very complicated notion,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.630
but let's calculate it
for these two data sets.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.000
So here-- let me rewrite that
first data set-- it's 2, 2, 3,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.330
and 3.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.700
So what is-- let me, actually,
let me write it this way.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.940
I think this will help explain
it for you a little bit better.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.860
So if I wrote i.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.770
i1, i2, i3, i4.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.410
That's i.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.836
Then x sub i.

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:17.730
And you know, it's
kind of arbitrary.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.640
It's just, you
know, this is saying

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.641
the first term, the second
term, the third term.

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:22.098
I could have had
this in any order.

00:07:22.098 --> 00:07:22.970
It doesn't matter.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.870
Maybe this was the first
term, and this was the second,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.380
and this was the third.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.800
It doesn't matter.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.550
Because we're just going to
add them all up, and then

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.102
divide them.

00:07:28.102 --> 00:07:29.810
So it doesn't matter
what order we do it.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:39.130
But anyway, x sub 1 is equal
to 2, x sub 2 is equal to 2,

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.590
x sub 3 is equal
to 3-- I'll stop

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.320
writing this equal thing--
x sub 4 is equal to 4.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.230
Right?

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.087
What's the mean?

00:07:47.087 --> 00:07:48.670
Well, we figured out
the mean up here.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.590
We just took these numbers and
added them and divided by 4.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:59.860
The mean is 2.5.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.151
So what is x sub
i minus the mean?

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:05.650
Right?

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.480
We're slowly building
up to this equation.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.640
What is x sub i minus the mean?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.754
Well, 2 minus 2.5,
that's minus 0.5.

00:08:14.754 --> 00:08:19.281
2 minus 2.5, that's
once again, minus 0.5.

00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.251
3 minus 2.5, that's 0.5.

00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:25.340
3 minus 2.5, that's 0.5.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.940
Fair enough.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.300
Now this equation, they
want us to square this.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.135
So x sub i minus
the mean squared.

00:08:35.287 --> 00:08:37.620
There's several other properties
we'll talk about later.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.429
But the most important thing
that the squaring does,

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.669
and the absolute value
could have done it as well.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.770
But the squaring makes
all of these positive.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.620
So minus 0.5 squared
is positive 0.25.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.720
This is positive 0.25.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.770
Plus 0.5 squared is
also positive 0.25.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.610
And this is positive 0.25.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:03.250
And so what is-- so if we
wanted to know the sum from i

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.990
is equal to 1 to 4 of x
sub i minus the mean, which

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.030
is 2.5 squared.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.760
This is equal to, what, the
sum of all of these numbers.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.987
This is just saying
sum all of these.

00:09:15.987 --> 00:09:16.820
So sum all of these.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.770
0.25, so that's equal to 1.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.300
But this isn't the variance yet.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.779
The variance is this
thing-- let's look

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:26.320
at the original formula-- the
variance is this thing, divided

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.630
by the total number
of numbers you have.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.390
So you take this, and
then you-- so the variance

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.800
is equal to this thing, divided
by the total number of numbers,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.490
which is 4.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.250
Which is equal to 0.25.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.180
And you see, I mean
here, the distance

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:48.014
from every number to the
mean squared was 0.25.

00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:50.180
So the average of all of
these, which is essentially

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.721
what the variance is, the
average was also 0.25.

00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:55.970
And I'll do another example
where these are different.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.130
The other example in this
video, actually, they're

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.000
not different.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.830
But you see here, the average
squared distance from the mean,

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.250
in that first data set, is 0.25.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.260
And here, what's the average
squared distance from the mean?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.460
So let's see.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.730
This is how far from the mean?

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:18.400
It is-- So let's say x--
let me write-- x sub i.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.330
And then, x sub i minus the
mean for this population.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.770
So x sub i, there's a 0,
there's a 0, there's a 5,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.640
and a 5, right?

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:35.230
There's the first term x sub 1,
this is x sub 2, and so forth.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.304
And then, each of these numbers
0 minus 2, that's minus 2.5.

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:41.550
0 minus 2.5.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.050
Right?

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.620
This could be 2.5, right?

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.740
That's the mean.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.475
It's minus 2.5.

00:10:46.475 --> 00:10:51.500
5 minus 2.5 is 2.5,
5 minus 2.5 is 2.5.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:57.670
Now, if you took x sub i minus
the mean squared, 2.5 squared

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.550
is what?

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.320
6.25 and it becomes positive.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.160
So it's 6.25.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.290
That's the same thing, 6.25.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:10.550
That's already
positive, so 6.25, 6.25.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.460
And so, the variance
is the sum of all

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.880
of these, divided by the total
number of numbers there are,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.751
right?

00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:19.250
So we take the sum of all-- so
this is the average of these,

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.420
and that's pretty
easy to calculate.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.570
If you added all of these
up and divided by 4,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.820
you're just going to get 6.25.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.336
So the variance of this
population is 6.25.

00:11:28.336 --> 00:11:29.210
So there you have it.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.510
You have two data sets where
their means are the same.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.830
But the variance of this
data set is equal to,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.130
we figured out, was 0.25.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:44.772
While the variance of this
data set is equal to 6.25.

00:11:44.772 --> 00:11:47.230
And it's hard right now to have
an intuition of what this--

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.250
you know, how does this
6 relate to the 0.25--

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.720
but you know that this
is a larger number.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.070
This is a much larger
number than this is.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.990
Which tells you, just kind
of at a intuitive feel,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.040
that the numbers in this that
are, on average, much further

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.510
away from the mean than the
numbers in this data set.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.800
Anyway, I'm out of time.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.640
I'll see you in the
next video, and we'll

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.848
talk a little bit about this.

00:12:07.848 --> 00:12:10.624
And we'll talk-- and we'll move
into the standard deviation.

00:12:10.624 --> 00:12:12.040
And then, what
happens if you take

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.600
these of a sample
instead of a population.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.800
Everything we're doing
here, we're taking the mean

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.940
and the variance of every
number in the data set.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.315
Later we'll do it
for the sample.

00:12:20.315 --> 00:12:22.026
See you soon.
