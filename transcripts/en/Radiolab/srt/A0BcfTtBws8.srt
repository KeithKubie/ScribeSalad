1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,710
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,620
S t. A. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,730
So we got an email from you

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,010
not long ago, our editor,
Soren Wheeler and I,

5
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:27,270
we got into a conversation with this
woman. I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,450
Her name is Janell. Jenny. I like
the packers. Of course you do. Yeah,

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,860
I guess photographer would
technically be my job,

8
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,570
but I do a whole lot of different things.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,200
None of which really pertain to
the story at hand. But that's,

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,750
and our story really starts when Janell
sent an email to the radio lab, um,

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,660
inbox basically saying,
I need your help. Yeah.

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,170
Something had happened to her that was
kind of wondrous and unexplainable and

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,920
very weird. And as a result,

14
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:02,340
Jenelle had found
herself stuck in a story,

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,580
a story told to hundreds of thousands
of people all across the [inaudible]

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,340
a story that sits right smack dab in the
middle of one of the biggest cultural

17
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,690
divides in our country right now.

18
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,520
It was a story that wasn't hers and
she wanted us to help her find a way to

19
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:22,760
finally tell her story, so to speak. Um,

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,100
do you want me to kind of just
talk me out? Yeah, sure. Well, um,

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,550
when I was 18, I went to a concert,

22
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,870
a rock concert actually is that warp tour.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,800
So it's like a festival
of young rock concerts,

24
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,610
tons of bands on different stages
all over the place. And Janell

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,520
is walking around between
all the different stages
and merchandise tables when

26
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:53,521
she sees this 10 10 by 10 white 10th
with just the little table in front of a

27
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:58,120
table with a sign on it that said
bone marrow donor sign up to be on the

28
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:00,670
registry, save a life,
something like that.

29
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,010
So this was a rock music and good
deeds brought together, right,

30
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,480
which is a pretty good mix in hindsight.

31
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,420
So Jenelle read the sign and she
thought to herself, I'll sign it. Sure,

32
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,430
why not? Yeah. Did you know
what bone marrow was? Yeah,

33
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,151
yeah. I mean,

34
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:20,590
I knew that that would mean that they'd
take a really long needle and stick it

35
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,850
in you and suck out bone stuff. Yeah.

36
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,260
I suppose at that point that was
probably not the four thoughts. Um,

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,520
I think the altruistic
like do something. Yeah,

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,960
that was probably the main motivation
and all Janell had to do with standing in

39
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:37,600
front of that tent was signed
some papers and swab or cheek,

40
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,080
because with a bone marrow donation they
actually have to figure out if you're a

41
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,050
genetic match with someone who
would receive the donation. Yeah.

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,040
Which was part of what Jenelle thought
was cool about it. I always thought that,

43
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,551
you know,

44
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:53,551
just be an amazing opportunity to be the
one person who could do something for

45
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:57,940
somebody that like literally no one
else in the world could deep kind of

46
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:00,430
connection with someone there.
Yeah. There's, you know,

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,690
I don't know if either of you are
only children, but it's, yeah, it's,

48
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,500
you know how there's just like, you
have cousins, you've got friends,

49
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,650
but at some point there's
not that it sounds so stupid,

50
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,760
but that biological connection like
besides my parents or one night, right.

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,591
Was that, that you,

52
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:21,591
you missed the idea of someone who was
much Li like you and muchly in your world

53
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,204
and muchly

54
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,780
yeah.

55
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,780
And also even the kind of the need like
somebody out there dependent on me on

56
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,120
kind of that almost other worldly level.

57
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,370
So Janell swapped her
cheek, signed the paper,

58
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:39,350
and then went about her normal life.

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,130
And then about six months
later she got a call.

60
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,860
Yeah. Yeah. It was a phone call to
my landline. That's my along with,

61
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,290
oh gosh. So what year
are we talking here? No,

62
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,290
it's 2009. Okay. Um,

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,520
it was a phone call and I
remember very specifically,

64
00:03:56,521 --> 00:04:01,140
it was a voicemail because I
hadn't had the chance to answer it.

65
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:05,110
And they said something to the extent
of, you know, high are familiar.

66
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,200
The national bone marrow donor registry.

67
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,710
We've done some tests and we've narrowed
you down to be a preliminary match for

68
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:13,621
a patient.

69
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:18,120
So we need you to come in and do some
further tests that involve no blood and

70
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:22,440
stuff. Did you think, oh no, I forgot
that I did that or are you thinking,

71
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:26,670
oh boy, or what were you, oh, I
was so I overcome with emotion.

72
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:29,820
I remember just just to
think there's somebody,

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,240
there's somebody out there
that might be my person. Uh,

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,830
so absolutely no hesitation
on my end. I went, sure.

75
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,280
Janell has into the clinic
because, well, some bone marrow,

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,750
the stuff in the kind of core of your
bones actually produces all your blood

77
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,780
cells and importantly including
um, your white blood cells,

78
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:51,640
which are a key part
of your immune system.

79
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,510
So what you're doing with the bone marrow
transplant is taking a healthy immune

80
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:59,920
system out of one person and putting it
into another person whose immune system

81
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,850
is, you know, cancer or, or
messed up in some kind of way.

82
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,081
He is though,

83
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,800
because the immune system is that part
of you that like recognizes you from not

84
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,420
you and attacks anything that's not you.

85
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,900
You have to like fool the new body into
thinking that this immune system is

86
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:19,660
them. And so the parts of your DNA that
have to do with your immune system,

87
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,080
couple of key parts of that
have to match with the donor.

88
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,490
So that's what they're doing with Jenelle.

89
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,080
They're taking her into like test your
DNA to see if the stuff that marks out

90
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:33,340
her immune system matches closely
enough with this, you know,

91
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,760
recipient so that the bone
marrow transplant will work.

92
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,360
And then maybe a month later I
get like another call on this one.

93
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:44,150
I was able to answer and they say, well,

94
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,900
we've done tests and you are the ideal
person in this 8 million person registry

95
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,180
to donate for this patient.

96
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,280
You are a perfect wow. Well you do it.

97
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,440
And I was like, absolutely. Um,

98
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,040
so did that feel totally like the
call of destiny? Like oh maybe,

99
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,740
maybe this was meant to be okay. Yeah,

100
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,590
there's something I feel
that's like bigger than myself.

101
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,240
That's happening and I
don't really, they made it,

102
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:22,510
can't really explain it yet at that
point. But I know there's like, okay,

103
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,830
here's a, there's a big thing.

104
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,330
So I go in and unfortunately
to disappoint you Robert,

105
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:29,370
the way that I don't need it,

106
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,390
bone marrow wasn't the actually the
real bad way with the big needle.

107
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,540
I'm no, I'm your new map disappointment.

108
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,490
Whoever have they come up with
a small needle urge. Yeah.

109
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:44,340
Well what the straw or something.
What they essentially do,

110
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:46,860
and this is actually the far
more common way of doing it,

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,020
neuro is they inject you with all these
drugs and it is like eight injections,

112
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,400
um, that boosts your white blood cell
count up to astronomical heights.

113
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,290
And do you know, like when you get sick,

114
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,140
when your immune system kicks
in overdrive and you feel sick,

115
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,020
imagine that like eight times over.
But just cause I [inaudible] Achy,

116
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,280
so achy, every bone hurt.

117
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,320
And while Janell was feeling
achy and sick inside of her,

118
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,360
her bone marrow is pumping out a bunch
of new baby blood cells on matured stem

119
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:20,460
cells that can really
become almost anything.

120
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,350
Then they just go in and [inaudible]
grab those cells. They harvest you,

121
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:25,184
I guess.

122
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,510
So you have a needle in both arms and
you pretty much sit still for six hours.

123
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,760
Jellies, suck all your
blood out of your body,

124
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,640
put it in a machine and give
you back what they don't need.

125
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,800
So I think they've got about, you know,

126
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,820
one of those little ivy begs just a
quart size plastic bag full of my stem

127
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,794
cells.

128
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,740
And once you're done they put some
bandaids on you and they're like, alright,

129
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,340
um, let us know if you need anything.

130
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,330
And do you know anything about like
what happens to your blood cells?

131
00:07:57,331 --> 00:08:02,130
Like who gets it or what they're,
um, the whole, uh, registry is very,

132
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:04,620
very strict about patient confidentiality.

133
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:08,130
But they did tell me that it was, um,

134
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,490
a 29 year old man with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia and that's their like,

135
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,340
literally, that's all I knew for a
whole year. Did you look that up in the,

136
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:18,090
in the, Oh,

137
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,530
of course they did endless Google
searches of 29 year old man,

138
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,000
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, trying
to get a real p right. I was like, oh,

139
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:31,380
maybe he's worded it that way and
I didn't find anything of course.

140
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,280
But once the ears up, if both
parties agree, then we can talk.

141
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,150
And that's,

142
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,800
that's kind of really interesting because
I definitely was looking forward to

143
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:45,850
that year mark. But once that
hit, I kind of got cold feet.

144
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,030
I really just wasn't ready
to know exactly who he was.

145
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,520
Um, and then I was also worried that
maybe this guy's like real piece of crap.

146
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,330
Like maybe he's a clan member
or criminal or something.

147
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,220
So there's a part of that two or three
that you'd open up the sentinel and it

148
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:09,270
would say formerly ill person robs
three banks and hits all ladies.

149
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,460
Horrible man saved by Janell
Janney it's so stupid to say,

150
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,930
but I thought that,

151
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,480
so I did end up eventually
sending this email or whatnot in,

152
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,980
I think about October.

153
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,150
It took them a couple of weeks to actually
give my info to my patient and vice

154
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:29,540
versa.

155
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,920
I was eating a lunch with a friend of
mine and I remember having chips and

156
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:34,754
Guacamole

157
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,740
by the way. My, my patient's name
is Jim. Um, so they gave Jim my info

158
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,040
and my phone went off in my pocket.
There was an email in my inbox and um,

159
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,623
there was a,

160
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,550
a scanned pdf attached to this email and
open it up and she had filled this out

161
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:55,600
with their own hand and I just
broke, I totally badges a web,

162
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:58,840
like a little baby in a, in a
booth, in a Mexican restaurant,

163
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,430
middle of Grapevine, Texas.
Um, and I got on Facebook,

164
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,330
I saw a picture, I saw a picture of her
and I was like, oh my gosh, it's got,

165
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,100
it's kind of be her.

166
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,100
I had gotten an email or not email to
Facebook friend request from said this guy

167
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:20,130
named Jim Monroe in Texas.
And I was like, oh, okay.

168
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:24,750
I don't know anybody in Texas. And
then it clicked all the time. Ah, this,

169
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,440
this is the guy, this is him. I
could see his picture. I can look in.

170
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,710
What does he look like?
Not very much like me.

171
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,810
Better now with shorter, no, wait. Yeah,

172
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm tall before I've got
blonde, her hair, blonde hair,

173
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,160
I think fake blonde, I should
say. It's started right now,

174
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,130
but I have like strawberry blonde
hair, but tall blonde haired,

175
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:51,840
blue eyed white guy. Um,
I'm very handsome. Yeah.

176
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,890
Short blonde haired blue
eyed person until I guess

177
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,780
we could be cousins. I think it, yes,

178
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,600
when I looked at all of his pictures and
his wife who's a model and these kids

179
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:10,960
were so adorable and he tried to find
as much as I can and as far as his

180
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,800
profession, I was like, oh, he
appears to be some sort of magician.

181
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,940
So I guess we'll talk about that leader.

182
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,430
So I don't even know, like,

183
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,210
I guess why don't we just find
out like where you're from,

184
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:27,920
where you were raised and okay.

185
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,540
That way. So I was, uh, born
in Orange County, California,

186
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,090
Fullerton, California. I went to school
in Anaheim, high school in Anaheim, uh,

187
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,980
was a baseball player. So I
ended up going, it was very,

188
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,610
very good baseball player. I,
uh, I got drafted by the, uh,

189
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,560
at the time they were called
the Tampa Bay devil rays.

190
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:48,560
Now they're just the Tampa Bay
rays. Oh, you were that good? Yeah.

191
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:51,920
I turned down a professional baseball
contract to go play at the University of

192
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:55,210
Texas in Austin. What did
you play? I was a pitcher.

193
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,220
I was a hard throwing right-hander huh.
And uh, ended up getting, like I said,

194
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,130
drafted and went to the University of
Texas to play baseball and that's what I

195
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:03,641
thought I was going to be.

196
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:07,000
I thought it was gonna be professional
baseball player. And then my, uh,

197
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:09,040
my sophomore year of college,
I blew out my shoulder.

198
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,340
I had a surgery my freshman year and then
came back and was throwing harder than

199
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:16,930
ever then did it again. Uh,
so baseball was kind of over,

200
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,660
I'm over it like 19, like that's,
yes sir. Yeah, it was a pretty,

201
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:25,990
it was a big kick in the head,
but he finished up school. They,

202
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:29,770
I maintained my scholarship as a medical
red shirt and majored in business and

203
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:33,010
psychology. Yeah. Then moved
up to boulder, Colorado,

204
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,480
got married and had a couple kids and
one of my really good friends during this

205
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:41,590
time was, his name was Tennyson and he
became one of my best friends and he was,

206
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,650
he wasn't just my best friend, he was
like my brother, he was an athlete too,

207
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:48,730
so he was a former college football
player and he had also lost his football

208
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:53,320
career based upon an injury.
Um, and then also new magic, uh,

209
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,210
and illusion and magic was actually
something that Jim had been fascinated by,

210
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,250
um, ever since he was a kid. Yeah.

211
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,980
I saw a trade show magician
when I was 10 or 11.

212
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,250
It was at the Anaheim convention
center of all places at an optometric

213
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,030
convention. Both of my parents are
optometrists and he was just doing

214
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,890
trade show stuff at a booth. Do
you remember what he was doing?

215
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,400
He did a version of this trick called
cards across. He made a cigarette,

216
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,330
appeared you gotta which he pulled out
of your head or out of somebody. Just,

217
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,290
he just casually holding his hand and
was holding a zigzag in the tips of his

218
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,700
fingers and he goes to light it and
there's a puff of smoke and there's a,

219
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,240
there's a real cigarette [inaudible] and
the thought you had at that moment was

220
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,320
I want to do that.

221
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,640
It was how did he do that?
And that is cool and you know,

222
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,350
I'm going to go learn how that's done.

223
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,380
So I just began to look at card tricks
and read books on all how all this stuff

224
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:45,890
was done to figure out how it was
done. So when he met Tennyson,

225
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,890
they started practicing together and
doing shows in front of friends and family

226
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,800
and pretty soon, sure
enough we start doing gigs.

227
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,050
But they started doing these shows at
like schools and festivals and stuff.

228
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:03,100
And they would do these tricks like a
lot of kind of card tricks and number

229
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:05,920
tricks. Say we pick a random
number and it went and up,

230
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:08,710
it was written on a piece of paper
in the shoe of an audience member or

231
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,573
something like that.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,500
But then the show would turn into
something else because the thing is,

233
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,650
Tennyson was a believer overwhelmingly
so like believer like in God you mean?

234
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,810
Yeah. Uh, Christian and, uh,

235
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,080
Tennyson was very convinced and so
after an hour or so of magic tricks,

236
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:33,010
just pure entertainment, Tennyson would
say to the crowd. This has been great.

237
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:34,000
We're going to take a quick break.

238
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,360
We're going to give you guys a chance
to take off cause during the second part

239
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:40,600
of this show and we're going to talk about
what the Christian perspective is and

240
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:44,230
why we believe this Christian thing.
If you want to stick around, great.

241
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:47,440
If you don't take off. Now, Jim
says during this part of the show,

242
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:52,140
Tennyson in particularly was way more
of the evangelistic piece. This, um,

243
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,980
and I considered myself
more of a producer.

244
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,700
Now Jim had actually grown up
going to church. Yes, I was, uh,

245
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:03,160
my parents went to Lutheran church. I
was, um, at one point doing that. It's,

246
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,100
but still there's, you know, at
the end of the day it was just,

247
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:11,390
there was nothing in it that,
uh, seem to be satisfying.

248
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,920
And so at this point in the show,

249
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:17,180
Jim would sort of stand back a bit
as Tennyson talked about how magic is

250
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:20,120
actually all about the unseen
and behind the veil of reality.

251
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:25,121
There's a god watching over us and Jim
says he would be standing there on stage

252
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,510
watching these people in the audience
who are feeling this real connection with

253
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:34,010
God. However, um, I wasn't having
that experience. He's just like,

254
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,970
I don't feel what they're feeling.
And he started to think to himself,

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,170
I didn't want to be the
guy that said, well,

256
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm a Christian because my
friends were, or I'm a Christian,

257
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,330
cause I was raised that
way. I want it to be true.

258
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,980
And he just wasn't sure that it was
right. Um, and then after he and Tennyson,

259
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,570
who had been doing this show for a
year and a half or so, Jim got a call.

260
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,450
Tennyson had been out
hiking in the mountains just
outside of boulder. And, uh,

261
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,200
he was found, uh, in a river.
His body was partially submerged,

262
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,850
uh, just at the edge of the water, at
the base of a 40 foot cliff. And, uh,

263
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,350
peaceful valley who was calling. No
one really knows how he passed away.

264
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,700
It looked like he might've
actually fallen from the cliff. Um,

265
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,550
the police thought maybe suicide,
but it could be, you know,

266
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:24,440
exposure to the elements,
that kind of thing. Um, yeah,

267
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,200
Jim says he was just, you know,

268
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,900
devastated and he's probably the
closest male friend I've ever had.

269
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,380
Just felt like he was, you know,
in the bottom of a hole. Yeah.

270
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,560
Bottom of a hole, kind of figuring
it out. Best friend passes away.

271
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,430
My wife and I as a result, Kinda got
into this really strange season where,

272
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,440
you know, I'm depressed, she's depressed,

273
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,790
we're pretty much on the verge of
calling it quits. Uh, and then, uh,

274
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,670
my leg starts hurting really badly.

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,430
We're in the leg underneath my right knee.

276
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,320
Jim says he started popping Advil
every day at first, just a couple,

277
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:02,720
then more and more. And
I'm trying to gut it out.

278
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,230
Then he came home one day and he says
the pain was so bad he couldn't even get

279
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:08,120
out of his car. And so
his wife was like, look,

280
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,760
we're going to the hospital now and I'm
sitting there and in an emergency room

281
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:13,970
and this man walks into my room
and he looks at me. He says, um,

282
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,250
you have cancer. Jim had leukemia,
which is I'm cancer of the blood cells.

283
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,820
So the white blood cells inside of your
bone marrow have literally exploded out

284
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:25,870
of control. And the reason why your
leg hurts so bad is cause your,

285
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,580
your bone is breaking on its own from
the inside. Wow. And he said, uh,

286
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,630
if you don't do anything, you're
going to die in two months.

287
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,910
Just before Christmas of 2008 Jim checks
into the hospital and right away they

288
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:39,470
do two things. One,

289
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:42,950
they put Jim on the bone marrow registry
in the hopes that he can find a donor

290
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,950
and two, just to keep
them alive, only waits.

291
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,850
They start putting him through round
after round of Chemo and get this wicked

292
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:53,790
concoction of stuff and then
be let out. He loses his hair,

293
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,320
his body starts to fall apart. And
all you can do at that point is just

294
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,770
hope, you know, like tick tock, tick tock,

295
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,310
tick, tick, Tock, tick tock.

296
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,810
That's when you think you know what
you believe to be true is in con is in

297
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:20,250
adversity. That's, that's when you
find out. And so for me it was not,

298
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,010
it was not a Christian worldview.
If there is an all loving on that,

299
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,550
a powerful being that makes
the universe go around,

300
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,830
then why would things like, you know,

301
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,780
suicide or murder or
rape exist in a, in a,

302
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,440
in this constructed world of his gym,

303
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:44,250
just couldn't get himself to believe
in the existence of a god like that or

304
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,840
really any god, no, there wasn't any
rhyme or reason or purpose is just,

305
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:52,290
this is, this is my
lot, this really sucks.

306
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,910
And then when he was at his lowest point,
I remember driving back to Houston,

307
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:00,110
Texas for more chemo.

308
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,230
And my phone rang and I didn't
recognize the number and I said hello,

309
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:04,280
and this woman on the other line,

310
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,063
she said, uh,

311
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,570
there's a one person that we've
been able to identify on the planet.

312
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,820
Out of all the databases,
everything, there's one,

313
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,850
you are the ideal person in this 8
million person registry to donate for this

314
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:23,830
patient. A thing about
that is in the world,

315
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,730
you are a perfect match, will you do it?

316
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,030
And I was like, absolutely.

317
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,770
My wife and I were in the car together
and it was just tears, you know,

318
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,580
it's like, wow, that's amazing.

319
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,750
So April 20th and this
is important to remember,

320
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,610
April 20th was when I donated

321
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,080
and is there a pulling the cells out
of Janelle's body up in Wisconsin?

322
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,350
You know,

323
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,350
one of those little ivy bags full
of my stem cells down in Texas.

324
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:02,170
Jim's doctors were telling him,

325
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,190
your bone marrow transplant is scheduled
for April 23rd on April 23rd the

326
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:09,610
nurses, they come inside of your
room to celebrate your second birth.

327
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,850
And then I remember Dr Dror telling me,

328
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,950
are you ready to put your
boxing gloves on? Well,

329
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,490
when he was preparing me for was a death,

330
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,620
come to find out later on they pulled
my wife out of my room and they said,

331
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,620
we're going to give this to Anne
with all this medication. He's,

332
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,550
he could potentially receive this and
reject this violently and pass away.

333
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,510
Because remember they're
essentially replacing Jim's
immune system with somebody

334
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:39,300
else's, in this case, Janelle's.
And in a very real way,

335
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:43,980
the replacing that part of Jim that
determines who he is with someone who he

336
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:44,814
clearly isn't.

337
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,630
And so there's a real chance the
body will just short circuit.

338
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,990
So they give you this drug and the
nurses nicknamed shake and bake.

339
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,980
It's designed to basically wipe out
whatever is left of Jim's immune system,

340
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,480
his, his white blood cells,

341
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,170
but inside a Viv and your
body just starts convulsing.

342
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,580
And then they put Janelle's
cells in and they monitored me.

343
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,910
And over the next couple of weeks
to know cells entered Jim's body,

344
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:13,460
they get into his bone marrow and they
start producing new white blood cells as

345
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,150
per basically producing a
whole new immune system.

346
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,600
And eventually Jim is cancer free. I mean,

347
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,110
it's literally like new life, you know.

348
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,310
Now I will say this, some bells kind of
began to go off on my head a little bit.

349
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,240
Jim says before he even
got the transplant, um,

350
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,610
his doctor had come into
his room and told him,

351
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,010
you're going to be like a baby
inside your mother's womb,

352
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,780
literally being born again because
on April 23rd and once again,

353
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,010
this is their terminology.

354
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,800
There's someone else that's going
to be living on the inside of you.

355
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,470
And this new system of blood is gonna
be your life. Why is that interesting?

356
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,840
You know, April 23rd,

357
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,810
my new birthday is April 23rd and
my old birthday is April 20th. Uh,

358
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,050
my new birthday is on April 23rd that's
on the third day. And on the third day,

359
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,890
significant cause of the biblical
echo of Biblical Echo. Yeah.

360
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,620
I came back from whatever I was in
because of the only blood on planet earth

361
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:16,870
that could save me and
my disease. So, you know,

362
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,680
does this land on you
the way it sounds to me,

363
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:24,490
like it lands on you now or did you
go through a like, like what happened?

364
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:27,930
Like those words. Yeah,

365
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,850
those words in particularly
bells went off in my head. Right.

366
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,600
Does that mean that you now suddenly, um,

367
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,980
believe in God again or for the first
time or, I mean, I, it's process, right?

368
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:43,550
You follow and then I think the puzzle
pieces are kind of all swirling and

369
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:47,960
coming together, but everything
changed on that demarcating day,

370
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,200
April 23rd, all thanks.
Obviously to Janell.

371
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,500
And not long after they got each other's
information and [inaudible] each other

372
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:57,050
on Facebook, they hopped
on a, on a phone call.

373
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,260
So she gets on and I get on
and, but it's all kind of like,

374
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,450
hey, oh my gosh, this is crazy. Yeah.
I cannot believe this is nuts. Yeah.

375
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:10,020
This is so crazy. And then she
drops this on me. She said,

376
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:15,021
I went and got a tattoo of a jigsaw
puzzle piece on the very spot where they

377
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:19,920
stuck that IV in my arm to pull out the
new blood knowing that I was the missing

378
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:23,070
piece in someone else's life and without
me, that person wouldn't be alive.

379
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,580
And I said, do you? I was like, I was
thinking, do you have a ton of tattoos?

380
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,410
And she said, no, I have one.

381
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,230
Do you know what Christians and related
to be true, right? What is that?

382
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:39,231
Their savior rolled up and showed them
the very spot on his body where blood

383
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:41,700
came out so that they would believe,

384
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,140
so you're just going down this
road, you're, you're just,

385
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,040
you're driving like a hundred miles
an hour towards, towards this. For me,

386
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,080
it was like I was being
introduced to a person.

387
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,290
Um,

388
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,480
there was an experiential understanding

389
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,940
of [inaudible]

390
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,670
that which was going on behind the scenes
of this existence that was answering

391
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:06,810
my [inaudible]

392
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,860
prayer. The prayer is for, is the
periods closed. Are you there?

393
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,950
Yep. Are you there? God

394
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,190
Basically Jim Satya now and her
donation to him as almost more than just

395
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:24,120
allegory is like something close to
literal proof of the existence of God.

396
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,110
Like a very real, very
present sign. I told her too,

397
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,760
I told her that we need to meet. I said,
can I please bring you out to Dallas,

398
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:36,510
Texas? He said, I have to bring you
to Texas, which is my nightmare.

399
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,610
I'm just kidding. Absolutely.
I wanted to go right into it.

400
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,290
I remember her tone. She's
like, yeah, sure. Super excited.

401
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,560
So yes, I flew her to Dallas, Texas.

402
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,980
This says Michael Scam rags and it's
coming down. I actually recorded it.

403
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,400
So it might be, you've met sqirl
girl saved my life. Oh really?

404
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,430
In the video you see Jim sort of standing
at the bottom of this escalator in

405
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,400
Dallas, Fort Worth
airport. He's, you know,

406
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,520
looking pretty thin and pale and nervous.

407
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,760
And then the camera
turns and there's Janell

408
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,050
coming down the escalator

409
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:26,730
and the hug, his kids come up,

410
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,833
his wife.

411
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,950
Okay, so, so, so now you'd go home.
We go to his, his home. Right.

412
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:44,210
And he lives in a very big
house outside of Dallas.

413
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,900
They had dinner with the
family and then, you know,

414
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,860
once everybody else was kind
of heading off to bed, um,

415
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,580
Jim and Chanel started to talk

416
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,020
and, uh, I think if I remember correctly,

417
00:25:55,021 --> 00:26:00,021
we were just outside by the pool and
just talking and figuring out who each

418
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:03,630
other was and you know, I was
like, so, you know, magician,

419
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,740
what, what, what is that? And uh,

420
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,500
he started telling me about what kind
of magician he really is and he is a

421
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,570
Christian magician.

422
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,080
I'm sure that in her mind
she's thinking, oh my gosh,

423
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,200
I just saved a Christian
magician from Texas life

424
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,290
and jokes on me. Isn't
that wonderful? You know,

425
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,180
when we come back, Jenelle becomes
Jim's greatest magic trick,

426
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,253
so don't go away.

I'm former US attorney Preet Bharara.

433
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,400
Since I was fired by
Donald Trump last spring.

434
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,940
I've had time for a lot of new things
like hosting a special evening at the

435
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:17,290
Skirball center on Monday, December 11th
it's a live taping of my new podcast.

439
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,030
okay, we're back. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and uh,

440
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,000
okay, let's return to a story
from Soren Wheeler. So Soren,

441
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:46,580
you left us in the backyard. They
were about to talk, right? Yup.

442
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,330
Sitting in Jim's backyard by the pool
and he's basically telling her his whole

443
00:27:50,331 --> 00:27:55,010
story about his sort of loss of faith and
the cancer and how she saved his life.

444
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,190
And then he tells her that
right after she saved him,

445
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,650
he started doing the magic show again.

446
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,280
That show that he used to do
with Tennyson is called the nays.

447
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,240
My name is Jim Monroe. This is the maze.

448
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,670
So we actually get to see Jim show
and I have to say he's a pro. It's a,

449
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:20,650
it's an impressive production.
He gets big venues here,

450
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,120
ready to have some fun tonight,
usually a thousand people or so.

451
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:29,121
There's crazy laser light show stuff
and he does these really complicated

452
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:33,240
illusions that are sort of half
Penn and teller, half David Blaine

453
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:39,890
sample taking a random phone number out
of the phone book where seven Zeros ends

454
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,070
up being someone in the audience and
then their phone will end up like hidden

455
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:46,700
somewhere, something like
that. And they're very good.

456
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,570
So Jim is telling Jenelle about
all these tricks, but then he says,

457
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,320
second half of the show is about us.

458
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,630
[inaudible] he explains it,
the magic show at this point.

459
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,160
And he tells people they can leave if
they want to and he starts to talk openly,

460
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,080
professionally to the audience.

461
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,910
Well, I quickly found
out that I had cancer

462
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,410
in very personal terms
about what happened to them.

463
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,320
Well my wife and I raced down
to MD Anderson Cancer Center

464
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,440
in a certain point he shows a video

465
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,700
stuff started cause I changed

466
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,770
anything in there. He's in
the hospital [inaudible]

467
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,970
throwing up into a bucket
and he's Pale, thin,

468
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,480
huge circles under his eyes.

469
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,340
And then he explains it right when he
was on the edge of death at his lowest

470
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:58,600
point, this, this thing
happened, a miracle happened.

471
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,710
There is one person just

472
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,680
when his blood was literally
poisoning his own body,

473
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,040
somebody substituted their blood on
his behalf so he could be born again.

474
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,860
Yes,

475
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,340
on your behalf that you can live again.

476
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,250
Read days after his birthday.

477
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,390
The third day I came back from the
dead is the only global appointment.

478
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,640
They're considered legacies.

479
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,590
So there's a whole three days thing there,

480
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,730
which is a story of Easter and
the rebirth. It's just, let's see,

481
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,000
I mean he sees this as like
definitive proof that there's a god

482
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,640
I didn't either.

483
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,960
The statistical anomaly that continues
to propagate this false ideology about

484
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:42,190
supernaturalism and miracle results.

485
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,080
I even got to the testicle
anomaly that the soul, the wild,

486
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,170
that's like being bitten by a shark and
struck by lightning at the same time

487
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:50,560
twice in this lifetime.

488
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,510
Or you might have to believe what I
believe is true and that is there is a

489
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:57,840
bigger one on mine, the
scenes and his name is Jesus.

490
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,530
Mm.

491
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:07,090
So yes, this is all being
thrown at me. And is he,

492
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,740
is he saying all this to
you by the pool? Is it all,

493
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,700
it all comes tumbling out.
Yeah. Yeah. And how are you,

494
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:21,030
how are you feeling inside stranger
and stranger going down the wormhole?

495
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:23,794
Because

496
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,850
I am an atheist in the sense that I don't,

497
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,950
I don't believe in the
tenants of Christianity.

498
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,730
I don't believe really in the tenants
of any established religion I've ever

499
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:37,800
seen. Honestly.

500
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:42,150
I just think that once things are
labeled and you're pigeonholed and the

501
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:47,151
exclusivity of really any religion is
this the cause for a lot of problems

502
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,620
throughout history.

503
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,990
But faith can be beautiful and there's
definitely parts of me and there's

504
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:59,820
moments in my life that boy praying and
really feeling like that was going out

505
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:03,060
to somebody would feel
great, but I just can't,

506
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,650
they just can't do it.

507
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,640
So at that moment he's
telling me this and yeah.

508
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,860
And he's like, well, you know,

509
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,890
you're here in Texas for this weekend
and would you be willing to come on stage

510
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:24,650
for one of my shows so
I can introduce you?

511
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,430
And of course I said yes. And of course,

512
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,480
of course she said yes. Yeah, of course.

513
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:37,780
I've always kind of looked at our
story as something bigger than what he

514
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:43,100
believes. What? I don't believe it's
bigger. It's capital B. Underlined,

515
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,570
bold. It's big.

516
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,580
Partly because Jim at every show he has
the bone marrow registry people right

517
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,380
there ready to sign fold.

518
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,650
And because of the show they
just saw he can get in hundreds.

519
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,390
Um, I know that dozens of people
have gone on to be matches. Oh.

520
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,910
So this was truly the culmination of,

521
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,080
from the moment I signed
up to be on that registry,

522
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:12,290
this felt like the zenith
of this entire thing.

523
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,320
Mm.

524
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,520
So next night at Texas
Christian University,

525
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,930
packed house Chanel's in the
audience. I was in like the front row

526
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,790
and during the second part of the show,
when Jim goes through the rebirth part,

527
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,260
he stops and he says, guess what?
Everyone that person who saved my life,

528
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,483
she's here.

529
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,490
Okay. He has me walk up on stage.

530
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,910
Proud wins wild.

531
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,880
It's first time in my life
I got a standing ovation

532
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,020
because your [inaudible]. That's why
the magical is crazy. It's because, yes,

533
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,513
yeah.

534
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,740
All of these kids in the audience who are
all pretty much my age as well at that

535
00:33:55,741 --> 00:34:00,741
point are seeing my being onstage as
the quite possibly the biggest proof

536
00:34:04,231 --> 00:34:08,190
they've ever had. That there is a god,

537
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,180
will you will you know? Was
there any part of you that said,

538
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,750
I shouldn't be here? Are you all,

539
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,910
yeah, there was a part of me that felt

540
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,540
a little bit of an imposter,

541
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,940
but for Janelia she says that feeling
was outweighed just by the number of

542
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:31,941
people that were lining up at the bone
marrow donation table and so the next

543
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:35,520
time she had a chance she did it again

544
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,480
and again and again.

545
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,760
She's now appeared at the end of the
show around a dozen times all around the

546
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:53,761
country playing the role of Jim's
personal savior and she says,

547
00:34:54,731 --> 00:34:56,740
the more time she did it,
the more that feeling,

548
00:34:56,741 --> 00:35:01,450
that sort of fraud feeling kept popping
up each time a little bit louder.

549
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,700
Yeah. There's parts of me,

550
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:07,240
there's little fibers in my
being better like wow, if,

551
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,470
if this is a sign, if there
is a god, I'm a real jerk.

552
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,950
This is such a beautiful and really
literal story being told to me about like,

553
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:21,640
hey, you know maybe there is a god.

554
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:26,170
She said she started to feel that like
if she's both perpetuating that story and

555
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,320
refusing it, there's
special place in hell for me

556
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,930
and this is why Janell got in touch with
us because she wanted us to help her

557
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:39,931
figure out a way to tell a story that
led her way of seeing the world into the

558
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:46,320
room. Okay. Are you guys,
is everyone there? Hi Jim.

559
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:49,740
Can you hear us? Yeah, I can hear
you guys. Jenelle can hear me. I can.

560
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,800
How are you? So our producer let,

561
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,310
if Nasser actually started talking to
Jenelle about what exactly she wanted to

562
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:58,740
do and they decided that we
should just all get in the studio,

563
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,910
Jim and her and all of us and see
if we could hash it out. Okay.

564
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:07,380
I guess like Jenelle do you want to just
kind of talk through what we've been

565
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:08,020
thinking?

566
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:12,680
Oh sure. I can try and if you want
to help me, lot TIF sir. Um, uh,

567
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,200
essentially lot defy and I have been
talking about what would be the best way

568
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:22,780
for me to kind of tell my
side of the story. Um, yeah,

569
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:28,050
my side of our story so to speak
without so much of the religious stuff.

570
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,830
Yeah. So when are you
guys gonna do that? Hmm,

571
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,360
maybe I missed the point. I'm sorry.

572
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,910
So do you say we as in like
we are going to [inaudible]

573
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,240
do you have version of that? Well I
thought you could help me. Oh cool.

574
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,790
Well I have no problem kind of just

575
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,910
cause you are so not only a magician
with magic things but also with words

576
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,070
[inaudible] so maybe if we could,
if you could help me. So yeah,

577
00:36:58,071 --> 00:36:58,904
totally.

578
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,210
That's, that's so interesting. My
mind begins to spin and I have a,

579
00:37:02,211 --> 00:37:05,690
so at first we suggested maybe Jenelle
could come out at the end of one of Jim

580
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:08,930
shows and just read a statement or
something. And Jim said, you know,

581
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,560
that's probably not gonna work. As you
guys know in this world, there's, I mean,

582
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:17,420
audiences come based upon how things
are marketed and booked. And Jim said,

583
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,080
you know, he has to worry about sort of
as a business, the expectations of his,

584
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,480
of his sponsors and even
the audience who are,

585
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,840
who are looking for a certain thing like
a producer. Cause I'm, I'm totally up.

586
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,430
So we're like, yeah, okay, fair enough.

587
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,390
Maybe we could be like a Q and a
after the show or something like that.

588
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:35,150
I don't know. I'd have to really like
process it, but I'm totally open to it.

589
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,290
I would always love to
help. Um, Jenelle fig,

590
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,680
I mean help her put it all together
and like, I think though that,

591
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,990
so eventually we landed on a plan. Jim
was going to be doing his show up in St,

592
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:50,570
cloud, Minnesota and we decided,

593
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:54,500
well we could just do a show with
him and Jenelle the next night.

594
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,280
So along with producers, Latif Nasser in
any McKeown, we headed up to St. Cloud,

595
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:03,300
met up with Janell and that night
we went to all go see Jim's show.

596
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,450
It's pretty big venue. There was
probably like a thousand people.

597
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,260
They're all college students and
of course because Juno was there,

598
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,380
uh right after he did the sort
of personal journey back to God.

599
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,140
She's here too. [inaudible]

600
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,161
a bit hard to hear,

601
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:26,880
but there was literally like a shutter
of energy that went through the crowd at

602
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:27,470
that moment.

603
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,880
Ladies and gentleman, welcome to this day.

604
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,620
Just as General Jenny come on up here too.

605
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,743
[inaudible]

606
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,020
so yeah,

607
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,140
you're the much better speaker than me.

608
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,530
What I can say is I encourage
all of you taking center.

609
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,750
So Janell just pointed out
that the national bone marrow
registry would be there

610
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:04,970
that night and she encouraged
everybody to, you know,

611
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,860
sign up and have a chance to save
a life and and do something good.

612
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,560
So please do that or at least consider it.

613
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,160
Then Jim had her show the whole
audience or puzzle piece. Tattoo

614
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,030
[inaudible] only one

615
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,813
[inaudible] [inaudible]

616
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,940
and once Janell had
stepped back off the stage,

617
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,250
before we close, I wanted to
know if I can pray for you.

618
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,980
Do you guys still pray in Minnesota?

619
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,950
All right, so would you
mind, I told you to leave.

620
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,320
I want you to pray this prayer with
me. Just say this in your home.

621
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,263
So Lord Jesus,

622
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,030
two nights I choose to turn
and start living for myself,

623
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,600
my own version of my own
story and I want to trust you.

624
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,230
I don't have all the
answers, but I know you do.

625
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,360
And tonight and by faith I choose to
follow you. Thank you for loving ladies.

626
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,290
Thank you.

627
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,240
In the midst of all of this randomness
that I experienced coming after me for

628
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:16,730
being jealous, I love him too.

629
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,380
In Jesus mighty name. Amen. And Amen.

630
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,570
And then just before
everybody stepped out,

631
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,610
awesome. This is very good. I'm
going to be here another night.

632
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,890
I'm going to appear that we're
going to be here tomorrow.

633
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,090
Have you guys heard the [inaudible]?

634
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,250
That was about three
people that shout it out.

635
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,770
They're in the audience. I'm just going
to sit. I'm not going to point them out,

636
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,743
but in the audio,

637
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,713
nobody cared.

638
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,020
I'm ready. Man is going to be
holding this forum. [inaudible] now,

639
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,090
Jen is going to touch your side of the
story of what happens is we heard through

640
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,340
this process. All right. All right,

641
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,430
so after the show we actually got a
chance to talk to some of the people from

642
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,160
the audience.

643
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,980
Then hearing the whole three
days, I'm like, oh my God.

644
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,020
That's wow. Oh my gosh. I can't
believe that she was actually here,

645
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,670
here in their rank about it.

646
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:16,880
I would've been so shocked to
sit right next to her. Yeah,

647
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,250
pretty much everybody was totally floored
by actually getting to see Janell in

648
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:24,980
person and they all seem to take her
story the way Jim does a visual example,

649
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,320
put a face to this whole thing. So
many things fell in mind where, yeah,

650
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,800
you just have to believe
in my opinion. Yeah,

651
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,030
yeah, yeah. So

652
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,990
[inaudible] the next night.
Good evening, everyone. Welcome.

653
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,890
My name is mark spring, winter night.
Much less fanfare in a much smaller room,

654
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,120
like maybe a hundred people there are.

655
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:48,320
So with the help of the religious
studies program at St, Cloud University,

656
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,730
hear me okay? Yes, here I am. Oh my
God, we did Janelle's thing. All right.

657
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:53,780
So I'm Robert [inaudible].

658
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,590
I am one of the cohost of the public
radio program cause they called radio lab.

659
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,940
I want to introduce also,

660
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:02,590
sorry wheeler who is our managing
editor who's gonna at Sam.

661
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,590
He's going to be adding his
2 cents from times nine.

662
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,490
We're a very democratic show and like
nobody controls anything and everybody

663
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,770
pitches in so, so he will to, uh,

664
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,900
and I want to begin by
just telling you a story.

665
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,210
So we brought Jenelle up
on stage, but you know,

666
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:17,270
could you just come up here and sit,
I guess, might as well sit here.

667
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,430
We told them her whole story of, you know,

668
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,610
donating and then waiting a
year to find out, you know,

669
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,800
who Jim really was talk,

670
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:29,320
I had no idea that when
we brought Jim onstage,

671
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,940
I saw Jim the years up,
he talked about, you know,

672
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,940
his whole process of recovery.
Trying to get your bearings.

673
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:37,130
You talked about how
grateful and thankful he was.

674
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,120
And then we turned back to Janelle. Me,

675
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,240
let's make this a little
more complicated. Sorry.

676
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:46,241
Could you just run the a m I asked you
like how you felt in that first round and

677
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,000
you, this is what you
told me in the interview,

678
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,300
there was a part of me that felt
a little bit of an impostor.

679
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,810
Well, no, why, why would you use
the word imposture? What is that?

680
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,890
Why did you choose that word?

681
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,420
So that's how we should start getting
into the meat and potatoes of my thoughts.

682
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,310
I think so, yeah.

683
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,960
Part of me is, um,

684
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and at that time especially
thought that I'm up here,

685
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:19,820
um,

686
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,820
again as this pretty hard and fast proof
or a very compelling narrative for a

687
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:31,691
lot of people and their faith that
I don't particularly share at all.

688
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:38,200
Okay. Can I ask a
question? Yeah. Um, but I,

689
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,200
I knowing that you knew
what at that point,

690
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:47,630
cause we talked about that and I was,
I was very concerned knowing that you,

691
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:51,170
you know, didn't agree with
what I believe to be true, that,

692
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,570
that you would feel like
you were in that spot.

693
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,170
Okay.

694
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:59,070
That's why I asked you. Oh, of
course. And I could've declined. Yeah.

695
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,181
But at the same time,

696
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:03,000
it doesn't make anything different than
the fact that it's still what it is,

697
00:44:03,001 --> 00:44:04,230
you know? Exactly.

698
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,200
I would have done it regardless
of whatever it was. Yeah.

699
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:14,030
If your whole theme of your show was
how great the Dallas cowboys were and it

700
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:18,350
got everybody to join the bone marrow
registry, I would have got up there,

701
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,030
cowboys hat. Honestly, Jim,
every time I see your show,

702
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,970
even though I don't it, you know,

703
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,210
adhere to the religious tenants of it,

704
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,430
I still get that feeling and everybody,

705
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,700
all my family, all my friends,
whatever their religious,

706
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,120
even my Muslim friends that
I've told this story get,

707
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,460
do you know that feeling?

708
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,960
And you know what that feeling is,

709
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,000
is a little intangible.

710
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:52,800
But I think it's something
even a little bigger than

711
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,440
that. Sounds so crappy
to say bigger than Jesus.

712
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,910
That's really blasting miss, but
I can't think of a better way.

713
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,330
What did he, what did you mean?
Can you explain what that means?

714
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,990
Well, you know, um, that

715
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,550
there is good in this universe and
there is good in everybody and it is

716
00:45:15,551 --> 00:45:16,930
regardless of

717
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:23,130
the goodness is at the top of the list
of you and everything else is follows

718
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:27,570
your religion and your race and where
you were born and your favorite pizza,

719
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:30,990
toppings and all of that.
But at the very top is

720
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,140
good with the capital
junior. It's underlined too.

721
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,240
All Right Jim,

722
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,310
in your show you have a
rather gorgeous take on,

723
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,960
on moral relativism. You have
a, a string of bonds, um,

724
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,430
that this idea that being good and doing
no harm and living as ethically as,

725
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:55,570
you know, how is
satisfying to some people,

726
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,970
but can you review it
isn't really enough. Um,

727
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:03,320
oh yeah. This is where we,
I mean obviously there's
some disagreement here. Um,

728
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,420
I think that there is good
and I think that there is evil

729
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,040
in this world and I think that people
in and of their own left to their own

730
00:46:15,921 --> 00:46:18,830
vices left on devices. I think
that they struggle with being good.

731
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:23,870
I think that even on our best
day, I think that we fall short.

732
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:29,140
And so in hearing her account, you just
say, you just saying thinking what?

733
00:46:29,141 --> 00:46:30,910
That, that, that she's not

734
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:33,120
[inaudible]

735
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,990
what is, what if, where does she fall?
She, where does this idea lose you?

736
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,110
I don't, I mean, it doesn't lose me. I
think it's phenomenally good. It's not,

737
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,260
not acknowledging as good. I just think
that it's for it, for the Christian.

738
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,250
It's not about being good or
bad. I think, what is it about,

739
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:53,990
I think it's about, uh, I think it's
about having a relationship with God.

740
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,730
Does that make sense?

741
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,400
That last sentence? I guess it makes
sense at that point, Jim, you know,

742
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,950
he made it clear that he definitely wasn't
condemning Janell because she didn't

743
00:47:02,951 --> 00:47:07,090
have a relationship with God. But then
we took it sort of different approach.

744
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:10,750
We started talking about the
unlikeliness of this whole story,

745
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:14,020
which is one of the things that Jim talks
about in his show and so at that point

746
00:47:14,021 --> 00:47:17,310
I decided I should jump in
and I, I say this and I,

747
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,270
I really say this only because it is our
job as a show that when we hear a story

748
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:23,890
like this, we dig in,

749
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,600
we investigate and we do that from
a frame that really focused on math,

750
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,920
facts, science

751
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,400
and couple of things happen to you
if you happen to be in my position,

752
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:38,080
you run across stuff like this and I'll
just read from the BIA match website.

753
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,730
A patient's likelihood of finding a
match donor on be the match registry is

754
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:47,680
estimated to be between 66 and 97% the
chances that you'll find a 10 to 10 match

755
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:53,010
in the way that Jim and Jenelle were 10
to minute 10 matches is around 50% oh

756
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,140
wait a second year, which I,
that doesn't make sense to do it.

757
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:00,790
Well it doesn't because a million
people, he, she was the one, yeah.

758
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:04,390
Let me say that this does not actually
contradict with Jim and Janelle's

759
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:08,800
experience of it for, for that to
happen to Jim, it is truly staggering.

760
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:11,950
It is truly, it could be one
in a trillion. And you know,

761
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:13,980
like the way winning a
lottery has one in a trillion.

762
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,300
That how can it be both one in the can.

763
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:20,200
Because what happens is if you back up
away from the individual and ask not what

764
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:21,430
are the chances, that's
what happened to Jen,

765
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,910
but what are the chances that this
would happen to someone somewhere?

766
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:25,803
It's like there's this,

767
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:29,230
there's a story about if you're golfing
and you hit a golf ball and it goes

768
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:30,280
however many hundreds of yards.

769
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:31,510
I don't play golf so I
don't know how far they go,

770
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:35,290
but it lands on a blade of grass
and that blade of grass says,

771
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,873
why me?

772
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:43,090
Why would this golf ball crush me
like this? Which is a valid point.

773
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,830
Uh, I would feel that too. Uh,

774
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:49,000
but that ball was going to land
on some weight of grass. So you,

775
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,720
it doesn't like there the
why me is still a true thing.

776
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,580
It is a true experience in which there
is a, there is still this difference.

777
00:48:57,581 --> 00:48:58,760
I think, um,

778
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:03,870
the ball can't point to anything greater
no than the argument alerts behind this

779
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:08,380
is uh, that these things happen
and it is just chance two places.

780
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:11,030
The random view accrediting, how
are you going to be able to that,

781
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,880
that you were randomly there and
you were randomly [inaudible]

782
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,450
chosen isn't the bird you were it
that the ball's mercy landed on you.

783
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,350
But I'm not, I also am not coming
at it from just that angle.

784
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,990
I wonder if it was just
the bone marrow transplant.

785
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:28,420
If it would be people
get that all the time.

786
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:33,421
I think perhaps the other bits and pieces
of the puzzle maybe help shadow it in,

787
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:38,250
you know, a little bit for me. Um, and
so I don't know if it's me. It's a,

788
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:42,040
it's a multilayered cake. I
thought you really don't like this

789
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:47,090
idea of like in this science version
there is no design and there is no first

790
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:53,370
cause except the first random event
that sets the thing in motion. Right.

791
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,530
Do you do both?

792
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,070
Could you either of you live with that
version of what just happened to you?

793
00:49:59,550 --> 00:49:59,910
[inaudible]

794
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:00,211
yeah.

795
00:50:00,211 --> 00:50:04,290
Well that's perfect cause it's exactly
what you talk about in your show with

796
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,720
the, all the different cards

797
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,880
Janelle's referring to a thing in gym
show where he talks about how unlikely any

798
00:50:10,881 --> 00:50:13,340
particular order of cards in a deck is.

799
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:18,170
And the idea of a particular set of cards
being dealt in a particular way is 52

800
00:50:18,171 --> 00:50:21,830
factorial, which is pretty much
impossible. It is impossible.

801
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:27,050
It's an impossible number you could
statistically, right, right. But yet you,

802
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,970
the cards and they happen right there.

803
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:33,971
So this really gets into
just the different viewpoints
on the proverbial deck of

804
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:41,150
cards and who's dealing them.
Is it in a particular fashion?

805
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:42,780
And I think that's, you know,

806
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:47,850
what Jim believes is that there is
a proverbial dealer and I don't,

807
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:50,883
I guess,

808
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,380
and you agree that that's
pretty much the difference.

809
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:58,030
Yeah. I mean, having
given thought to that, um,

810
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,160
I believe that, that there
was some sort of, you know,

811
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,370
mind personality [inaudible]

812
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,550
so the, I believe part is where you
is, where you stand. It is. Absolutely.

813
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,900
Yeah. Absolutely it is.

814
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:15,901
It's faith and [inaudible]
your his savior I guess.

815
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:21,540
And we saved his life. But
in some way you don't, you,

816
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:25,150
you haven't. I don't. How do
you worry about this at all?

817
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:28,890
Yeah, absolutely. And even
right now on this stage,

818
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,460
there's a part of me that in front of all
of you that I'm sure a lot of you were

819
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:36,580
at the show last night. There
was a part of me that is

820
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,200
afraid of disappointing that I don't
share what you believe to be true.

821
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:46,570
I mean, you're an entire experience,

822
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,990
pretty much points the Arrow that like,

823
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,930
I'm like an alliteration
of Jesus and your story.

824
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:56,290
And that's really difficult to reconcile
as someone who doesn't have faith.

825
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:01,350
And it makes me sad sometimes because I
think it would be a lot easier if I just

826
00:52:01,481 --> 00:52:03,130
believed exactly what you believed.

827
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:08,131
And I think that I always am very
afraid of letting that be known.

828
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,550
Like I'm super like clammy right now,

829
00:52:12,551 --> 00:52:15,730
just saying it in front
of this many people. Um,

830
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:21,330
I just feel like people would see
your story and it's so tremendously

831
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,190
compelling. It's unbelievable.

832
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:29,730
And then see that that last piece of this
little puzzle literally doesn't fit at

833
00:52:32,171 --> 00:52:32,870
all.

834
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:36,620
I mean, I, I, it's not like I haven't,
I haven't thought about that either. Um,

835
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:41,621
and how you might feel and I empathize
and I don't know how to answer that.

836
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,900
Yeah. You know, I, I just, I just
want to give you a hug, but yeah,

837
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,750
there's an unconditionality to
how I feel about you that I just,

838
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,410
you can do no wrong in my eyes. Yeah.

839
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,321
Here's the, for you,

840
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:58,110
the hardest thing I was just trying to
think of how difficult this must be.

841
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,650
You have been, say your life has
been saved by her [inaudible].

842
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,070
She is in effect your savior.

843
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,300
And yet your belief is that
unless she accepts Jesus,

844
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:13,450
that in some sense she's outside of
grace. And you know, I don't know.

845
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,060
I don't know what you believe
about Hell and heaven,

846
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,440
but that she might be punished.

847
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:19,950
So what do you do about this weird
contradiction? She's insisting, nope,

848
00:53:19,951 --> 00:53:24,790
not for me. Then you says, oh, this
is the way it is, and oh my gosh,

849
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:26,190
it's was it, is it hard

850
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,190
for you? No, not at all. Okay.

851
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,220
I'll tell you why. Because
it's not my place to do that.

852
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,390
I'm very sorry to everyone
who listens to this,

853
00:53:35,391 --> 00:53:39,890
whoever feels like they got judged by
Christian cause it's never their place to

854
00:53:39,891 --> 00:53:43,400
do that. And this is where I think most
of the times and everybody listened.

855
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,360
This podcast is placed as kind of
positioned or pigeonholed Christians.

856
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:52,990
And what they don't understand is that
I'm not commanded to do anything but to

857
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:59,940
love and to start conversations.
Right? I'm not the one, I'm the,

858
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:04,100
I'm not the, I'm not the one who was
sent into the world to judge. All right?

859
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:08,570
But what I, so, so putting
it like that, I know,

860
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,250
I know where you want to go with this.

861
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,140
No, I'm just, this is not
actually an honest question.

862
00:54:12,141 --> 00:54:16,100
You have to love the judge that may
not love the woman who saved your life.

863
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,830
That's hard I think yet. But,

864
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:23,260
but at the same time, it's, uh, that's,

865
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,320
that's not what I'm s that's
not, that's not my place.

866
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,091
I had to say,

867
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:32,091
I think we were sort of expecting that
maybe there would be a sharper edge to

868
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:36,600
the differences between Jim
and Janell. But to be honest,

869
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:40,950
their conversation that night and,
and their stories started to feel like

870
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:46,490
almost an allegory for how to move through
the world and hold your differences

871
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,120
but still be one.

872
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:53,010
Let me just finish this way. Do you
have a sense between the two of you? Um,

873
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:56,660
because I mean obviously you,
you stay very, very good friends.

874
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:57,494
I mean that's obvious.

875
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:03,100
Is there some something that either of
you can say that explains why you can

876
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,600
dignify ugly but emphatically disagree
and still stake such extraordinary close

877
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:13,723
touch?

878
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:19,450
I think the idea of humility
and as Jim might even say,

879
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,384
grace

880
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:21,723
is

881
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:26,200
absolutely essential no
matter your tenants of belief.

882
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:31,270
And that's really what's going
to get you through conflict.

883
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,010
So yeah.

884
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,940
And is it because you're in this big
ocean of the world and the two of you or

885
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:41,380
just little little dots in it and
so whatever you think is still,

886
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:45,610
you're in the big ocean and there you
are together. Is that the, I think maybe.

887
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:49,660
Yeah. Yeah. And do you
ever have a bigness thing?

888
00:55:49,661 --> 00:55:53,740
Do you feel small? Do I feel small? Yeah.

889
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:59,990
I feel tiny humility at it's root word
is it comes from the root as Hump Humus,

890
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,800
which means dirt. Huh?

891
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,380
So when you become
humble, you become there.

892
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,070
And however I can see it now, I can
keep going. I can keep going. You know,

893
00:56:13,071 --> 00:56:15,590
God does with third is he creates
things, but I won't go there.

894
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,080
But you become dirt.

895
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,270
And, um, and I think,

896
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:25,390
I think where we get hung up
is that we want to be right.

897
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,320
And that hasn't been
brought into the this yet.

898
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,380
You want to be right and right and wrong
are the words right and wrong are our

899
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,850
dead, I think in relationship or deadly
words. I think that saying I'm right,

900
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:44,200
you're wrong. Um, is, is, it's
not good for relationships.

901
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:46,300
I think it's like, let's
find, let's find where we,

902
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,310
have you ever said you are right
or you're wrong to her? No.

903
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:54,760
No one said to him either. I'd
never left a nice place to land.

904
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,103
I think so.

905
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,030
I think we're done. Now. That
doesn't mean we're done. Done.

906
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,990
That means that I'm going to let
these two people introduce the person

907
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,630
at the end of the show. We had the bone
marrow registry people there and uh,

908
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,140
encouraged people sign up and quite
a few dead, I think maybe 20 or so,

909
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,580
but that was pretty much
nothing compared to what gym.

910
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,820
Got It. At the end of this show,
150 people, wait, say that again.

911
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:31,420
Just like 150 people signing up
right now. Did you count them?

912
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,270
That's our producer Andy
McEwens at least that.

913
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,380
Is this bigger than normal
or I always like this.

914
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,500
This is a little bigger than
normal, I think anytime,

915
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,690
but I'm actually in the show.
It's a little bit better.

916
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,640
So I've been told and what is it? How
are you feeling when you watch this?

917
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,720
It's really overwhelming. Like, yeah,
it kind of makes me want to cry. Yeah.

918
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,410
Yeah. I mean without you,
this wouldn't happen,

919
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:05,020
right? It's almost too big to think of

920
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,103
[inaudible] [inaudible]

921
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:47,660
[inaudible]

922
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,370
thank you, sir. Sure, no problem.

923
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:53,300

926
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:02,840

registries and says the one that Jim and

927
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,290
Jenelle were connected to
is called be the match.
