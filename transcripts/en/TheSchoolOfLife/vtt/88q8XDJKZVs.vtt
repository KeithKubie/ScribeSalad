00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.279
They happen in the privacy of our minds, pretty
much everywhere.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.280
At the pool, the conference, the aisles of
a supermarket.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.640
The dynamic is always the same. Very little
knowledge, indeed complete ignorance combined

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.750
with a deep sense of knowing them absolutely
and of being entirely certain they would if

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.880
only circumstances allowed, be the one.
It's been going on since early adolescence

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.690
at least, this madness.
And even now when someone should know better,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.789
it happens.
These crushes, they show off our capacity

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.140
for knowing how to make the most of the smallest
details.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.140
A wrist, a neck, an ankle, a pair of jeans
worn a certain way.

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.899
They instantly become whole people with whom
we can imagine years of a life together, full

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.089
of profound mutual sympathy, tenderness and
laughter.

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.150
This blessed person will, we know, understand
us

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.119
and all the secret complex, ignored parts
of us.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.920
This capacity we have for elaborating a whole
personality from a few small details, it's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.140
there when we look at sketches.
This isn't someone who has no nostrils, eight

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.750
strands of hair and no eye lashes.
It's a beautiful creature we feel we understand

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.799
at once.
The cynics say, it's madness, this filling

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.240
in of the gaps.
We're just projecting wild wreckless fantasies...

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.420
but that's too sweeping.
We're probably right to be delighted. It's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.820
just not the whole story.
Perhaps that remarkably thin wrist with the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.600
leather band around it really does belong
to someone who is skeptical, alternative,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.909
delicate, intelligent, wry.
The error of the crush is to go beyond that

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.969
insight, to think this could ever be the whole
truth about a human being.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.750
Knocked off course by the crushes power, we
forget one central inviolable fact of human

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.959
nature.
That everyone is crazy and trouble to be around.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.319
Everyone has something substantially wrong
with them.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.430
Everyone is extremely hard to live with.
You can't know what, from an ankle or a wrist

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.060
but it'll be something.
Time will reveal it sure enough...

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.030
because life has messed all of us up,
because we all grew up inadequately parented

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.590
and have all ended up terrified and anxious
pretty much the whole time.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.370
That said, we shouldn't give up on having
crushes at any age.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.640
We just shouldn't believe in what they appear
to promise anymore.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.380
Of we haven't glimpsed complete perfection.
It's just a pretty nice side or two

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.060
coming to the fore.
