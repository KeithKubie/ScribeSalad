00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.630
- [Presenter] Let's talk a little bit

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.910
about selective incorporation.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.470
You are already likely
familiar that the first

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.640
10 amendments of the
United States Constitution

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.040
are the Bill of Rights.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.000
Bill of Rights.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.170
And especially the first eight of these

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.690
are all about protecting
individuals rights.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.890
So you have those rights.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.150
But then there's a question.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.890
To what degree are these rights protected

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.160
against state laws?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.950
This became a little bit
clearer once the 14th Amendment

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.830
came along and just to remind ourselves

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.760
here's section one of the 14th Amendment.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.010
We really want to zero is
on the due process clause,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.817
which says, "nor shall any
state deprive any person

00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:48.817
"of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law."

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.930
Now, some have argued
for total incorporation

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.210
that says the 14th
Amendment's making it clear

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.680
that the state cannot
infringe on these rights.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.870
But what has happened,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.880
especially in the United
States Supreme Court,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.310
is that on various decisions,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.830
maybe this was something
involving the 5th Amendment,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.330
they've ruled that the rights
described by that amendment

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.020
can't be limited by a state law.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.290
So they would have
selectively incorporated

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.450
the 5th Amendment from the Bill of Rights

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.470
and decision on what the
state can and cannot do,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.310
and their justification
there's a due process clause

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.170
of the 14th Amendment.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.170
And to make that a
little bit more tangible

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.740
we can look at some
relatively recent cases.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.160
In 2008 you have the case

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.920
District of Columbia versus Heller.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.260
This is a really interesting
case around the 2nd Amendment.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.750
The District of Columbia,
Washington, D.C.,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.450
had a law that banned hand guns.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.170
So one of the residents
challenges that hand gun ban

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.920
and it goes all the way to the
United States Supreme Court.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.950
And in the decision on District
of Columbia versus Heller

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.320
the United States Supreme Court says that

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.500
the District of Columbia cannot pass a law

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.710
that violates Heller's 2nd Amendment right

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.030
because of the due process
clause of the 14th Amendment.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.380
But that still left a
little bit of an opening.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.660
You fast forward and in
2010 you have another

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.690
similar case go to the Supreme Court.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.910
This is McDonald versus Chicago.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.280
Chicago had a similar hand gun ban,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.530
and McDonald was a resident of Chicago.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.100
The government in
Chicago argued that okay,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.590
the District of Columbia versus Heller

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.350
does not apply to us because
that was a federal district

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.520
and it would not apply to
something that is part of a state.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.320
Well, the Supreme Court
disagreed with Chicago

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.610
and took the side of McDonald.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.760
They selectively incorporated

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.070
using the 14th Amendment
as their justification.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.390
They said look, the state cannot deprive

00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:46.120
any person of their liberties.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.710
So they selectively
incorporated the 2nd Amendment

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.390
into that decision and made it very clear

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.360
that a state cannot pass
a law that infringes

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.330
on people's 2nd Amendment rights.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.940
So big picture, selective incorporation,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.710
it's the doctrine where judicial decisions

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.160
incorporate rights from the Bill of Rights

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.880
to limit laws from
states that are perceived

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.800
to infringe on those rights,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.400
and the justification comes
from the 14th Amendment.
