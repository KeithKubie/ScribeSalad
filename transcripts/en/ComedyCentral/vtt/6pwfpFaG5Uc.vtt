00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.536
Former acting attorney general
Sally Yates testified

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.038
before Congress today

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.539
regarding ousted
national security advisor

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:08.775
Michael Flynn's alleged ties
to Russia.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.910
Flynn resigned less than a month
into his term

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:12.712
in revelations
he'd lied about meetings

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:15.248
with Russian ambassador
Sergey Kislyak, who...

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.749
God, this is really boring.

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:21.988
Jack, um, do we have that raw
adult dodge ball video instead?

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:27.693
-(laughter)
-Aw!

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.630
-Man.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.832
That really livened up
the intro.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:35.468
-Ah!
-(whooping)

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.503
Right in the lady balls.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:40.006
-You could hear it.
-(laughter)

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.641
Anyway, Flynn formerly headed

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.776
President Obama's
Defense Intelligence Agency

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.145
before being fired in 2014
due to mismanagement,

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:47.513
temperament issues

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.115
and reportedly destroying
the Lincoln bathroom.

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.951
-(laughter) -And today,
sources revealed

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.387
Obama personally warned Trump
to stay away from Flynn.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.823
Maybe that is the warning
happening right there, or maybe

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.991
it's the "Not my (bleep) problem
any more, bro."

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:00.460
-Kind of a thing there.
-(laughter)

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.228
-(applause and cheering)
-I don't know.

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.897
But...

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.900
I'll tell you, if we know
anything about Trump,

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.902
it's that nothing
dissuades him more

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:11.637
than telling him
not to do something.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.173
So comedians, what's another
warning President Obama

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:16.142
gave
to incoming President Trump?

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:17.844
April Richardson.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:21.147
If you want to score weed from a
Supreme Court justice, remember,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.483
Ruth Bader Ginsburg's
got the good (bleep).

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.052
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
Points. -(laughter, applause)

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.087
Mark Normand.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.224
If you want to win people over,
kill Osama bin Laden.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.758
Oh, wait. I already did that.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.494
-(laughter)
-Points.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.362
(applause)

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:37.663
Dweezil Zappa.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.432
You're not a civilian anymore,

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.501
so you might want
to avoid Twitter.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:45.067
-HARDWICK: Yeah, points.
Points. -(laughter, applause)
