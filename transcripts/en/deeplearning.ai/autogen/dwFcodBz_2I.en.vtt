end up yeah I'm getting to do this work
 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.829
end up yeah I'm getting to do this work
that you do yeah so so I actually I

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839
that you do yeah so so I actually I
 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.169
that you do yeah so so I actually I
before my ph.d program my major was in

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179
before my ph.d program my major was in
 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.599
before my ph.d program my major was in
kind of optics so it's more like in

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609
kind of optics so it's more like in
 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.279
kind of optics so it's more like in
physics I think I had a fairly good

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289
physics I think I had a fairly good
 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.229
physics I think I had a fairly good
color background like very good Packer

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239
color background like very good Packer
 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.180
color background like very good Packer
on math the outer I can do us and I was

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190
on math the outer I can do us and I was
 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.949
on math the outer I can do us and I was
thinking like what kind of major gonna

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:02.959
thinking like what kind of major gonna
 

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:06.100
thinking like what kind of major gonna
take for my ph.d program and I was

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110
take for my ph.d program and I was
 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.260
take for my ph.d program and I was
thinking that well I guess go for a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270
thinking that well I guess go for a
 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.840
thinking that well I guess go for a
vertex are go for something else because

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850
vertex are go for something else because
 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.920
vertex are go for something else because
a black to like early 2000 I think not

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930
a black to like early 2000 I think not
 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.480
a black to like early 2000 I think not
new technology was really really hot

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490
new technology was really really hot
 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.020
new technology was really really hot
yeah and but I was thinking probably I

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030
yeah and but I was thinking probably I
 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.840
yeah and but I was thinking probably I
should look at something like a even

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850
should look at something like a even
 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.849
should look at something like a even
more exciting and the leaves a good

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859
more exciting and the leaves a good
 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.459
more exciting and the leaves a good
chance that I I was taking some classes

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469
chance that I I was taking some classes
 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.730
chance that I I was taking some classes
that you pay and I got to know Tenley

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740
that you pay and I got to know Tenley
 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.029
that you pay and I got to know Tenley
so later he became my PhD advisor so and

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039
so later he became my PhD advisor so and
 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.709
so later he became my PhD advisor so and
I was thinking like machine learning was

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719
I was thinking like machine learning was
 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.859
I was thinking like machine learning was
a great thing to do and I got really

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869
a great thing to do and I got really
 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.740
a great thing to do and I got really
excited and I kind of I changed my major

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750
excited and I kind of I changed my major
 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.800
excited and I kind of I changed my major
so I I did my hippie idea open like a

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810
so I I did my hippie idea open like a
 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.770
so I I did my hippie idea open like a
majoring in like in machine learning

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780
majoring in like in machine learning
 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.160
majoring in like in machine learning
yeah and so let that kind of lecture is

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170
yeah and so let that kind of lecture is
 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.730
yeah and so let that kind of lecture is
I was left for five yes and then I was

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740
I was left for five yes and then I was
 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.459
I was left for five yes and then I was
kind of really exciting and I think I

right and and if people are able to kind

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620
right and and if people are able to kind
 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.680
right and and if people are able to kind
of develop our research or develop a

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690
of develop our research or develop a
 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.720
of develop our research or develop a
kind of good technology on this platform

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730
kind of good technology on this platform
 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.720
kind of good technology on this platform
we're all so awful and like a big

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730
we're all so awful and like a big
 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.570
we're all so awful and like a big
applications so formally the technican

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580
applications so formally the technican
 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.280
applications so formally the technican
be probably into some big applications

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290
be probably into some big applications
 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.560
be probably into some big applications
if I do so later the technology up get

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570
if I do so later the technology up get
 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.440
if I do so later the technology up get
insulate and improved yeah so so we

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450
insulate and improved yeah so so we
 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.110
insulate and improved yeah so so we
believe that the combining loss of a

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120
believe that the combining loss of a
 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.290
believe that the combining loss of a
kind of a combining loss will be sauce

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300
kind of a combining loss will be sauce
 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.960
kind of a combining loss will be sauce
altogether I think is gonna be a really

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970
altogether I think is gonna be a really
 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.590
altogether I think is gonna be a really
powerful a profile and also give you one

try to find that the date has said
 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.830
try to find that the date has said
somewhere and and that we probably don't

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840
somewhere and and that we probably don't
 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.080

then hasn't seen yet so what should

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.190
then hasn't seen yet so what should
 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.310
then hasn't seen yet so what should
people outside China know about deep

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:41.320
people outside China know about deep
 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.540
people outside China know about deep
learning in China yeah I think in China
