00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.830
The answer is 41 over 50.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.380
To get this we start by writing
eighty-two hundredths as a fraction.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.190
And we notice that 82 and
100 have a common factor of two.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.680
We can write this as 2
times 41 / 2 times 50.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.536
Divide the two out of the numerator and
the denominator and

00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:28.124
we're left with 41/50.
