ADMIT IT: the best part about crying isn’t
the release, or the raw emotions -- it’s

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.470
how freakin sexy your face looks when you’re
all done tearing up.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:16.260
Hey folks, welcome back to DNews, Laci Green
here!

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.270
It’s a phenomenon the internet has so kindly
coined as “ugly crying” - when you’re

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.580
SO upset that your face gets all contorted
and puffy and um….ugly looking.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.660
But you know what?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.580
I REFUSE TO CALL IT UGLY.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.580
CRYING IS BEAUTIFUL…..ish.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.790
Okay fine it’s a little ugly.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.079
Funny thing about crying is that there is
a huge gender gap.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.870
Women are much more likely to let themselves
cry than men - clocking in an average of 47

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.589
cries per year, while men only cry about 7
times per year.

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.079
I actually feel kind of bad for dudes.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.079
CRYING FEELS GOOD.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.879
WHY AREN’T BOYS CRYING MORE????

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.579
There are a lot of complicated reasons, but
basically it’s a difference psychologists

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.789
have repeatedly linked to cultural norms.

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.030
How you’re allowed to express your feelings
differs based on your gender.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.010
For instance, as a culture we find it more
acceptable for men to deal with their angry

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.180
emotions by getting into physical fights.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.990
While the gender divides in crying are better
understood, WHY we cry and what exactly triggers

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.930
it varies from person to person and situation
to situation.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.240
But the universal experience of “ugly crying”
can be traced back to simple anatomy.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.490
In order to produce tears, the lacrimal glands
in your eyes have to get to work.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.850
Tear fluid is produced with the help of blood,
which comes through thick and fast when the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.310
blood vessels in your eyes dilate.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.530
Normally you can’t see those vessels...but
when they widen up, you can tell they’re

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.689
there, alright/ All those tiny little vessels
swelling up to produce your tears make your

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.039
eyes look “blood shot”.

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.369
But what about the puffy eyes?

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.090
This happens because, if you’ve ever had
the absolute pleasure of tasting your own

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.380
tears, you’ll notice that they’re really
salty.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.850
The salt causes water retention around your
eyes, causing them to puff up.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.770
Salt isn’t the cause for your ENTIRE FACE
becoming a puffy, bloated mess however.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.280
The reason for that is actually a bit more
complicated - it comes down to your fight-or-flight

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280
system.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.020
This is the part of your sympathetic nervous
system that’s activated when your body is

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.020
under stress.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.341
When you’re angry, when you’re scared
or threatened - your pupils dilate and the

00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:02.999
adrenaline flows, causing your heart rate
to increase.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.630
Crying is basically the same - especially
if you’re holding your breath a bit and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.920
not breathing steadily, it causes blood to
pump into your face, straining your muscles,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.940
and making your face red and puffy.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.310
Add a nice smattering of snot mixed with tears
and drool and well….you’re a masterpiece,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.310
baby.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.599
Thanks for joining me for DNews everyone,
are you an ugly crier?

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.630
