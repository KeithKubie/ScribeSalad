00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.860
TADASHI TOKIEDA: A strip of paper, a paper ribbon, and two ordinary paper clips.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.860
We bend the paper strip in a Z or S shape, like so.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.180
You know, going winding about like that.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.720
And, with the help of the paper clips, we shall fix that shape

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.300
by slotting the paper clips here and here.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.400
Now, what happens if I start pulling the ends of the paper?

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.520
Well, you can see that the paper clips come closer and closer together,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.680
because they are being driven by the paper.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.380
So, if I keep pulling, eventually they'll touch and jam,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.680
but, if I keep pulling nonetheless...

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.560
they hop!

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.940
And, when I pick them up...

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.340
they're linked. That's quite interesting.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.700
They're linked.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.020
What we have just done is with two paper clips only, and this what we shall call 'version number zero'.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.800
This is just the beginning. The trick goes back quite a long way;

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.560
according to Martin Gardner's Encyclopedia of Impromptu Magic,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.120
this seems to have been discovered by somebody called Bowman in Washington State.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.480
Today we'll do some variations on this.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.760
So, we fix the shape of the bending paper like so.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.540
But this time we added a rubber band. You see, the paper has two loops here and here,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.480
and, seeing from your side, we're hanging the rubber band on the left loop.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.920
This is version number 1. Version number 1, then, hanging over here.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.180
What happens? This time what happens is this.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.960
You have the rubber band hanging from the paper ribbon;

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.160
underneath clip-clip together from the rubber band.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.800
We have this kind of half-chain—and you will see in a moment why we call it 'half-chain'—

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.980
of rubber band-clip-clip together.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.660
In science, you have to exercise your power of imagination and observation, especially.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.980
You know, you can't just take something and say "Oh, this is not going to matter",

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.820
and then reject little differences of innocuous appearance.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.360
Maybe you have to pay a lot of attention to such little differences.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.320
To illustrate that point, let's do something that looks like version number 1,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.780
which we have just tried, but isn't quite.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.860
Number 1 that we have just tried looked like this

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.960
The rubber band was hanging from the left loop of those two loops.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.180
Okay, now [clears throat]

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.400
The rubber band is now hanging from the right loop instead of left loop,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880
and that's what we shall call 'version number 2'.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.040
You see, before it was hanging here, and now it's hanging here.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.440
So, that's version number 2.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.300
What's going to happen if I pull the ends of the paper?

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.700
Well, you know, somebody not observant might say "Well, what's the difference?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.420
Here, here, well, probably doesn't matter."

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.100
But you remember that version number 1 ended up having the rubber band hanging from the paper ribbon,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.420
with two paper clips hanging from the rubber band.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.000
This time—version number 2—whole thing falls off the paper ribbon,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.680
so that's different. Nonetheless, when you pick it up,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.460
you still get this clip-clip-rubber band, this half-chain together.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.920
So, in the case of version number 1, we had this,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.460
and, version number 2, this got detached.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.380
Having tried version number 1 and version number 2,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.000
it becomes tempting, indeed irresistible,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.240
to try both at the same time, what is 1+2.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.940
Well, it's very lucky that I have another rubber band here.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.960
I think, and I'm sure you think too, 1+2 should look like this.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.960
You see, because by itself, this rubber band is in the position of version number 1.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.520
It's hanging from the left.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.600
This one, by itself, is in the position of version number 2,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.840
so 1+2 should be like this; it's doing 1 and 2 at the same time.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.280
So, the question is what happens if I pull the ends of the paper.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.120
What's going to happen to the two rubber bands this time, and the two paper clips?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.540
Before we do that, however, let me debunk myself a little bit.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.960
The fact that, in version number 1, the rubber band stayed on the paper

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.840
and—number 2—the rubber band fell off the paper,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.340
is, in fact, no mystery; we can understand this.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.460
So, let's try to understand it--

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.980
by ignoring the paper clips.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.500
You remember that version number 1 looked like this?

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.800
The rubber band was hanging from the paper on the left loop.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.160
If you look carefully, you see that the paper strip goes through the rubber band

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.820
and then passes on the side.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.200
In other words, the rubber band is linked with the paper strip.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.660
So, if I pull the ends of the paper...

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.280
of course it stays linked, and it has no choice but to stay on the paper.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.460
That is why, in version number 1, the rubber band stayed on the paper.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.580
In contrast, version number 2 looked like this.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.140
Over the two loops in the paper, it was hanging from the right loop.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.620
If you look carefully, you see that the paper comes into the rubber band but goes back out.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.840
So, the rubber band is, in fact, not linked to the paper.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.860
When I pull the ends then, being unlinked, the band is free to fall.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.400
That is why the rubber band can fall off the paper in version number 2.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.960
So, the fact that the version number 1 stays on the paper, number 2 falls off the paper,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.440
is no mystery as I say.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.740
That's a purely topological thing that we can understand.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.320
Let's go back then where we left off and try to do 1+2.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.920
So, what's going to happen if we do 1 and 2 at the same time?

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.560
You should pause and try to guess.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.340
BRADY: They're all gonna to be linked, and on the paper.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.280
TADASHI: Good. But, a bit more precisely—

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.480
BRADY: I picture one big long chain—

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.720
TADASHI: Long chain. Rubber band-clip-clip-rubber band, in that kind of order?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.120
Or rubber band-clip-rubber band-clip?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.580
Or, maybe two rubber bands get linked? Well, I do that only for money.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.560
BRADY: I don't know, I picture— my guess is rubber band-paper clip-paper clip-rubber band.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.420
TADASHI: Excellent, OK, so that's quite nice. By the way, it's always important to guess anyway,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.960
because, you know, guessing is really the way to learn and, in fact, advance in science,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.960
both for students and researchers alike, because if you guess right, you are very, very proud you got it right.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.780
And if you guess wrong, you are really shocked; maybe not really, but slightly shocked,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.300
and that engages your thinking, and you can learn what happened,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.320
and then it makes you a little smarter next time.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.060
So, always guess before solving any problem.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.600
OK, let's try doing this.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.440
My friend Brady guessed rubber band-clip-clip-rubber band.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.600
Let's do this. 1+2, what's going to happen?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.100
Here we go.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.940
Of course that's what happens, congratulations.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.720
And it makes sense, in retrospect, because if we didn't have this rubber band

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.880
you see that configuration -- the remaining configuration -- is, of course, the number 1 configuration.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.420
If we didn't have this rubber band, well, you get clip-clip-rubber band hanging -- that's number 2 --

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.920
but that would be because this rubber band is not present,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.460
would be detached from the paper, so everything will fall down.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.620
So, together, you get this long chain.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.120
When we hear about computation, or calculation in general,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.860
we always think naturally because that's how we learn these things in school, and about numbers

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.060
— calculating with numbers — or, perhaps at a more advanced level — calculating with formulas.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.120
And, you know, you do some algorithm, you do some recipe

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.280
and then the expected results come out.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.340
But here, your brain, although it hasn't formalised anything,

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.960
you know, it hasn't written any numbers or formulas,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.360
has effectively computed.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.300
It has caught on to something- some really rich pattern in nature,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.240
and has started understanding what was going to happen.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.400
So, it's quite curious that your brain is good at computing,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.100
even without numbers or formulas.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.560
OK, what happens if I take two copies of number 1 on this paper ribbon,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.240
and do the same experiment pulling the ends?

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.540
1+1...

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.760
looks like this.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.680
You see? This rubber band is in the position of now-familiar position number 1.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.060
This rubber band — the top one — as you can see by looking at it from the back,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.400
is another copy of version number 1.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.000
So, we have here two copies of version number 1 living together on this strip of paper.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.880
And you can see that both of those rubber bands are linked to the paper

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.880
in the sense that the paper goes through one and through the other.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.560
So, when I pull the ends, the rubber bands must stay on the paper, that much we know.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.300
The only question is: how do they interact with the paper clips?

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.260
You care to guess?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.020
BRADY: I think both rubber bands are gonna stay on the paper...

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.680
TADASHI: That's true.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.480
BRADY: ...and the two paper clips will be linked to each of them on the ends.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.940
TADASHI: How about paper clips between themselves?

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.600
BRADY: I think it'll be rubber band-paper clip-paper clip-rubber band.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.160
TADASHI: Ah, that's good. Indeed, we are guessing that we- I can get that long chain of band-clip-clip-band.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.300
Let's try this.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.360
Indeed.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.760
Of course.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:28.140
Again, we thought nature should behave in a certain way, and nature obliged.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.180
You get this kind of suspension bridge.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.540
Rubber bands on the paper, that we had already understood topologically,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.300
but what is new is that you get, again, this long chain of band-clip-clip-band

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.480
hanging like this; paper clips connecting the rubber bands in the middle in this hanging configuration.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.780
That's 1+1. So...

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.020
1+2 was like this because number 1 is linked to the paper; number 2 isn't.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:15.760
And 1+1 was like this because they are both copies of number 1 and they have to be on the paper.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.100
Each time, then, we are getting a long chain- a full chain of band-clip-clip-band,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.120
and the only question is how that long chain is positioned with respect to the paper.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.500
Well, it remains for us to try 2+2...

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.160
Version number 2, I'd like to recall, is the one where by itself fell off the paper.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.360
2+2 is like this and that's because- if you look at, for example, just at this rubber band

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.200
that's in the now-familiar position of number 2;

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.160
paper goes in but comes back out.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:52.300
And over here, at the top, you will see another copy of version number 2.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.760
OK, so, what we have to do is to pull the ends and see what happens.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.880
Well, this time, neither of the band, by itself, is linked to the paper.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.920
So, what's going to happen?

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.400
When I was exploring this, and trying various possibilities and some,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.060
at this stage, when I came to this stage for the first time,0.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.860
naturally, I guessed that I would get a long chain of band-clip-clip-band,

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.700
which we do.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:17.200
And because neither band is linked to the paper, I thought the entire thing will just fall down to the ground,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.400
leaving the paper alone.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.860
So, let's try this.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.000
This time, however, something strange has happened.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:31.220
The entire ensemble of the rubber bands and paper clips didn't fall down to the ground;

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.440
instead, they stayed on the paper.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.760
You see? There is a rubber band that goes around the paper like this in a transverse manner.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.960
And then there is - in the middle - a rubber band, which is kind of acting as a lock, so to speak.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.620
Please ignore the paper clips there; not that interesting at this stage.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:51.680
So, there's a middle "lock", and then the band that goes around - transversely - around the paper.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.880
You can see that if we didn't have this rubber band, the other one could be pulled off the paper.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.540
On the other hand, if we didn't have this rubber band,

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.300
then this middle lock, which is hanging, would fall down to the ground.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.260
So, neither band is linked to the paper, that's true,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.640
but each one is preventing the other from leaving the paper.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.840
So that, if I now closed the ends of this paper,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.340
and think of the paper as the third loop, we have here a system of three loops.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.780
Any two of these are mutually unlinked, but three together...

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.980
are linked and stuck together.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.360
And that kind of configuration has a name: it is called a Borromean link.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.400
Borromean link,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.100
after the Italian Renaissance family called Borromeo—

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.340
no, no, it's not the family who used to poison one another; that's Borgia, that's another family—

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.580
but Borromeo.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.340
And it appears in all sorts of contexts.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.500
Very, very important central object, for example, in 3-dimensional topology.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.880
Here is an example of a Borromean link.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.600
Each of those three pieces of wood is a loop—

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.780
rather, sort of, distorted loop, but it is a loop nonetheless—

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.660
and they're clearly stuck together; you cannot pull them apart.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.040
But, you see, it's curious to note that, if you make in your mind's eye

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.680
any one of these three disappear, by saying "kazam", for example.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.460
Let's make the one that I'm holding disappear.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.260
Then the other two can be pulled apart, so they are not linked.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.820
And it's the same for any of these three.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.580
So, if I make this one disappear, the other two can be pulled apart, and

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.320
any one of these disappearing will cause the other two to fall apart.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.220
So, that is a Borromean configuration.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.820
This is carved out of a single piece of wood, and when I first bought it in Africa,

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.620
I was very impressed to hear this.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.500
But then, you caught me, that that's the only way to carve something like this, of course.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.060
Good, we have seen quite a few things,

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.340
and if you wanted to share this with friends and family, I suggest that you end on the following,

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.580
rather mischievous, note.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.000
You say "OK, OK, folks, you understand everything, right?",

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.100
and by this time, they're feeling cocky and confident.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.620
"Yeah, yeah, we understand everything", and you say "OK, let's revise the first thing that we started with".

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.480
What happens if I bend the paper like this in a Z or S shape,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.320
and, with the help of paper clips, fix them in place, and then pull the ends of the paper?

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.200
They say "Oh, we have seen all that", and "they get linked together, right?", and so on.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.760
It's really strange because, not more than ten minutes ago,

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.660
they had never seen paper clips come together. Now they assume that, every single time, they come together.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.640
That's quite curious.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.620
So, you say "OK, OK, but let's try this."

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.880
So, paper clips on paper, and when I pull - ah, that's strange; they didn't get linked together.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.460
What happened?

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.840
'Course, some people - maybe not you - were distracted by my patter,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.060
and haven't been watching.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.760
What we did was, indeed, put the paper clip at the top of this Z shape.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.200
But the other one - instead of putting it at the top, I put it at the bottom on the other side.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.140
So, paper clip here...

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.600
and here.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.080
So, when I pull, they're completely separated; there's no incentive for these to link together.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.380
So, you have to keep watching.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.900
But not all is lost. This is just a piece of mischief, but you can start doing science on top of this.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:18.380
Let's try the paper clips in the wrong positions, but with addition of the rubber bands.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.000
Let's try rubber bands in the position that we used to call 1+1, in other words:

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.320
both rubber bands are linked with the paper.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.780
As far as the rubber bands are concerned, it's just like 1+1.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.860
As you can see both rubber bands are linked to the paper; they have to stay on the paper.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.700
What's different from the previous experiment is that one of the paper clips is at the top,

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.680
but the other one is at the bottom.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.160
It used to be both at the top, and both at the top - mysteriously, they used to link.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.280
But this time, the paper clips will not be linked.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.880
Rubber bands, however - we have already understood the topology, because the paper

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.240
goes through the rubber band - has to stay on the paper.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.960
So, what's going to happen when I pull the ends of the paper?

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:52.760
Huh?

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.220
Any takers? Any guesses?

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.080
BRADY: Like, maybe, each rubber band will have one paper clip?

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.920
TADASHI: Okay, that's interesting, so...

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.720
My friend Brady's saying, well, when I straighten out the paper,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.900
rubber bands will be hanging from the paper; that's obligatory.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.620
Each rubber band will have a paper clip, this rubber band, paper clip.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.480
But paper clips will not link because they're on the wrong sides of the paper.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.660
Let's try this.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.980
Excellent.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.420
That's what happens. You see?

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.540
We have started computing.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.880
We understand something. There's a lot of method to be smart in this.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.740
I guess, interesting, let's try this.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.460
That's inter— it looks like the previous one

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.840
but this time, each paper clips is linked to the rubber band, but not between themselves.
