Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, September 4th, 2017 how's it going? How? Why you happy fucking Labor Day. Happy Labor Day. Happy Labor Day. You don't have to go to fucking work unless you're the guy that owns the fucking business then you never get to sleep, do ya? You should have stuck with your first wife, but you threw her out and now you got a fucking 20 something fucking car and she wants to spend all your money. Alright, sorry. Anyways, how you know something you worked hard all year. God dammit. It's nice that you got a fucking a Monday off, isn't it? Don't you wish it was the way it is in Europe?

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       I don't know how they do it over there. You know they all got fucking health insurance. They get like 53 weeks off a year. Then have like the whole fucking continent shuts down in August. Everybody just says fuck it. We're not working. And somehow it keeps going. Is it because their countries are so small doll? Look at the little country. Is that what it is?

Speaker 2:          00:01:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       Over here is so fucking big. You know, just a mow. Your yard takes half the God damn summer over here. All of us fat Fox wall, Elon around a giant pieces of property rad in a four wheeler shooting a guns. You fucking live over there in Europe, man. You get, you got nothing. You got to flat, you know, you and five other guys fucking addicted to heroin. When some baby drowns in a toilet or whatever that fucking movie was, you know you got nothing. Or maybe maybe you got a house and it's got like the fucking, it's got that roof that looks like a bale of hay that someone braided in. It looks like a weave but with like, hey, I don't know what it is over there, but all I know is they still have castles. Some of them still have kings and queens and they get, they get like August off, just off.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       You know when they get free health care, they pay a bunch of fucking taxes. But I gotta be honest, you pay a bunch of taxes here too. I think it's just because we're bigger. Got The wide open fucking roads. I'm going to go with that. I'm going to go with that and I'm never going to read up about it and that's what I'm going to say. If that topics ever brought up like, Hey, I'll come back, come they get all this vacation time and if a woman as a kid over there, Raj, she doesn't have to be backward to work on Monday, I'll come. That is because there are little tiny countries, you know, they have little tiny hospitals, you know, a little tiny teeth that they don't brush. You know, it's, it's, it's Europe. What do you mean? What do you do? That's why their cars go better into corners. They have a little tiny streets and they gotta they gotta zigzag around some shit. You know that, that's basically what it is. It's not like America. Some woman gives birth on Friday, the eight gene makes sure you're fucking here on Monday, pumped that kid

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       out, do whatever it is you got to do.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       Yeah. Have you gotten a stick? A weed wacker of ROR a fucking reverse blower up there and suck the kid out and be back to work. We'll give you Monday off. Then you gotta be here on Tuesday. That's how it works here in America

Speaker 3:          00:03:13       now. Everybody wanted his why was so fat has nothing to do with our poison food. We're just stressed. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       if you guys didn't have a whole month to August off over there in Europe, I'd love to see if you guys actually had to fucking work over there and worry about, you know, I need a new pancreas. How am I going to afford that?

Speaker 3:          00:03:35       Right. Which is easily the cost of at least three flat screen TVs. That's the going rate for a pancreas, if I remember correctly. All right. If you are dealing with that stress, I'd like to see how many fucking doughnuts you be eating, you know, uh, speaking of which, uh, Billy, no fun. Billy, no fun. His on his 18th day of not Busan, 18 days, not Booz and I barely even remember what it tastes like at this point. You know, I'm dropping weight. This is the time of night when it sucks. Um, you know, in the morning it's great. I wake up, my stomach's flatter than it was the day before. I feel good, but it's like at night, I mean, Sunday night, I don't have to go to work on Monday. I have tomorrow off like all of you guys while you're listening to it today, you know, you can't tell me, you know. Um, I mean as, as a fucking human being, I have to go out and get fucking hammered. Right. I mean

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       kind of. I mean, I, if I don't die, I mean if I was running the CIA I'd be, oh, there's this guy in Isis, see some sort of religious fanatic. Oh, Billy red cakes. Oh, Billy red velvet. I'm staying away from the sugar. I'm being an angel. I'm being an angel cause I might have some act and work in,

Speaker 3:          00:04:58       um, in October.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       So, uh, I got to make sure I'm down to my fighting weight of my fighting weight. A buck 72. That's what I need to be at. Whenever I shoot something, you know all these fucking actresses out here talk about how it's so hard for them is if a guy can go on and be a bloated fat fucking nut, get shit for it. Okay? That's not how it works. They can get to you through social media. They go right at you and they tell you that you're a bloated fed. Fuck what happened to you. You got old, which a hair go, all of that shit. You know what I mean? But you know, you know what it is about people. They look out their own fucking heads. All right? They look at the world in a two dimensional way. They look out their heads, they observe something and then they put it their head and they process it with their previous experience and then to them that is the truth.

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       That is what's going on in the world. They look at it from their fucking angle and they don't realize it. That is 360 degrees, which is why South Park is the greatest fucking show of all time as far as I'm concerned, because the matter what problem they attack, they hit it from all sides. The red side, the blue side from the north to South East, west. You know what I'm saying? You're like dead. That was, that was the longest fucking compliment ever. Ah, Josh Adam Meyers from the God damn comedy gym. Josh Adam Meyers, Bill Barr. I'm taping my Monday morning podcast. You're one of our first callers. How are you?

Speaker 4:          00:06:22       Good, good. I'm just curious. I could get your opinion on the Kyrie Irving at dad's on the street.

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       I wasn't aware that that happened. Was that a big news story in the world of sports?

Speaker 4:          00:06:31       Good. The little bit. Yeah. It's, it's a few people know about it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       Uh, you know, as a, as a fucking lover of the Celtics, as a Celtics lover. I hated the fucking trade because I loved Isaiah. He was like a mini big PAPI. He was on his way. He was going to have a street named after him. But, uh, that it's, it's a business now and this all goes back, I think to the Miami Heat, all those pile on teams back to the Coby Shack Lakers when whenever it stopped being bird bird, Celtics, magic Lakers, Isaiah fucking, uh, Pistons Jordan with the Bulls and everybody just jumped around. Now it's over. I thought you wouldn't ask about the cigar.

Speaker 4:          00:07:08       I am. That's what I was saying. I was like, do you want me to give you some time so you can finish this up and then,

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       no, I don't give a shit. Just ring the doorbell and I'll stop and I'll finish it later.

Speaker 4:          00:07:16       All right. Costing a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       Alright. Don't, I don't ring the doorbell. My daughter's sleeping. Just text me.

Speaker 3:          00:07:21       All right. See Ya. Um, anyways, the most roundabout compliment ever for South Park. I had no idea it was going to say that. So a, I am, as of this morning, I bought 179 pounds in six ounces, one 79.6. So I'm trying to lose three weeks and next week on Friday, I need to be, uh, I need to be one 77. I right. Just said he hit pause him in the fucking dog house. I just woke up my daughter. Oh my God, my wife is fucking pissed at me, boy. [inaudible] all right. This is the Monday morning podcast and I'm gonna be fucking whisper. And for the rest of this God damn thing, um, that was, I talked to my, yes. So next week I want to be 177 pounds by a Friday and then one 74 the next week, and then I'll be one 71 and then if I get this acting Gig, I'll be where I need to be.

Speaker 3:          00:08:20       Um, so I was going to take a month off from boozy, but if I get this acting Gig, then I'm just not going to booze like right on through to the end of the fucking shoot. And then when that's over, okay. Uh, I'm gonna get like one of those kegerators and I'm gonna fill it up with fucking whiskey and I'm going to be underneath it and it's gonna be glorious. Um, I dunno. I Dunno what my fucking problem is. I should go to a meeting and just see what that's like. I went to a meeting a long time ago and I got arrested for drinking and driving and one of the requirements was you had to go to a, uh, an AA meeting, two of them or something like that. Um, all I remember, I was just like, these guys are fucking drunks. I mean I drink, I don't, I don't fucking drink. These guys had like lunacy stories.

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       Talking about like fucking bleeding out their ass and going right to the liquor store and the next day, you know what I mean? Like not eating food for Mike. Just crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:34       Crazy, crazy fucking stories. So I just was sitting there going, I am

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:09:39       I'm just a drunk. These people got a fucking problem. I'm telling you right now, if you ever just want to see, you know, some of the most fucked up people on the planet, just go to an AA meeting. These fucking people, man. You know, if fingers are like stuck together from like cigarette smoke, you know what I mean? They got like, they just, you know, I can be, I'm just being an asshole. I have no idea what a fucking AA meetings like. And it looks like you get like a little trinket if you'd do it for awhile, you know, get six days, you know, he Shah flagging, you know, you know, addictive people. They're, they're fucking, they can never stop talking about themselves. Right. So I think it's got to go up there. Oh my God, I'm gonna get so much shit for this. I don't give a fuck. I think it's about time. Somebody fucking put a in its place, right? Once you grow up in white knuckle it, like the rest of us, you've got to go join a fucking group and everybody sits down and fucking makes an Afghan together. Um, you know, it's funny that I actually would love to be part of a group

Speaker 3:          00:10:45       when I went golfing up the, this past week, you know, and I went with a buddy of mine and he was like a member of a country club and like, this is fucking cool. It's really cool. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:10:57       bunch of guys could fucking talk shit, having a great time. All that shit that everybody fucking gives you a rough time for, you know, they always make fun of guys hanging out. Now if they all hang out together like they do, there has to be like mocked for some fucking reason. It's fun. You just sit around breaking each other's balls. That's all it was. I went there and it was, everybody was fucking cool and everybody was just busting chops the whole fucking time. And then you go out and golf and everybody's just giving each other shit and you're laughing and you smoking cigars and you're gambling and shit. It's, it's fun for whatever fucking reason. I don't know if he, if you do that now, I don't know for some reason that that's attacked. You know, I don't, I don't know what the, I don't know what it is. I don't know what the fuck is you supposed to be doing, but I can tell you I did enjoy it. Um, and speaking of enjoying shit, I know I'm all over the map.

Speaker 5:          00:11:56       Um,

Speaker 3:          00:11:58       I found I got caught up with the last, do you know today's Formula One race and uh, the previous one, like a week ago or two weeks ago, I missed it and I have to tell you, I loved the force India team before I watched the previous race and now I, I will fucking love that team forever. I will love that fucking team forever. It at the very least, Esteban O'Connor and Sergio Perez, everybody else was fucking, was racing to not lose, you know, didn't want to fuck up. These fucking guys went in there. You know what I mean? You ever watch a hockey fight and the guys is so good at it. They barely even punch each other. The best ones is where you just, you grabbed my shoulder, I grabbed your shoulder. We just fucking beat the shit out of each other. You know, that's what these guys did. They went old time hockey with like racing. They're on the same team. They slammed into each other twice. They don't even give a fuck that it's a teammate. This was like some sort of bloodsport that they were doing everybody else's out there. Like, oh my God, that's my teammate. I need to, I'm really literally making fun of the other teams for actually doing the smart thing. I love that they did it. I love last year when Hamilton and a fucking a Nicki Minaj, whatever his fucking name was, I can't remember this fucking name. What the hell's guy's name.

Speaker 5:          00:13:24       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:13:25       Nikki, I want it now. I'm taking my toys and going home. I'm getting married now. Rosberg right, Nico Rosberg that's what it was when they slammed into each other. They did that a couple of times. I liked that. And I love how these fucking drivers, there's all of these shit where they don't like each other. This, you know, like Sebastian Vettel doesn't like Lewis Hamilton. Kimi Raikkonen doesn't like Valtteri Botox. It's, it literally is fucking days a thunder. It's tremendous. And a, this past week's race was great. Uh, yesterday as far as watching a lance straw, getting, uh, 18 years old. These lined up in the front row next to Lewis Hamilton, who's just the fucking greatest driver. He just is. He is. I know Mercedes has the best fucking cars right now, but you know, give me a fucking break. It's not like Ferrari's and he's sort of a slouch. Right? I Dunno.

Speaker 3:          00:14:23       You could argue that Daniel Ricardo's just as good. He's just not riding. Driving a car was good. Maybe that's what the fuck it is. I don't know what it is, but I really enjoyed yesterday's race and the previous one. Um, how do you not love force India out there with the pink cars? The few Chicago slamming into each other. It looked like me and my brother had a fucking carnival that we'd be like, those two guys are related. Like you would know. We would, if we got into bumper cars, we would, no, I didn't give a fuck

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       about anybody else out there other than slamming into my own fucking family member. What was the point of hitting somebody else? I couldn't laugh at them in the car ride home. I'd never see him again. Um, so anyways, I guess they go to Singapore next one of these years. I'm going to line up a stand up date with that race over there. Um, I'm going to try and go to a couple a year cause I'm a fucking lunatic. So I went to Montreal this year and I'm also going to the race in, um, Austin, Texas, um, provided there's not another, uh, you know, fucking hurricane like that one that hit Houston. Jesus Christ. Um, anyways, I actually, you know, I want to show to tweet out something you guys, there was actually something we could send like fucking diapers and that type of stuff for our kids. Can't imagine it about that as babies and everything you got to take care of.

Speaker 1:          00:15:46       Um, that seemed like a really cool thing to do. The very least. At least you could fucking dope. So, uh, anyways, I'm behind with my MotoGP racing. I gotta get caught up on that. Um, but I have to be, I have to be honest, this, this race in Italy was one of my favorite races just because of what was going on in like position four, five, and six fucking lunatic racing. And, uh, I just wish they could somehow do something to the cars that, that happened in the first and second position because once again, Lewis Hamilton, you know, he gets to the first corner first he comes out in first place and then that's it. He's in the front of the race for the rest of the fucking race. And then that's just it. It's over. He's driving in clean air. His car's too fucking fast.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       Now you've got to hope that the car breaks down or he fucks up, which isn't going to happen. And, um, but I did enjoy all that other stuff. But uh, congratulations to Lewis Hamilton for winning another one. He now is the head of Sebastian Vettel and I believe the Mercedes team as a team is ahead of everybody else too. So they're fucking crushing it. And a, I think it's going to be all downhill from here. So I'm hoping the fucking Ferrari team, cause they, the closest ones can step it up. And a, I like both those guys. I like Kimmy, Kimmy Raycon now he seems fucking pissed off getting penalties and shit. Um, I relate to the angry guys. That's why I like force India. They're going to fucking slam into each other. It's tremendous. It's tremendous. You know, it's childish. It's stupid. I love when that guy who the former race car fucking champion, I don't know what his name is. The commentary just goes, Oh da boys boys. What are you doing a buy baby? Every gets all like fucking parental with them. I wanted to see, I watched the qualifying to, I love when it rains out to all, I forgot the greatest quote I've heard since I started watching formula racing after the fucking four Sindia cars hit for the second time. I think it was that old card guy. He, she says over his radio, he goes to his fucking

Speaker 3:          00:17:51       crew chief for whatever. He goes, what the fuck? Seriously, what the fuck? Like flipping and meanwhile he's going like 180 miles an hour. He sounds like me when I drive to work and he's doing like, you know, 180, 200 miles an hour and he's, they fucking flip each other off. They never flip. He jets, you know, the European and shit, they, they give the a little blue with the fucking hand. Somebody's got to flip somebody off. You know what I mean? Or if they write on their ass, slam on the brakes like you do on the highway. Stop fucking tailgating. I wasn't tailgating. I was drafting. All right, enough of this shit. I know a lot of you guys don't even watch this shit, but I'm all right, let's plow ahead here. I, uh, I was, um, did it casino, I already forget the name of it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:39       Um, I was in a casino, uh, right outside of San Diego and I did it two years ago and I flew down in our 44 and today, oh, yesterday I flew in a, uh, I don't even know what the fuck it was to be honest with Ya. Let me see if I can look up the name of this helicopter. This helicopter was turbine engine, which is a jet engine. And uh, it was fucking on. The whole thing was hydraulic. I fucking gives a fuck with what helicopter was. So basically I trained on the [inaudible]. Our 22 is like driving a car that has drum berry, drum brakes, no power steering. You know what I mean? And you have to like fucking control the wipers yourself. You know, like the 1920s, like Laurel and hardy, you got to like move it side to side. Um, which is also why I love that thing because you're really flying.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       If you hold in a hover your fucking doing it, then you move up to the RF 44. And this is kind of weird where it's like the, uh, the collective and the cyclic of both hydraulic. Okay. That's your power and then how you steer the shit you hold with your hands basically. And then if for whatever reason your foot pedals are, are not hydraulic, they just manually your own precious. So you're dealing with like really finessing it, barely having to touch it up top and then your drum breaks down the bottom. It's just, it's a very odd feeling. And I fly out of Burbank and there's always a fucking tailwind when you're going into set it down. It's so fucking annoying. Like right behind you. Full blast. I don't know where it comes from. Um, every time. In fact, I saw this student that was learning over there. What he would do once he, when he would go to set it down, he would just, he would just face the wind and set it down and then go inside and get the wheels and then put 'em on the thing and then just turn the helicopter around.

Speaker 3:          00:20:34       As much as it was funny, I was like, that's a great fucking idea. I would rather do that, you know, cause you're landed next to other helicopters. I don't want to fuck anybody else's shit up. Sweaty was this thing was like a, was like a six and a, I've got a picture, you know, Dean del Ray, go look him up on Twitter. He's teed, tweeted out a picture, I'll fucking, I'll retweet it. And it's like, the word is, I'm standing in front of the coolest helicopter I ever flew in. I'm talking when somebody, whoever took the picture. So I looked like a fucking, I may look like an asshole anyways. Whose kid? No. Um, but it was, I would say the most amazing machine I've ever gotten the chance to operate. And it was like, it was like a sports car in the air with like, like the tightest, most responsive fucking suspension you could possibly think of without the rough ride because you're not on the ground, you just go in through the air.

Speaker 3:          00:21:30       It didn't feel any turbulence whatsoever. And um, I just know when you take off in the year 22 and you push the stick forward, right? I mean, I don't know how long it is. It's a good eight, nine seconds until you want to get up to 53 knots. That's the optimal, you know, speed to get out to get the most rate of climb and it takes you a good, I feels like forever eight, nine seconds, this fucking thing. It was like maybe two and a half seconds and it was up to speed. You just pulled the stick back and you fucking shot up in the air. I've never been, it was really intimidating. But once I just sort of, I watched my instructor and I've two times do that, the start and startup and shutdown of it and it's like, it's, it's not that bad. It's just intimidating at first. And then you get, once you know where to look, which is basically your manifold pressure, your altitude and how fast you're going, and then also your trim once you know where those are all the other shit. It's just like, well, you know, a fucking horn is going to go off if there's a problem anywhere else. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:22:37       Anyways, it was fun as shit and went down and we did the Gig and um, I think I'm going to start doing that. Like, um, I'm doing a podcast festival for the all things comedy network in the end of October. And if I don't get this acting Gig and I'm in La, I'm going to fly out in a helicopter. I got a Vegas Gig, I'm going to do that one in the helicopter too. And that way I can get my, keep my hours up, stay current and a while going out, making money. So I'm renting the helicopter, but I'm earning money, right? And in a way I get to fly private without having to blow all this money on a fucking stupid ass jet, which is stupid, right? Those fucking private jets is fucking stupid as hell you in and you can't even stand up. It's the dumbest thing ever.

Speaker 3:          00:23:25       You're way better. You could spend one 90th the money on a first-class fucking ticket and you are in a a, you're on like a fucking cruise ship. You can stand, you can stand up when you take a piss. You don't have to bend over at the fucking neck, you know? I know they make bigger jets, but those things are like, you know, you're going to fly from Boston to Rhode. It's going to cost you like a fucking $300,000. I don't know how people, I don't know anybody flies private to be honest with you. I have no fucking idea. I'm just go to a mom and pop airport, get on jet blue or virgin. That's the way to do it. Use some miles, bump yourself up to a bigger seat. You're going to get a pilot who's psyched? He's making a ton of fucking money. You get on those little ones, those [inaudible] people and I'm making shit.

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:24:12       right. I don't know. That's been, that's been my experience. They're trying to, they're trying to get a gig flying one of the bigger ones so they can actually make money instead of flying some little fucking six cedar.

Speaker 2:          00:24:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       But you know what it is. I'm out of my fucking element. I don't know anything about that shit. I just have heard about how much it fucking costs. All right, let me, uh, let me read the, um, let me read the fucking, uh, advertising here for this week. Uh, all right, what do we got here? Oh, draft kings. Everybody Gay. Do you like to gamble on sports? You want to make some fucking money? These are the guys. It's not too late to get closer to the game you love with draft kings one week fantasy football.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       You know,

Speaker 3:          00:26:10       all the time I had another guy bring up fucking deflate gate. I always tell them, it's like they did not get convicted of deflating balls. You fucking moron. That was laughed at at court for the 90 million at the time. And then the suspension was, was, was canceled. Remember that he was supposed to be suspended and they took it to court and it was laughed out of court and the judge said, you're wasted. Why did you waste my fucking time with this? That's what happened. And then you know, the United States of America, you can not get tried twice for the same offense. That's a hearsay

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       something or other, right? You can't be, you can't be fucking double jeopardy. You can't fucking do that. So the NFL found a loophole, they just went back to court and said, uh, is the NFL and corporation. And the judge was like, yes. And then they said, does a corporation have the right to suspend its employee? And the judge said yes. And they said, fine, where corporation, Tom Brady is our employee and he is suspended. And that's what they did.

Speaker 2:          00:27:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:10       That's why he got suspended, not because they proved anything. You fucking dopes. And by the way, the guy who caught the, the, the alleged, by the way, under inflated fucking ball, by the way, the cults also allegedly had 200 flighty balls. But who gives a fuck?

All right, there you go. All right. Booze lineup. Oh, beautiful. I was hoping people gonna send these in. All right. I um, I talked last week on, you know, I get back into baseball and a Yankees, red sox things heating up again. We'd better meet in the playoffs. It's has to happen. It's been too fucking long. Um, I ended up fucking Yankees took three out of four, so I broke even all this shit-talking all of this fucking shit talking and it just, we ended up just being even, um, but I was talking about, you know, just watching baseball. I did my booze lineup of like whiskeys, scotches, and bourbons. All right. I don't just do scotches. Okay. This isn't like the fucking, this isn't MLB when Babe Ruth played. All right, this is any, anybody can show up as long as you brown. Now Tequila is also welcome. Um, so this would be my lineup. Uh, I always change the lineup. I would say this week, uh, Johnnie Walker blue was leading off. You got to start with some strong shit, right? Pappy van Winkle is in second, and then I would put a angel's envy at third.

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       MacCallum rare cass. Rare cask is baton cleanup. All right? Then I'd have Yippy Kai, Yay.

Speaker 6:          00:39:38       Fifth.

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       And then once she gets in the middle of this is just when I just want to get fucked up. Right. Those other ones. Angels. Entities also want a good one just to get fucked up on, you know, it's not that expensive either. Then you get to the middle of the order, but it's like I'm staying at home and I'm getting drunk by myself, or I'm getting drunk with a friend of mine that it appreciates good whiskey, bourbon or whatever. When I get in the middle, then it's like [inaudible], patroned silver. Maybe I put grand patrol where I put angel's envy. That's why I got that. Okay. Grant patrol it fucking the third spot. Then I got [inaudible], then I got fucking angel's envy and then Johnny Walker Black.

Speaker 6:          00:40:19       Okay. Those are the next three.

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       So then you've got eight and nine and that's when you know, you just have fucking, yeah, just people coming over and they just want to get shit faced and you just got to go maker's Mark Fucking, uh, Jack Daniels, you know? And then if you just have a complete fucking shit at, do you just give him Red Label? Fucking Johnny Walker. All right, so here's this person's Booz lineup. All right. He goes, I love your idea about doing a booze alcohol battling lineup. Here's my submission leading off Kentucky Tavern. I'd never heard of this. This is what I love. It's going to give me new shit to try. Dependable, a little rough around the edges, but you know this guy's going to get on base at a 400 clip even if he has to lean into one every now and then. I love that this person broke it all down and give me a scouting reports to when you send these in [inaudible] second core nitos. What the fuck is that? Juanito's a can be streaky at times, but still has a little bit of a pop if you mix it with grapefruits. Soda, Dude, Jersey and your second guy, you're already mixing it with something.

Speaker 6:          00:41:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       Alright. Oh Shit. Hang on a second. Speaking of that, some Josh just asked me if I had soda. No, I don't. I got to do a voice text here. Get the Phanta orange with the Mexican sugar. There you go. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       That's right. When I'm fucking not booze and I actually drink Fanta Orange Soda. It's kind of nice cause it's really sweet. And then you got the smoke. You know, it's not redundant. Remember big night when that lady got the pasta and then she also ordered mashed potatoes and the guy wouldn't do it cause it was two starches. You know, why would you have a cigar and then drink something really PD. It's like fucking redundant. You want some, a sweet kind of alcohol, um, fucking with you. I'm not actually, I do. Okay. So batting third, this guy has bullet. This is your franchise player. He makes everyone around him a little better. Plus he's going to give you a team friendly, longterm contract that won't have you paying luxury taxes. Do this guy's great. You know, we took a funny idea. Now he's taken it to, he didn't even funnier level.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       All I did was just, I got to break down each player now. All right. Batting Cleanup Knob Creek. He goes, can you tell I'm a bourbon drinker. I can never keep them straight. Egos. Bottom line is if there's any ducks left on the pond, this guy is there to deliver it. And the knockout punch. I gotta tell you the way he's describing this lineup, he's definitely making the playoffs. If not fucking winning the pennant. I'm batting fifth Smirnoff vodka. Okay? Definitely nothing to write home about, but when surrounded with the right personnel, there's always potential for magic. You know what my vodka is? My goto vodka. I like Belvedere. Oh, Belvedere, come here, boy. I like that better than grey goose. Grey goose is just like, that's like soft rock, like easy listening. You know what I mean? I like Belvedere. It's got a little more of a fucking bite to it, but I don't know much about vodka is either a batting six Johnny Walker black.

Speaker 1:          00:43:29       Now you might be now. Might be a good time dimension. I'm in my early thirties thank goodness this guy is a September call up. You're not quite ready to add them to your 40 man roster just yet. Buddies for a cup of, but he's up for a cup of coffee because you know he's going to be an important part of your future. Yeah. Maybe you can get on base and steal second. All right. Batting seventh. Oh Jesus do this is unforgivable. If you're in your thirties, this is unforgivable and I respect you that you can still drink this Yeager meister. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       Wow. You often find yourself wondering why this guy is even still around and yet you feel you can Burma you wait and yet you can, you feel like you can remember a time when he was actually pretty good. Yeah. He's like the fucking, uh, one of those guys. We had just like, you know, like Vince Carter still plan. It's not fair to Vince Carter because Vince Carter was one of the greatest fucking, you know, I think the best dunker of all fucking time. High of certainly the highest jumper. I Apologize, I shouldn't have said Vince Carter was the first guy I thought of. He is like a, uh, uh, up. Do you have moon? Do you ever one like Giobbie was playing on the Colorado Rockies. It's like one of those deals. All right. Captain Morgan Batting Eighth, definitely a role player. This, this I, that's like your catcher.

Speaker 1:          00:44:53       This guy could be a superstar, but he's got a bit of a sweet tooth and always shows up to spring training, 20 pounds overweight. Now he's the panda still. You know, he's good for a sac flying a key situation. Yeah. One of these guys just has to, you're out there for defense, you know, he's not hitting for average. Alright. Batting ninth, wild Turkey, American honey, and he writes old ggs a, you ask him to lay down a bunt and you just know he's going to hit into an inning ending double play every damn time. Uh, by the way, if it's, if it's a close one, I'm putting in buffalo trace in place of Jaeger as a defensive substitution through this guy's brilliant. So that's my lineup. Thanks for the idea. I enjoyed putting this together. Even if you don't read it now, Dude, I love that you broke it all down. All right, here's another guy's lineup. All right. His whiskey lineup. Bullet, Eagle, rare batting third macallan 12 batting fourth angel's envy, cask strength. I never had that. D h a I might fuck up some of the names of these. Uh, Bell Bell. Vinny, 12 years, single malt. Glen Levitt, French Oak. I can't deal with the florals. I don't like the floors. I like more that PD thing. Like the Glen Levitz. I'd never been able to a quite handle this, but I, I respect them. They are definitely in the hall of fame of booze. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       oh fuck. He's going to stop by a Taco. Oh, Jesus Christ. What is he talking about? No, fuck. He's gonna stop by Taco truck to get the fucking booze. No, no, no, no, no, no. The soda I made. Hang on, let me hit pause and straighten this up. All right, I'm back. So anyways, uh, Glen Levitt, French oak, six number seven, Willie pots. Still Reserve. Never heard of that one. Number eight, Jefferson's ocean aged at. See Jesus. Sounds like low tide shit to me. Number nine, Hudson Bay starting pitcher is blends. I've got to do a starting pitcher. Middle Reliever, uh, giving you a re a reliable couple innings makers. 46 closer is Alijah Craig barrel proof. Dude, I love everybody going with the starting pitchers. Then you got to have your middle Raliegh. Eylea yeah, actually actually had middle relief. Oh my God, Dude. This is, this is endless.

Speaker 1:          00:47:18       And then you don't see, you're gonna get some real big time. Booz hounds that nine, you know, positions in the batting lineup, but not going to be enough. They're going to have to go thick enough to like, I dunno, do like a a football team. 11 offensive players. This isn't fair to people over in Europe. Go ahead, give me your fucking lineups and use all the fucking soccer terminology. Maybe I'll learn something. All right is another not last booze line up here. Dear Billy, no fun. No fuss, no Muss, no brainer in answer to your requests for our batting lineups of booze. I'm not much of a drinker anymore, so I'll go the other way and do my recreational drug lineup. I love it. I love it. You guys have taken this idea and running with it. This is tremendous. All right. Number one, weed number two, black hash, preferably from Nepal.

Speaker 1:          00:48:08       Number three, magic mushrooms. Batting cleanup, LSD, preferably purple. Owsley never tried it, but according to Ken Casey, it was the best number five, ecstasy, pure and uncut. Number six, ketamine. I don't want this number seven, cocaine, pure and uncut cocaine. Pure on up unconscious should be fucking, that sounds like a speedster, man. Get him on base. He fucking still second. You have LSD. Fucking bring them home with a single door, right? I don't know. Running on a full count. You're not going to catch that guy. He might score from first. All right, number eight, peyote pot number nine, masculine, pure and uncut. Hey Bill, on Thursday you were talking about the sound of drums in the 70s. I watched this recently and thought it would be informative to you over overhead, Mike with a compressor on it. Um, you guys have to watch this. If you're in, are there

Speaker 3:          00:49:05       any type of music? I actually watched this thing and it's, do you know that sound of a Phil Collins Drums, the famous drum fill from in the air tonight that Gaga go, go, go, go good. Don't, don't dumb. And it was, you got to watch this video, how they came up with that drum sound was an accident and then everybody used it and it literally became the sound of the 80s. And now it's back. I guess Taylor swift used it in some song called 1989 and all that. But if you just, if you're into that nerdy audio stuff, like I found this out great. My fucking drum teacher, Davy Lich is, I was tuning up my drums, you know, I got some back east and says old Slingerland kit and it's a a third, a 12. Wait, no, a nine by 13, 14, and an 18. It was 13, 14, Tom's and then an 18 inch floor and a 24 inch kick.

Speaker 3:          00:50:01       And I ended up adding another, I've found a, uh, from the same era, a 16 inch floor Tom. And then I added another base drum. So I got to 20 fours. All right. This is my first attempt to get, to try and get away from just aping and doing a bad job of everything John Bonam did. I was getting into Primus and my, my brothers, they were playing like speed metal and shit and they would try and I always try to get me into Metallica, slayer and all them and I just, I just was too much of a fucking idiot to realize how great that music was. And I could have seen all those bands on their first tours and I didn't do it. Um, so anyways, uh, I went home and I was tuning up the bass drum and um, I just couldn't get a good fucking sound and it was this weird like vibrating fucking sound or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:50:52       And I text my teacher, I said, yeah, I'm getting this weird like a buzzer rat on. He said, is there a hole in the front head? I was like, this guy's a fucking genius. Could genius because what happened is there wasn't a hole in the front head, but where they were or something fell on it and puncture just a little list of hole. I said it was a tiny little, it goes, that would be enough to fuck it up cause I couldn't get that boom sound. And, um, so now I'm like obsessing about it. I gotta get, I gotta get back east again. I want to try tuning them up again. And um, I've now become obsessed with like different heads and I used to be so afraid to try and tune my drums. I'd have somebody else do it and then I just wouldn't touch them.

Speaker 3:          00:51:34       And I play them until they sucked again. And then I hope I could find somebody else rather than just biting the bullet and being like, just take out your drum key and start fucking with it and ask people who know how to do it, to teach you how to do it and keep fucking doing it. You asshole. But you know, part of me, I mean, an asshole is you don't do shit like that. All right. Apocalypse. Hey there, dilly dilly. Hey there, Billy death bell. Uh, the Internet keeps talking about the end of times as if things today are far worse than they've ever been. I'm only 31 years old, but I seem to remember plenty of bad weather and shitty presidents. Um, there's this need to make everything sound worse than it is these days because everyone loves to be the bearer of bad news and they get a thrill off the excitement that shit may be going south real quick. I saw a quote by John Mayer on Twitter. Someone asked him what annoys him? And he says, spacious argument. It's everywhere. I can't stand it. Is that, as I say that right? The Fed has a, the fetishization of defense attorney logic gone mainstream. Ugh. Well, he's obviously a smarter person than me because I don't want any of that means spacious argument. It's everywhere. I can't stand at the fetishization of defense attorney logic gone mainstream.

Speaker 3:          00:53:04       That right there is why he's a brilliant guitars cause I don't know what the fuck he just did, but I don't, I don't know that anybody's ever put words together like that. I don't know what that means. Uh, I totally agree. Everyone thinks they're dropping the mic and they're just pandering and reaching for low hanging fruit. Now that I agree with. Yes. A P s keep the 90s music coming though that Fiona Apple Song that Andrew used last week reminded me of the summer.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       I started jerking off save the pet store manager from, from last week. I don't know what that means. Yeah. Andrew picks the music. I wish I was could claim a that I was as cool as to know all this shit that he does. He knows a bunch about music. Um, yeah, there is a lot of that. There's a lot of gloom and doom and all that type of shit, but uh, you know, it's not all it is. I, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:53:52       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       The Great Barrier Reef and all that type of shit is pretty terrifying. All of that shit is pretty fucking terrifying. And uh, I mean, I can't even focus on it if you actually get passed all the dopes on social media talking about things and you actually listened to scientists talking about like whatever their predictions are. Um, I know that there's, I don't know, this sounds like a, uh, you know, I think it's going to be a no, it should be interesting. We'll see. I hope that wrong. You know, who the fuck knows? I Dunno. All right. The DNC, everybody dear Mr. Burn, I'm appalled and disgusted that you had the Addis audacity to speak poorly of Debbie Schultz. Wasserman, a lifelong servant of her country and the only party, uh, that has moved this country forward. I usually enjoy your brand of humor. There's no way this person's serious. I have C, I have c parts of your comedy specials and overheard a handful of episodes of your podcast while in the proxy of my brother in law, a. You Sir, I have a responsibility to tell the truth and not just your uninformed opinions on politics, that the seat that you distribute is going to aid in the dismantling of this country. Oh God, no. God, give me a fucking break. You just happened to be walking by and you heard that. Well, you know, the whole part of this podcast is that I am uninformed.

Speaker 5:          00:55:26       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       and I sent a link that you could watch on Youtube and listened to that lawyer discussing the things that she did or didn't do. So I don't know what you fucking problem is. You know, I talk about politics. The way I talk about sports is someone who never did it at a professional level. I met Schultz Wasserman a few years back and I asked her what we could do every day to change the nation for the better. And she eloquently said, do not let them tell you how to feel. Oh God, I'm not reading the rest of this. This is fucking sincerely a proud Democrat who will not be discouraged. You know what you sound like. You sound like someone, you know, when someone comes up to me and says, the Patriots are cheaters, and then I say, who's your team? And then I talk about the shit that they've done. And then they downplay that. Yet you are, I've gotta be honest with you, as uninformed as I am. Um, people like you, I can't

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       even talk to because you're so lost in your blue ties that you can't see that it's this. You know what? It's like everybody out here in Hollywood loves to sit there and Trash Fox News and talk about how there are all these bullies and all that, and I'm going to tell you, I'm not gonna name any fucking names, but the amount of performers, comedians, actresses, and all this type of shit, like their level of zero tolerance like they are, they are literally what they're fighting. They're bullies. They tell people how they're supposed to think the way they're supposed to think and they feel that they are 100% right. They feel that their view of the world is the way that the world should be. And anyone who doesn't think that needs to be attacked, needs to be dragged on stage and humiliated needs to have their, their, their ability to earn a living attacked.

Speaker 3:          00:57:18       It's no difference than when you watched what Fox News did, did the Dixie chicks, it's the exact same fucking thing, the exact same level of righteousness, patting themselves on the back about how fucking smart they are and how informed they are. You know, meanwhile as they fly around and fucking private jets, give me a fucking break. Give me a fucking break. Okay. You know, the Patriots Cheat, your team cheats, the Republican's a pieces of shit. The Democrats are pieces of shit. Alright, there you go. There you go. So, and other than anything other than that, you're looking at shit through fucking rose colored glasses. And, um, I think it's, I think that that is a, I don't know what to think. I just, I can't have a conversation with that. You know what I mean? It's like if I listen to a red sox fan back with Derek Jeter was playing and they just say that he sucks and he's fucking overrated and blah, blah. And I would just sit there and be like, no, he isn't. He's fucking won one of the greatest players of all time. I'd love if he was on my team. You know, I hate the Yankees, but I, I'm not going to hate on greatness. Marianne Rivera is the greatest fucking closer of all time. I still fucking hate the Yankees, but I don't hate him to a level that I can't see.

Speaker 6:          00:58:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:58:35       I can't see that. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          00:58:38       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:58:39       I just don't, I just don't fucking understand it. I don't understand it. Like you want to talk about spy, Geeky and the Patriots. We're guilty of cheating. Deflate Gate was bullshit. Spy Gate was true. However, they were only guilty of, of doing it for one game. And I only clarify that because everybody thinks well they should take away all their titles because that's what they were doing now. That was the first game. It was illegal and they kept fucking doing it. All right. And they were 100% guilty or they deserve to be fucking fine because they were cheating then. Yes, they were that one time. All the other stuff was bullshit though. However, if they, cause I'm a one deflate gay came out, I was like, if they did this shit again, I'm done with this fucking team. That's what I said. And then I watched the whole fucking thing unfold and I was like, oh, this was just bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:59:23       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       so there you go. Does that sound evenhanded you guys probably think I'm too much of a patriots fan, but I mean I did it. They spygate was cheating and they were guilty. They did it one game. Raymond. Janie fucking ratted him out. Okay, then that was it. They will fucking guilty. What are you going to do? Does that make them worse than anybody else? No. Bill Walsh fucking cheated. So there you go. They should democrats and you Republicans say the Patriots are Democrats. I'm a patriots fan, so I am a democrat. Okay. But I could see their fucking, I can see that spygate was fucking cheating and they were guilty of it. And I could also see that Bill Walsh.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       Fuck it. Did the same thing when he pretended his fucking headsets went out. It's not that fucking heart. Um, I don't understand what your point is that the, Oh my God, this person was used to fucking meeting proves, you know, they said, would she, we do easy. Don't let them capitols tell you how to feel. That is such like, that has got to be the most vague. I'm on my way to my town car fucking horseshit response ever.

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       Hey Bill. Uh, what's your secret to being as successful standup comedian? Uh, you just get out there and keep doing it, man. All right. Girlfriend won't take racist last name. All right, dear. Bills burry. Doughboy Hey, fuck you man. I'm under one 80. Okay. Go easy. Go easy. You know. All right, dear bill's very doughboy. Uh, my girlfriend of three years has made it very clear that if we, if I were to propose to her that she would not take my last name. The reason being is that she feels my last name is racist. The name is Koons, spelled c. O. N. S. I told her that I have never encountered a problem having this last name and she has nothing to worry about. Thoughts. Yeah. Here's my thoughts. I think you're making this up and if you're not, um, that woman is too dumb to marry and reproduce with.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       Yeah. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       If you call a black person a coon that is racist. If your last name is coons, it isn't, you know, like I see if your last name was the n word, then yeah. I mean, maybe you want to, you know, yeah. I mean, if it's, I don't know. I, yeah, I mean if that's your fucking last name, that's a believable last name, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:02:00       You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:02:03       I Dunno. Anyways, my roommate is, you know, like, I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think of a fucking racial group I can do here without getting in trouble. Cause I want to really do a fucking, I guess I got to go against my own, my own fucking racist. What I do if there's no good ones, there is no good ones with white people. Cause like it doesn't have an effect on us. Nah. Shit. You know what I mean? I don't know. Maybe in the future some other group takes over and then we'll have that. We'll have our, you know, you can't call me cracker. Um, I love crackers. I love putting cheese on it. My roommate is a fucking Weirdo. Dear Conti. McConn fuck. Uh, first of all, a big fan of the fucking podcast, the last fucking Netflix special was phenomenal. So thanks. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       Now needs is one of these people that thinks, because I swear that now they have to swear. You don't have to bring yourself down to my level, sir. Anyways, I just fucking moved into college as a freshman. My roommate is a hot motherfucker. I mean I'm gay. So right away I was into them, but I kept to myself since I had no way of knowing he was gay too. I thought you guys had Gaydar you couldn't sense it. Um, so last week on Friday after a fucking drunk at night out, we returned to our room. Oh Geez. Here we go. And the fucking guy offhandedly tells me he's gay. Once the conversation started getting more personal, then I told them I'm also gay and this guy says fag. I don't think this is real. After which we proceeded to fuck, which was fucking amazing. By the way. I find the term, I find the fag term endearing. So fuck all the political correctness. Hysteria by gays and non gaze alike. All right, I'm just going to read this. Okay. Anyways, this is when the shit started to hit the fan. No Pun intended. Sorry Dude. You loved it over the fucking net. Um, once I came, he expressed disappointment at the volume of my comp. Does anyone believe this is true? The fucker literally said that's it. What? Are you sick or something? I felt fucking inadequate sense. His load was considered really bigger than mine.

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:15       Oh Jesus Christ. So then the next morning he says he wants to fuck again. I go along with it like, he's so hot, I'm not going to refuse halfway through this motherfucker says, you know, for a tall guy, you sure have a small Dick.

Speaker 2:          01:04:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:31       And he writes like, what the fuck? Yeah. Well Dude, you came back from more abuse here. So I'm all for two, right? Inadequate Dick size check, lack of Herculean come shot check. Uh, is insulting the people. He fucks part of his style. Like I can't figure out why he still wants to fuck. We have to, to colossal fucking insults. So what the fuck do I do next? So stop fucking the guy. Ah, fuck knows. But the next day we're chugging peers in our room.

Speaker 2:          01:05:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       You know, other than, than the gay sexist sounds amazing that, sorry, I'm looking at this as a straight guy. Um, what the fuck am I? Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:05:15       okay. Well chugging beers, a room and he suggest something beyond weird. Oh God. He's basically tells me He wants me to pee in his mouth. You know, even if this is fake, this is tremendously Korean. If you got to give this up a case since it turns him on, since it turns a mom, I'm eight beers deep and I'm a lightweight, so I'm like, fuck it dude. I swear to God, if this is true and you piss in this guy's mouth and he's like [inaudible] I set a, this motherfucker has a stream like a God damn firehose and nearly broke my jaw in the process.

Speaker 1:          01:05:47       What? I don't believe that Jesus Christ. So I'm completely weirded out by this colossal cont dude. You let them piss in your mouth. His only saving graces that he happens to be the hottest guy I ever met. So bill, what the fuck do I do? Do I change room, kick this con to the curb and sleep and never sleep with the game or do I stick stick in there so that I can stick it in there. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. You McGee Bitch. Uh, I don't know. It sounds like you feel bad afterwards. If I was with a woman and she was doing this shit to me and she was really hot, yeah, I'd probably keep going back, but I would just get myself mentally prepared. You know what you might do just telling me as a weird asshole.

Speaker 7:          01:06:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       You got to get in his head. Tell him a, his ass is too hairy. He needs to braid the hair on his ass of, so I don't know what the fuck did to, I mean [inaudible] you're outside, you know, this is still basically human interaction. So you're talking about feelings here. So do you want to get childish to say something mean to him and uh, I don't know. You know what's weird is Josh just showed up and now I have to smoke a cigar after reading that shit. Yeah, dude, don't, don't fucking go back. Don't go back for more. Right. Or if you're going to go back for more, I'm sorry, I'm texting him. Hey, hang on. All right. Uh, yeah, you don't need to put up with that shit. Everything's like a pun in this. Um, the weird thing is that you live with the guy. It's never good to fuck your roommate. You know, it's, that's, that's never going to be a good thing. But I don't know how it works with gay guys cause you're both guys. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       So I would think you'd be able to just be like, yeah, we'll just fucking write. Then we'll watch a game and fucking drink some beers and I'll fucking piss in your mouth. Evidently. I guess that's how it goes down. I don't know what the fuck happens here. So I would just, uh, if he sincerely is making you feel bad, then I would, I would try to find a better guy. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:07:58       but consider you live with them. You obviously get to see kids. Nike, you can just blow the guy off. So at some point he's going to be like, hey man, you want to fuck you gotta be like, Nah, I don't. You'd be like, why not? It'd be okay cause you're a dick. You say mean shit to me and I don't like it. All right, so why don't you in there and go rub one out and piss in your own fucking mouth. You're fucking Dosha or you just move up. All right, that's the podcast. Everybody, God bless each and every one of you. Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
