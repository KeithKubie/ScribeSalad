00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:09.857
Many generations have felt 
they've reached the pinnacle

00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:12.117
of technological advancement,

00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:14.198
yet look back 100 years,

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:16.947
and the technologies 
we take for granted today

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:19.903
would seem like impossible magic.

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:21.837
So will there be a point

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:26.767
where we reach an actual limit 
of technological progress?

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:31.258
And if so, are we anywhere near
that limit now?

00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:32.479
Half a century ago,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.788
Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev
was asking similar questions

00:00:36.788 --> 00:00:40.419
when he came up with a way
to measure technological progress,

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:44.571
even when we have no idea exactly
what it might look like.

00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:47.789
Anything we do in the future
will require energy,

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.498
so Kardashev's scale
classifies potential civilizations,

00:00:51.498 --> 00:00:55.508
whether alien civilizations out there
in the universe or our own,

00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:59.779
into three levels based 
on energy consumption.

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:02.500
The tiny amount of energy
we currently consume

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.249
pales next to what we leave untapped.

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:08.218
A Type I, or planetary civilization,

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:12.310
can access all the energy resources
of its home planet.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.919
In our case, this is the 174,000
terawatts Earth receives from the Sun.

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:22.370
We currently only harness 
about 15 terawatts of it,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.760
mostly by burning solar energy
stored in fossil fuels.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.409
To approach becoming 
a Type I civilization,

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.301
we would need to capture solar energy
more directly and efficiently

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:36.611
by covering the planet with solar panels.

00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:38.711
Based on the most optimistic models,

00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:42.090
we might get there 
within just four centuries.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.569
What would be next?

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.981
Well, the Earth only gets a sliver
of the Sun's energy,

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:51.620
while the rest of its 400 yottawatts
is wasted in dead space.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.251
But a Type II, or stellar civilization,

00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:57.801
would make the most 
of its home star's energy.

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:00.562
Instead of installing solar panels
around a planet,

00:02:00.562 --> 00:02:05.831
a Type II civilization would install them
directly orbiting its star,

00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:09.652
forming a theoretical structure
called a Dyson sphere.

00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:10.971
And the third step?

00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:16.170
A Type III civilization would harness
all the energy of its home galaxy.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.762
But we can also think of progress
in the opposite way.

00:02:19.762 --> 00:02:21.681
How small can we go?

00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:24.492
To that end, British cosmologist
John Barrow

00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:28.972
classified civilizations by the size
of objects they control.

00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:32.432
That ranges from mechanical structures
at our own scale,

00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:34.752
to the building blocks of our own biology,

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:37.642
down to unlocking atoms themselves.

00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:42.413
We've currently touched the atomic level,
though our control remains limited.

00:02:42.413 --> 00:02:46.012
But we potentially could 
go much smaller in the future.

00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:48.514
To get a sense of the extent 
to which that's true,

00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:54.542
the observable universe is 26 orders 
of magnitude larger than a human body.

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:58.433
That means if you zoomed out
by a factor of ten 26 times,

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:01.273
you'd be at the scale of the universe.

00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:05.183
But to reach the minimum length scale,
known as the Planck length,

00:03:05.183 --> 00:03:08.712
you would need to zoom in 35 times.

00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:13.782
As physicist Richard Feynman once said,
"There's plenty of room at the bottom."

00:03:13.782 --> 00:03:15.143
Instead of one or the other,

00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:17.973
it's likely that our civilization will
continue to develop

00:03:17.973 --> 00:03:21.654
along both Kardashev and Barrow scales.

00:03:21.654 --> 00:03:25.313
Precision on a smaller scale lets us
use energy more efficiently

00:03:25.313 --> 00:03:29.013
and unlocks new energy sources,
like nuclear fusion,

00:03:29.013 --> 00:03:30.614
or even antimatter.

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:35.693
And this increased energy lets us
expand and build on a larger scale.

00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:38.684
A truly advanced civilization, then,

00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:43.339
would harness both stellar energy
and subatomic technologies.

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.165
But these predictions weren't made
just for us humans.

00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:48.050
They double as a possible means

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.324
of detecting intelligent life 
in the universe.

00:03:51.324 --> 00:03:54.305
If we find a Dyson sphere 
around a distant star,

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:57.146
that's a pretty compelling sign of life.

00:03:57.146 --> 00:04:01.575
Or, what if, instead of a structure that
passively soaked up all the star's energy,

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.635
like a plant,

00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:07.310
an alien civilization built one that 
actively sucked the energy out of the star

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.813
like a hummingbird.

00:04:09.813 --> 00:04:13.714
Frighteningly enough, we've observed
super dense celestial bodies

00:04:13.714 --> 00:04:15.675
about the size of a planet

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:19.085
that drain energy out 
of a much bigger star.

00:04:19.085 --> 00:04:21.095
It would be much too premature to conclude

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:23.385
that this is evidence 
of life in the universe.

00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:25.735
There are also explanations 
for these observations

00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:28.145
that don't involve alien life forms.

00:04:28.145 --> 00:04:31.007
But that doesn't stop us 
from asking, "What if?"
