00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.190
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.580
Today's event is sponsored
by the Science, Technology,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.800
and Business Division, here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.810
I'm Tomoko Steen and this is
specialist, here at the Library.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.140
And this is one of the
Science Literacies.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.830
And today's topic is
molecular anthropology.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.130
Is that right?

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.520
And genetics.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.730
Anthropology, genetics.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.230
Today's speaker, Doctor
Adam Wilkins.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.430
He's a geneticist and author.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.280
He has also wrote several
books, previously.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.000
And he has been trained
as a geneticist,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.520
especially microbiogenetics
[phonetic].

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.700
And he has worked on a
that, a few of those times.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.140 position:56%
But he turned himself into the more
science writing and public outreach.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.080
He has been the editor of the
''BioEssays'' [inaudible] journal.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.020
As well as, now he is the editor
of the Perspective section

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.690
of the Genetics, which is the
probably the leading journal

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.720
for the field of genetics.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.410
And Doctor Wilkins have done
PhD at University of Washington.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.890
And so, he was born
in Columbus, Ohio.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.590
But currently, he is
at Humboldt University.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.540
So, a lot of people ask me,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.750
''Is he a German?'' Surely,
he's American, I guess.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.110
But it's going to be
an interesting talk.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.020
And we have a book, outside.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.150
So, after this we have
a book signing.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.500
So, if you are interested, take
a look at the book, as well.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.510 position:56%
And before [inaudible], maybe we
just invite speaker, Doctor Wilkins.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.910
[ Applause ]

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.730
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Tamoko, thank you
very much, of that introduction.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.150
And even more, I'd like to thank
you and the Library of Congress

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.080
for inviting me to come speak.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.650
It really is an honor and
a privilege to be here.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.970
The Library of Congress is a
bastion of American civilization

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.890
and as such, the defender of
fundamental American values.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.810
And those need defense
as much today,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.250
as they have at any other time.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.890
So, my topic is indeed the
evolution of the human face.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.590
Or if we were to put it in terms
that Rudyard Kipling might like,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.590
how our species acquired its face.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.920
As background, too.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.520
Before I get into the
subject itself,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.450
I'd just like to say a little bit
about how I got interested in it.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.760
As Tomoko said, my
background is in other things,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.440
particularly microbial genetics.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.610
But I've always been
interested in evolution.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.240
And I think it's safe to say that
for most of the 20th century,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.830
evolutionary biology had a
very self-consistent reasonable

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.180
logical theory.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.990
But there is a real
lack of specificity

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.620
to how much one could say about
specific evolutionary changes,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.860
for which there was evidence.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.840
But we could not tie specific
genes and genetic factors

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.320
to particular evolutionary changes.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.010
So, in a way it was a kind of.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.690
It was a good theory, but it
lacked a certain kind of rigor.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.960
But beginning in the 1970s and
acquiring strength in the 1980s,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.480
it began to be possible to
isolate genes, specifically.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.540
And make very specific hypotheses

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.370
about what particular genes
were doing in evolution.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.380
Not the least in how
particular genes were responsible

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.200
for particular traits
in different organisms.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.750
And for some of the interest
in evolution or biology,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.570
this is the prospect
of scientific heaven.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.640
To be able to really
have good concrete ideas

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.420
about what genes might be involved

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.910
in evolutionary changes
of particular kinds.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.840
So, I wasn't involved as a
laboratory scientist, in this work.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.650
But I was very interested in
it, and I wrote commentaries.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.360
And I finally, wrote a book
that summed up the state

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.770
of the field, which
came out in 2002.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.090
And shortly after the book became
published, I found myself thinking,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.840
''Well, how might this
kind of thinking apply

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.810
to human evolution?'' We are a
distinctive looking animal species.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.110
We are animals.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.420
Of course, we are a lot more.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.050
Our species is unique
in what it does

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.650
in the world, and what it has done.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.230
But surely, there would be a
scope, I felt, for this new branch

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.700
of evolutionary biology, called
evolutionary developmental biology.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.440
To say something interesting
about humans, human evolution.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.980
And surely, after having
this thought, I felt, ''Ah,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.880
the human face might be a
particularly interesting aspect

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.370
of human characteristics,
of human biology,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.790
to focus on.'' It was more
just a hunch and a feeling.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.370
Because at the time, actually
there was very little one could say

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.590
about the genes that are involved
in constructing the human face.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.690
And that might be involved in the
evolutionary series that gave rise

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.810
to our species, and out
particular kind of face.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.280
For various reasons, I couldn't
start on the book, right away.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.380
Having to do with work
and other projects.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.900
And I didn't really start on
it in a serious way until 2011.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.620
And it was a good thing that
I waited, because in a sense,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.010
there was very little known
when I first had the idea.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.280
By the time I got started
on the book,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.980
there was a great deal
more information.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.500
So, in effect, the field had caught
up with my ambitions to write

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.820
about it, which was nice.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.970
Okay. So, let us.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.410
I'll just add one more thing.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.970 position:56%
That is that in the sense, as I
worked on the book I found the focus

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.140
of my interest changing, somewhat,
from that of how the genes

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.620
that are involved in
making the human face.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.510
How they'd evolved and how
their expression characteristics

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.810
had changed.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.580
More to the why of this.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.520
What was it in our
evolutionary history,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.900
the evolution of our species,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.350
that really has made
us the species we are?

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.110
So, while my official title for
this talk is ''Making Faces,

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.390
the Evolutionary Origins
of the Human Face'',

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.550
The alternative title
gives more of a hint

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.970
as to what I'm going to focus on.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.130
How our evolving face
helped make us human.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.190
Okay. So, let us begin
with a basic question.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.240
What precisely do we
mean by the face?

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.030
Now, we all recognize faces.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.000
And even in this sort
of caricature of form,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.590
that is Clerdia [phonetic] face.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.120
But how do we define the face?

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.830
It's always good to start with a
clear definition of one's subject.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.180 position:56%
And briefly, the face is the forward
directed part of the animal's head

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.610
with a mouth and three
kinds of sense organs

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.720
for vision, smell, and taste.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.860
Forward directed means the
face is set in the direction

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.820
of movement of the animal.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.830
So, our faces do, indeed, look
forward toward the environment

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.300
that the animal is entering.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.400
And what I have here, is pictures
represented of vertebrates.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.830
So, we are in the group of
animals termed the vertebrates,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.270
which are a subdivision of a
major group called the Chordata.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.830
We needn't go into
those details very much.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.210
But the vertebrates, all
the animals with backbones,

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.710
consist of about 50,000 species.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.910
Which is roughly a
half to one percent

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.150
of all the estimated existing
animal species in the world.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.830
Still, 50,000 is a big number.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.740
And all vertebrates have
faces, as you can see, here.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.220
We cannot see the sensor
organs very directly,

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.060
in this, but of course, you can.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.050
Well, except for the eyes.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:32.550
So, what we have here, is a fish,
an amphibian, a reptile, bird.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:36.720
And two of my favorite
mammalian species, wolves and us.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:43.700 position:56%
And they all have eyes and some sort
of visible nostrils for olfaction.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.700
We can't see the organs of taste,
because they're within the mouth.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.280
So, another way of putting this,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.070
is to say that the face is the
sensory headquarters of the animal.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.650
Okay. It's a really concentrated
area of the animal's body,

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.650
that had three of the main
kinds of sensor organs.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.410
With, of course, the organs of
hearing, just behind the face.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.000
And they are in close
association with the mouth.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.080
Now, why is the face
constructed this way?

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.050 position:56%
Well, we get a clue from considering
the evidence that we have

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.410
on the earliest vertebrates,
which were tiny fish.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.240
And they did, indeed, have,
from everything we know.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.540
Of course, we don't know directly

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.760
about their organs of
taste and olfaction.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.180
But they had two eyes in
association with the mouth.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:40.570
And this must have been, for them,
a tremendous aid to being able

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.850
to find food and to ingest it.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:48.160
To have the eyes and the organs
of olfaction near the mouth,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.670
helps the animal, of
course, to find food.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.240
If you imagine the eyes and the
organs of olfaction back here,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.660
you can see that they wouldn't
be nearly as useful to the animal

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.250 position:56%
for finding food, as if they were
in close association with the mouth.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:08.800
So, having defined the face,
let's come to the question

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.810
of what makes the human face
particularly worth talking about?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.500
Is it just because it's
the face of our species?

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.600
Quite naturally, we are
interested in things

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.110
that relate directly to us.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.680
Just as most of us are more
interested in our family

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.570
and friends, than people
down the block,

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.250
whom we might see most every day.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.930
But whom we don't know
anything about.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.640
So, is the face primarily
interesting just

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.120
because it is our face?

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.530
Or is it, in fact, something, a
rather special and unusual face?

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.090
And I'm going to argue,
briefly, that it is, indeed,

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.650 position:56%
a very special and interesting face.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.590
So, to answer this question.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.280
If you're going to argue
there's something special,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.380
it's got to be special in
comparison to something else.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.010
And so, we need to compare it,
in this case, with other faces.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.900 position:56%
And let's just focus on the mammals,

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.820
which is our major subgroup
within the vertebrates.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.660
So, first of all, let me just admit

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.180
that there are some very
interesting, unusual,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.920
indeed special, faces
amongst mammals.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.430
And we have an assortment
of these, here.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.740
No need to go into details.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.110
You can see, immediately,
that they're not like you cat

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.900
or your dog, which are
more typical mammals.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.700
But the great majority of
mammals actually do have a kind

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.560
of typical generic face.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.710
There are 18 divisions within
the mammals, called orders.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.020
Okay. It's a taxonomic term.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.460 position:56%
And I've shown here, typical members

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.790
of eight different
orders of mammals.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.850 position:56%
And if I pick the examples from
most of the other orders of mammals,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.960
it would be a similar picture.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.880
The features that the typical
mammal has, are a muscle.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.530
Okay. Rather well-spaced eyes.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.380
Fur on the face.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.620
You can see that in all of these.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.920
And no real forehead.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.570
The head sort of slopes back,
gently, from just above the eyes.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.460
And those are the features
that make for a commonality

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.920
in the faces of most mammals.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.930
And once one has realized
that, one sees that, in fact,

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.800
even amongst some of the
oddballs that I showed earlier.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.250
Some of them have at least one
or two of those common features.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.220
And without going into
the details, though,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.250
just you know, make that point.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.610
But having accepted that fact

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.860
that there is this set
of common features.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.810
We then come to the
rather surprising fact,

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.570
that one of the most
unusual mammalian faces,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.580
is that of homo sapiens.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.240
That's ourselves.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.140 position:56%
Okay. And since most of us in this
room tend to think of the human face

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.720
as the prototypical,
hence, normal face.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.650
It may be a surprise to think
that we actually have a very odd

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.480
and different animal face.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.940
So, instead of just your
taking my word for this claim,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.150
that our face is particularly
unusual.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.960
I decided to quote an authority,
here, a man named Donald Enlow.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.370
I'm not sure if he's still alive.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:08.440
But he is or was one
of the great experts

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.220
on the craniofacial skeleton.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.480
In other words, the skull
and the bones of the face.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.440
And here, I'll just read out,
even though you can read it.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.740
I'll read it out.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.480
''The human face is different.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.110
Bu ordinary mammalian standards,
our facial features are unusual,

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.880
specialized, and perhaps
even grotesque.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.110
The long functional
muscle that marks the face

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.400
of most other mammalian forms,
is all but lacking in man.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.030
The associated snout is reduced

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.900
to a curious overhanging
vestige.'' Known as our nose.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:42.080
''The face is wide, flat, and
vertically disposed.'' Okay.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.520
We have these flat, and indeed,
vertically disposed faces.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.910 position:56%
''instead of graceful facial contour
sloping back to the skull roof,

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:54.990
the human face possesses a unique
bulbous, upright forehead in front

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.330
of an enormous braincase.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.050
The flattened face is diminutive in
character relative to the remainder

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.700
of the enlarged head.''
So, our faces are small,

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.410
relative to that of
most other mammals.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.580
''The eyes are close together
and they face straight forward.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.840
The human dental arches are
disproportionately small relative

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:18.590
to the size of the whole body.'' In
other words, we have smaller teeth.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:23.190
Okay. Indeed, the physical
features of our face are unusual.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.600
And for an evolutionary
biologist, that's interesting.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.530
But what makes the human face
truly unusual is not its structure,

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.860
but its behavior.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.220
And specifically, its capacity

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.660
for different expressions,
as illustrated here.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.740
Okay. Now, there are
altogether seven basic strong

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.060
human expressions.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.040
And one is neutral.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.320
Okay. Where you're not
showing any particular emotion.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.680
Anger, disgust, fear,
happiness, sadness,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.060
and surprise shown
in that order, here.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.080
The lines under the line drawns,
indicate the tension lines

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.450
from the muscles in the face
that create these expressions.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:07.750
I'll have a bit more to say about
the facial muscles, in a moment.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.880
So, most mammas do not
have this great range

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.450
of expressions, of
strong expressions.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.250
And certainly, the other
vertebrates; fish, amphibians,

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.010
reptiles, birds, do not
have anywhere near this.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.850
And I'll come back to the
why of that, in a moment.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.300
But some of our nearest, and I'm
tempted to say dearest relatives,

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:34.620
the great apes, in fact do
have large expressive capacity.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.290
As shown here, in this comparison.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.460
And you can make really
a very good judgment

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.240
that the strong expressions
they show.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.650
Which can often be likened

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:50.290
to particular human expressions
accompanying certain emotions,

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.690
really reflect those emotions,
because of the context.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.230
The chimpanzee happiness
expression occurs

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.730
when the animal is really
showing some pleasure

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.940
in the animals it's
interacting with.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.670
Or whatever.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:09.670
So, it's not pure anthropomorphism,
by a long shot.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.400
But these very expressive
animals, chimps, bonobos,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.580
gorillas a little bit less,
orangutans a little bit less.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.460
But these very facially expressive
animals don't have quite the full

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.960
range of expressions that we do.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.240
And this is just a
small illustration

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.920
of more subtle expressions
that our species exhibits.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.520
And one of the nice things, is that
almost everybody in this audience,

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.050
and in fact I'm sure
everybody in this audience.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:41.970 position:56%
Can read these expressions and
understand something of the emotions

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.410
that this person is
experiencing and displaying

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.390
in each of these situations.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.220
And altogether, there
are something like,

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.580
I don't know the precise number.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.060
There are people who study this.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.260
This is a whole large
area of research.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.810
There's something like 50 of
these so-called minor expressions.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.590
And that's a great number.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.130
So, I'm not going to make the claim

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.890
that we are the most facially
expressive animal on earth.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:09.260
Okay. And I stress facially,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.830
because other animals
really have different ways

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.540
of expressing their feelings
through body language.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.050
That is, body language
below the head.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.950
Through sound and other ways.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.630
But facially, we are the most
expressive animal on earth.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.030
And I say that, not only
because of this great range

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.900
of expressions we have that our
nearest animal cousins don't have.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.660
And there are scientific ways
to measure this, I should add.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:42.850
It's a method called FACS, which we
need not go into in detail, here.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.230
But by using FACS,
you can actually look

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.730 position:56%
at the expressions in other animals.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.640
And this has been done
with chimpanzees and dogs.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.690
And they really do by these
measurements, by this technique,

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.970
they really are less
expressive than we are,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.970
in the range of what they do.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.860
But in addition, the
frequency of our expressions,

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.870
I think we are probably the
most expressive animal on earth,

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.280
because we are talking animals.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.040
And when we talk to each
other, there is a play

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.810
of expressions on our face.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:16.000 position:56%
And if you watch any two people
having a conversation for any length

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.380
of time, more than just hello
goodbye, you will see this play

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.620
of expressions as a
kind of shadow dialog.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.050
And even if you can't hear the
words, you can tell something

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.300
about the feelings that are being
expressed accompanying the words.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.910
So, this raises an interesting
evolutionary question,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.070
''How did we become this
super-expressive animal using our

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:44.180
faces?'' So, the basic biological
foundation of this is a whole set

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.760
of muscles, called
the mimetic muscles,

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.900
and these are diagrammed, here.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.250
And again, we need not
go into the details.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.690
The key point is that the
mimetic muscles are found only

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.990
in the mammals.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.800 position:56%
And that's why the other vertebrates
aren't near as expressive.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.440
They don't have the capacity to
move their skin on their faces,

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.770
in the way that we mammals do
with these mimetic muscles.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.080
The face is the only
place on the mammal's body

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.550
where there's a direct connection
to the skin for moving the skin.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.260
Okay. And it's a mammalian
specialty.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:22.790
Now, other mammals have
many of these muscles.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:30.820
Many of the mammals that are not
primates don't have the full set.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.050
But our nearest relatives
do have the full set,

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.230
the gorillas and the chimpanzees.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.870
So, the fact that they are perhaps
somewhat less facially expressive,

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.150
is not due to difference
in the muscles.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:45.290
But it must be due to either the
way the muscles are innervated

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.260
or the mental processes that
activate the expressions.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.960
And I think it's the latter,

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.700
though in this lecture I won't
be able to document this.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.070
Just as I won't be able to document
many of the things that I say.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.960
But I go into them in the book.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.700
And of course, we'll be glad to
take questions on that, at the end.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:13.980 position:56%
So, having this whole set of complex
muscles isn't the sole explanation

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.090
for why we're such an
expressive species.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.270
But these are the elements
of our anatomy

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.460
that make those expressions
possible.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.610
So, let us now come to the
evolutionary questions.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.060
And the big one is, or
the first big one is,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.420
''What were the major changes
that led from fish faces

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.700
to the human face?'' And as I
mentioned, the first fishes evolved

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.390
around 500 million years, ago.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.900
And there is clearly a
great deal of difference

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.580
between this face and this face.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.290
Even though they are basic faces by
the criteria that I've mentioned.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:54.010
So, let us first look at
the general time scale.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:58.220
And then, we're going to
home in on this period

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.110
when the first primates arrived.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.100
So, I've spoken of us as mammals.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.400
We are, indeed, mammals.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.020
But we're within one special group
of the mammals, the primates.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.760
And the distinctive changes
that have evolved in our lineage

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.850
that have made our face what it is,

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:17.320
all arose in this relatively
short period.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.280
But let's look at the whole period
in which animals have existed.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.090
So, first of all, the
earth is estimated

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:28.270 position:56%
to be 4.5 billion years old, and
this is a fairly well-agreed figure.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.650
The first animals didn't appear
until only 600 million years, ago.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:37.000
So, about the last 12%
of the planet's history.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.870
These first animals were actually
very strange and not easily related

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.950
to more contemporary mammals.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.090
But the first vertebrates
and many of the modern kinds

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.640 position:56%
of animals originated here, starting
about 540 million years, ago.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.440
The first vertebrates
from their fossils,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.980
date to about 500 million
years, ago, as I mentioned.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.630
The first true mammals,
okay, animals that have fur

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.210
and whose females produce
milk for their young,

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.900
those are the key criteria
for making a mammal.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.060
Arose in the Jurassic
period, the age of dinosaurs.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:17.450
Maybe, 180 to 150 million
years, ago.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:21.470
The first primates, which are
our mammalian mother group,

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.020
arose about 60 million years, ago.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:30.540
And we humans arose, our species,
arose only 200,000 years, ago.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.920
So, if one were to take this
whole 600-million-year period

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.160
for the existence of
animals, our species arose.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.200
If you were to take
that as a 24-hour day,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.580
our species arose in
the last two minutes.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.400
Okay. We are really very
recently evolved animals

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.610
by a number of strong criteria.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.810
Okay. We can make that statement
with reasonable definitiveness.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.520
Now, there were humanlike
species, earlier,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.410
going back to roughly
2 million years, ago.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:09.210
But that's still only about the
last ten minutes of a 24-hour day.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.650
Okay. But what we will
want to look at now,

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.830
is how the particular features
that make our face special.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.530
Some which I enumerated, earlier
in that quote from Don Enlow.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:25.060
They all arose during
this 60-year period.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.360
And specifically.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.380
Here, let me backtrack.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:34.990
Let's just look at one early
change, which is important.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.560
And then, I'll take you
through a quick run-through

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.600
of a lot of evolutionary history.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.130
And then, we'll start
focusing on the primates.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:49.790
So, the first vertebrates arose
about 500 million years, ago.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.200
There were further changes.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.270
The big change was
the evolution of jaws.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:59.420
And here, I'm not talking about
the movie star eating shark.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:04.390
But these elements which
allow us to chew our food.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.410
The evolution of jaws
probably happened only once.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.060
It was a somewhat unlikely
evolutionary event.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:19.040
But it really opened up the
capacity of our line of animals

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.140
to ingest many different
kinds of food.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.150
Had we remained jawless
fish, like this,

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.130
probably the vertebrates
would never have expanded

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.870
in the way that they or we have.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:35.550
Okay. Now, here is a very quick
run-through of vertebrate history

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.170
that will just take
us up to the primates,

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.210
which is what we're interested in.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.510
Because it's within the primates

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.660
that our distinctive
form of face arose.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:50.120
So, about 300 million years,
ago, there were lobe finned fish,

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.170
which were the precursors

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.310
of the first land dwelling
animals, the amphibians.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:25:02.380
Amphibians gave rise to a number
of other land-living forms.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.330
In particular, the branch that
gave rise to the dinosaurs.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.470
And another branch
called the Synapsids,

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.070
which gave rise to the mammals.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.040
And indeed, these have been
called the mammal-like reptiles.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.600
The look very.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.440
This is Dimetrodon, a
famous early animal,

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.420
sometimes mistakenly
called a dinosaur.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.740
It was not.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.470
It was a Synapsid.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.290
And its key feature, which
you can't really see here,

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.490
that made it mammal-like,
was its different dentition.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.080 position:56%
There then, followed further changes

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.900
in which these more
reptilian-looking animals gave rise

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.200
to mammals.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.280
And finally, there
were true mammals.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:48.350
The date of true mammals, the
first dates are a little bit vague,

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.820
depending upon what you
define as a true mammal.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.290
But let's say about
150 million years, ago.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:59.160
Whereas, the modern forms of
mammals are more recent than that.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:04.620
And here, just to give
you some time sense

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.110
of when mammalian features
started arising.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:12.670
This is Dimetrodon, about
290 million years, ago.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:18.670
This is Cynognathus, an
early mammal-like form,

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.840
only 210 million years, ago.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.790
So, about 80 million years.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:28.000
Mammals clearly had their
own line of descent.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.860
So, a lot of this evolution
is summarized in this book.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.940
This is the first general account
of the evolution of the face,

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:41.190
by a man named William K. Gregory,
who was a curator at the Museum

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.050
of Natural History, in New York.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.780
And this is his classic book,
''Our Face from Fish to Man''.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:55.570
It was written in the aftermath of
the Scopes Trial, the famous trial

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.380 position:56%
which had as its issue, the question

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.200
of whether evolution should
be taught in the schools.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.460 position:56%
And this is a famous trial involving
famous lawyers, Charles Darrow

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.210
and William Jennings Bryan, two
major figures in American history.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.770
So, Gregory wrote this
book as a defense

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.670
of the existence of evolution.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.000
And his take-home message was
this; ''the basic structure

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.450
of vertebrate face has
stayed much the same,

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.550 position:56%
despite many changes in the details.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.280
Over 400 million years from the
early jawed fish to humans''.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.920
And that is, undoubtedly, true.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.050 position:56%
Here we have a fish skull with a
fish face and the rest of the skull.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.160
Here is a lion skull.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.670
And even though, of course, at one
level these look very different,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:47.190
in their fundamental
structure, they're much the same.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.800
So, along with its basic structure,

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.570 position:56%
the vertebrate face has retained its
central function from fish to man,

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:57.210
as sensory headquarters
plus the mouth.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.330
Despite all the changes in details
of structure in numerable species.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:08.700
Okay. So, the organs of smell and
taste and vision are much the same

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.180
in most mammalian faces, in their
location and their basic function,

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.970
as in some of the early
vertebrates, which were fish.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.540 position:56%
Okay. So, let's now come to the
primates, which is our mother group,

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.740
in which the distinctive
characteristics

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.360
of the human face arose.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.380
And I'm not going to go into the
details of mammalian evolution.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.330 position:56%
We're just focusing on the primates.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:41.050
One so-called taxonomic
order out of 18.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.470
And let us look at the.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.070
So, we are primates.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:50.690
And let us look at the earliest
primates, from which we arrived.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:51.990
And there are different views.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.810
You know, we're trying
to reconstruct things

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.760
that happened roughly 60
to 65 million years, ago.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.410
So, there are not living
eyewitnesses.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.490
So, it involves a matter

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.670
of scientific reconstruction
[inaudible].

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.350
And there are different views.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.490
From Robert Martin who is
one of the great experts

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.180
on primate evolution,
we have this view.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:19.410
From another group, we
have something closer to.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:23.330
We have a depiction that is
an alternative depiction.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.300
In a way, I'm cheating,
because this is presumed

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.220 position:56%
to be the earliest placental mammal.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.180
But the primates arose.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.640
Almost certainly arose quickly,
as a separate group from something

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.660
that might have looked like this.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.850
So, they might not have
looked that different.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:47.230
The important point is that whether
you accept this view as closer

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:51.150
to the reality of the
earliest primate, or this one,

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.840
these are typical mammalian faces.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:30:00.980
Okay. As I showed, earlier, where
there is a projecting snout,

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.930
there's fur on the face,
and a few other features.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:11.590
So, let us now look at the
diversification of the primates

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:16.320
and see where the changes came in,
that helped to make the human face.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.060
And this is a picture
of the evolutionary

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.210
or phylogenetic tree
of the primates.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:28.570
And there are two basic
groups, called the prosimians

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.230
and the anthropoid primates.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.990
And we are definitely a member
of the anthropoid primates.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:41.360
And the split between these two
major branches occurred probably

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.270
around 55, maybe 60
million years, ago.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.990
So, the ancestral primates,
whether they looked like either

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:55.860
of the versions I showed you,
were existing at least here.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.840
Maybe around 63 million years, ago.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.650
And maybe, before.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:04.110
And then, they split
into the prosimians

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.730
and the anthropoid primates.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.380
And this is where the first
major set of changes that led

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.590
to the human face took place.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.690
And we'll come to the second
set of changes, in a moment.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.520
But let's look at the first.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.370
So, here is a prosimian, which
despite some exotic details

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:25.150
like the ruff, looks very
much like the other mammals

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.560
that form the majority of mammals.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.750
There is a projecting snout,
the eyes are very wide apart,

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.660
there is fur on the face.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.300
Here are two anthropoid primates.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.570
And all of the so-called
anthropoid primates,

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.720
and we belong to this
large division.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.480
Anthropoid means man-like.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.310
Have these distinguishing features.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.430
They have close-set
forward-looking eyes.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.120
Notice these eyes are definitely
more close-set than these.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.620
The anthropoid primates have
a naked or furless face.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.460
And they have a reduced
muzzle, compared to the others.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.480
So, the net result of this
first set of physical changes,

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.190
which probably took place
roughly 50 million years, ago,

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.030
is that the anthropoid primate
face is far more expressive

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.330
than the prosimian face.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.970
Okay. Just by virtue of
the face being naked,

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:21.300 position:56%
you can see the skin more clearly in
naked faces, than in furred faces.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.590
And it is therefore, more
expressive of the feelings,

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.900
intentions, and simple thoughts.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.910
Okay. So, this is the first step
forward toward a human face.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.040
And I think we can
see that these faces

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.240
of the anthropoid primates are,
indeed, more humanlike than this,

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.830
which looks more like
a typical mammal.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:49.220 position:56%
So, the first major set of changes
took place roughly 50 million years,

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.910
ago, changes that led in the
direction of the human face.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:59.270
And the second phase of
major changes leading

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.390
to modern human face, including
ultimately anatomically modern

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.020
humans, shown here by this figure.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.090
Took place much later.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:13.700
Roughly starting about four
to 6 million years, ago.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.380
And here, I've just
sketched it very crudely.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:23.190
Now, we don't know what the
absolutely ancestral hominin,

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:27.760
this means the humanlike
primates, looked like.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.150
But the modern chimpanzee
is probably not too far off.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.870
There are debates about what the
resemblances and differences are.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:37.820
But we can take a modern chimp
as a crude representative

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:42.560
of the earliest member of the
branch that led to humans.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.140
And we see some of
the changes, here.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.060
I'm not going to go
into them in detail.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.360
But I think you can see
that this modern human face,

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.220
which is a bushman
from South Africa.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.160
Really is a smaller face
than these longer faces

00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:01.150
of these more apelike
humanlike creatures.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:04.450
It's a smaller face,
it's flat, it's vertical.

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:07.430
There isn't really
any sign of a muzzle.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.670
Okay. There's a broad forehead.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:16.190
Okay. So, what were the major
changes in the second stage?

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.630
The complete loss of the muzzle in.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.280
You know, the complete
loss of the muzzle.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.290
Flattening and verticalization
of the face.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.030
So, we really have vertical faces,

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.910
unlike faces that have
projecting snout.

00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:32.100
The gain of the forehead and
behind that, our big brain.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:38.000
And I'm now going to concentrate on
this, because it's quite important.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.810
One, it really has changed
our look as an animal.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:50.060
And secondly, this is connected
to the growth of our big brain,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:56.970
which has certainly been a major
contributor to the fact that we are

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.420
such a facially expressive animal.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.020
And that those expressions
have played a huge part

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:08.140
in our evolution a
what we are, today.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:16.220
So, one of the driving forces, or
one of the trains in our evolution,

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.570
has been the increasing brain size,
shown here fairly diagrammatically.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.200
And these are inferred
brains, because of course,

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.310
the brains themselves
haven't been preserved.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.920
What we have is the skulls.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.660
And from the skulls you
can reconstruct some

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.940
of the surface features
of the brain.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.340
But these are, as I say,
somewhat imaginative depictions

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:44.740
of the changes in brain size
that have occurred in the course

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:50.150
of our developing from
the first hominins.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:54.890
The first humanlike animals,
over roughly, 6 million years.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.660
So, what drove the increase
in human brain size?

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.280
This is really an important

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.210
and interesting question
that's fundamental

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:06.060
to understanding human evolution.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:11.540
The first key point is that
something must have driven this,

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.410
because brains are expensive.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.650 position:56%
Expensive in terms of energy, hence,

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:18.280
in the amount of nutrients
that we have to take in.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.940
The comprise only about
two percent of body weight,

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.450
which doesn't sound
like a large percentage.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.830
But it's a relatively
large amount for an animal.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:29.210
But they require 20% of the
energy needed by the body.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:32.120
Okay. So, brains are
energetically expensive.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.210
And that makes demands on the
animal for adequate nutrition.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.280
Okay. So, there are three
general explanations.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.260
I'm going to run through
them fairly quickly

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.880 position:56%
and not do any of them real justice.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.690
But just to sketch them out.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:49.290
There's the better
nutrition hypothesis.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:53.400
The need for greater intelligence
for foraging and hunting.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.440
And finally, the third hypothesis
is that it the growing array

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.230
of social interactions,
something known

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.930 position:56%
as the social brain hypothesis, that
drove the increase in brain size.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.270 position:56%
So, the better nutrition hypothesis.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.310
There are several variants of this.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.920
I think one of the favorite ones
comes from Richard Wrangham,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.160
who is a professor at Harvard, and
a friend and colleague of mine.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:23.640 position:56%
And essentially, is that when humans
learned how to cook they were able

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.000
to increase the efficiency

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.390
with which they extracted
calories from food.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.770
And there's a lot of
evidence for this.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:38.020
But it's not clear to me that
simply having more easier access

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.430
to more energy would have driven
the increase in brain size.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:45.070
I think the more plausible
explanation is

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:52.290
that there were pressures for
increased complexity of behaviors

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.350 position:56%
and various brain related functions.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.640
Which required better nutrition.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.450
But the better nutrition itself,

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:02.120
which he has emphasized
comes from cooking.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.280
And cooking [inaudible] releases
more readily available energy.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:13.110 position:56%
I think that simply the availability
of more energy by cooking food,

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:17.580
probably does not explain
the increase in brain size.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.330
And there are other
variance of this hypothesis,

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:26.350
but they all emphasize
increased energy availability

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.650
from foods as the driving force.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:32.530
So, I think that this is unlikely.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.030
I would say it's an
insufficient reason

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.100
to explain the increase
in brain size.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.700
What about the need for
greater intelligence

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.160
for foraging and hunting?

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.500
There's no question that foraging
and hunting as humans do it,

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.310
it often more sophisticated,

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.400
even often a much more
sophisticated way of getting food.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.210
Than the way most of our
brother animals get their food.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:39:00.110
Including our nearest
relatives amongst the primates.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.270
So, I think that for
various reasons,

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.790
which I'm not going to detail here.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:10.520
I think that this is
unconvincing as the prime driver

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.940
of what has made our brains bigger.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:18.320
This is unconvincing as the major
selective force for larger brains.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.620
What about the third one?

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.920
The growing array of
social interactions?

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.400
The social brain hypothesis.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.560
There isn't time to
go into all of this,

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.150
but there is a great
deal of support for it.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:32.170
That it was the growing
complexity of social interactions,

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:38.210
whether in raising offspring,
in interacting with each other.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:42.910
That may have been the driving
force in driving brain growth.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:47.180 position:56%
So, in my opinion, this is the best.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:52.150
And it's inextricably bound up
with the idea of social selection.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:56.430
Namely, the idea that social
interactions strengthen

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:57.920
social cohesion.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.160
Which promotes the survival
of the group, and thereby,

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.910
of its individual members.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.430
And here I've allowed myself
to give one reference.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:09.110
This idea has, I think, not
really been given enough play.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:13.350
But this idea was first explained
by a guy named Herbert Simon,

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.190
who is an economist,
not a biologist.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.790
But somebody with a
very great range.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:24.160
And the idea simply is that we are
necessarily a cooperative species.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.130
Certainly, in our early
days, we needed a lot

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.130
of cooperation to get things done.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:33.720
You take the human and put him
or her out on his or her own,

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.310
and that person's survival
will be rapidly compromised.

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:39.920
We are inherently a social animal

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:45.430
and we need our social
cohesion, in order to survive.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:49.200
I realize that I'm not giving
this argument in its full details

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.230
and merits, but that's
just because of time.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.740
But I would recommend if anybody's
interested in following it up,

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:57.400
looking at this article
by Herbert Simon.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.550
Now, three key points to
that social selection.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.900
It's not the same as
group selection.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.790
Group selection posits that certain
things evolved because they were

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.410
for the good of the group.

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:11.470
Instead, the idea of
social selection posits

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.980
that there was strength in social
bonds that were a direct benefit

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.810
to the individual,
often at minimal cost.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.910
Okay. Again, that deserves
more explanation

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.210
than I can give it, here.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.740
But that is a key idea.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.600
For humans, the evolution of
social interactions must have been,

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.460
to some degree, coupled with
the evolution of language.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.840
Okay. It's hard to convey your wish

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.190
to do things cooperatively
without language.

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.460
You can do it to some
extent, and animals do.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.110
But language had almost undoubtedly
been of crucial importance

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.050
in our evolution as a species.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.530
Finally, the evolution of
language was almost certainly tied

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.080
up with both the evolution
of the brain

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.450
and of facial expressions
accompanying speech.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:03.740
But faces, in that last point,
we come back to the face.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:08.730
That facial expressions
are in speech, in a sense,

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.420
a fundamental part of what
we communicate by speech.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.090
And if you think about your
own reactions to people,

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:15.910
you'll understand that that's true.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.310
As I mentioned, every
prolonged dialog

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.680
between people involves a
play of facial expressions,

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.540
as well as the words
that are conveyed.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.200
And that's why it's often much
more effective to talk with someone

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.520
about something that's
difficult face-to-face,

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.710
than by email, for example.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:37.820
Okay. Faces convey much information
about an individual in addition

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.610
to that about mood and feelings.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:43.840
Faces provide visual
information about gender.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.870
Okay. Age.

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:49.520
Admittedly, I've chosen those
examples to maximize the contrast.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.260 position:56%
There may also be a size
difference between these two people.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.340
But even just from the photographs,
you know, that you're looking

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.770
at a baby, here, a
very young person.

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.510
And an older person, there.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:04.020
Ethnicity, as an example.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.320
And character.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.510
Now, this is the most tricky
and perhaps the most ambiguous.

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.170
So, to weight the scales,

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.850
I've contrasted Abraham
Lincoln with Rasputin.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:19.410
But. And there are some
wonderful pictures of Rasputin,

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.720
in which his eyes look
positively crazy.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.290
But I think even if you didn't
know anything about the history.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:28.410
The historical importance
of these people,

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.210
these two individuals
and what they were like.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:35.760 position:56%
I think that if you saw lots of
pictures of Lincoln and of this man,

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.480
you would conclude that this
man was, indeed, more trustable.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.440
It really comes through
in his facial expressions

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.240
and the set of his face.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:49.970
Okay. So, the face provides a
tremendous amount of information

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.360
to our fellows, often
just at a glance.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.100
And these are an important part
of our social interactions.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.830
So, faces provide an
instant visual identification

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:02.350
of a particular individual.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:05.030
In effect, of the 7.3
billion people on earth today,

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:07.600
there are about that many
distinguishable faces.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.090
Of course, identical twins
and triplets are an exception.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:15.560
But, indeed, most human faces
are at least slightly different

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.670
from other faces, and
often very different.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:22.550
So, and rapid visual
identification is an invaluable aid

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:23.910
in social interactions.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:27.140
And this is just an obvious
point, when you walk into a room,

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.440
you look for people you know.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.490
You do it almost immediately,
from their face.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:33.780 position:56%
Yes, there may be hints about from
their size or body build, and so on.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.760
But the face is the main
provider of information

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.170
about who you're looking for.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:43.860
So, is there an evolutionary
explanation for facial differences?

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:49.580
Yes. If facial differences provide
quick individual identification,

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.430
and if that identification
promotes social interactions,

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.540 position:56%
most of which are positive, helpful.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.650
Then, it will be selection
for such differences.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:03.830
Now, there is actually beginning to
be a genetics of facial difference.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:07.540
I'm going to just go over this very
lightly, because I think it gets

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.880
into too much detail for
the time I have allowed.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.280
I'm not even sure if
I've exceeded that time.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.660
So, I'm just going to leave this
with you as a specific point.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.970
That it's now possible to identify
specific genetic differences

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:26.330
as correlating with individual
specific facial differences.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:30.040
There is beginning to be a true
genetics of facial difference.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.710
There are at least, at this point,
20 genes that are identified

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.760
with specific facial differences.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:42.500
And at some point, just from
sequenced genomes, alone.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:47.080
And the genes that are involved
in creating facial differences,

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.210
one may be able to actually
reconstruct what the faces looked

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.960 position:56%
like form their genetic differences.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.680
This is really, it's
still for the future,

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.800
but it's within the realm
of possibility, now.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.440
So, with those findings, can
facial differences be related

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.130
to social selection?

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:12.280
Namely, selection for individuals
within a particular social context.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.580
Almost certainly.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.220
A new work shows that
quantitatively,

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.990
faces are indeed more
morphologically diverse

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:19.850
than other regions of the body.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:22.290
Okay. So, our faces
show more differences

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.850
than any other part of our body.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.510
The genes implicated in
generating facial differences are

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:28.500
under selection to be different.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.800
The phenomena of negative frequency
dependent selection, or NFDS.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.210
This is an awkward term
and we can forget it.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.280
But the important point
is that it seems

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.400
that there actually is selection
for us to have different faces,

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.790
so that we can recognize
each other very quickly.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:45.600
And this only makes sense in terms

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:51.320
of facial difference actually
promoting interactions

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.640
that are ultimately helpful.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.140
This point could be elaborated
a lot, and it's interesting.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.580
But there isn't time.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:04.520
So, I'm now coming to the close of
the lecture and just summing up.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.280
So, what was the major net
effect of the changes that led

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.560
from fish faces to the human face?

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.440
So, let's first just
look at fish faces.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:17.170
And it's not just fish faces,
but the faces shown by fish,

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:19.690
amphibia, reptiles, and birds.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:21.890
The four major classes apart

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:24.040
from the mammals, amongst
the vertebrates.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.290
The animals with backbones.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:30.010
So, these faces were, indeed, the
sensory headquarters of the animal.

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.980
And the site of food
ingestion in the mouth.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.940
Primarily, the face
existed as a receiver

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.650
of information about the world.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.830
And initially, for the
animal to find food.

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:45.270
Now, with the mammals, there began
to be real facial expressions,

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:49.270
and hence, information to other
members of the same species

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.470
about what was going on in the mind

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:54.590
of the animal making
these expressions.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:57.450
So, there were the
same functions as found

00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:59.660
in the other kinds of vertebrates.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:04.270
Plus, the face is the provider
of some information to others.

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.750
And with us, in the genus homo,

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.990
and specifically our own
species, homo sapiens.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:13.380
There were all the same
original functions of the face.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.090
Okay. For locating food and so on.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:17.730
Plus, it was a provider.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.180
The face has become a
provider of huge amounts

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.150 position:56%
of information about the individual.

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.250
And this is of social value.

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:28.250
The face is a storehouse and
transmitter of information.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:33.900
Okay. So, the earliest vertebrate
face is where primarily receivers.

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:39.970
Sorry, were primarily receivers
of information about the world.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:42.760
And of course, as a site
of ingestion for food.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:48.300
Our face is certainly a storehouse
of information about the face.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.270 position:56%
But it also conveys that information

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:53.160
to the fellow members
of our species.

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.500
It's a fairly fundamental
difference.

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.440
And of course, as I've
stressed, this is shared

00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.810
with our nearest relatives.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:03.810
But also, to some extent, with
more distant mammalian relatives.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.390
But we've taken it to an extreme.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.130
So, summing up, I'll
just read this out.

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:12.980
''For about 450 million years
of evolutionary history,

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.810
the faces of vertebrates
functioned primarily

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:17.340
as the sensory headquarters
of the individual''.

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.730
Okay. The concentrated
areas in which three

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:25.120
of the main senses are localized.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.420
Initially, and particularly the
search for and ingestion of food.

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.620
Furthermore, a point that I
haven't really elaborated,

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.100
but I'll state it, here.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.580
''Matters of diet influenced
the shape of jaws and teeth

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:36.360
and the placement of
the sensory apparatus.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.990
And therefore, the shape
and structure of the face''.

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.280
Okay. So, matters of
diet were really crucial

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:47.580 position:56%
in shaping the evolution of the
face for most of vertebrate history.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:51.270 position:56%
''For 50 or so million years, in the
anthropoid primates'', specifically,

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:54.040
''the social environment
played an increasing role.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.210
Becoming even stronger and
more complex in the hominins''.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:00.180
The hominins being our group.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.210
''Thus, social selection
played a major part

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:05.080
in shaping the human face
in all its unusualness.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.960 position:56%
We are the most sociable of animals.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.360
And the physical characteristics

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.570
of the human face reflect
a long history

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:15.230
of increasingly complex
social interactions''.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:18.720
And that in a sense, is the
main message from this talk.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:23.080
But I'd like to end with
an additional thought.

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.260
And even a bit of advice.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:31.200
And that is that the
capacity of our face to give

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.750
out information is incredibly
valuable and unusual.

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:37.720
And more than 50 million years

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.150
of anthropoid primate evolution
have been invested, in a sense.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:44.210
Not by anybody deliberately
making it so, it just happened.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.870 position:56%
Have been 50 million years of
primate evolution have been invested

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.040 position:56%
to make our faces superb instruments

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.790
for communicating our
thoughts and feelings.

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.940
I urge you to take advantage
of that, as much as possible.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:59.240 position:56%
If you want to communicate something
important and/or complex to someone,

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.560
do it face-to-face, not by email.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.950
At least by Skype.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:06.690
Okay. And I think with
that, I'll close.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:11.510
So, thank you, very
much, for your attention.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:15.660
[ Applause ]

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.980
&gt;&gt; Mr. Wilkins.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:18.280
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Yes.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:22.440
&gt;&gt; Can you explain exactly
how the genetic selection

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:27.150
[inaudible]difference from
other people [inaudible]

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.180
or facial characteristics
[inaudible]?

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.480
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Yeah.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.160
So, I think you're asking me
what is negative frequency

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.080
dependent selection.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.260
This is the awkward term.

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:43.320
How can there be selection
for difference?

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.870
And it depends on.

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:48.130
I think in this case, certainly,

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:51.840
it depends on people
perceiving difference

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.920
and finding it attractive.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.220
So, we all know.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:52:00.060
So, it comes into probably
what's termed sexual selection,

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:07.070
where there is a special set of
things that influence the selection

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:10.760
of characteristics that
have to do with mating.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:14.580
Whom you want to link up with.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:20.390
And so, it's almost certainly
something that has been.

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:23.620
And I think it's almost
certain, this preference

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.750
for slight difference is connected

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:32.450
with what we find attractive
in others.

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:38.370
This point hasn't yet, has not
received a lot of attention.

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:41.350
The main findings that
really support this idea,

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:47.520
came out only a year or two, ago,
from a guy named Michael Shin, who.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:52.970
Yeah, Shin, who is a professor
at Cornell University.

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.860
So, I think that's all
I can say about it.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.920
But basically, it comes down to
the fact that people like a degree

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.700
of difference, when
selecting their mates.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:09.280
And this has the side effect of
helping to make us all different.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:15.010
Which has the important
additional value

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:22.350
that in social interactions
we can identify each other,

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.680
much more readily.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:29.470
Without this negative
frequency dependent selection,

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:33.210
we might be tending
to be more homogenous.

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.790
There would be less
facial difference

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.390
and more similarity, time.

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:42.610
But here we are, standing at 7.3
billion people on earth with nearly

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:46.620
that many different and
discernably different faces.

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:50.250
And it must have something to
do with the fact that difference

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.340
in our perspective mates,

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.070
slight facial differences
often are attractive.

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.870
I'm not sure I can say anything
more about it, than that.

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.390
But that's the rough idea.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:02.280
Yes. Oh, sorry.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:07.770
&gt;&gt; There was a lot [inaudible].

00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:18.790
Public channel, or something
like that, about what makes,

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:33.700
I guess humans attracted
to one another.

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:37.580
But not just humans.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:47.200
But right now, my question
is about this thing

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:52.870
that they said about
facial symmetry.

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:54.170
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Mm-hmm.

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:57.950
&gt;&gt; They were really talking about
people who are looking for mates

00:54:57.950 --> 00:55:03.900
who are the healthiest and the most
likely to propagate the species.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.200
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Yes.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.530
&gt;&gt; But that so what they were
looking for was [inaudible].

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:11.240
Facial symmetry and
a chart that showed

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.730
that some actor had
like their perfect face.

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:15.030
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Yes.

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:16.330
&gt;&gt; That they [inaudible].

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:17.930
But that instead of
looking for differences,

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:23.090
they were actually looking
for like a [inaudible] was the

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:24.390
perfect healthiest.

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:27.570
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: So, this idea is
what I believe, and there's a lot

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.150
of supporting evidence for it.

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:31.500
That a symmetrical face is really,

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:36.460
highly symmetrical faces are
more attractive to members

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:42.990
of the opposite sex, than
more visibly asymmetric faces.

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:49.030
So, there is a fair amount of
scientific data supporting this.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:52.430
I'm not sure I'm equipped to
say anything more than that.

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:53.730
But that comes into it.

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:56.730 position:56%
Does that help answer your question?

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:58.030
Or?

00:55:58.030 --> 00:55:59.330
&gt;&gt; Well, I just sort of
[inaudible] that [inaudible].

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:00.630
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: It's
a slightly different.

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:01.930
Yeah.

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:03.230
&gt;&gt; Selections.

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:04.530
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Yeah.

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:05.830
Yeah. Yeah.

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.130
I think the idea, in general,

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.430
is that more symmetric
faces indicate kind

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:09.730
of a better construction
of the person as a whole.

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:11.030 position:56%
And I think we all know that we find
more symmetrical faces inherently

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:12.330
more attractive than more
visibly asymmetric ones.

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:13.630 position:56%
And that must affect the likelihood
with which one can mate with others.

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:14.930
Yes.

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:16.940
&gt;&gt; Did I hear you say?

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.500
Did I correctly hear you say

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.010
that thought processes
helped to shape the brain?

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:24.000
And if so, how did they do that?

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.500
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Well, I'm
not sure I said exactly that.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.710
But thought processes
certainly affect our behavior.

00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:34.990
And our behaviors then, our,
in the sense of animals.

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:39.830
And an animal's behavior will
affect how well it survives.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:46.580
And hence, you know, whether it's
likely to have more progeny or not.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:48.560
Does that help out?

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:54.000
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] actually
affect the physical structure?

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.610
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: So,
it's indirect, okay.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:57:02.760
So, there's a selection for
neural superstructure that permits

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.910
or promotes certain
kinds of behaviors.

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:08.900
Which in turn, are either
more favorable or less

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:12.580
for promoting the survival
of the animal.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:18.450
So, it's an indirect way
of affecting the likelihood

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:23.490
of selection for an animal
with those properties.

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:24.790
Yes.

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:32.980
&gt;&gt; I understand that humans evolved
in small groups of maybe 100 or so.

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.280
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Yes.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.580
&gt;&gt; Individuals.

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:36.880
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Yes.

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:44.040
&gt;&gt; And so, it seems to me,
listening to your discussion,

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:49.190
that we only need to distinguish

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:55.300
about 100 different facial
arrangements, something like that.

00:57:55.300 --> 00:58:00.680
According to the evolutionary
analysis.

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:14.630 position:56%
And so, in the modern world where
you're living in cities of millions,

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:18.980
you have to have social
evolution to contribute

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:21.680
to the distinctiveness
of all the individuals.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.690
And my thinking, as you're talking,

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:28.150
is that you've also explained
the evolution of all kinds

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:31.350
of social phenomena, like
[inaudible] for instance.

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:32.650
I don't know what [inaudible].

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:33.950
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Yes.

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:37.390
So, we are used to a
world of cities and towns

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:39.460
and large numbers of people.

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:41.840
Most of the evolution I've
discussed occurred when the groups

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.180
of humans were much smaller.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:47.660
But there's undoubtedly,
evolutionary selection going on,

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:50.820
today, in these very
large mixed groups.

00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:54.980
I mean, what we have, today,
is really unprecedented

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:58.220
in the evolution of our
species, or indeed, any species.

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:02.040
This going from small interactive
groups to potentially huge ones.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.340
So, does that pertain
to what you're saying?

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.640
I'm.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.940
&gt;&gt; I wasn't thinking of
that, but that's okay.

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.240
Because I can see that [inaudible].

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.540
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: You
can [inaudible].

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:09.840
&gt;&gt; Adam Wilkins: Yeah.

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.140
But.

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.440
&gt;&gt; Judging from your
facial features.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.740
[ Laughter ]

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.040
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.340
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Please join me
to thank today's speaker, again.

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:17.640
Thank you, very much.
