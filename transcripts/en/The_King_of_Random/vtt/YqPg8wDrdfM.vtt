Hey guys before we get started

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:06.689
I've got an exciting announcement the king of random has been nominated for two Streamy Awards this year including best show of the year

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.699
But we haven't won yet. We need your help to take 10 seconds jump over to Twitter and tweet the hashtag

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.740
#TKORFORSTREAMYS that's all it takes to cast your vote just tweet #TKORFORSTREAMYS and with your help

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.200
We'll hopefully be up on the stage on September 26th. There's definitely something floating around there, but we're gonna drink it anyway

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.140
What's up guys welcome back?

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.609
I'm grant Thompson the king of random

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.308
And I'm at Pat from game theory and film theory we brought you back out to the ocean today because we're doing another experiment with

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.009
Ocean water absolutely we are answering a comment from

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.690
Craig videos who asked if you could take seawater and turn it into actual drinkable water, that's right so in this experiment

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.200
We're on the opposite. End of the spectrum rather than taking the salt out of salt water

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.149
We're taking the water out of the salt water and trying to make it drinkable so really cool experiment Craig

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559
We're doing this for you. Let's see if we can make it work. Let's go so to help us with our experiment today

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.909
We've got this little contraption off Amazon. This is basically like a wood powered distillation apparatus. Have you ever heard of an electric distiller?

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.089
I have not actually there are electric water distillers, but the reason I got this one is because it's actually powered by wood

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.400
Yeah, so you're doing an old-school style wood propane exactly so if you know if there's emergency

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.589
And you can't get water anywhere all you have to do is light a fire underneath

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.450
Yeah, you can theoretically take any water

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.979
And it will vaporize it and then distill it where it collects it back into the centre so for my like

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.799
Apocalypse bunker. This is a must-have. I must have and I'll put a link down in the description so we can get on Amazon

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.109
I'm not saying it's worth it. This was like 400 bucks

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.850
Whoa which I think is way too much

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.869
But I'll put a link down the description in case you want to go hashtag humble brag about how much you spent on this

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.549
That's right, so our goal for today head down to the ocean get a big pitcher full of water

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.828
Then bring it back to my place throw it on the stove. See what we're able to cook up do it get to it

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.269
Let's do it bottoms up in a couple hours going for a swim guys

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.710
Oh, that's that's way up in the pants. It's way up in the pants at this point

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200
You're good

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.130
Whatsit Miss Frizzle always says when you do science get messy take chances

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.510
Definitely got messy. That's good man. Good thing to see it's waterproof

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.449
I hope let's reel it in see we got all right. There. You go, sir

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.329
This guy is an animal hey, you got to get water somehow so you just ran out there

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.760
And he took it barefoot, and this is what we've recovered

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.230
I think we got a little bit more than salt water in here you see a few other little things floating here

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.799
Maybe a little bit of sand who knows what but we're gonna take this back to the house now

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.400
We're going to load up our little

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.110
Distillation device and set it on the stove for a few hours and see what we get out there you go

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.760
Let's go do that next so here. We are guys. We're back in the house. We have a stove top with a gas flame

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.809
We've got our sea water and now all we have to do is transfer all the sea water into the distiller

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.970
Crank up the heat and let it sit

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.879
That should be plenty

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.129
You can actually see like your Kennex

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.309
We got like some feathers floating around there some other organic materials

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.190
This stainless steel mesh is gonna help suppress all that and if everything starts bubbling it's gonna keep it all down

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.029
There we go just floats right on the top there

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.119
This is the tray here that will actually collect the water

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.729
You know this just sits down on top right? Oh bing bada boom. We place this little cap on top

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.819
This is to help vent volatile organic compounds those things that are lighter than water, and then we simply fire it up

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.230
Now let's talk a bit about what's happening inside the pot here as the water starts to boil it turns into steam and the steam

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.719
Rises and it goes into these condenser units here

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.609
Where it hits and then condenses into liquid and drips back down inside the system now

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.889
We know that when water evaporates that leaves everything behind

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.150
So theoretically the water coming out of here in steam form should be relatively pure

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.039
And we can actually speed up the condensation by using something like ice or cold water on top of the plates

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.960
And then all we're gonna need is something like this cup or a bowl to put underneath the spout to collect all the fresh water

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.769
That drips back out now. We just have to sit back. Give it a little bit of time and let it boil

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.330
Hey, so finally some water is coming up to spout and it looks to be fairly clear

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.159
And it's poured out really quickly and consistently - it is this whole thing is really hot right now

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.600
You can see everything's steaming the glass is steaming water steaming where everything is hot

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.180
Stevi

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.850
Four hundred dollars well spit all we have to do now is let this sit for about thirty minutes or so so we can collect

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.179
A whole bowl full of stuff right and then we can let it cool down and give it a taste test

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.539
Guys check it out it has been about fifteen minutes now

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.969
And you can see we've already filled this glass all the way full

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.040
And this thing is just cranking out so I actually had to switch out to a larger bowl because we're getting more water a little

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.040
Bit faster than I expected

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.389
So check it out guys this has been running for about 35 minutes now. We've filled up an entire bowl with water here

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.639
I'm not quite sure how it tastes yet, so we're gonna take it off

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.139
Let it cool down for about 10 or 15 minutes, and then give it a taste test in the meantime

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.698
Let me take this top off so you can look down inside and see what all that sea water looks like boiling away

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.740
You see how that screen mesh is kind of holding all the bubbles down and there's quite a bit more water in there

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.229
Which is fantastic?

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.890
Huh

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:02.359
All right so quick update guys. We just transferred all of our water into this picture for convenience

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.349
You can tell by the steam coming on the top. It's still quite hot so we're gonna stick this in the fridge

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:07.639
Let it cool down a little bit

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.309
And then we'll do the taste test when it tastes a little bit more like pure crisp water as opposed to

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:20.419
As much as you probably enjoy drinking hot water. You know you can make myself a cup of tea all right

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:26.779
I'll stick in the fridge all right a chopper Stephanie's watermelon. How's that Stephanie loves her watermelon perfect all right cool?

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.479
Good news. We put this thing in the freezer. Just to cool it down a little bit quicker

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:36.019
You can see it's getting frosty the temperature the water. It doesn't feel like super cold. Yeah, but it's definitely not hot anymore

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.990
It looks like

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.599
That's point there are things floating around in there

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:44.610
Good

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.569
It's just like orange juice. This is water pulp style

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.210
Call yourself a cuppa over the teeth over the gums look out stomach here. It comes

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.129
There we go all right bottoms up cheers sir official taste test here we go

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.590
I

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.419
Taste absolutely zero salt it 8-0 Sol's your salt

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.299
Does have some sort of aftertaste though mmm that's all tea and that's actually the taste of distilled water

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.699
Because distilled water takes everything out of the water

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.590
So they actually add taste back into it really they do we actually have some distilled water with humanitarians

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.590
Oh, that's a great idea uno momento por favor

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.090
That's Spanish for

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.930
wait right here

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.209
Yes, so this is official distilled water. This is from the store. It has a Best Buy a date

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.890
Yeah, see this says it's distilled water purified by steam distillation

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:42.220
Huh okay filtered and ozonated, so it should be the same process all right butters up. Here's once again

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.740
Pinky up means it's fancy

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.230
You see you still get that same after - yeah, yeah, it's colder though. It is a little bit warmer. Yeah

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.230
I think warm water. Just doesn't taste as good

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:05.049
But as far as like the taste goes that I say that taste is very comfortable. It is very similar no salt

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.329
You know see you life. I'm actually impressed with how good the ocean water turned out mmm?

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:16.420
It's a completely viable solution it opposed the pugilistic world where clean water is not available - would you like to have some more

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.610
processed ocean water please do

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.890
gotta stay hydrated nope

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:28.869
The amount of water that I got out of the ocean for you how much how much pure water would that give you it's all

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.280
evaporated down oh gosh

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.140
I say most of it really yeah, you're gonna be able to capture most I'd say probably under 98% recovery rate

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.929
Maybe 97 Wow because in our experiment we found that only 3 percent of the mass was actually salt

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:47.919
Yeah
so theoretically the other 97% should be water anything so I think by out here able to capture all the vapor if you collected a

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.719
Full bottle of ocean water I would expect you to almost recover a full bottle of distilled water you

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.549
Know it would just be a lot more drinkable right so if you have a lot of extra time on your hands

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.120
You can do it - you challenge us to take sea water and make it drinkable

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.989
We did that did it and I'm very excited. I hope you learned something new big

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:10.089
thanks to Matt Pat for joining us for this experiment for risking his safety to dive out to the depths of the ocean and

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.650
Rescue sea water for this experiment. Hey, it was touch-and-go there for a little bit. Hopefully

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.630
I wasn't too salty for you today

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.960
And this was a pleasure doing this experiment his link is down in the description below

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.799
So you can go check him out give him some support random nation unite let's go show him some love

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.990
Baby shout out to Craig videos for suggesting the topic of today's video Craig you can go check your youtube inbox

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.990
We are sending you 25 bucks Chuck

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.589
Don't spend it all in one place. We'll be looking for in the next video. Talk to you then

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.190
Figure 747 whoa

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.360
Lanning you're attracted

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.939
Laughs say he's having flashbacks to his former life hundred percent distilled pure water Subscribe to Crushr YT for Captions!

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.110
We'll see

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.860
There's a lot in there go ahead table event area oh

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.620
It's just oh oh

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.840
That's why you wear safety shoes. If safety red shoes, and not your oh my gosh

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.479
I got wet at the beach, and so let me take off my socks. Thank you. Hey guys quick reminder about the Streamy Awards

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.010
We've never been, but we'd love to win

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:14.129
So if you would take 10 seconds jump over to Twitter and tweet the hashtag TKO our four streamys with your vote

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.710
There's a chance we could be up on the stage on September 26
