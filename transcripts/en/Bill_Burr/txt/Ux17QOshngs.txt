Speaker 2:          00:02:21       can see on it's on. There we go. Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burns time for Thursday afternoon, special edition of the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and a, I have a guest, a very special guest. One of, uh, one of my, uh, I dunno, just the biggest fan of this guy and all the bands that he's played in just going to get right to it. It's got a brand new album out. Mr Duff Mckagan how are you sir? Bill, how are you? I'm doing great. You know, I uh, got the email saying that you wanted to be on here. I said, you know, the tough had made a new album, a solo album, you know, when he wants to come on and promote it. And I got to tell you, you just came off that giant tour. You're like, I'm all tangled up in the fucking wires here.

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       I told you this was going to be a bare bones operation here. How did you get the time? You know, cause I, I'm such a uh, a pussy where I go on the road for like a week and I'm like whining to my wife Linda. Good. I miss my kid and everything. And I know you guys had breaks and everything, but he did two and a half years on the road. How do you come out of that and be like, you know what, I'm, I'm ready to a sit down and write an album. You're not like fried.

Speaker 3:          00:03:27       Well, um, I think, well that's two questions and I do that a lot. Yes. And so, so the, the being able to tour, like, I mean, I saw some tours when I was a kid. I saw the clash before London calling and I saw this like, I mean they were as exotic as led Zeppelin were, but they were one of us. Right. And they made that known. Like there's no difference between the crowd and the band. We're all in this together. That was an early influence. And then seeing Henry Rollins like get prepared. My first Gig ever was opening for black flag books. Ron raise of a singer to singers before at Rollins. Okay. So when Rawlins probably came into black flag, there was a lot of talk. You got to step up. That's a big position to be the singer black flag. And my band, again, there was a different band, but we opened for black flag when Henry came in for like five shows. Right. And seeing this guy, he was super intense. He's still pretty intense guy, but this is, I mean I'm like 17 years old and he's just has gym shorts on and you know, and he, he's pacing this is that sound check?

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       Yeah, I've seen him do standup comedy and he just, he just like, they introduced so many, just like 45 degree angle right out to the Mike. Stan takes the mic out and wraps the cord around. His arm was like, all right, this guy's keys going in.

Speaker 3:          00:04:51       That's what, so seeing that like preparation he did for a show that kind of like, that was at the state of my head. And I though it was a couple of things that made me decide to be a lifer. Right. You don't have a choice in this anymore. Like what, how did you start playing music? I don't know. I didn't have a choice. Right. It's just, and then, you know, so touring all these years now turning, I'm 55, you know, like you have to really like, do you have to train like an athlete, you have to like do all those things. You have to pace your days and, and uh, our shows are not short in our shows. Yeah. Um, so three and a half hours of, and you've seen the size of our stage is this, you know, so you're probably running five miles a night with a base on, you know, um, but to, to get to the, to the writing of the songs thing.

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       I was in a position, you know, one that I didn't realize how much was missing in my life until we kind of the three of excellent slash myself talked some stuff out and we decided like, let's, we were offered to Coachella, let's, okay. I mean, we could do this, you know, nobody else knows about it except us three. And we talked about all these kinds of things that were hanging there in the air for years. And, and we, the way we approached it with our kind of chess out and heads up and, and with honesty and, and a rigor, you know, and it was so cleansing and going out and touring and then like, well we can go keep, we can keep going, we can do all of North America and we can keep going. And I had this, you know, right. I think at that time. But when we're rehearsing for that, that we rehearsed for three months for that tour and we were like six hours a day, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       Um, how were you guys the first time you, you, the first time you counted it off, you hadn't played together in that long, did it come right back? Was the like riding a bike?

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       I didn't just go into rehearsal. I'm going to spend a month in my,

Speaker 2:          00:06:59       my basement, you know, that's so cool. So you actually went back and listened to all your own stuff first time probably ever like, okay. You know? Yeah. I did the pre work and I know slack, we all did the pre award. The young, you stumped the older you will a few times. Like what the hell was this? No, I mean it's all in my bones. It's all muscle memory of course. Played a bunch of

Speaker 3:          00:07:20       these songs in other bands and whatever. So it wasn't too far out. But there was some stuff like a strange, I hadn't, hadn't played coma, you know, like, oh wow. Yeah. What will you know, what kind of drugs were we doing to the right?

Speaker 2:          00:07:34       Oh my. Yeah, I know. But also that weird thing where you've, I've played this song around the world and I don't remember how it goes. That's gotta be crazy. [inaudible] and it is in your, you know, you play and once you play you play. Yeah. But once you play on drums, a song a few times, it's, it's going to be there where,

Speaker 3:          00:07:53       you know, your, your body remembers it. So, um, but I had this, I went during the rehearsals, I got sucked into that things. I think we all did. I was watching, like it started very simply, a friend of Susan Nights, the guy who actually set us up on a blind date, he used to write for Thrasher, he got into politics, became campaign managers for people. Um, and with John K six campaign manager for that presidential bit. And he, he like texted me, he goes, Hey, watch my guy John Casick. There was that first debate of like 12 republican nominees or wherever the guys who were running and people were that were running. And I watched John Kay sick. Am I going to say real centrus he's done a lot pro Ohio. And cause I had a backstory. So I'm watching him and I see this kind of screaming and shouting and stuff going down and because this is a mass, but it got me into the news and I started watching all news and it's fun.

Speaker 3:          00:08:58       You know, I started following people on my Twitter, my Twitter. I originally got to follow the Seattle Seahawks. The mariners are awful. They are. And like a few of like people that I, you know, respect comedians or rock guys. Um, but I started following all these other things that just don't do it. Um, and I went down a rabbit hole and I'm smart enough. I read enough history. I, it's all like done since I was sober and sober for 25 years. It's just, I read history. I'm a total book nerd and some Watson, this news are, they, they're Britain start bringing on panels that are all yelling over each other. I'm like, this is an interesting way to keep people that they know what they're doing. They're polling like they're watchers, you know, this must be working because they're in the business of selling ads. I'm smart enough, but I'm still down the rabbit hole and I'm looking at my Twitter and wake up in the morning and looking at, go to the news first thing in the morning and I get wrapped up in this whole thing to divide. There's sort of divide out there. Wow. I mean, I've been traveling this country for a long time, man. I didn't know it was there where, where if I bet isn't in a way. Okay. So,

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       so it isn't, it's, it's you watching it on TV and it gets, that's why I stopped. Nothing that was ever the most informed guy, but I stopped watching it when it just, the way they were spinning it and then it was just, he came up. The same reason why I don't watch those real housewives shows is I don't want to watch or listen to a bunch of people screaming and yelling at each other. I grew up with that and you start, it's if it affects like my mood and then I also think it's all bullshit anyway, so I, I don't watch it. So you went to, I'm sorry, you went down that rabbit hole you started.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       Yeah, I remember I went down the rabbit hole. I mean, I, and I knew, I knew I was going down a rabbit hole and I, and uh, so the, uh, one point in rehearsal, like we would talk about rehearsal one point I just right before, right when we started playing Coachella and then we went to Mexico City and then we went, came back to the STA. I turned off the news before all that. I just stopped, just stopped. I stopped having Yahoo is my home screen cause I used to be because you get to sports pretty quick. That's the only reason. Yeah. Y'All who was just filling up, you know, the important stuff, the important stuff. Um, I muted everything on my Twitter except for the Seahawks and the mariners. And I've done this for the last, since again, since I've been sober, I read about all this history and I go to the places I read about.

Speaker 3:          00:11:31       So I'll plan and this is a stadium tour. So we have kind of a day and a half off and every city or you have travel days in Boston. So I would plan my travel and my bus like, okay, DC to Atlanta. What's in between Monticello, let's go then get the bus driver a room there. I'm going to Mazzella a little big horn that's between Minneapolis and Denver. Uh, world war one museum is a Kansas City. I want to go on the air boat with the guy in Louisiana and see alligators. I do this stuff every day off. And what happens when you do these things, these activities, you've talked to people. And oftentimes I go to Monticello between DC and Atlanta guns. [inaudible] roses was playing nowhere near there. So I can go in undetected, I can go to a little big horn can. People just are not expecting, you know, a few people go, Whoa, duff, you know, but it's not like I kind of tried to not go to the places in the cities I'm playing if I can help it sometimes. Like when I saw you in Paris, I just came from Normandy. I did a whole thing.

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       Dda. How crazy is that? Yeah. I went down there the, uh, the next day, uh, in the morning I drove a van down because that's all they've rented us as this big stupid van. And I went down there and I got lost. Oh, you did? But I didn't, but I made it there. I made it. That just couldn't get back to my hotel. I couldn't find it because you just walk the beaches of yourself. I went and I smoked a cigar, sat on the Bay beach in the morning and I, I couldn't believe how moving it was. Yeah. And we took this incredible tour with this piece with the creators. Yeah. And that, and the guy, uh, um, looks guy from Scotland and he took us all into, but he did it all the papers. Yeah. Yeah. And they had this bunker where I guess Hitler had gotten gassed or something or saw people get gassed in the, uh, in World War One. Like when they, when before they, that whole, let's not try it, you know, the poisonous gas shoot at people. So he had showers installed in case, you know, any of the troops got, you know, if they use gas. So that was the weirdest thing was just like, Oh wow, that guy actually cared about something.

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       Right. I want to, I don't think I saw that kind of rang a bell with you.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       It was one of the German bunkers and then was like, right as you walked in, there was a little like a shower thing that like, I guess if, if whatever they spray you, if you hosed it off you, I mean, it's pretty ironic that he was concerned about that. Consider, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:13:58       no, I could see that, that, that, that like, oh, oh yeah, actually, okay. He was looking out for somebody other than himself. Yeah, sorry. Anyways, um, but I, I'm going to all these places and I'm talking to people and, um, you know, thinking there's this big divide and you know, red states and blue states and, you know, make a joke out of this bite, travel from state to state and I don't notice a red one or a blue. It's all the same. And it was, it's been the same since I've been traveling since the 80 [inaudible] punk rock bands 82 and 83 throughout all of this traveling, I've traveled the whole time and, um, raised, we've raised our daughters who are now 1821 to be world citizens because that's what we all fucking are. You know, let's face it. Um, I'm an American and proud American.

Speaker 3:          00:14:45       I make no bones about that. I'm, I'm super proud to be American. My Dad fought world war two, you know, my parents grew up in the depression, but two of my brothers are in Vietnam. We went to this amazing, uh, I've got seven siblings. I mean, the variety in our family is stunning, you know, and the things that I got to see because I had this super cool mom, you know, Martin Luther King March when he died and all of these kind of epic things that I wish I was older when I did. Um, but I'm traveling to America at first and talking to people, I'm like, oh, this to buy, oh, it's another selling tool for the news. And it's politics. Dude. You read enough to know better, like he fell down as stupid rat like the guy and you know Louisiana, you know once people you would think where are the other, you know, I mean he was alligators like marshmallows.

Speaker 3:          00:15:40       Who Knew? Right then he, you know, one thing he commented, he's been doing it for 45 years and it goes to the marshes are disappearing. But what do you mean? Because they are disappearing at an l like I used to be able to go through this channel right here. We can't, as you see, we got to turn around and go in. Our whole trip was this like circumnavigating old paths. He used to go and he goes, it's like 900 cubic yards per 30 minutes or something. Like some, he gave me some stat. So you find out more about your country. And I what I found out that the thing that being, you know, getting back together with the band and those guys and that's kind of talking through things and getting on this back to this place where we're friends and we're able to go out like seriously kick some ass and be like, we never phone it in man.

Speaker 3:          00:16:28       It's back to that real thing and that brotherhood and it gave me like this intellectual sobriety or whatever clarity to go out and just, I was relaxed and able to talk to people and put things together. And I started writing while you out on the road. Yeah, I started writing. I thought maybe I was gonna write a book, but I was reading hillbilly elegy by JD bands where I was out there. I read Sarah Canto whores viewed from the fiber country, read some book and I thought, is there great books everybody should read them? And I thought, well, should I put another book out of like my observations? Is that too much information? Too many observations. And, uh, I've wanted to do like a really as a sidebar to this. I've, for the last 20 something years, I've wanted to do a record. It's really toned down like Mark Atlantic and Johnny thunders acoustic type of record and I just didn't really have the time or the, the, the intent to do as a record like that I guess.

Speaker 3:          00:17:32       And I was writing all of these words like chapter beginnings basically. And uh, I carry acoustic guitar on the road with me always. And in a rare moment that I was in a hotel room, I was looking at my computer, it's just like, you have yours out. I had my computer, my guitar in my lap and I'm strong strumming e major in, uh, in a B minor seven chord. And I was reading the words too. Uh, it's not too light. Will turn out the song. Everybody's lying. Yeah, I need some truth. Everybody is trying to push you to the abuse. Um, and uh, the whole idea of like, maybe I'll make that that austere record now and get these ideas across.

Speaker 2:          00:18:18       Well, I've got to tell you, you said a lot of things that IB, the like heard people that have respect say like on this album, you know, you've kind of talking about everything. Uh, first of all, the sound of it, Kevin, if I already said this to you or if I said this down on the, on the podcast or I sit in the driveway as you came up, but like first of all, the sound of it is, is complete departure from anything that hurts, heard you do in a great way. It's a record that I kind of felt like I wanted to go for a drive when I was listening to it and it reminded me of like, um, it's Kinda got that timeless vibe to it, which is what I like and what you're talking about. He talking about everything about the drug epidemic, homelessness. Um, there's that great line in there where you say a go for a walk and find my better man or something like that, which is literally something I've been doing just trying to deal with. Uh, you know, the big demon in my family tree is like rage issues, you know, and just how that way yeah. Wears on people. Yeah. It just wears on people and Shit. So, um, I I just threw one, listen to this really connected.

Speaker 3:          00:19:23       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:19:23       With this stuff and it's, it's kind of the stuff that I've been kind of saying as far as like, they're sitting there going after you for Caitlyn Jenner joke and meanwhile you're out there talking to some guy who's trying to go through a marsh and you're saying to 900 something yards, square footage or whatever is disappearing every day. And every once in awhile you'll see some anorexic looking polar bear and you're like, I think this is the priority. And they got everybody screaming and yelling at each other about just complete nonsense. And then when you go on the road, red state, blue state, this country, that country, I just find everybody who's just walking around, you know, they're cool. They want to make sure they have enough money for food, they want to find love. It's really basic. It's pretty basic. But then you put it on TV, it's like, ah, everybody's just screaming, acting like the world is ending because of these other fucking issues.

Speaker 2:          00:20:13       And it's like, no, this is the real shit that's happening over here. And I don't, I don't know. It's that I, I call it the support the troops like Zombie mode. They got everybody in, which I just love that expression, support the troops. Like why wouldn't you, you know, so it's like, do you support the troops? There's only one answer. Yes. That's like, there you go. But it's almost like a bill where there's all this other shit attached to it. And then that supporting troops makes it like, you can't question where you send them, how long they're there, how they're, when they come back, who's making money, reasons why you go over there. And the second I found once that kind of took hold, any sort of intelligence discussion went from just support the troops America. And if you said anything in the other way, it's like, oh, you're a socialist. Get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 3:          00:21:05       His is a, is the truth of, of that, um, presidents, kings, Queens, warm makers have never made a chase that's impacted our lives. The people that make the change to the good art are us. Right. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:21:25       my friend, what do you think about cause World War Two seems like there was definitely, you know, obviously that had to happen. I mean if they were going fucking what I'll be going down. I mean it had to be stopped. So it's at some point like I'm not saying all war is bad. Do you feel, do you feel that?

Speaker 3:          00:21:39       Well I, I was getting to a point actually was like support our troops. Like a friend of mine in US helping each other instead of like the slogan support your troops. You know that my friend is a mountain climber who's a guys, it was this biker guy got a really bad accident back is in a cage. Just put, they're going to chop it up and he decides to climb Everest. And he goes through this hell and, and as personal Holly gets to Everest, climbs it, and he's coming back for whatever estate, gets on a plane from India to Germany to Manheim than any kid gets on the plane, just came back from Afghanistan. It got his leg blown off, went to Walter Reed and in Madison, you know, and my buddy Tim says, this guy's kids there at the airport together. He's talking to the guy, he's got a, uh, you know, kind of, uh, uh, temporary prosthetic leg and Tim's talking to him.

Speaker 3:          00:22:30       He's got a cage around his back. My buddy Tim and his foots hanging on, you know, by like just some clue and stuff. And he's talking to this kid, this pattern, marine kid, this kid, 21 years old thing. When you meet him there, kid, he's like, what are you going to do? Is like, I, I don't, maybe I sit on my mom's couch and either I don't know what to do. You know? So Tim's like, you want to climb a mountain? And he started one guy, but one guy and he got a bunch of us involved and we help train these guys. You know what I'd done? My friend Tim now has got better veterans up all seven highest mountains in the world. Legless armless one guy missing two legs. They did Kilimanjaro, two legs missing. So he had these little climbing prosthetics for Tim's figured it all out. Like how, and it created this whole now network of these guys who find those hopeless guys who just gotten back right now and they get them into this, this climbing club. I call it a gang. Uh, but you know, that's how you support your troops. You follow the lead of a friend, uh, like a guy like my friend Tim.

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       Oh, you mean you shouldn't just say that on Twitter and on, you're done. Like, so I hear all this. You hear on the news a little American flag Emoji

Speaker 3:          00:23:52       and then you've done your part of it puts perspective on the, like the social media side of, you know, help our or our trips. Like Tim's just doing it like a ton of people. This is in Hollywood, you know, people are jumping in and helping and doing raising money and do these climbs aren't cheap and, and come in and help train these guys. And that's, that's how you do it. And that's the America I know, not the one I see on the news, not the one I see on social media. You know.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       What do you think I remember like when I first like hung out with you, hung out with you.

Speaker 4:          00:24:27       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:24:28       two things that blew me away. One, you tell a great street joke. Yeah, you too. And uh, you already, you had me laughing in the setup because they, maybe it was something, some joke when some guy went to a hotel and then you just, I could see off the top of you head and you decided to pick a hotel and you said it was this hotel and you described the architecture is as an aside, you already had me laughing. And then secondly, we were somehow talking about, um,

Speaker 4:          00:24:53       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:24:53       all that, the high end fashion that women were into. Do you remember that? And I was just like, I remember as a kid, like I had never heard of Louis Vuitton. If you wanted to get it, you gotta be at a total fashion nerd and you don't have to go to like New York City, like, uh, fifth avenue, I would think. Or maybe had to go to Paris. I had no idea. Seattle, they probably didn't have any of them. No. And now it's like I was doing some, tore through the deep south and I was in somewhere Alabama and they had a fucking mall and there was the same bags that you saw like in Paris. And I was like, I'm just, I know you're smart with money and shit. It's just like people, just regular people going out and buying, like spending money on bags like that.

Speaker 3:          00:25:34       It was sex in the city and made that change, dude. Yeah, do a theory. But when that came on and my wife's watching all their friends, they're talking about shoes like Manolo Blahniks. I'm like, what is that? Their shoes, Jimmy child's shoes and bags and stuff. And that's when that whole culture changed for American, like purchasing. Uh, yeah cause you think

Speaker 2:          00:25:57       you will kills me is I spent like, I always joke, I spent like 15, 20 years in the back of the plane Sunday. By the way, I'm going to buy a fucking headphone cord long enough that okay,

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       they got to chances for that. Bill Berg got a guitar soon. Just get her Stacy. I know. Probably Radio Shack other than they don't have that anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       I know. I I they used to have one right down the street and I didn't, I didn't go but um,

Speaker 4:          00:26:19       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:20       Uh, I literally just fell out with saying we were talking about the,

Speaker 3:          00:26:22       did I tell you what, when my friend though I live down the street from me, him and his wife, they live in the apartment and he's become really good friends with his next door neighbor guy lists by himself. [inaudible] guys. They'd been friends, really good friends with the past like year and a half. And my friend with his wife, he was watching TV last night and it's living room, gets a text from its next door neighbor. Hey Man, I, um, I'm really sorry. I got to be honest. I've been, I've been banging your wife for the last few months, but it, but it's over. I've stopped. So my friend put down his phone, he went in the other room, got a gun and shot his wife and it came back and sat down and sofas. Like, what did I just do? My God. And there's phone buzzes again. It's this his friend next door and like, oh, sorry, I met Wifi. Got them autos

Speaker 2:          00:27:15       that was going to go, you can cut that out if you want. No, come on man. You've listened to me play drums. I can listen to you tell a fucking joke. Um, but I, that's what struck me when I met you. I was like, this guy like that remind, that's like something a comedian does, like looks at something and just how you, you put it together in like, uh, like, uh, with music. But like I even when you were saying that to me, I was, I was actually thinking, fuck, why didn't I think of that? Because that would be a killer bit. And because it always be, like I was saying, oh, now I remember, I thought I was, I spent like 15 years in the back of the plane. Yes. Working my way up, you know, I always say the blast row then trying to get the exit row poor man's first class.

Speaker 2:          00:27:58       Right. That's actually sometimes can be better. Better. Yeah. And then getting finally getting up to the front. Um, so now I get them to pass the front. It was like, whoa. Yeah, these people are, these people do. Yeah. And they'd be on the phone or they'd be writing shit. They own banks and stuff. Yeah. And, and for Y'alls, you still riding in the back. All they do in the front of the plane is just treat you like a human being to give you. That's all it is. They just give you a seat that actually fits a human being. They'll come by frequently and ask if you want water or food as opposed to jam and you in the back. So what has struck me over, uh, is the amount of people that I've seen that will come on the plane, you know, and you just, you know, a comedian, I just, you know, I'm always like looking at people and stuff and I'll see something come up with a Louis Vuitton bag.

Speaker 2:          00:28:43       I'm like, oh this person is probably sitting next to me. And you'd watch them go into the back of the plane and you just start thinking of like priorities. Like as far as like, I guess the bag maybe that is worth more, you could sell it. I'm just thinking like why the fuck, it's like the person who buys the flashy car before they buy a house and they're still like renting. And I think that like beyond the sense sex in the city that now the whole like social media where everybody is, is they're doing their own, like almost like new cycles. Spin that of, of the, I'm crushing it. You hold the camera up, see look like 30% better looking. You got all this money and you just live in and all you're doing is you're taking snapshots of the coolest parts of your month. Yeah. Not the one where you're fucking crying during a breakup or a, you lost your job. None of that shit is on there. So it just kind of makes you feel like everybody is leaving

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       you behind and that you need all of this stuff. And um, I think we're still learning how like, it's funny because again, back to my girls, 18 and 21 so we had to, you're raising a kid, right? And I'm a rookie here, two and a half years. Okay. So our kids got to, let's say seven and 10. That's when social media was just starting to like be a thing. And so now you've got to raise your kids through this social media thing too. How did you do that by the way? We had to figure it out and crushing blows, you know, just school kind of like bully, like, uh, you know, social media, bullying from school, like, okay girls, you know, it's not real. It's just like, they would never say that to your face. So you've gotta and then, but, but I lost you there.

Speaker 3:          00:30:31       So they would be getting bullied on social media from somebody at school, like a different group of girls or something, you know? And so you have to, you know, the girls are crying or something will happen like that. Right. And you have to talk to them. Like, would they ever said that to your face? No. Okay. So you've got to look at this as like kind of, uh, uh, pussies, way out, you know, so how does that work? The next day at school? It's like they said, I'll let shit, you don't confront them. Like, I don't know how it works with kids today. Yeah, you'll, you'll figure it out. But I think what's happened, like it started off with the bowling and then, and then these kids became smarter. They're also aware of what's going on outside as well. You know, they know the school shootings way more real to them than, than us because it's happening and could happen at school to that.

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       Right, right. Um, they're aware of things more visceral. They're there, they're in it. They're social media geniuses more than us. We follow dumb shit and like, you know, you can't say that they're, they, it's been part of them. So now they're, there's weeding it out there, weeding it out, and now they're starting to take the pass way more than we can, the way smarter on social media than we are. And uh, like the insta life, the Instagram life, you know, pies seam, that's more like 25 and above the pupil that Instagram life is fabulous. Right. You know, the kids younger, this is my observation, right. Take it for what you will. Now I'm listening to this because it's something that worries me because I think now like my daughters and their friends, boys and girls, like we know all of their friends very well. We were like the house sets.

Speaker 3:          00:32:15       It's cool to come hang out and let some really astounding kids and, and uh, they're taking the pass right now and they're, they're kind of sitting there silently. She see Emma Gonzales ever speak up. The parkland, like those kids who spoke like through this thing and then we're smarter than you, you know, that is kind of this new generation that's coming up. It's just Imogen's Alice and the Parkland kids who kind of stood up and said, okay, hold on a second. Right. We do have something to say and here it goes, right? Uh, blown away by their intellect in like, okay, if everybody's as smart as that 18 we're in good hands and it, the kids I observe or are just like that and they're just kind of waiting like they have now 18 they can vote.

Speaker 2:          00:33:05       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:33:05       um, what are you guys going to do with that we're going to take over?

Speaker 2:          00:33:09       No, that's the answer I get. Every generation think that my, my problem is I feel like there like a,

Speaker 5:          00:33:16       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:17       Like their hands are like bound, you know what I mean? By the time you get to a certain level as a politician, like th th th th the way the money is set up. Like they are there already. All, all of these people's favors and just the, I don't want to get, I also don't get why, where it's like, Hey, do you want cleaner drinking water? And everybody goes yes. And then they, they get to attach all of this other shit to it. I don't know. I don't understand. Well, why can't, the thing that we're saying yes to just be the thing that you're doing,

Speaker 3:          00:33:46       because I think we have to do it, not the politics. It's always been that way. We have to do it like my friend Tim, and it is mount climbing things. We have

Speaker 2:          00:33:55       to do it. Yeah, that makes sense to me. But being able to let go, so if they're saying they're gonna take over by doing shit like that, if there's anybody young listening, that's the only way I think to make change is, uh, is you have to start it and do it at a, at a small level. But if you, like I remember when Trump, we became president and he said something like, you know, I'm going to come in here and I'm going to drain the swamp. And I just laughed when I heard that. It's like, and what do you think they're going to do? Just sit there and be like, well, I guess he got us. It's like, no one's going to work with you if you're saying you're going to go in here and you're, you're gonna, you're gonna expose all, uh, like political corruption.

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       Um, like at that level, it's just so walled off. Um, I dunno, I just Kinda got back from Europe and I just felt a weird vibe when I was over there and I, I forget what country I was in. I was just like, are you guys going to start this shit up again? And it kind of got a weird laugh and then something in the back when, yeah, like just the vibe over there was, it's not the place I went to for the first time 10 years ago or now it's just becoming like, uh, like look at like fucking Paris and mean Jesus Christ. It's like, that's a fucking, it's like a mosh pit over there every other day. Like something crazy like a,

Speaker 3:          00:35:13       the yellow vest protestors. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:35:16       that and then wage thing. And when I went to Sweden there was these other people protesting and I was just like, what's going on here? And I talked to a couple people over there who are Muslim and they just like, yeah, racism is kind of like a, it's not the way it is in the United States. We have like such a long history of it. So people really like overt with it over here and just, and I don't know. Yeah, I, I don't want to like tell you what, what I saw cause your album I thought is really positive and I don't want, I want to put my awful world view into it, but I kind of came away from it with the positive of just like, look, I'm just going to try to be a better person. Try to be cool with the people that are in my life and just try not to be a dick because other than that, this stuff is so big and overwhelming.

Speaker 3:          00:35:56       I mean, I think what you just said it, that's the answer. You know, I too have traveled to European countries that I've gone to says shit man, before the wall went down, you know, many years before the wall and then the wall going down. And then, you know, opening up of a tech Czechoslovakia became the Czech Republic. And, and seeing like all of this that I remember part Perestroika and you know, the opening up of USSR and, and after that glass nose and Perestroika and then the wall going down and then seeing those countries themselves, chase Italy and republic and what's, Oh, what's going on here now? You guys were, we're super stoked and now there's kind of another vibe going on instead of the five. Talk to people.

Speaker 2:          00:36:42       Why does that always happen?

Speaker 3:          00:36:45       Um, there's, I think, you know, I read so much history, so there's cycles, man. Like, and, and we've gone through, we're going through a cycle right now. There's what I've learned from reading so much history is, again, man, the politicians, American politicians, European politicians, they don't chase. They run to get into the office. And that you're right, there's so many favors to be repaid and that point and that, you know, man of the people are a woman of the people. That ship has sailed by that point. Um, and it's always been like the people that made a change. There have been just in really small than a ways. There was a small little ways and that's the positivity that we pick up from other people. They you, you got to kind of bring it local into your own neighborhood, you know, if you go got and try to solve huge problems.

Speaker 2:          00:37:41       I always wondered like I was sitting there thinking like with Evan, everybody stopped watching the news.

Speaker 2:          00:37:48       Then how would we behave? And it's like, well before television there was still all kinds of brutality. What's then made me think like, well then how did they get their view out there? It seemed like back then what they would do is they would send people out to get slaughtered so then they could just be like, do you see what happened? Like sort of like what the native Americans where they would just make these treaties like, okay, we're just going to go to here. And then they tell, hey people, there's free land beyond here. And they, they, they tell them something, then they would go out and get slaughtered and then we had to go get her revenge, which was really them just using people to go fight the native Americans and then just take more of the land. Um, I don't know. I have this odd sort of like I, I dunno where I am now in a world holistic, it's a little bit, but I'm also like super positive locally.

Speaker 2:          00:38:42       Like I, I'm just kinda like just person to person is a real positive experience for me. But it's why I don't like when you though those school shootings and all that type of stuff, I stopped watching those because what I hate about it is I don't want to know that fucking person's name and I feel like the same way somebody watches you guys in a band makes them want to be in a band. I feel like school shootings are like, that's like keeping up with the Kardashians for psychos and then they want to watch it and all those women who young girls who aspire to be like a car Dashi in an all glamorous psychos, watch that and go like, oh, that's, that's what I want to do.

Speaker 3:          00:39:25       I don't disagree with you on anything you just said.

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       No, I don't hear that a lot. Thank you. Yeah. I usually get a lot of pushback. Yeah. The Shit I say,

Speaker 3:          00:39:35       you know, uh, I mean I've got involved in a few things because when I wrote these, if it was going to be a book and there was going to be a social action involved, now that's a record. The song social action involved, right? It's small things. Like I got involved homelessness in Seattle's super gnarly. It's super visible like in La because street camping is legal, right? RV camping is legal. You can have four grams or under of heroin and not get arrested. Seattle, they tried this social experiment. It's not really working. It's makes homelessness very visible there. And, um, I had a brother in law that went through, he was a, it was my oldest brother in law. He ended up homeless on the street and when I was in punk rock bands and I would see him down town when they're all sketchy, you know, punk rock clubs and stuff. Um, is my brother in law man. And this guy is a guy helped raise me when my dad left, like my brother in law, Dexter buzz taught me how to run sprint and do all this catch with football and all this stuff. And now I'm seeing him, I'm 17 years old and his eyes are yellow jaundice and you know, alcoholism and 1983 82 and like help try to help Dexter out. Like, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:40:59       and he helped somebody out in that situation.

Speaker 3:          00:41:01       Like my friend had a punk rock club, like, Hey, can my brother and I texted her, like, make some money sweeping up or whatever. That's how you help. Like,

Speaker 2:          00:41:09       but he, but he was, uh, receptive to it.

Speaker 3:          00:41:11       Text her. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you know, he helped me one time I was downtown and I got surrounded by a group of these dudes who are homeless, you know, street and suddenly like out of nowhere, like leave that guy alone lungs, my brother in law and there comes decks, drop out of the stairs and like he know night. And uh, I thought I was going to get the shit beat out of me or worse, you know. And, and uh, so he looked out after me too as well. Um, we're brother-in-law's, you know, I was, he was 20 something years my senior. Right. Uh, what is the age difference in your 20 20th, so yeah, you're the baby. Yeah. So I'm 55. My oldest brother, 75. Is that right? Yeah. Wow. So he was burned. My oldest brothers and sisters were born during World War II at the army

Speaker 2:          00:42:04       cause I was, cause I was reading, you know, Park next, our per view book. It was saying how, uh, you know when you were like in high school, like two year brothers were in Vietnam. And I was trying to like, wait a minute, what, what is, what is, what is this the spread on that yet? How, how old were you when they, like when your brothers went away and how long went off to war and how long were they away at war?

Speaker 3:          00:42:27       I wasn't born yet. When my first one went off.

Speaker 2:          00:42:30       Oh, so he wasn't there right after [inaudible] took over from the France. Right, right. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:42:34       Like 63 or 64 maybe. I was just born. Um, so he went over for, you know, so he went and right at 18. Yeah, it could because there was so many brothers in our family. I think at the beginning of the Vietnam war there was sort of like still this kind of, well, I'll do my, do my bed, there's told me brothers, we'll get drafted anyhow. Right. I'll be able to choose where I go if I, if I sign up right. Dad and signed up for World War II. So there was, our grandfather was a world war one, so there was this kind of thing like, okay, this is what you do. Uh, my s second brother, uh, the second oldest brother mark did the same thing. Signed up, thought he could get in, I'll get in the navy or something. And they, they, they put them in the army.

Speaker 3:          00:43:22       He was in, he was in the shit. He never talked about ever in his life. How does that work? I thought if you enlisted, you got to choose. Yeah. Well I think he thought he was able to choose and I think they needed more people in the, in the army and they kind of just put them someplace and so he's building forward, forward, uh, uh, I know he was building those forward arm positions, you know, and then had to hold it down and tells they could fill it. Um, he did that for a couple of years. He got his Gi bill used it. But the school is a math genius in a park at Hanford and then at Boeing. It never talked about his experience in the war. He just died of cancer a couple of years ago. He did work a hamper for a couple of years and he was in Vietnam for a couple of years and that doctors, you know, kind of put some things together, you know, but Hanford also nuclear.

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       Yeah. I'm not that bright a guy. He can produce a nuclear. So you need to do that a lot during this pocket. Hampers and nuclear. This is a state and you know, but uh, uh, what we was any out. So my, my brother died downtown Seattle, my brother in law, Dexter, uh, Union Gospel mission was just placed where that he used the services when my sister that was married to him, she also died just a couple of years ago. Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. So she all, she wanted all of her, she died suddenly. Um, so we see in her will like all every like donations or whatever it goes to the Union Gospel mission. Like, I better check out this place. My brother in law and then my sister and I'm seeing homelessness and I do a trip down there to Union Gospel mission. I've seen it, you know, it's scary. It's the things I talk about in the song, like I'm not going near there.

Speaker 3:          00:45:19       Right. Um, but I went in and the first time I went with, with my wife and she just had just done a news thing. She was all dressed up and she's like, I want to go. I'm like, well, you're looking pretty, you know, like, uh, you know, uh, you look like you look really, you live really indoors and it's like, what are you doing here? Yeah, yeah. But, but you know, we travel a lot, so we do see a lot and we, you know, when we travel as much and see the things we see, we grow at a layer of empathy I guess. Like you're not afraid to go some places because you understand people are pretty much cool everywhere you go. Even that scary homeless guy that's yelling, you know, if you read Elyn, Saks is the center cannot hold your understand more about schizophrenia. Like that guy's not screaming at you. He's screaming at some thing that he doesn't. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:46:14       no, they just went to Israel for the first time and I thought it was going to be everybody just shooting guns at each other. He was just chilling, chilling. It was cool. Yeah. So I'll say the Palestinian people protesting and they were, they were civil, the whole thing. I was like, oh, this is like, and it was right on the Mediterranean Sea. It's like, this is beautiful. That's just not how I pictured it. Because whenever they show it, it's after something horrible happen. Yeah. Or are they, it's like they don't even talk about it over here until something happens.

Speaker 3:          00:46:41       European people, if you've noticed, you've traveled to Europe, are terrified to come to us because what they see as the guns and the shooting and stuff, I'm not going there, you know, so it's, it's whatever you perceive something else to be. Right. Um, right. So, so we went to the Union Gospel mission and they said, do you want to, we're going to go on a run right now I'm running, what's that? What? We're going to go into the jungle, which is arguably the worst homeless and cabinet in America. If they called it the jungle, it wasn't going to be something that's been there for a long time. These guys have an MTI, Mti out part of it. Um, cops won't go in there. The city, how are they going to go on there but not the cops. The cops, like we're not going in there, you know, cause they, uh, so, but these guys from the Union Gospel mission who have lived in the jungle and I went to Rehab and now run the Union Gospel mission and we lived here and they tell me my point to all of this.

Speaker 3:          00:47:39       They, they, we, I started asking him like, how would people get here? How do people get to that tent on the street? How do people get to the jungle? Like living in the bushes, like underneath the freeway. Like it's like, well, you know, it's 85% drug and alcohol addiction. Okay. I kind of took it, but there's a number. Okay, thanks. But like I was, you know, I mean, my fear of living on the street even drew my whole, my addiction, I'll call you, like kept me off the street. I'd worked like nine times as hard to be able to trace. You paid the rent, right? Yeah. Nine Times. He's like, yeah, but did you have like abuse as a kid? No. Yet did you could, you know, go through foster care note? Did you get abused multiple times? No I didn't. None of that. He goes that 85% number of drugs now I'll call coincides almost directly with the amount of child abuse that these and the guy I'm talking to, I won't say his name right.

Speaker 3:          00:48:43       It happened to me, it happened to, my brother happened to this guy right here sitting next to us bad and, and we got stuck in this cycle that it took me 50 years of my life to finally get out of, I didn't know how I'd know means it goes to the t like the, there's a ton Linda Bennington, Chester's wife since since his untimely passing got hooked up to this thing, the five signs, the five signs to recognize something's wrong and this starts very young, these five signs and I think the five signs should be putting in like school like yes, right. Like, cause we remember going to elementary school, there was the guy that, well that guy's a little rapey. You knew it like in the fifth grade, you know what I mean? Like I said, she's going to grow up and not going to be cool with checks because something's going on the little rapey that guy's a little, you know, you could tell like at a young age like we knew there was some guys weird like weird.

Speaker 3:          00:49:51       That's all you had. Was it weird? He just killed his family's cat, you know, staying away from that guy, you know. Uh, there's, there's signs, you know, as a young kid and if we had like, and this one starts, one person like to Linda started stinking, I'm into it. I'm have a propeller thing with my record that you can get involved. I'm going to make tee shirts from my tour. They had the five signs on the back of it. Oh that's great. All I do is come on podcasts and bitch about shit. You actually doing something about it. I need to to get fans involved and like if we can just like one person at a time, um, you know, it start with the, you know, sure. You hear about a guy getting radicalized on Facebook and it goes and shoots up is in place. But sure. What allowed that guy to get radicalized on some, the rest what you said there

Speaker 2:          00:50:42       about the jungle, right? Yeah. I know everybody is going to give me shit for not bringing up your song, but I'm not going to do

Speaker 3:          00:50:48       well. They had a sign that said no trespassing. They have at Union Gospel mission is great. It says no trespassing sign. When somebody back in the day eighties late eighties spray painted like gang writing, welcome to the jungle and that was assigned to get into the jungle. Wow. And they have, I took a picture of it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       I'm saying like how that if I was to drive by that not having not talked to you [inaudible] my first thought would be, you know, I want it. I've got to get the fuck out here. I'm not saying it still wouldn't be, I would be afraid, but I'm now seeing those people is like, that's some, that's, those are hurt kids grown up, which humanizes them as opposed to looking at it like, cause I have to be honest with you, like I see a lot of homeless people out here in La and there's that thing where you like, I definitely, you know, as much of an asshole as I am, I am empathetic and I, and I do want to try to help out, but it's just how to go in and approach without getting fucked up. Like I would just went by a drug store the other day and this actually, I almost said something to this kid.

Speaker 2:          00:51:52       There was a guy who clearly so many people have just like, like mental problems. Right. You know, and this guy was just like, he was still going on some, you know, schizophrenia fucking riff about, uh, something about hobbits or something and the way he was moving it freaked me out in this younger kid out. And at some point we both kind heard what he was saying, which was comical. On a base level if he wasn't living the life he was living. But then I saw the younger kids start smiling and then he takes his phone out to film them. And I'm just looking at like, dude, this is like, cause they shut down. Mental hospitals is now going to become your content for your Instagram page. And I almost said something to him. Um, but then there was just like, alright, have an Iwatch, shit like that on you.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       Now I'm kind of a hypocrite because I remember when bumfights first came out, I remember that these guys would pay bumps to beat the shit out of each other. And I was the age I was at, I was way too old to find that funny. But I was also still trying to find my voice as a comedian. And there was that whole thing amongst comics where like, you know, you gotta like you can't be softy, everything's gotta be funny. So I watched Saturn and entertainment level, so I just, I quickly was just like, all right, what? I'm going to be a parent to this 20 something year old. I'll feel like a fucking hypocrite. And I didn't say anything, but my, my problem is, is I always go to anger and what it should have went to was more like, hey man, this guy's, he's, his life is hard enough, man. You don't need a blow. I should have gone like that. And it's my default emotion would be like, you know, hey, fuck had you know this guy. You know, I would, you know, and who listens after hey fuck head. Who listens to your true

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       Yo, my phrase, yes. Come on. Excuse me. Fellow American. Yeah. Um, yeah, I, I read this, you're talking about the guy yelling at something. I mean, we could go on forever bell. I gotta tell you, I'm like, there's levity in this and there's hope like in the record that, that, that, that's what I liked there. There, there is. But I read, I read a lot and there's this book, I brought it up earlier. The center cannot hold, was written by this woman. She's currently the head of school psychology at USC. If you've heard, we've heard of this school, it's a big school.

Speaker 2:          00:54:14       I hear about them when they win championships and scan that stuff. But she, she's a schizo frantic and she wrote this book. She did admit it to, she would live this like kind of solo life until she was, she has schizophrenia and wrote a book. Was it, I mean she's, the head of the joke there was, it was an uneven, she's, she's brilliant but, but to start her story, you know, she's, she, she gets scholarships to Cambridge and yell law and all of this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:54:43       Meanwhile going off on these schizophrenia tirades of like, I've killed a million people and a million people killed me. I've been killed a million times. Her and her friend stopped and then they would like, what are you, what's going on? Oh, I was joking like,

Speaker 2:          00:55:00       but it still was able to contain it like that.

Speaker 3:          00:55:03       We went into a hospital in England for a year, the, but over there, the professor recognize what was going on. She's brilliant. No, she's brilliant. He put her in this place. They don't chain you down in the mental hospitals and they use velcro. They don't. They actually done. Uh, but she got, she had her stories. You should just read the book, but I wanted to tell you about the, her beginnings of that. Like she, when she was nine or 10, she always thought there was a man outside their door at night. And she's like, well what, what nine or 10 year old kid doesn't kind of think that like the boogeyman and she's like 1516 mark and home from high school to houses would talk to her, but everybody else seems to be handling it well. Right. The houses must be talking to everybody. They're talking to me, but I'm looking at other kids on the street. They're not freaking out on it, so I'll just, I won't either. I'll just hold it in. And it progressed and progressed and progressed to where she was on the roof of that. They'll know about it. But after doing a hundred graduate screaming and you know, blacked out like screaming map Kelda million people had been killed a million times and

Speaker 2:          00:56:17       I was going to ask, so she doesn't remember saying that. Some of it she does, she talks very real, very real.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       She would have these moments where suddenly it all came to her like, ah, I've killed. But she would, she also writes in that I would never harmed anybody. That's what's so misunderstood. Like schizophrenia means a million different things where they put a label on sort of one thing just to kind of get it in a group. But I read this book all the way to its end. She's now 60 maybe or something. She was the head of school psychology at USC and I drove past a guy on sunset and vine. He's on the corner screaming, chanting the top of his lungs, like the guy you saw and several of them parking lot of where it was right. I suddenly had empathy for, I understood it a lot more. And I think, um, uh, reading and educating yourself if you're interested in your fellow man and it's just interested in how we've gotten here and what's in the future and cycles of things. I just read a lot and it's so interesting and like even current administration's don't bother me cause it just passes, you know, we go to Europe and stuff, we see how administrations affect other countries, how they think about us. You know, there was, I mean we've been traveling through a few wars, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:57:41       I don't travel the way you like, I, I've, I do a little quick little runs. You guys would go and live there. Yeah, we're there.

Speaker 3:          00:57:49       Um, yeah, we've been traveling there and staying in Europe would go there and stay for it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:55       How did you like when when you guys were always blows my mind. I understand like when you get to a certain level, you can afford a business manager who can handle your mail and your bills and all of that shit when you will come up and you just touring around in a van. Yeah. Okay. And there's taxes to be paid and there's the cable and yeah, like money. So like you guys. Oh yeah. It's just the sheer that see you basically homeless in Flores and yeah. You, you know, like

Speaker 3:          00:58:23       I always, I had such as my parents grew up in the end, the depression. So I grew up with depression era values. Like we'd hear these horror stories of the depression. Like I'm never, there was one time on, I was 18 years old, I was on a punk rock tour. I was starving, literally shaking, starving, and a guy said, you can go down to the, I'd had jobs as cooks. I paid tax, I've done construction. I've done every kind of job. There was this tour, I had to stop for two weeks, my construction job and go on tour. I didn't have any money. I had apartment paid this, you know, the taxes, you pay pad of Europe, they take it out of your paycheck, you know. Um, but I was starving, penniless and starving in San Francisco and they said, you can go down to the emergency food stamps.

Speaker 3:          00:59:15       Oh. But I was so hungry. I didn't have a choice. I wasn't going to fucking panhandle. I wasn't, I didn't have it. I didn't, there was no safety net in my family. You know, like you can't, what they mom, why aren't me some cash? My mom didn't have any money, you know. Um, so I went to this line and I, I'd maybe it happened for a reason and went to the welfare line and you can get $80 in emergency food stamps and it was women with babies, but six, you know, and there's me, I'm an able bodied, you know, 18 year old bumps. Fucking starving man. If I didn't eat, I hadn't eaten for like three days, you know, and I just needed something to eat. So I waited there and I got, and I went into a store and I bought,

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:00:03       bunch of like a loaf of bread and some Bologna and some cheese. I still, so I still had like $70 of food stamps and I gave, I gave him five bucks left. Yeah. So I gave that, I get food stamps to, to a woman that was in the store. And you want these. And I never had that experience. Like, I'm never going to be homeless. I'm never going to be homeless and I don't want it. I paid that back, that 10 bucks I got from the welfare a million times. I Oprah paint, you know, I met my taxes and everything, but how do you know later on when I started making money and stuff like a and getting mail, so you have to have an address for that. The gas, right. So, you know, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:00:44       I got a buddy of mine, a comedian, he actually, he so living out in the woods, he tried to legally see if he could stop getting mail. Oh. And just like he just, that's the level that he wants to just not be involved. And they were like, no, you have to, you have to have a mailing address, a SPEC. We kind of have to know where you are just in case you do some crazy shit. We know where to start looking for you, I guess. Um, I went down that, you know, like 10 years ago I got totally into like conspiracy theory and shit. And I was buying like fucking powdered food and all, it's not how I ended up learning how to fly a helicopter because I got so fucking scared of living out here. Like what happens when the dollar collapses in the shit hits the fan.

Speaker 2:          01:01:25       How the fuck do you get out? It takes like nine hours to get out of here. Even when it works in up and out was the only way I'd never took into consideration how expensive a fucking helicopter wasn't. You can't land it in anymore. So you know how to fly one. Yeah. That's not an easy thing to do. It's no flying. It's not hard. It's all the shit you need to know so you don't fuck up when you're up there. That's, it's the, the ground school is, is, is the hard part. But like, you know, I mean if you could drive a stick shift, you know, I mean it's like four stick shifts once, isn't it? No, no we're not. It's, it's this, this is up and down. This here is where you want it go movies. Yeah. Yeah. So like the emergency brake, if you want to go up, you go like this, they're right now, can't see this. What are you doing? If you want to go down and you go like that, you just went down with his hand and then the cyclic, the stick between your legs. He just Kinda, you know, whichever way you want to go, like a stairwell and then, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       fly a helicopter. Now you can show me how to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:02:21       Basically it, well if you're ever in a helicopter and then you just got your pedals, that kind of keeps your ass and you know, is where you wanted to be. I mean, it's very, it putting it all together is a little about pat and you had rubbing your stomach, but you know, I, when you know, you play bass and can be singing like in [inaudible], what do they call that? Uh, like a I'm poly rhythmic kind of thing. Yeah. Where it's like, I always wanted how the guys can play, can play guitar and sing where it's like the phrasing is different.

Speaker 3:          01:02:53       Just once things stuff. Yeah. Yeah. You that takes a lot of practice. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:02:58       but that is way fucking harder. That is way fucking harder than the helicopter. Helicopter is more the fear like am I going to fucking kill myself? That's indeed. Yeah. You don't think that playing bass singing songs

Speaker 3:          01:03:13       when I was getting really hammered, I want it. I was the best idea was my friend talking me out of it. This is like 91 height of my drink and I need to, I'm going to learn how to try to get, I'm going to get a helicopter in my face like, yeah, not a good idea. Oh Man. We can go up to lake arrowhead. Big Bear. Yeah, like 10 minutes man. Fuck traffic it probably not a good idea. What was your drink of choice? You've got like 18 guns. You think the mailman is gonna you know, probably not a good idea. Yeah. I was paranoid and like what was your drink of choice? Oh, I had everything up. Why do you got my drink of choice was just straight vodka.

Speaker 2:          01:03:54       They fuck up. I was, I quit drinking last November. I still have some bottles of booze here, Bruce, cause they're high end shit and I'm not throwing them out. And I'm also not giving them away. I just keep them with special friends come by or whatever. I haven't, but I, I uh, I'm more of a, I was a whiskey bourbon guy and yeah. And I, and I started buying the high end stuff. So then you don't think you're, you're kind of a drunk. You just think I'm a connoisseur. Right. But I'm more of a, I'm just a binge drinker because I went to a couple of AA meetings and like this fucking stories there. I was just like, my jaw was on the ground and they like, build, do you want to share? I was like, I can't fucking follow this. You're thinking of it as a bit like, dude, I don't have any.

Speaker 2:          01:04:38       Like, I mean, I come home, my wife yells at me, come to bed and I fall. I fall asleep and wake up in sports center's on. I mean that's about as bad as the gut. Um, I was just doing it too much. Uh, I just, I kind of learned, like I keep saying this on my podcast because I hope, you know, cause some people, I think a like me and you can kind of, I kind of like if, if a doctor saw how much I was drinking would say you are an alcoholic and it's Kinda like a lot of people don't realize that just 30 pounds overweight can see, you know, your height is in there too. But like if you're about my size, five, nine, five, 10, if you're 30 pounds overweight, you're obese. People think obese is like, you know, you fucking thighs are rubbing together and you're wearing ray on slacks and nobody wants to bang you, right?

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       It's just like, no, it's just, it's just 30 pounds. And I learned that from my buddy who was about my size and he went up to a buck 95 and he went in for a physical and the guy was like, look, I'm not going to write you up but just to let you know you're five pounds over. And he was just like, write me up for what? And he was like being obese. And like it blew his mind who my mind too, but not as much as him cause he was actually being called obese. But um,

Speaker 3:          01:05:45       I just saw a thing on. So I do watch this. I watch local morning news in Seattle. Right. And here in La there was access. So it's just like local stuff. Right, right. You don't get the, and I pick what news station I watched it just as local stuff. I want the weather, you know, like maybe a little story about something.

Speaker 2:          01:06:07       Yeah, some old lady who jars around on jam in the end makes you feel good. You know, rescued a dog.

Speaker 3:          01:06:12       I bet there was a story on the news this morning talking about obesity and uh, one of the rear admiral somebody came out today and said, uh, uh, majority of American kids wouldn't qualify it for the military today cause of obesity and mental issue. I was like, whoa. I rewound the story. I just hear that. Right. Anyone who said they wouldn't, wouldn't be able to do like regular just jobs or our college. It was a, it just reminded me the thing you said about obesity obstacle, look into that more.

Speaker 2:          01:06:50       I thought you was. Yeah he was also talking like physical, I saw a thing about like some school between here and San Diego like way back in the day, I can't remember if they came up with the president's physical fitness thing that did as a kid. Yeah as a kid. Like they probably don't do this now because it makes kids feel bad about themselves. But they used to be this thing called the the the president's physical fitness test and you had to be able to do a certain amount of pushups in a minute sit ups. And the one that blew my mind was a pull up cause I had never done a pull up. And if you've never done a pull up you can barely do one because you'd never use those muscles. Like for some reason a chin up I guess cause you're picking stuff up and you're using your bicep.

Speaker 3:          01:07:27       It did not pass one of them. And still be okay. Right. So it was Paula was your weakness or push up? I think you could not pass one. Yeah. I remember doing that every year as a kid. 30 30 sit ups in that in a minute.

Speaker 2:          01:07:41       I've been doing pull ups ever since, since I have you til I fucked up my shoulder and I, I've been the last two years I have, I had a bet with my buddy 200 bucks that when I'm 70, I'll be able to do 10 of them. And right after I made the bet I don't, my wife showed me some, one of her crossfit fucking exercises and I was trying to do it and I just felt this pinch and I had this rotator cuff fish. Oh No, I know. So now I don't know. I don't know what I gotta do here. So I'm taking a few months off.

Speaker 3:          01:08:06       Yes. Those little, uh, so those little stabbing, just a little pinch. Like now I'm 55. I'll get a little pinch where when I was 30 something. Just be a little page. Yep. Shut off that little pinch. I think I just bulged my disc in my l four l five.

Speaker 2:          01:08:22       You Ready? Sure. You gotta get like a Jedi misuse. That's what I ended up finding somebody to hook me up with somebody I, a nerve issue and she, I remember I was in my left leg that was fucked up and she just sat there listening to me for like a half hour asking me questions and I was going like, the fuck are we doing here? So he goes, all right, let's go. And then she took me in back in was my left leg when I was feeling pain. She started with my right shoulder and I was thinking, all right, either she doesn't know what she's doing or she's at some jet eye level. And it turned out, fortunately it was the jet eye level. And uh, I just, through all the years of playing sports, it was fucked because the, when the, the pain takes you back to when like you ever say, hey guys, I'm pasty as health sis, I'll get like bruises on me.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       My wife would be like, what happened? And I'll be, I dunno. And what I do is I push on it and are Oh yeah, yeah, I was walking through, I banged into the door, it's fucking weird. So she was doing that with my leg and it was like the history of my life. Like all my brother used to give me charley horses. Oh, I used to play pick up hockey and not wear any gear. I fell on my fucking leg and she went all the way. Like it took like three months too. I was like, come on, ray lived your life in that, the painful moments. Yeah. That's great. No, no, no. This was three months, three months of slowly. She was like, there's three levels of your muscle were on the surface. And then I was psyched that we got to the moon, but every time she would start a new layer, like, dude, I'm telling you, I was like coming up off the table. And she was like, give me numbers, give me numbers. And I was like, I'd be like, all right. I was like six six. And she goes, well, you're Irish. So that's probably an eight guys. Can't fucking, you know, communicate like pain or shit like that. So, um, do, we've talked for almost second hour and when, I haven't even talked about like the over an hour. Jesus Christ, the how great the album, what's the name of the APP was a tenderness, it's called tenderness, tenderness.

Speaker 3:          01:10:07       So I wrote the song, we did begin with this, I wrote these songs on, on the road, uh, during this tour. I'll make observations, we're going down again. I was at, at, uh, at peace with like, uh, my old bandmates and, and proud there's really, and um, I was able to observe and I, and I got them to thank for it, for that being in, being in that place and, and my wife of course, and my, my kids growing up into like the strong young women, I wasn't worrying so much about, ah, your kid at school and this and that. And I was just really observing and living in life, being adults that you saw us. I was traveling just like my wife would come with me. Like, we're tough and we're not worrying about the kids at Humbard. Like got this next level and um, kids are on their own, they're cool. Uh, we're going to go out and together and see stuff and, and have some fun. And, and I was able to go and talk to just a ton of people. Not only, so

Speaker 2:          01:11:10       how did you, how did you put together? Who's who singer? Who on this?

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       I did. That's your voice? Yeah. What? Yeah, so I had, I, I'm saying for a long time, this is the first time I was saying it like in a lower register. Um, but so I wrote the songs. Um, Gotcha.

Speaker 2:          01:11:30       La showed, I got to see the, I know I'm going to be, I'm, I got an acting Gig in New York

Speaker 3:          01:11:34       this summer. I heard, are you going to revive? Told me because my wife had instructed me to set up something with you guys. And then the first thing your wife said, are you guys coming in New York at all this summer? When do you leave? Can you say that on there? No, cause there's too many Weirdos. Yeah. Uh, we'll talk about later. As soon as I said that, I already said I probably shouldn't have said that I'm going to be in New York, but it's a, it's a big enough place. New York state. Uh, yes. Albany. Yeah. I'll, I'm going to be in a little couple of John's town of Poughkeepsie. Uh, Lake Ontario. I'll be up there. Yeah. At the play her lakes. Beautiful up there by the way. Um, have you ever looked at a map and just started like,

Speaker 2:          01:12:15       I, I wish I did that from the beginning of my career, all the little towns and, and, and colored in all the roads that I've been on. A, I wish I would've done that because I would think like as much the way musicians travel and certainly, uh, I mean, I think that's how I got the sciatic nerve thing. I think it was all those years of sitting in a fucking car and this leg not moving and my knee got fucked up. Just being in this stationary position. Yeah. Will, will screw you up. Yeah. Not, not a stretch or anything like that, but I always wished, you know, it was a big thing for me. When I finally did, I got all 50 states. Wyoming was the last one and I didn't have a good show. Oh Wow. I think I weirded him out. I came out, I was excited to be there and they would just, you know, like the vibe of your, this album that you have that's sorta like, you know, uh, that was their vibe.

Speaker 2:          01:13:06       And I came out more like whatever you guys close with, with goods at Paradise City. I came out on, I came out with that and they were like, the fucks with this guy. And then I was thinking like, what are these? Just a bunch of country hillbillies or whatever. And then I went to their local club, the dance club or whatever and slash watering holes, like all in one area. And I went there and there was like troops there. They were gays couples there. And it was just, yeah, it was like all total mixed up. And I was just like, that was that moment. Like, oh, I was the asshole. I was the, I was thinking like, what'd you call? Just get off your fucking ranch. And it's just like, no man, we came out here to laugh and you fucking came out with like steam coming out of your ears. It wasn't a really bad show, but it was, uh, I, I, I never stopped in addressed. It was all I needed to say, like, wait, can you guys out? You know, I never did that.

Speaker 3:          01:14:00       We all prejudged alright. Don't feel bad about it. All right. Uh, the, the map, we were talking, oh, so shooter, um, I wrote these songs. I, I put them on, all my crappy demos are on garage band, on my Mac. Right. Uh Huh. And I back him up by sending them a copy to my manager. So that's my backup hard drive. Right. So I have like, and I might send it to my wife, so I have like two backup hard drives of my crappy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:14:27       Demos. How was she as far as like when you, cause I bounce jokes off of Nia and she's Kinda like, she's so honest that like I, I kinda use the risk like, all right, if I, if I can make her laugh. Cause she, her dad managed Comedians, so she grew up around comics. Is Does your wife like that with music where she's from

Speaker 3:          01:14:44       Ohio. So she, she has this very like, you know, if she's like, I like that, you know, that it's like, okay, that kind of covers like a pretty big area. She'll be, if she doesn't like, like my band loaded superhard my adult poke rock band. Right. So you'd be like, Whoa, she wouldn't say super aggressive. Ah, ah, there's so much in that. Whoa. Yeah. Hey, I like this next to that guy. He's a pill to like just a very small group. I'm pretty sure just by my wife's reaction, um, this, this record, however, like she, her, her reaction to these songs and she knew she was with me experiencing all this stuff so she knew where the words are coming from. She was just finishing her novel at the time when we were traveling. So she was writing a lot and, and um, my manager when I sit, I don't think I just want to make that, that austere record now. And he said, I think, uh, I'm going to look for somebody to uh, to work with. And he said he goes, what about shooter and shooter? Jennings is a guy I've known since he moved here in 2001 he was in a, he was 21 he was in a band that opened for my van loaded. Right. They were called star gun and there, you know, like I think you could still to this deck and it says 10 young musicians. I can pick out that one that's going to be a lifer

Speaker 2:          01:16:14       nine or just kind of like that back. Let's plan to do that with Comedians, right? The comic and an open mic can be like, all right that person I get more be like as far as potential like I can see like the, if that person, it's just something about they have that five and I'll meet people after shows and they won't say I'm a comedian, they'll just have this five. I'd be like, are you a comic? It'd be like, yeah. That's like, yeah, you seem like you seem like one. It always makes them stand up a little bit cause I can see that awkwardness sorta like looking down kind of that can't even describe the community young, the young comedian vibe though. Dude, I'm a shit and Dick joke jackass, but they, they, they, there's, there's a social awkwardness, a unique social awkwardness that a comedian has gone back to that back bar at the, at the comedy store that's just for the or whatever. Yeah. That's a weird room. Sometimes that's a, it's a cause. It's a very, the comedy store has always been a very transient place where if you, it was one of those places I shouldn't, I, I'm not going to say it. I'll say it because it's just one of those people pass through.

Speaker 3:          01:17:22       Sometimes the sinks in your head built, don't have to come out your mouth. I know. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:17:26       I know you're right. But I usually only do like an hour, an hour and 15 and I just want to make sure that we say all the stuff, where can we, where can we get the album and all that. We haven't even said that yet. Oh, I'm just hearing your manager. Taryn is fucking hair out. Yeah. Work. Where can they, they can download this.

Speaker 3:          01:17:46       Uh, yeah. I mean there's vinyl records come in. Actual vinyl records. I've got a stereo right over, there you go. Uh, it comes up May 31st, it's called tenderness. It's on universal music. Uh, they'd been wonderful about my social action with this thing. And um, yeah, we start touring in Philly and on May 30th, they, before the record comes out. So hopefully like in two days after they fill, it would be like three people. Like, yeah, what are you doing? And then the next day. So hopefully by the time we get to New York, June 3rd and we're playing at Irving Plaza there, some people know the song, Oh, I get it. Um, Chicago, Nashville, Austin, up up the west coast. And then, uh, guns is doing some stuff. That's my main priority. And this is, this is, this is not an ego project. This is not anything close to it. It's

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       something like this is a legit album. I love it.

Speaker 3:          01:18:40       It's the top topics are important. What my daughters to know, like, what did you do when, you know, and this is my little piece of what I did when and that's getting active and talking about stuff openly and, and kind of like assuring people I beat, you know, these things you might be worried about, they're going to pass, but we gotta be in this together just like after nine 11, you know, and just like when America's been great, you know, the hurricane two years ago in Houston, the fires in California, but come together, we don't ask who the fuck you vote for and come together and we help. You know, and that's the America I choose to see. And the,

Speaker 2:          01:19:20       they been acknowledged as opposed to the crazy shit on t puck that turn it off. Yes man. Yes. Thought I did and I don't even know. It's kind of fun walking around. It's like a crazy old person. But um, anyways, I absolutely love the album. It's called tenderness. It's on iTunes for a youngsters. All of those areas where you can get it, please pay for the album. And if you don't, cause I was joking with duff earlier, I hate when people like they send you the fucking emails being like, I downloaded it illegally. Hahaha. But just want to let you know I enjoyed it. And it's just like, man, it doesn't matter what standup up specials anymore. It gets at this part because I'm not selling my fucking DVDs. But anyways, the great duff mckagan has got a new album out called tenderness, comes out May 31st he'll be on a Philly,

Speaker 3:          01:20:05       Philly, DC, Boston, New York,

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       Chicago, Nashville, Austin, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle. Then you go check them out on the road and check out his new album.

Speaker 7:          01:20:20       It's better day. Leave it all behind you. Nothing left to say. It's all been shot through living other fool. Look up Scott's blue. Never [inaudible] the truth. [inaudible] scanning. Tell soon the Nadis come through. Never know. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:21:39       Hey, what's going on? It's built burn. It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 16th, 2011. Another beautiful week in the month of May. Has the nice weather hit you yet? Go outside Cheryl. It's so fucking nice out. Oh my God. I was out there and my fucking flip flops I had on a wife beater. My fucking left titty was hanging out right. And I went down, I went down to the fucking post office. I saw Kevin, I saw mark. Um, I am beyond punchdrunk. I uh, I'm in the midst of a two week absolute fucking terror of a travel schedule. Um, basically in 15 days I have six flights. All right. I just pause there. So all my travelers out there could, could just go la dude, what the fuck? Yes. Six flights, six flights. It was seven, but then something worked out, worked out where I uh, stayed an extra day when I was shooting an episode of Glee.

Speaker 8:          01:22:47       I really hope you guys like my episodes ugly glee because a, I was getting a little self conscious with some of the shit that they were sending, making me wear, by the way. And this is just an acting gig. This has nothing to do with me as a comedian. All right, so I don't want to hear, dude, you're fucking sold out. Has nothing to do with my acting. I mean Mike, my like stand up comedy that I'm on that show. All I can say is I'm glad that I stopped boozing because a, I'm not going to say I was wearing a half shirt, but let's just say my shirt didn't quite reach my genes. You know, the, the sizes run a little bit small over there. But anyways, anyways, yeah, we were shooting out in fucking New Mexico for this peewee Herman thing that we were doing, the Mexican hat dance, little little number there.

Speaker 8:          01:23:32       Suppose this so fucked right. So I basically, last week I went la to New Mexico, New Mexico to a fucking Washington DC and then back to lax and like an asshole. Here's a little travel tip for all you peoples out there. For those of you who don't follow me on Twitter, um, when you fly into DC, do yourself a favor. Fly into Ronald Reagan airport. Reagan, that's the one you want to fly into. Don't fly in to Washington Dulles. Do not repeat. Do not fly into Washington Dulles. I don't give a fuck how much you save. All right? It's a fucking $60 cab ride. It's like, it's, I don't know what to say. It'd be like if you flying to New York City and you flew into his slip instead at five o'clock and hit fucking rush hour, I forget it every goddamn time I go to DC every fucking time.

Speaker 8:          01:24:33       And even as I'm landing, I'm going. Yeah, it's kind of like a house isn't only a half hour cab ride. No, it's like a fucking 50 minute cab ride and that's with no traffic whatsoever. So do yourself a favor. Do that. Fly into Reagan. You come right in, goddamn buzzed. The fucking White House, you know, federal reserves right down the street and a you land. You're right fucking there and everything is all good. But for the love of God, do not. I repeat, do not go to Washington, Dallas. It is a motherfucker. All right. Flying to Washington Dulles. If you actually want to go to Philadelphia, that, that would be my suggestion. But other than that, it was, it's a nightmare. So this week I got the second half of that episode. So this week I fly La to Mexico, help Albuquerque, New Mexico. And then I fly to Albuquerque, New Mexico to New York City.

Speaker 8:          01:25:29       I do four days of Caroline's comedy club, and then I fly all the way back across the country on Monday. All right. And then guess what? I'm fucking out in La for a week and then I'm on vacation vacation. Just like Axl fucking Foley vacation. I am on vacation. I'm getting my fucking Mumford fucking sweatshirt out and fuck everybody. I've gone on vacation. All right. I'm going up to a Goddamn Lake. Uh, put my little touch, sees in the fucking water, hang in there with Nino and my fucking dog and I'm not doing shit. I'm going to go on youtube, learn how to fish cause I grew up in the goddamn suburbs and even know how to do that. So feel free to send me some emails, Dude. Oh my God. You know the fish. No, I doubt I don't. That's like me saying to you will you didn't know who was an express train. You fucking moron.

Speaker 8:          01:26:26       Stay up the middle platform. Your idiot. It's fucking easy. Right? Is that a way to teach them my peaking on my levels here? God dammit. I swear to God. In this upcoming year, I am going to get somebody to help me with my mixer. Um, by the way, speaking of which, um, if you want to send me any emails, all right? You want some advice for me? I don't know why you would, I know why you would because you're not going to take it, but you like the way I, I give out advice. You're like, wow, at least I'm not as dumb as him and my own fucked up way. I make you feel better about yourself. Right? If you want to send me a list of underrated, overrated and uh, Yada, Yada, Yada, all that bullshit, you go to the men podcast.com and send all the emails to that fucking thing. Is that what it is?

Is, is this, is this the fucking entertaining part where bill makes you feel smarter? Huh? That go fuck yourself. Whatever. Go to the Amen podcast.com I'm show they have the link there. See, and I wonder, I have the balls to wonder. I have the balls to sit there and watch TV and be like, why aren't, why aren't, why aren't I where that guy is? You know, because you're disorganized, Bill and you stutter. Other than that, you should be taking this business by fucking storm. Um, all right, so what are we going to talk about this week? Let's talk about my fucking unbelievable weekend. I, um, I got to work with Jim Norton Breuer and Dave Attell at constitution hall. I told you guys that Eddie Murphy, speaking of Axel Foley and Mumford sweatshirts a, he did delirious there. Chris rock did bring the pain, only two of the greatest specials of all fucking time. Um,

Speaker 8:          01:29:18       I got to perform on that stage, man. And I, I can't even tell you, I can't even explain it. It'd be like, you guys, do you ever do that shit? You ever get to take a tour of like a baseball stadium and they let you down on the field for half a second. You can't fucking believe you down there. It was the same thing. It was just stand up version of that. As I was doing my set was kind of looking around the stage and I'm like, you know, oh right there. That's where he dropped the microphone when he said, it's hot up here. And so he said, take your clothes off. And he dropped the mic and laughed. I remember that walking away, I could barely concentrate on my act. I had all I could do to not say goonie Google. Huh? Gus, your wife is a fucking big foot. Gus. What a fucked. And I think to say that just out of nowhere, just to see if anybody would've got it. Um, but anyways, I had a great time out there in DC. As always popped into the Improv. I did a quick little guest spot. I saw my good friend from back in the day. Bob fucking Molly.

Speaker 5:          01:30:16       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:30:17       Beast of a comic that I started out with. And uh, I had a great, I had just had a great time out there. Everybody crushed as always. And a, we actually went over to the Pentagon, all four of us. And we, uh, went in there, we met a wound, the wounded warriors sick. The men and women over went over to Iraq and Afghanistan and got hurt. We got to talk to them. We gave him some tickets to come out to the show and I got to tell you stuff to meeting those soldiers. You know, everybody over there, just the way they look. You in the eye. Yes sir. No Sir. All though I don't think I've ever felt like such a piece of shit as a human being in my life. I was just like, I have no discipline. I just, you know, I don't sit up straight. These guys just, they would just kick in my ass straight across the fucking board. And um, I really realized what a, a pathetically insignificant life. I'm leading.

Speaker 8:          01:31:17       These people are down there, change in the goddamn world. All right. Live in by like codes of honor. I don't have a code of honor. You know what's my big thing? Ah, don't fly in Reagan. Don't fly in the Dulles Salute to you America. You know what a fucking button. That's what I felt like a fucking bomb. And I can't even explain those guys. They all, all those, all those soldiers, they all got that look in their eye. You know, it's, it's, I can't, I can't fucking explain it. They look at me. They could see it. Like this guy's soft looking at price sleeps till 10 in the fucking morning. Rolling around his bed, bitching, oh, I go to a podcast. I honestly, I never felt so fucking pathetic in my life. I remember reading rd Lang's book too fat to fish and he had a caption underneath when he was on a plane with a bunch of soldiers. He said, here's a picture of a bunch of guys who are better than me. And I was like, oh Jesus Christ already the fuck. Now I know what he was talking about.

Speaker 8:          01:32:21       I'm a fucking loser. Everybody. So feel better about yourself this week. Everybody, um, I guess compared to me. So anyways, yeah, it was great. Yeah, we went there, we had a great show and I want to thank everybody for coming out. And uh, once again, I went on the road, every one and I, and I, and I'm, um, I'm fighting the battle against you, the bulge. And I'm not talking about my stomach. I'm talking about my fucking squash. All right? That, that's the big goddamn thing is a guy. If you want to age gracefully. All right, you got to make sure the poundage of your head, you got to keep it level member last week and I was telling you about Ebay Malmsteen how big his fucking head is now and he's still trying to get away with wearing those leather goddamn pants and his booties. He looks ridiculous or he looks like, oh he looks like a hoard up.

Speaker 8:          01:33:16       Ah, ah. What the fuck is her name? That chick big head from that Shell fish way back in the day. Um, best podcast sucks. You know what? Normally I'd abandon it, but I don't have the fucking time cause I have to catch 19 flights this week. So you know what? We're going to plow through it. I'm going to see it through like a fucking soldier going to soldier my way through this one. Another rock star. I'm just going to pick on rockstars and next week I'll pick on it. You guys can give me some, give me some actors that you've seen over the years. Male actors whose heads just got fucking gigantic val Kilmer. Val Kilmer didn't do shit. He just fucking eat. You know was the last time he had a salad. You seen that hunk of fucking roast beef sitting on top of his goddamn head. It's unbelievable.

Speaker 8:          01:34:02       Here's one for you, Brian Setzer. Sally saves. Damn the guy from the stray cats. I don't know what the fuck happened to his head and I'll tell you who's halfway there. Is that Billie Joe Guy from the fucking green day? You know, she's got the exact same build. Is that dude? It's the fuck. It's the worst. Both of them full heads of hair. I'm jealous, but none of them. They're not. They're not having salads. They're out there on the road day. They're eating the fucking, they're eating the potato skins that had just keeps getting bigger and bigger. That's why they switch every once they switched from playing like an SG or a Les Paul, they go to that big, what the the s three 30 you know, I like the sound of the old Chuck Berry Song. No yet don't. You got a giant fucking head and now it looks like you're playing a Ukulele, so you got to go to a bigger guitar. I see what you're doing, Vince Neil, there's another guy, I saw them when they went out and they opened for Aerosmith like five years ago. I was just sitting there going, when did his heads get as big as fucking Nikki Sixx? Nikki Sixx can have a big head that guys like fucking six foot four. You know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:35:07       The fuck am I talking about? I'm talking about old people with big heads people. That's what I'm talking about and I'm talking about how at some point you gotta be man enough to eat a fucking salad every once in awhile. That's the key. Just once a day, just go out. Just get a fucking chef salad. If you've got to throw some Balsamic vinegarette on it and for Christ's sake, eat a goddamn salad before you walking down the street scare and children with that Goddamn Jacqueline and sitting on your fucking head. You know you want to win at paint ball. You want to stop getting knocked out early in the game? You eat a fucking salad, private

Speaker 1:          01:35:45       Jay Joe's age. Christ. What the fuck is that on top of your head? Oh Shit. All right, Gina. Head that fucking bitch.

Speaker 8:          01:35:53       That right there is why I never joined the military. There's no fuck away. I could stand there and get screamed at like that, you know? Then they'd slap the shit out of me. Then I get a concussion. Right. And I'd be like one of the, and then of course, you know they make you come back too soon in the military. Forget about and fucking NFL football over the years you've got to come right back. Put that Goddamn baret on [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:36:15       Geez a, where did they find a fucking Marae for that fucking squash?

Speaker 5:          01:36:21       Pick it up.

Speaker 1:          01:36:24       Well, it's at a toilet seat cover. You think it's funny? You think it's fun and boy slap me in the fucking head again backing up.

Speaker 5:          01:36:34       Okay,

Speaker 8:          01:36:35       dude, why do you keep knocking it off my fucking head? If you want me to put, there's no fucking way. There's no way. You know, my ego would tell me, look at this old motherfucker, you know, skinny little guy with his fucking bird chest.

Speaker 1:          01:36:48       Huh? You're white chest area. Do you think you're gonna yell at me and knocked my little hat off front of all these fucking people that had just met. Sorry. Um, anyways, is

Speaker 8:          01:37:01       podcast for this week and uh, you know, it's, you know what's funny about having all the fucking free time I do. I have all these, I only, I work every other week. People, I'm one of the laziest mother fuckers you ever gonna meet in your life? Okay. I'm sitting here right now. I'm doing this podcast at four 37 La time in the afternoon and I'm still in my pajamas and wearing pajama bottoms. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:37:23       All right. For people like me to paint a picture. And I got my little Tribeca film festival tee shirt on. That's what I'm doing. Drinking a little coconut water, which one of my listeners said that he actually went out and listened to and uh, he fell, I forget how he put it. Something about, he felt like he was drinking out of Momar Qaddafi's ass, I believe. Is that how he, that's how he described pure coconut water. I think it tastes delicious. Hang on a second.

Speaker 8:          01:37:47       Ah, oh, that's good stuff. Oh, that's good stuff. Um, anyways, so despite the fact that I only work every other goddamn week, I swear to God, anytime anything cool is happening in La and in La, in La. And I'm like, I'm going to go to that shit. I'm going to take a night off from this fucking business and I'm going to go to that shit every time. It's always when I'm out of town and this week is no different. All right. Listen to this shit. I'm down the club the other night, minding my own fucking business. I want to go down there, right? I want to go down, I want to tell some jokes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And somebody comes up to me and he goes, dude, you're not going to believe what they have at the fucking La sports arena. I'm Mike. I'm like, what? What's, what's coming up.

Speaker 8:          01:38:38       La Sports and me with a fucking clippers used to play as like, yeah, evidently they're doing some UFC fight. I swear to God this isn't a movie. All right, this is actually real. You guys into MMA, you under that type of shit course. You are right. Who is it? Who doesn't like to watch two guys with shaved heads? Just beat the living shit out of each other. Um, don't want, I set one time when I was talking about that, like the UFC style of fighting. What I love about it is a, I think I might've said this on the podcast, I can't remember. I'm going to blame it on all the altitude. My dried out skin from the fucking pressurized air. But uh, when I watched those UFC fights and you see somebody, you see those guys where they got the cardio there in ridiculous fucking shape, they can strike, they can take it down to the ground, they can submit you, they can knock you the fuck out. And that's what I was, you know, I always look at that shit and just be like, that dude right there on fucking rape bubble, right? Who's kitten heel that, that's the big thing. That's why you, you keep going in martial arts as a man. Do you want to be on fucking rape bubble?

Speaker 4:          01:39:47       You know?

Speaker 8:          01:39:48       And why is that? Because my generation, when we first got cable, every other movie that was on cable, especially Cinemax, always involved some fucking regular dude go into prison for a crime he didn't commit. And then let people try to fucking, they strive to try to stick that Dixon is ash, you know, then he's got to fight back and blah, blah blah. And of course he always fucking wins except Shawshank redemption, which is why that was such a great movie,

Speaker 4:          01:40:22       you know,

Speaker 8:          01:40:24       is Tim Robbins. You know, sometimes he won, sometimes he didn't. You know, Jesus Christ, think about that. You know the expression, hey, you win some, you lose some. Now we're going onto faded. But uh, yeah, the, all those fucking movies, you know, always are about that. So I said that, I said that to somebody one time a guy yells, fucking guys, you know what? Those guys out of their fucking on rape of will they go to prison? I don't give a shit what you do. You come out and stand it up. You come at him, fuck. He try to shoot their legs, they'll fuck that choke you out.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       You'll end up getting raped. You know, it's like when the lions go after one of those fucking one of those buffalo and they're pouting on and all of a sudden that thing just whips around and the th the Goddamn Tiger takes a horn to his side or the lion does and then the lion dies and he's like, wait a minute, I thought I was killing you and then you fucking shank me. We got it, Bill. Fuck, we got to get on with it. So someone told me the other day, I was saying, those fucking guys unbreakable and this dude was like, Nah man. I like, what do you mean? No? How the fuck are you going to take that guy out? And he said, listen. And he goes inside. If they want to get you, they're going to get you that Mike. Like what? Why the fuck you going to get that guy?

Speaker 1:          01:41:37       I didn't give a shit. If you've got three guys, Adam, he's still, he's gonna fucking knock them out. Superman punch a fucking knee to the head, rear naked choke and it's over and the guy goes, Nah. You know they, they're, they put stuff in your food. They drug you that I, I can't even say it. Just like, uh, it just, it killed me when somebody said that they, they put drugs in your food. It just didn't even seem fates. I can't even explain it.

The shit that I advertise, I'm going to tell fucking stories, make you laugh, slide in the fucking promo and it's just going to be shit that I believe in. I believe in cops fighting cards in the, the uh, the octagon. I think that that's how they should settle it. You know, on the side of the road when they do that shit where they, you know, they show the video from the state troopers thing, you know, the state trooper's car and all of a sudden the, the, the regular traffic stop turns into a fucking eight year sentence for assaulting a police officer there. There ought to be like some sort of signal that means not only do I disagree with you pulling me over, um, I, I want to fight you in an octagon.

Speaker 8:          01:48:16       You know, you make some sort of gesture and then he gives you a police escort. You follow them right over there and then you guys go at it, you fight in the octagon and if you win, you get no ticket. You get no ticket. Hey look who just came walking in. If it isn't my lovely girlfriend, how the fuck are you? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? I'm talking about that, that, that MMA match that I'm going to miss. Which one?

I can't fucking believe I'm not going to be in here for this, but, uh, but anyways, um, Nia, you've stopped by here and we're, we're gonna, we're gonna, you're gonna do a little passing promo here.

Speaker 1:          01:51:42       What are we going to be doing tonight? Okay. What am I going to go see with you? Cause I hadn't been in town for the last couple of days. So you guys are probably wondering how do you keep it going? How do you, how do you keep them magical, you know, you know you had to keep the spark. You fucking annoyed the shit out of me today. What do you mean? You know what I mean? I was talking about earlier when you, you kept putting off that vibe that you would, you were annoyed by my general. I was not present. Yeah you were. I was just busy, you know, I want to say I wanted to get up and do it on the road for like five, six days and I'm thinking, oh she's gonna. I thought you want to, you want to kiss me? Like that chick who kissed that dude and Times Square when the war ended, that's what I thought was going to happen.

Speaker 1:          01:52:24       You haven't been gone that long though. Oh Jesus. It's over. It's over. No, I just, I wanted to get up and go to the farmer's market and I had to wash my hair. I had a whole thing. The only time that you should have been mad at me, it was the was after I'd already annoyed you'd like five times and at one point you were in the shower. Did you say annoyed me? How many times? Like five. Okay. I just want the record to show that you, that you annoyed. Yeah. Five times its full course of mourning that you're supposedly fucking annoying. I didn't think of this was about me. I thought it was about, you know, it's about you being being a jerk this morning. This is the only thing I will admit that was wrong was when you were in the middle of showering and I came walking in with the cold cuts and I said, hey smell this chicken.

Speaker 1:          01:53:04       Does this smell like it went back in the shower. I love taking like baths and showers. It's like my whole relaxation, like being cleaned, get to the fucking fancy soaps and I'm in there and you know, enjoying myself and who fucking barges in the bathroom opens up the shower, stall, shower, stall, door thrust, a package of old ass lunch meat in my face practically is like, does this smooth 40, taking a shower. Okay. What are you doing? I'm trying to shower. I have a bad sense of smell. I know, but you kind of have a really bad sense of smell. Well, I'm doing my episode of Glee in a couple days and I don't want to get uh, some Nella. I don't want to get fucking a, yeah, well if you see right here so he could really tie, came out of the shower, whatever. We're going to see bridesmaids tonight.

Speaker 1:          01:53:55       This is how, and Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, this is how long I've been out of town that I actually agreed. She goes, do you want to see bridesmaid tonight? Now of course my brain was like, no, it's produced by Judd Apatow. Okay. So nick is any of that. He's never in it. He's the director. All right. Well, he didn't direct the movie produced. All right, well, any of those other guys in it, I don't know. That's Rogan and fucking Paul Rudd and those guys. It's just going to be a bunch of broad, it's just like slap stick. My Big Fat Greek wedding. Is this what it's going to be? Put it like this Judd Apatow produced this movie. So whatever you think that it's going to be thinking about the fact that he produced it. I think the idea. All right. You take a sippy, a big, uh, a big mug full of wine too.

Speaker 1:          01:54:46       You got a big mug full of something. Have you had some questions from a no. You want, you want it? You want to, do you want to do what advice one? Yes, I do. Okay, we'll do it. Advice one and then, uh, then that'll be a, that'll be the little Nini segment here for the fucking week. Um, let me see if I got one that actually involves men and women, men and women. Like I'm not going to see enough fucking broad center and the goddamn movie. If there's, if there's one period joke, I'm walking out, I'm walking out, does this make me look fat? If somebody cries for no fucking reason and goes, oh my God, I love your guys, you know, that's happening in act three, I'm walking out, all right, I'm letting you know I'm getting up and I'm walking. I'm storming out and you won't even hear me drive away cause we have a hybrid of the Saturday night live people a hem. Him, I am supporting. You think they want to do that fucking movie? They need the money. Uh, I haven't seen it. So actually somebody told me it was fucking hilarious. All right, where am I hair? Uh, but, but papa, Papa. All right here. Go.

Speaker 8:          01:55:44       All right, Bill. One of my best friends has been going to church for years and previously it has never bothered me at all. Low Gg. Um, I grew up, I grew up Catholic and like so many Catholics I got raped. No kidding. I no longer, I no longer attend church, but it doesn't bother me in the least. If someone else wants to go, this guy is the exact mindset than I am except by make fun of people who go to church a little bit, a little bit. A few months ago, my friends started asking me if I would like to go to church with him gay. Uh, I plight. I politely declared that sets a gay thing to do and I don't mean, I don't mean the how is it gay to ask the want to go to church with you because you're both going to be wearing sweaters. You're going to be singing songs.

Speaker 11:         01:56:31       You are the [inaudible] au Lait Lou [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          01:56:41       You don't get to sit there and sing with you have your fucking friend wearing a sweater and then the priest up there, God knows what he did, is going to be like, hey, add a beard and some long, Aaron, he cured a leper. None of you guys can do that. So you better give us some money.

Speaker 11:         01:57:01       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:57:02       yeah, who are not making fun of mass right now. It's not great to you. It's nothing. Yes. Granted there are some things that I've seen. Like what? Not None of that horse shit, that overly Boob, ugly, ugly, ugly to him. Well, it's like a call and response. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what fucking sacred. Meaning the request of question. Now you're getting the answer today. I'll tell you what sacred. What's sacred is how you go out in the playoffs. The Celtics went out with heart. We still lost their fucking, we still got our ass. We still got our asses kicked. We still got our asses kicked. All right? But there was no quit in that team. All right? Okay. That's fucking sacred. What? Sac religious is what the fucking Lakers did. And I'm at disrespect in the franchise. I'm saying what? The couple of those?

Speaker 8:          01:57:46       And it wasn't all of them. What a, it was really what buying them did. I don't even think about autumn did was bad. All right? Can you just finish reading the question? Jesus Christ. Really, all of a sudden you're dictating it. You asked me why. So he wants to go to church with me. With him. I repeat gay. I politely decline. Dude, I'm not doing that shit. Um, so filling in the blanks with your own commentary or no, that's not a part of the letter because you're presenting and then a bias fashion. Just read it and then give your opinion. You see the shit that is a classic fucking broad. It's like I've been doing this shit for four years and you're telling me how to run it yet you have no idea how many more on guys are going to send him hate mail because of that, because not because you're a jerk.

Speaker 8:          01:58:27       Because some other, well, there are more options. So I don't give a chaise. This is fucking elitist attitude. Um, since then my friend has told me he feels it's his mission to spread the word of God. Saying it like that and continues to ask me to go. They got up, he drank the fucking Koolaid. Now he's a Zombie and as time passes, he's getting more aggressive with this sales pitch. That means he's probably reaching out and like touching his hand. Uh, what started off with him just slipping it into casual conversation as loud now led me to receiving text messages that say the following, this means more to you. This means more to me than you know, God has poured out love to me and he is reaching out to you also ignore a few months, but there is a lot at stake here. Wow. Yeah. No, he has a little one. Yeah. He's buying into that. Jesus is coming back and this time he's not fucking around.

Speaker 8:          01:59:36       It's personnel. Yeah, he, okay, so he's buying into the rapture that this hippie is going to come back on a stegosaurus and just start killing people, killing people. What they say, what they say is fucking wrong. He's going to come back RAF. One of the deadly sins, judge's judgment is mind set at the Lord. He's the son. He's the Donald Trump. He's got the fuck he's got to call them over at this point, coming out of heaven. He didn't make that money. He didn't make the fucking world. He's just allowed Jack ass a fucking fuck. You know, whatever. Cast me into the the fucking pits. I don't give a shit. You know, you think I want to hang out with you in heaven forever. Just go it. Isn't this awesome? Yeah, it is awesome. Can you please finish the letter? All right. What started off. Okay, so here we go.

Speaker 8:          02:00:27       Uh, to be to this. I replied, honestly, it's it, if it's my choice, I don't want to go, please stop asking me about it. I don't know how many more ways I can request that. There you go. Okay. He responded with, I'll hold off, but know this, God loves you and will not quit. If I do. Okay, well then there's no reason to hit me two times. Let's just let God do it. All right. Anyways, here comes my question. Bill, why does this fucking Piss me off so much? Why do these, why are these cults do? Uh, what do these cults do to these people? He's involved with the Church that people do joke around with and call a cult. What would you do if you were me at this point? I don't even want to talk to this guy cause he's conversations are infuriating me.

Speaker 8:          02:01:13       Um, yeah, I would, I would cut this guy out of your life. Yeah, it's annoying. This is what I feel that way. No, but this is his friend. This is his friend, his friend and he, and he won. He wants to get them out of the cult. So the thing is is if you go to him and you try to get them out of it, you just going to drive them further into it. So what you do is just say he just stopped being friends with them, you know, and hope that that'll help because they're not going to go out of that then he's not going to leave it if you ask them to leave it. Yeah. You never, you never know. But yeah, he needs to just kind of mouth cause yeah, there's no, you can't, unless he wants to spend the rest of his time with this guy debating Catholicism or whatever, which I'm sure he doesn't want to do.

Speaker 8:          02:01:55       And then yeah, he should just cut them off. Personally, I would still hang out with them. You would just so you could get into debates with him? No. And I would just do unbelievably Shay titanic and it can be a bit annoying shit. I've good idea. I would, I would, maybe you should do that. I would always have like shout at the devil playing, you know, or maybe just that beginning cheesy thing. She didn't invite you to call my women to a restaurant and it turns out to be like a strip club and see what he does. Yeah, but you're going to see the titties on the outside gentleman's club. That's true. No, I wouldn't do that shit. I would just, I would hang out with him and hang out with, I would keep saying I want to get involved in the church and I would keep going to events and I say we're going, you know, I just feel so filled up with God's love. I would then be a, you want to talk about filled up. I would fucking jerked off into this chick's mouth less. I'm telling you, William Burns, she had a big bass miles and I don't know, maybe it was a couple of days since the last time I fucking, you know, let them loose. But I right up to the brim. She was a champion. She swallow. I'm sorry, what were you saying?

Speaker 8:          02:03:00       This is why you're going now. Oh, why don't you pray for me? I will. These fucking people, these people. Yeah. All, all those, all those things are like, uh, they're just there. I don't know. It's, it's, it's a cult. It's a fucking cult. I mean, if it works for you, you know, I think they just like wearing those old clothes. You know? It must be nice to drive a bicycle. Talls banging against the fucking seat. When you were growing up, did you never, I was an altar boy. I was an altar girl. Yep. I was an altar boy. Yeah. That's the name of Mike. My mind, my new book. Second Schuster. I was an altar board. Yeah. And, uh, I remember I used to do, I'd sit there and I would ring the bells. Yup. You know, I have to do the incense where you have to take that ball that's on a string.

Speaker 8:          02:03:52       It looks like one of those medieval torture devices, you know? And it's so, yeah. I wish I, you know what it was I did that chick, I was so bored in mass, you know, I wanted to be involved. I wanted to get up on stage. I wanted to say something. That's engine. Hallway. Yeah. Potentially fucking an altar boy. Yeah. I have one priest. He used to do the fucking homily. Then he would ask, he would give us a lecture about some shit about the, the uh, uh, I used to craniums or whatever the Crista cranium, the woo do these, you know, these fucking people from a long time ago and he'd be giving you this speech and going out, God, he's going to ask me questions on this. And he would be like, he would just be doing the homily. Then we, he be doing the homily and he just be like, and ms to what is it blow you? Just start quizzing you on them. Fucking crowd would be laughing when I fucked up the jokes and I look, I'm not the jokes that the questions and I loved it.

Speaker 1:          02:04:43       Beat the shit out of sitting there, standing, kneeling, doing all that.

Speaker 8:          02:04:49       And, um, and I really bought into it when I was younger. I really bought into and I thought it was good at that it was the right fucking thing to do.

Speaker 1:          02:04:55       And uh, then I got older and I started reading and I traveled and I realized this is just a bunch of bullshit at a, I read into the history of the church and I was like, wow, these guys aren't exactly what they say that they are, you know, it's kind of like a lot like Taco bell who doesn't like Taco Bell. Then I do my little shoot out there in New Mexico and uh, there was some big strike they had out there because they're not paying any of those fucking workers that pick the goddamn tomatoes that go into it. Okay. Okay. Did you go to a Catholic school? When did this become inside bill studio? Did I go to Catholic Schools? Had this whole thing is inside bill studio. I didn't know you run a Yap for like 90 minutes. No, I just went off on like a monologue for five minutes.

Speaker 1:          02:05:41       You just go and go and go. Um, no, I was asking cause I went to Catholic school. So yeah, it's a whole thing. It's too complicated again too, but yeah. So what was that? That's it. That's it. That's why you stopped the whole point. You know, what is the, you just like talking into a microphone. That's what it is. Fun. Okay, well listen, I have to get on with the podcast here. Are you kicking me out? I'm not kicking you out. I'm asking you politely to leave so I can go back to running my yet finished dinner.

Speaker 8:          02:07:04       I don't know when it's gonna happen that when it does, when I was in the Pentagon, I was thinking about drinking because I went to the gift shop. Yeah, they do have a gift shop at the Pentagon. And you know what else was awesome? No one there seemed to know how many floors there were. They said there's rumored to be like another five below the ground, but nobody really knows. You know? I'm sure. I'm sure the, uh, one of the big generals were there. I'm sure he knows I, and what happens when you get all the way down to the bottom layer? Like who the fuck is down there? You know, but it's a bunch of bankers. I bet there's like an underground subway from the Fed reserve right over to that lower level of the Pentagon is a little office in there. And uh, that's where the people from the Federal Reserve Go, uh, when they want to yell at the president and the president comes over on his little private subway because it's also close together.

Speaker 8:          02:07:59       Right. He comes over and then he sits outside their office. I'll fucking nervous, like wringing his hands going, Oh God, did I, did I not say it right? Um, anyway, so let's plow ahead here. Bill, I want to comment on your drinking and if anyone could stick with any kind of schedule. Oh, when I asked if anyone could stick to any sort of schedule, because I've been thinking about going back to drinking and just like one day every month, just getting absolutely hammered. Having October fest every month is basically what I'm thinking about. Oh, I know. I actually, I forgot. So it was, I'm in the gift shop at the Pentagon and they had these, these drinking glasses and they had this giant one that had the marine corps, um, shield or insignia, family, crest, whatever the fuck you call it. And the second I saw it, I was like, I want to fill that up with some beer and have like nine of those.

Speaker 8:          02:08:47       Um, so anyways, uh, I asked if it was possible to do something like that. The Guy said, I just turned 25 and I've never had a sip of alcohol, smoke cigarettes or taking any kind of illegal drug, never, not even by accident. And it's been Ben by choice and nothing religion affiliated. My friends slash coworkers also poke fun of me for not, I'm often saying that they'd be able to get me to drink at least one. In general, everyone has the same reaction. Jesus Christ hardy, unwind, you must be boring, et cetera. Well, anyways, I guess that what I'm saying is it is possible to not drink with all the opportunities out there that are in the world and the stress of life in general. It can be possible to get it to get at least to at least get it down to drinking only one day a week.

Speaker 8:          02:09:36       Um, congrats on your streak and if not drinking and thanks for the last. Um, well that's different because you've never drank. I wanted to hear from a drinker. See, the thing about you is you've never opened Pandora's box. And I've said this before, but it's, it's, it's very easy for me, for me not to do heroin every day because I never did it. So I don't know what, I don't know what I'm missing. You know, I've never gone to Vegas and just actually called one of those whores and hadn't come to my room. So when I go out there, I never think to do it. And then I don't feel like I'm missing anything. But the thing is, is when you do shit like that, when you've done it, when you've lived that life, that's when it's fucking hard. The other night I was driving home from the fucking fuck was I coming from the comedy store and I was just sick of being sober. I was just driving going, I want to get fucked up. I just want to do it. This is, this is a, this is getting ridiculous. I'm s I'm actually sick of thinking clearly I can't explain it. It has to do with that shit though, because I know how fun it is to get drunk, you know? And I haven't had any embarrassing things happen in seven fucking months, so I forget how stupid it is, but, um, God dammit.

Speaker 5:          02:11:01       Okay.

Speaker 8:          02:11:02       The only reason why I'm not drinking is because if I don't drink, and then I try to beat this streak, I got to start all over again and go seven fucking months. Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck am I talking about? I don't even go. I don't even know. Um, let's move along. Let's, let's go with underrated overrated for this week. Everybody, uh, bill new fan of the podcast, I'm going to skip all the ass kicking ass, kissing a, I've noticed you do a lot of overrated, underrated. So here's mine. Overrated bars. Speak of the devil bars. They just turned 21 and I'm starting to check out the bar scene. What a fucking joke. A bunch of drunk tool bags and filthy Ho was as you would say, what happened to sit around drinking with your friends. I'd rather have a beer with some close friends and go out to a crowded bar filled with people.

Speaker 8:          02:11:45       I want nothing to do with spending all my money on watered down drinks. Anyways. Keep doing what you're doing. You're the man. Thank you. Um, all right. Did you go out to the bars? If you want to try to get laid, that's basically the only reason why to go out and do it. Other than that, you're absolutely right. If you're of legal drinking age, just buy some booze and go home. Go to a house party, watch a game with your friends, cook out, have a great fucking time. Uh, play the music at the level you want to play it at. But the reason you go out to the bars is because of the, who is this because of the lady? That's why you go out to them. Plus they have a larger selection of the booze. But a dude, you're only 21. I mean, I don't know, maybe a really mature, you'd be one of those people is like married by 23 and has a kid, you know, when a fucking wheel barrel.

Speaker 8:          02:12:33       Do you know I finally learned how to say that, that it was wheel barrel, like roll out the barrel. It's Barrow and I don't even know why, but that's what the fuck it is. Um, I'll give you an underrated for this week. I'm underrated. Would be, uh, the kinks. I just downloaded some of their music, their, their fucking ridiculously underrated. Um, I know that they get credit, they sort of get like half credit. They kind of get lost in the wash between the Beatles and led Zeppelin. And I don't know why. I don't know why. Because as far as I can tell, those guys can, right. Yeah. Any type of song you want, great lyrics. They can write about heavy shit. They can write about light shit that could fucking rock. They can actually do a ballad that is in fucking cheesy, actually downloaded, uh, give the people what they want.

Speaker 8:          02:13:23       I bought that on on vinyl when it first came out. And you know what, it still holds up still fucking holds up to me and with my guitar playing skills that can figure out some of the songs. Um, all right, we're getting to the end of the podcast here. Um, what was the last fucking thing I wanted to tell you guys? Oh, wait a minute. I've got two big topics to talk about. One, uh, Bruins verse Tampa Bay lately. Um, how the series went, the first game we lost three to fucking or whatever, wasn't three to one of those like emptying it bullshit at the end of the game. But like, that's exactly what I was afraid of. And I, you know, sometimes I'm so sick of these fucking non hockey towns having great hockey teams, you know, it's a fucking waste to get it off. It's a fucking wait.

Speaker 8:          02:14:13       It's like Kevin a boat and you live in the middle of Nebraska. There's no reason to have a fucking hockey team or then amazing hockey team. They're fucking great team in easily the best team we've played and come up against so far. They're just a great fucker team and I easily think that those guys could win the Stanley Cup. Our guys on the other hand, I don't know, I think we got a shot, but like Tampa Bay, I think Tampa, I, if I had to put my money on it, I picked her up a bay because Vancouver and San Jose, they're too fucking and consistent. They'll play like lights out fucking hockey, three games in a row and then just fucking, hey man, let's make it interesting and they'll lose like the next fucking two, three in a row. I don't believe in those, those teams, she can't fucking do that.

Speaker 8:          02:14:55       Eventually that kind of play in is going to bite in the ass and considering they're going to knock each other out. Um, everybody thinks the champions coming from the West. I got news for you. It's coming from the east and I swear to God, if Tampa Bay wins second fucking Stanley Cup during the time of this Bruins drought, that white trash piece of shit city that nobody goes to, you know, it's like one level above Jacksonville. More people go to Orlando, then go to Tampa, people go to Miami, they go to Fort Lauderdale, bunch of fucking rednecks go out today. Toner for the Daytona 500 we start with the fucking super bowl. Super Bowl, Nascar driving baby, right? Nobody goes to Tampa.

Speaker 12:         02:15:48       Mm.

Speaker 8:          02:15:49       I was, you know what I was doing yesterday? I was, I was tweeting twittering during the fucking game and all I was doing was just shitting on Tampa, just shitting on the city trying to annoy people and of course people are taking it seriously, which makes it fun. And I said Tampa, that's the type of city you go to when you like abandoned your family. You know, we just got divorced. Just the, there was, you know what? There was a life altering moment in your life where you just got kicked so hard in the balls. You've just decided to say fuck it. That's when you moved to a city like Tampa. If you've quit, that's what Tampa's for Tampa is for quitters and all you people down there with the a new lightning fucking jerseys or even worse, the free fucking tee shirt that you got from the local radio station. All right. No wonder you finally fill in the arena. You finally want to see what a winner looks like. Isn't that what it is? They're all those fucking years of losing.

Speaker 9:          02:16:47       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:16:49       The Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Bunch of fucking losers. The fucking devil rays.

Speaker 9:          02:17:00       Huh?

Speaker 8:          02:17:01       Devil rays just like your lives. Tampa, Tampa Bay. Odians just like your fucking lies. Oh I think it's going to add. No, it is it. Yeah. I had to put three balls through the hoop to when the teddy bear, you lose Virginia's for lovers. Tampa is for losers. There's no fucking way done. The hockey gods are going to allow this to happen even though you have way more firepower than us. You've got a great goaltender and you play in your one three one that you didn't even show us in the first fucking game. Go Fuck Yourself.

Speaker 8:          02:17:40       Do you know the Strip mall was invented in Tampa? It was, cause they were too fucking stupid to know how to enclose a mall. You know, they'd start to build an enclosed mall and then you know what they do, they fucking quit. Then they would just left with this weird looking structure. You know, like what kind of, well it's sort of a mall, what should we call it? Well, in tribute to all the whores that live here in Tampa, we'll call it a strip mall. You know, the, all these fucking cracked out whores walking around half of fake tits hanging out some fucking eight year old kid still breastfeeding on it. You know, I know you guys think I'm being harsh, but this is the shit you see down in Tampa. They don't deserve the lightning.

Speaker 8:          02:18:30       I think that's when, you know, your city sucks is when one of your teams is named after. Whether, you know, I really should say it because the thunder just fucking advanced to the western conference finals. Huh? Look who's watching Hoop Nika watch hoop because the Lakers are out of it. I love it. I fucking love it. Truly enjoy it. Truly fucking and enjoy that. So anyways, I flew virgin airlines in the way back from Washington, Dallas, everybody. And uh, like a smart son of a bitch. I got there like two hours early and I show up in computers are down and this is fucking gigantic fucking line and it was an absolute nightmare trying to check in for the flight. And it was so bad when I got to the gate, the captain was actually helping people get seating assignments and at one point, you know what he said? He goes, well, you know, he goes, this is how it was before computers and nobody blinked. And I, when he said that this is not the way it was before computers, this is how it is now because of computers. You fucking moron.

Speaker 8:          02:19:47       Jesus Christ. We used to go to the airport, he just walked up. You walked up to the stern line, but you fucking walked up and you just, you gave, you gave me information, he had your fucking ticket and you went through, didn't take two hours and then another hour at the gate to get your seating a salmon. You fucking idiot. I lost all confidence in that guide is ability to fly a fucking airplane at that point. And then I got on there, right? Virgin Airlines is where they've got like this, this club lighting, you know, like this Jersey shore sort of look on the plane, you know, like, like there's going to become stains on the seats or something, but it was actually a very enjoyable flight and they have new airplanes and uh, I highly recommend that airline and the guy gave nice, smooth fucking landing. They had all kinds of video games and movies and all that type of shit.

Speaker 8:          02:20:33       And you know what? I realize, I don't think I've said anything funny in like fucking 20 minutes. What happened to this podcast? Everything was going great. Do it. I'll tell you what it is. You not boozy and drinking fucking coconut water, dude. That's what it is. Huh? What are you going to do next to have a jank cucumber and fucking swallow it whole you fucking queer. Um, all right. Is that it? Is that it for the podcast to my fucking dog. Smells like a fucking dog. I just gave it a Goddamn Beth. I don't know what's going on. You know what it is. I've been hiking a lot lately and you know I have, I lost enough edge for you. I don't booze. I drink coconut water. I'm recommending eating salads and I go hiking every day and I have a beard. Okay, that's just write down the checklist of complete fucking pussy. What's The matter you Colin? Doggin oh cause cause it's all windy out. Yeah. We have a vicious pit bull that's afraid of the wind. Cleo, C'mon in here. Look a walking with their head down low. Oh my God. What's going to happen? Cleo? Come here. She's truly freaked out. Look at her tail between her legs. Clear?

Speaker 8:          02:21:52       Yeah. Okay. Now I can't pet you in this moment. This is something I learned from the dog trainer. If I pet you right now, when you're all freaked out, you're being rewarded for being freaked out. Jesus Christ. Look at the fucking thighs on you. You've been hiking with me, Huh? All right. You know what? Fuck this podcast. This is the end of the podcast. Everybody. My predictions, my predictions. I like a, all right, we're going to, we're going to go with my heart first bro. And slot at the fucking Tampa Bay lightning. All right, we're going to win that in. Uh, my fucking dog is standing there shaking right now. I'm clear. What are you doing?

Speaker 8:          02:22:38       All right. Fuck it. Alright. The Bruins are gonna win in. Um, I actually, for some reason I think, I think six games, the Bruins are going to win. This is my heart talking. Uh, my brain says Tampa and seven. Let's go across the fucking lake here. I like, uh, all right. This is the deal. What's weird in the sports world right now is San Jose in Dallas and the Dallas Mavericks are both not choking. There's no fucking way. Both of them are going to win a championship this year. One of them is going down and I don't think it's going to be San Jose. I say San Jose Beats Vancouver. I think they finally fucking pushed through this year. Joe Thornton is finally acting like a captain. I think it's gonna happen. Both teams are very streaky. Roberta Lovango. I don't know if he gets the Yips, they're going to be in trouble. I'm taking San Jose and the fucking West San Jose in the fucking West is probably going to be Tampa, San and San Jose.

Speaker 8:          02:23:36       I hate to fucking say it in the Goddamn finals. The Bruins make it to the finals. We're going to win it. Ah. It gives a shit bill. No one gives a fuck about you, God damn predictions. Yeah. Will I do? I do. He don't do I give a five. I give a fuck up enough about you that you're driving to work right now. This is an hour in.

You reach down for it. You stop short. You broke the bridge of your nose and you're still sitting there laughing. Cleo, you have to fucking relax. All right. You're freaking me out. Clear. Hey, not Jesus Christ, that dog. I swear to God. Yeah, you, you're retarded. All right. Basketball real quick. Um, as much as I love Oklahoma, I got to go. Dallas. Dallas is going to make the finals and uh, all right, Tampa is going to win the cup and I hate to fucking say it.

Speaker 8:          02:24:40       No Mavericks will when I get a bad feeling, the heat is going to go to the finals. I'm rooting for Chicago. I Love Dallas and I love Oklahoma. I got to go with Oklahoma cause fucking a, I love Durant and I also like a Kendrick Perkins and uh, yeah. And that's it.
