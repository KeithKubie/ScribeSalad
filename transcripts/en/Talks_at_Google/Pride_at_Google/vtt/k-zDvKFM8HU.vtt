00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.420
SPEAKER: This has been a
rough week for our community.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.354
In light of the horrific
tragedy in Orlando

00:00:05.354 --> 00:00:07.770
this weekend, I'm so glad that
we can really come together

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.670
today to build bridges within
our community and bridges

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.080
that make us stronger as
a whole, so we can support

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.880
our youth to grow
up safer than we did

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.670
and loving themselves in ways
that we didn't know how to.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.550
I think the shooting
has really reawakened

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
a fear in a lot of us, and
that fear for our safety

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.540
and survival in a world
that wants to harm us.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.360
Maybe this fear has faded over
time as we've gotten older,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.120
and as a society as we've all
finally started to grow up.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.000
With so much greater
visibility in the media

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.580
and with hard-won legal
victories like gay marriage,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.010
same-sex parental rights,
employment discrimination

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.000
protections, many
of us have begun

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.242
to feel almost like society
has started to value us.

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.950
Many of us in this
room work at companies

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.190
that offer us luxuries
like paid parental leave

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.940
for same-sex partners,
pay gender affirmation

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.760
surgery for trans people, even
LGBT resource groups that throw

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.470
events like this with free happy
hour, which is why I know you

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.250
guys are all here.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.930
But let's remember that
so many of these advances

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.810
really benefit the
professional class only,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.300
and there are still so many
LGBTQ people right here

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.140
in the Bay that are still
every day harassed at work.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.582
They must fight for basic
health care, housing,

00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:21.290
and people who live
in a constant or near

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.640
constant threat of violence.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.500
The fear that we're
all feeling this week

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.833
is a brutal reminder that
there are people out there who

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.980
would do us harm,
who want us to hide,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.940
and hate us for even existing.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.500
This fear has never faded for
many people in our community.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.110
Even here, which is
America's gay mecca,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.380
San Francisco, people
in our community

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.050
are still fighting to survive,
to feel safe, to be respected,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.050
and to be seen.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.930
Google's theme for pride this
year is pride for everyone.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.690
And I hope today
this theme really

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.070
is a call to action for those
of us with relative privilege,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.054
especially those of
us working in tech,

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:58.720
to show up for those
of us who are still

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.850
fighting for basic safety,
for a home, for a voice,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.210
and for a place in our
society and our community.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.530
We chose to highlight Bay
Area LGBTQ youth at this event

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.770
because so many of
us, so many of them

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.440
are impacted disproportionately
by poverty, violence,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.560
and oppression.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.120
So today let's stand in
solidarity with our queer youth

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.820
who know the struggle,
and despite it all,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.080
are still resilient
and brilliant.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.510
Without further ado, I want to
introduce our youth speaker,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.070
because we want, of course,
to not be talking about youth

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.570
without inviting and
having a youth voice here.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.931
So this is Pablo Rodriguez.

00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:39.431
Pablo?

00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:43.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:47.678
You good?

00:02:47.678 --> 00:02:48.719
[LAUGH]

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.760
PABLO RODRIGUEZ: Awesome.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.080
SPEAKER: So I'll just say
a few words about Pablo.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.870
He's an undocumented,
queer, two-spirit Latino,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.250
a graduate of Mission High
School, where he was president

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.210
of their GSA, active in
Latino youth organizing

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.730
groups, and the organizer of
his school's annual drag show.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.080
He was recently awarded
the eQuality Scholarship

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.200
and the Colin Higgins
Youth Courage Award--

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.986
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:10.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.796
SPEAKER: --which is, for those
of you who-- I guess you do

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:15.890
know what this is-- a national
LGBT recognition that's

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.504
only awarded to three
youth every year

00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:20.420
for their contributions
to the queer movement.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.445
So congratulations.

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:22.570
PABLO RODRIGUEZ: Thank you.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.610
SPEAKER: Pablo is
currently attending CCSF

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.010
and leading the Undocuworkforce
program at LYRIC.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.060
And let's welcome Pablo.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.560
Thank you.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.550
PABLO RODRIGUEZ: Thank you.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.500
It's such a pleasure to be here.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.177
I was on my flight
into LA last week,

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.760
and it was, like,
with a huge headache

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.510
because it was my first
time getting on a plane.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.550
And for most of the people here,
probably wasn't the first time.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.070
But for me it was.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.980
So that was really cool.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.880
Well, before I start
telling my story,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.930
I want to thank the creator
for one more day of sun,

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.610
for one more day of moon,
for all of the elements that

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.060
are around us right now,
to all of the directions,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.470
to the mother [INAUDIBLE],
the mother [INAUDIBLE],

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.610
the woman with many names that
is always taking care of us.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.900
So with that, I want to start
with colonization, murder,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.990
rape.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.820
My name is Pablo Rodriguez.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.320
I'm currently living
in the Mission,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.400
and I'd like to see myself
above-- I don't like

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.070
to see myself, but
I feel like I'm

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.107
one of the last people
currently living

00:04:38.107 --> 00:04:39.440
in the Mission with a skin tone.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.280
I identify as queer,
gay, two-spirit,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.970
which is a recent term
that I'm reclaiming.

00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:59.504
I have been living in the Bay,
in San Francisco for I don't

00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:00.920
know how many
years, but I've been

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.000
here since I was 14 years old.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.410
I am still undocumented.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.610
So I was without my mom for
almost eight or nine years,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.760
I believe, ever since she
left me to come out here.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.085
So there was a big
disconnection between her and I.

00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:27.480
So when I came out here and
I came out to her two years

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.790
after, the disconnection
was bigger.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.380
So let's pretend that
my connection to her

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.070
was like from that
distance from there.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.906
She was standing right there,
I was standing right there.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.780
And every time that I
would sit at the table,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.700
it was like seeing a
stranger that I didn't know,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.350
because the only thing that
I was able to recognize

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.650
was her voice.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.430
After I said, Mom,
I'm gay, I was

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.090
out of that window literally,
because she kicked me out.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.630
Time after, I finally
came back home

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.260
and I took on the
initiative to start actually

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.560
getting to know her.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.750
So it was two levels
that I had to deal

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.580
with of how to start approaching
her and getting to know her

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.440
as a mother, and then
also allowing her

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.170
to start getting to know me.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.570
So I started by asking her, so
what is your favorite color?

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.250
Because I didn't know what
was her favorite color.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.110
And then dipping into
other conversations

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.500
that started
developing with time.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.410
Going to Mission High
was really challenging

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.450
for a lot of reasons.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.600
One of them has to
do with language.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.720
I didn't even know
how to say hi.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.470
All of the words that I'm saying
right now, that I'm coming out

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.050
my lingua, I didn't know how
to say any of these words.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.026
So I'm like, yay, I know
how to speak English now.

00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:55.216
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.280
Which was challenging,
but still was

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.410
able to manage to
put on the drag show

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.640
in a public school
for everybody.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.460
And everybody was attending,
all of the parents

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.311
were coming into the room.

00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:11.810
Like--

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.667
[TAPPING]

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:13.166
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.940
Like, what is the school doing?

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.430
Like, why are teachers
in high heels?

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.400
Why are students doing this?

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.465
And it's like, because we can.

00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:23.770
[LAUGH]

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.730
So going to school, again,
was really challenging as well

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.400
because the whole
language barrier,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.200
and also because even
within the school,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.780
there is not really a focus
on undocumented queer youths.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.530
Usually you have a lot of
presenters coming and teaching

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.170
on how to vote and how to sign
up for all of these things,

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.211
and a lot of the programs
and a lot of the services

00:07:54.211 --> 00:07:55.710
that they offer, a
lot of the things

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.830
require a social
security number.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.130
So you can imagine how awkward
it is sitting in the room

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.060
and they're telling you to vote
when you clearly know that you

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.050
can't.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.250
So that was one of the
things that I noticed.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:13.930
Especially Mission High School,
it was like all of us-- well,

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.557
I at least knew most of
the undocumented kids

00:08:16.557 --> 00:08:17.390
in that high school.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.050
So let's pretend we're,
like, in Mission High

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.910
School right now and half
of you are undocumented.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.140
So you have, like, a person
there talking about voting,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.980
and half of their class is like,
uh, looking at each other like,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.400
are we really sitting here?

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.730
So that was one of
many things that

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.250
happened within the
public system as a whole.

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:52.546
And as I mentioned before, I
experienced homelessness right

00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:53.795
after I came out to my mother.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.290
And that left me in a very
risky and tricky situation,

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.390
because a lot of
people were telling me,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.010
oh, you should contact a lawyer.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.930
We can do this.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.010
We can do that.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.420
Sort of like suing her.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.450
And I was like, I
don't want to do that,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:16.770
because that can risk her
being able to continue

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.607
working here or even being
allowed to stay here.

00:09:19.607 --> 00:09:21.190
So it's like, I don't
want to do that.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:26.960
So coming out as an
undocuqueer is challenging.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.640
It's hard.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.240
It puts you at this place
where you don't exactly

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.420
know where to go.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.926
And a lot of programs,
again, don't exactly

00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:37.050
know how to deal with that.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.370
A lot of programs are
more focused on LGBT,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.070
but not exactly LGBT people
of color or undocumented.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.840
So again, it's like the
whole intersectionality thing

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.370
that we have to start talking
about what intersectionality

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.150
is.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.930
And not just talking,
but actually seeing how

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.160
that plays a role in society.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.030
So a lot of places
are like, well,

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.030
you know, you can get
housing, you can get that,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.400
but if you have a social.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.450
I didn't.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.740
So I had to, like,
maneuver myself

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.850
into a lot of different ways.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.620
And that's how I got
to LYRIC, and that's

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.370
how I got to meet my
mentor, [? Ed ?] Martinez.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.080
And you know, I was always
looking for resources.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.505
And that sort of leads me into
the fact that in San Francisco,

00:10:26.505 --> 00:10:32.090
I have only been here since I
was 14, and right now, I'm 21.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:40.210
And it's crazy how the lack of
resources for people like me,

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.950
it's like the only place
that is right now working

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.340
with undocumented queer
youths of color is LYRIC,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.430
and I'm leading that.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.840
There is no other place or in
the Mission or any other place

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.735
around San Francisco that
is working with us youths.

00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:01.810
And that's something that
I also have to deal with,

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.680
because we talk
about colonization

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.410
and we talk about
genocide as something

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.670
that happened 500 years
ago, but it's not true.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.160
It still continues to
happen every single day.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.940
And again, we also
talk about how--

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.980
I put it on here--
the manifest destiny,

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.000
and we talk about segregation.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.810
Manifest destiny is still
happening on the Mission.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.730
Segregation still
continues to happen,

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.860
because I have to travel
all the way to Oakland just

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.970
to get tested, because
[INAUDIBLE], every single time

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.970
that I attend [INAUDIBLE] they
tell me, oh, you came too late.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.720
Can you come earlier,
like 7:00 AM?

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.410
And I live all
the way in Balboa,

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.500
and I have to travel
[INAUDIBLE] out of my way,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.680
and I can't get there on time.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.730
So segregation still happens.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.210
I have to travel all the
way to the East Bay just

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.960
to get HIV and STD testing.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.746
I have to travel all the
way to the East Bay just

00:12:02.746 --> 00:12:04.120
to meet my friends,
the ones that

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.286
used to live on the Mission.

00:12:05.286 --> 00:12:09.080
I have to go all the way to the
East Bay just to go and dance.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.440
I have to go all the
way to the East Bay just

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.710
to talk about how radical
my thoughts and ideas are.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.940
Thank you.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.204
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.990
SPEAKER: Thank you so much.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.940
I think this talk
just really touched

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.780
on a lot of the
subjects that we're

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.620
going to be speaking about
with the rest of the panel,

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.360
and all these issues
that are so important.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.300
And so thank you once
again for coming and being

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.200
the voice of youth,
even though, you

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.410
know, there's countless
people, as you were saying,

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:49.190
that are in need of services
in the city, in the Bay Area.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:54.160
And that's why today we brought
several youth service providers

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.606
to talk a little
bit more about what

00:12:56.606 --> 00:12:57.980
we can do for
youth, what's going

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.430
on on the front
lines, people who

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.510
work on the ground
with youth every day.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.000
And in particular, queer
youth to empower and overcome

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
a lot of these barriers
that Pablo talked about.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.458
STEPHANIE PERRON:
So I'm Stephanie,

00:13:09.458 --> 00:13:11.920
and I run Our Space, which
is a queer and trans youth

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.890
center in Hayward.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.260
It's a program of Bay Area
Youth Center and Sunny Hills

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.610
Services.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:21.090
We will be celebrating
year six in August,

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.990
which is really exciting.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.740
We serve over 150
young people each year

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.720
through different programs.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.730
We started our space
really with the idea

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.790
of centering queer
and trans youth who

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.040
are impacted by systems
and holding them

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.450
at the heart of
everything we do,

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.360
and really recognizing them for
their strength and their power,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.510
and holding their needs and
experiences at the center.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.180
What we found when we started
our space six years ago

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:55.460
is that the organizations
that Our Space is a part of

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.400
works a lot with foster youth,
so I was a mental health

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.490
clinician carrying a caseload,
working with foster youth.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.820
And many of my young people
were queer and trans identified.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.710
And as I started trying to link
them to services in the Bay

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.370
Area, they wouldn't link.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.580
They were like, I'm not
going to go to this place

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.090
and try to be out about
my foster care status.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:19.480
And there were a lot of
barriers that they experienced

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.620
when they tried to access, like,
LGBTQ services in the East Bay.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.414
And so we really
started Our Space,

00:14:25.414 --> 00:14:27.080
holding foster care
youth at the center.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.020
So the way Our Space
plays out right now

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.490
is that we have a community
center with, like, sort

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.350
of typical community center
programming, like movie night,

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.530
queer and trans support circle.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.524
We have an intergenerational
community dinner every month,

00:14:39.524 --> 00:14:40.940
which everybody
in this room would

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.510
be invited to participate in.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.440
It's a really sweet, sweet
community building event.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.700
So we do things like that.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.120
We have mental health services
for queer and trans youth.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.630
We go out into the community
and do workshops in schools

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.990
and with other providers.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:59.450
And we also do a lot of really
specific work with Alameda

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.650
County Foster Care.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.840
So we work with their
child welfare workers

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.600
and do trainings for them,
and coaching and consulting.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.040
A lot of county workers think
that they don't have any queer

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.360
youth on their caseloads,
or that they've never

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.480
worked with a gay youth.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.382
And we all know that that's not
true, because queer and trans

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:18.840
youth are disproportionately
represented in the foster care

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.340
system.

00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:24.360
So we do a lot of work with
them, and we do a lot of work

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.943
with families of queer and trans
youth who are in foster care,

00:15:26.943 --> 00:15:28.950
and try to get queer
and trans youth who

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.880
are in foster care
out of foster care,

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.650
or back to a more
permanent situation.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.080
So that's a very mini
overview of what we do.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.310
We also host East Bay
Youth Pride, which

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.550
is going on it's fourth year.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.645
It's on October 22, and there's
are some flyers back there.

00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:46.880
It's the only youth pride that
happens in the East Bay that

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.520
was started by
young people and is

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.970
run every year by young people.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.490
So you can totally volunteer
or come hang out with us

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.190
at East Bay Youth Pride.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.259
I'll pass to Kate, who I adore.

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:00.050
KATE CALIMQUIM: Hi.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.490
Kate Calimquim.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.920
Program manager at Castro
Youth Housing Initiative.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.650
It is one of several
programs at Larkin Street.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.560
This program is
geared towards LGBTQ

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.260
houseless youth, ages 18 to 24.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.510
I think given with the housing
situation in the Bay Area,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.240
you know, there's a
large need for housing,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.860
especially for young
people who come

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.790
from all throughout the
Bay Area, California,

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.470
even in the United States,
outside of the country.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.120
They come to San Francisco
thinking, oh, rainbows

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.860
and unicorns.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.780
I'm going to find my community.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.880
And they come and face
reality, and it's not so much.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:47.550
So at Castro Youth, we have
30 beds in hotels and housing

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.070
in the Castro
District, which helps

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.390
youth begin to build their
communities, and whatnot.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.690
And we have case
management services,

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.120
which helps link
folks to mental health

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.750
services, educational employment
services, health linkages.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.010
I think we have a lot
of trans young people

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.829
who come in and
just kind of want

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.940
to work on their gender
affirming surgery.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.690
And so we have a lot
of great partnerships

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.800
within the community, such
as the LGBT Center Dimensions

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.780
Clinic where we help young
people realize and recognize

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:26.030
their goals for personal growth.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.500
It's a two-year program,
or up until folks are 25.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.390
And with that, folks are
able to save a lot of money.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.060
30% of their income goes
towards "rent," quote, unquote.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.800
And it's really a savings
program, which is really great.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.050
And folks can exit
with a lot of money

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:48.010
to help kind of get their
footing in the door.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:52.890
I could go on and on, but I
figure I'll pass it along.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.832
SPEAKER: We all do
so much up here.

00:17:55.832 --> 00:17:57.040
ZAKIYA HARRIS: Hi, everybody.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.470
My name is Zakiya Harris.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.710
I'm from Oakland, California.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:04.310
I'm one of the co-founders
of Hack the Hood.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.830
Some of you might
have voted for us.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.740
We actually won the
Google Impact Challenge

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.265
about a few years
ago, so thank you.

00:18:10.265 --> 00:18:11.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.920
We are a nonprofit
based in Oakland.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.000
We're currently working
throughout the Bay Area.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.740
We engage in low-income
youth of color

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.870
specifically in technology.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.450
Our core offering is
a six-week bootcamp

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.460
where we pair young
people one-to-one

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.890
with a local small business
and their community,

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.610
and they build a website for
a local cleaners, artist,

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.960
consultant, mom-and-pop
shop, really

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.780
lifting up the voices of those
who are not on Google Maps

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.070
and are not currently
discoverable online,

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.500
and making sure that
they have an opportunity

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.510
to really participate
in the changes that

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.620
are happening in the city.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.980
The young people that we
serve are 15 to 23-ish.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:55.490
Many of them are undocumented,
in the foster care system.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.410
We have young people that
are teen parents facing

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:03.350
a variety of barriers,
in addition to being

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.140
part of the LGBTQ community.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.560
We also have a lot of staff
who also identify in that way.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.760
So I think a lot of our model
is very culturally relevant,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.060
and it's also about reflecting
the communities that we serve.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.832
And we really try to do
that through all aspects

00:19:19.832 --> 00:19:20.665
of our organization.

00:19:24.064 --> 00:19:27.642
I'll pass it on.

00:19:27.642 --> 00:19:28.850
ERIK MARTINEZ: Hi, everybody.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.700
Buenas tardes.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.127
My name is Erik Martinez.

00:19:32.127 --> 00:19:34.210
I work with San Francisco
Unified School District,

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.950
and I oversee support
services for LGBT youth.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.480
It has been in existence
for about 25 years.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.548
We're turning 25 this year.

00:19:43.548 --> 00:19:44.960
Oh, what else do I want to say?

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.460
Oh my gosh.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.040
Blanking out.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.940
Oh, that's right.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.398
I have to mention this or my
boss will say something to me.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:54.250
It's the first fully integrated
LGBT support services program

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.190
in a school district.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.300
That happened here
in San Francisco.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.390
I was like, I knew I was
going to forget that.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.890
For San Francisco Unified,
I think this topic

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.480
is extremely relevant.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.600
90% of the youth who
attend SF public schools

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.720
are students of color.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.940
That should be no surprise then
that the majority, about 90%

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.820
of our queer youth are
also students of color.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.030
And really, the
goal of our program

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.740
is to create sustainable
support services programs

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.550
at each individual school
site where we have activities,

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.360
information, and education
for all students,

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.750
targeted skill building and
support services for groups

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.300
of students.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.840
So for example,
gay-straight alliances,

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.470
or what they're called now,
gender and sexuality alliances

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.210
are an example of that.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.890
And also making sure
that our schools

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.940
have one-on-one
support services.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.140
So making sure we have social
workers and culturally informed

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.410
nurses as well.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:50.660
JOCELYN WONG: All right.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.160
Hi.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:57.600
I'm J-Wo, an artist and activist
and youth mentor in Oakland.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.440
And I've been doing
mentoring with youth,

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:07.540
primarily youth of color, in
Oakland, previously working

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.820
with students trying to
get into college, mostly

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.400
first generation
college students.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:18.810
And as of recently,
helping youth entrepreneurs

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:22.250
developing their
own and realizing

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.627
their own economic
sustainability themselves.

00:21:26.627 --> 00:21:27.710
SPEAKER: Thanks, everyone.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.584
Let's give the panelists
a round of applause.

00:21:29.584 --> 00:21:33.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.140
So I want to start off,
just maybe someone can

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.820
reiterate a definition
of intersectionality.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.810
Because all of you are
working in the context

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.969
of intersectionality, and I
know Pablo touched on that.

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.510
Does anyone want to
give me just kind

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.810
of their definition of what
that means specifically

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.060
in the context of this work?

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.900
Zakiya, thanks.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.380
ZAKIYA HARRIS: I would like
to offer another analogy.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.580
And this is the way I
think of intersectionality.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.670
We all know about nature, right?

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.530
Nature is an ecosystem.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.090
And everything in an
ecosystem is connected.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.250
There is no such thing
as linear thinking

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.780
or compartmentalization.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.610
From the very
smallest microorganism

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.450
to the largest predator,
there is an interrelationship

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:16.860
and connectedness.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.649
And I believe that every
community, particularly

00:22:19.649 --> 00:22:21.690
indigenous communities
throughout the world, that

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.570
has always been the
view and the perspective

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.560
that we have used
for ages and ages.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.570
And I think that
intersectionality

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:34.540
is like a really cool,
modern PC way of saying that.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.950
But I think we also need
to ground ourselves.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.440
And I loved how you opened
up with the four directions,

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.520
because you're
grounding us in nature.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.940
You're grounding us
in that remembrance.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.957
And so I think that we need
to continue that perspective.

00:22:46.957 --> 00:22:48.040
So that's what I think of.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.850
I think of all
the connectedness,

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.080
that you can't talk
about police brutality

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.580
without talking
about immigration,

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.950
without talking about
capitalism, without talking

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.820
about how it affects
people of color.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.780
We understand the
interrelatedness of them.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.240
And I think most importantly,
we need to design for that.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.340
We need to be thinking
about in our design

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.680
so we're not just addressing
one particular symptom.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.710
We're looking at the whole
pie and looking how we can

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.782
address it from the ground up.

00:23:16.782 --> 00:23:17.490
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.400
Thank you.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.906
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:19.906 --> 00:23:22.920
I think the language that we
use when we have these dialogues

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.310
and expanding the language
and the concepts that we use

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.250
is really important.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.680
So to kind of integrate
that, can some of you

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.880
give some stories of
youth in the ecosystem

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.990
that they are living
in and coming out of,

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.700
and how the different
factors of their identities

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.760
and their environment
really affects the way

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.510
that they have access
to the resources

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.960
that you all are trying
to give and trying

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.073
to connect to youth to?

00:23:48.073 --> 00:23:49.072
JOCELYN WONG: All right.

00:23:49.072 --> 00:23:50.770
I can talk about a
young man that I've

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:52.800
been working with
for a few years

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.860
now from when he
started in high school.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.610
A gay young Latino.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.080
And in terms of,
like, issues that

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.600
were facing him from this
intersectional point,

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.400
he was living in
deep East Oakland,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:14.050
attending Castlemont, which if
you know Oakland is like out

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.430
on 90 or something.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.616
You know, it's a tougher school.

00:24:18.616 --> 00:24:20.490
There's definitely some
incidents of violence

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.323
that happened there.

00:24:21.323 --> 00:24:27.510
He lives in a neighborhood where
shootings, drive-bys, domestic

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.810
abuse, they exist there.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.160
His parents are also--
they're both immigrants.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.340
They don't speak English.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.510
Neither of them had
attended college.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.520
I think only one of his parents
had finished high school,

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.860
or equivalent to that.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:53.070
So when he was thinking
about attending college,

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.680
the issues of his
sexuality, being Latino--

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.690
you know, so he was
in a lot of hiding.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.850
And then trying to access
resources that he didn't know,

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.870
his family didn't really know.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.830
So he was coming-- he
was speaking with me

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:14.720
as like kind of a confidant
in terms of his sexuality,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.310
but then he really needed
to access resources and help

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:22.460
for continuing his
education, finding financing

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.280
for that, which was actually
probably one of the harder

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.480
barriers for him,
and doing all of that

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:37.070
within his geographic place that
was violent and under-resourced

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.430
overall.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.320
So it's not like he had
just one of these barriers

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.780
to face or to
overcome or deal with,

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:50.156
but there were multiple layers
that he had to deal with.

00:25:50.156 --> 00:25:51.780
And I think actually,
his parents still

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.382
don't know about his sexuality.

00:25:53.382 --> 00:25:54.840
He's still in the
closet with them,

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.670
and he still lives with them
out of financial need and such.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:04.190
So three years down the road,
he's actually still facing

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:09.560
a number of these
challenges based on,

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.410
you know, the class,
the immigration status

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.662
of his parents, his race,
his sexuality altogether.

00:26:15.662 --> 00:26:17.370
KATE CALIMQUIM: You
know, sitting up here

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.870
thinking about the young
people that I've worked with,

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.260
I guess a good
general example I have

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.720
is working with multiracial
young people who initially

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:34.605
came out as lesbian
or gay, and yet

00:26:34.605 --> 00:26:39.280
as they explore their
identity, begin to transition

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.660
to another gender.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:49.010
And so trying to work
with either-- so with that

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:52.360
as a transition from
male to female, you know,

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:57.520
the loss of access and privilege
as a male-bodied person,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.220
working with internalized
racism from their families

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.600
and communities of origin,
and how that all plays out

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.340
with this young person
who also came up

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.210
with some class privilege.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.390
And so as they come
to San Francisco

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:20.820
and begin to get involved with
just kind of homeless youth

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.270
organizations and just kind of
that loss of privilege, being

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:30.010
able to begin working with
community organizations really

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.230
focused on racial identity
and working through,

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.990
how do they navigate
those systems?

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:40.070
So there's a lot of
processing to be done.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:46.760
And how do we build
folks' self-identities

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.510
in the face of so many of
challenging situations.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.560
Coming up without privilege.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.880
You know, just kind of
coming in, recognizing

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.500
how they lose
privilege in a sense,

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.780
and also coming
to-- yeah, sorry.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.280
STEPHANIE PERRON:
No, that was good.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:06.985
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:07.860
KATE CALIMQUIM: Yeah.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.140
STEPHANIE PERRON: I'm
thinking about a young person

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.130
I've had the honor and
privilege of working

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.670
with since she was 14.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.030
She's 19 now, and
she came to Our Space

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.170
when she was 14 because
she lived in a group home

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.460
the other agency runs.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.560
And after about a month
of coming to Our Space,

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.140
she came out as a trans girl,
which was really exciting,

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:37.280
and she was really
affirmed for her identity.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.390
But when you're in
the foster care system

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.485
as like-- I mean, when you're in
the foster care system period,

00:28:42.485 --> 00:28:44.110
and then when you're
in the foster care

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.314
system as, like, a
queer or trans person,

00:28:47.314 --> 00:28:48.730
and then you're
in the foster care

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.380
system as, like, a
trans girl of color--

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:58.180
she identifies as black-- she
had a really rough time of it.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.640
Then she was bounced around
from different placements

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.910
and placements and placements.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.170
And I think that one of
the things that happens

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:09.125
is that a lot of providers
in the foster care system

00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:14.470
are white, look like me,
or a lot of white women,

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.050
and we bring our own frames
to the situation, right?

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:22.100
And so I think it's really
easy for young people

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.460
in the foster care system,
especially when they're

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:30.070
queer and trans youth of
color, to get read as violent,

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:33.570
to get read as aggressive, to
get read as they don't care

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.800
about school, to get read
as all these awful things.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.436
But what's really going on is
that they're getting harassed

00:29:39.436 --> 00:29:40.810
in their placements
all the time,

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.560
and their safety is in
jeopardy all the time.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.630
So like leaving a foster
care placement is actually,

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:54.070
like, a really amazing
act of survival, to leave.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.880
So this young person's been in
foster care since they were 14.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.050
There's a law in
California that's

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.640
called the AB 12 that extended
foster care to the age of 21.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.790
So 18 to 21-year-olds are
allowed to be in foster care.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.920
Which is actually kind
of an awesome thing,

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.320
because you're supposed to
be able to have housing when

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.070
you're in foster care,
and you have access

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.490
to a lot more resources.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:22.215
This young person,
whom I love so much,

00:30:22.215 --> 00:30:25.540
has bounced around a lot, and
had, like, my phone number

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.600
written on her backpack.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.820
So she would work
the streets a lot

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.560
and sort of get trafficked from
Oakland to LA and back again.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.121
So she was gone a
lot of the time.

00:30:36.121 --> 00:30:37.620
And she's one of
those young people,

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.720
as I'm sure that we all have
these young people in our lives

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.692
who we're always like,
I hope you're alive.

00:30:42.692 --> 00:30:43.900
Like, I want you to be alive.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.190
But they don't know if you're
alive or if you're not.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.231
And then you get the phone
call every few months,

00:30:48.231 --> 00:30:49.700
and you hear their voice.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.450
So one year ago, she
showed up at my office,

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.160
and it was like 5:30
at night, or something.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.060
The end of the day.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.410
And she looked rough.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.220
Like, she looked
not in good shape.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.590
And she had literally
just gotten back from LA.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.240
I hadn't seen her
in over a year,

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.950
heard from her in over a year.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.620
And she was 19 at this point.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.385
So still legally supposed to
be able to be in foster care,

00:31:15.385 --> 00:31:15.885
right?

00:31:15.885 --> 00:31:18.220
Like, you all are
with me on this.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.810
So I say, let's get you food.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:21.310
You're here.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.893
Let's do this.

00:31:21.893 --> 00:31:24.115
I'm going to call your
county worker right now.

00:31:24.115 --> 00:31:27.050
We're going to
find you placement.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.440
Her foster care case
was in the county that's

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.570
outside of Alameda County.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.820
So for me as a provider, I
don't hold the relationship

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.332
with those other
providers as well.

00:31:35.332 --> 00:31:37.040
So we get the county
worker on the phone,

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040
and they can do nothing.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.380
They say, oh, you're
a non-minor dependent.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.950
You're 19.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.430
You're not in work
or school right now,

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.160
so you don't meet
the requirements,

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.990
which is actually
not true, y'all.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.350
She didn't have to
be in work or school.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.310
But there was nowhere to go.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.590
And then I spent two or
three hours on the phone,

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.870
trying to find housing
for this young person.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.310
And I can echo, like, the
Bay Area housing crisis.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.840
In the East Bay, there
are very limited options

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.110
in terms of shelters, and
the main youth shelter

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:13.290
had a wait list
that was 43 deep.

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:16.340
Other shelters that we may
have been able to get her into

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.770
were mostly men's
shelters, where

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.970
it wasn't necessarily
going to be safe for her

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.070
as a trans girl.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:28.320
So what we end up doing after
all this time is that I coach

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.920
her, which I just want to name.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.410
This is, like, probably one
of the low, lowest moments

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.520
of my professional
career, but I coach her

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.770
into what to say to get her a
bed at John George Psychiatric

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.510
Hospital so that she can have
a safe bed for the night.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:46.680
Because she doesn't want to,
like, ride the bus all night.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.640
Like, we can't figure out
anywhere where she can go.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.220
And if anybody's ever
had an experience

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.300
with an adult
psychiatric hospital,

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.400
they're not necessarily safe
places for the queer and trans

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.640
community.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.890
So anyway, I say all this just
that she has a lot going on

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:06.770
in her life, right?

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.370
And with a team of lawyers that
we were able to connect her

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:12.320
with and with lots
of other supports,

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.000
it has still been, like,
an infinite struggle

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.210
to get her back enrolled
in the foster care system.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:24.160
And so I mean, she's
currently in prison right now.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.950
But I think about
this a lot, right?

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:33.090
I think a lot about if she was
a white, straight, cisgender

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.340
young person who
acted a certain way

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.500
and talked a certain
way to county workers,

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.440
would her trajectory be
much different than what

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.810
it is right now?

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:47.470
And I think when she gets out,
she could in theory have access

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.860
to post-foster care housing.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.110
But she doesn't have a family.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:56.210
She doesn't have, like,
emotional, connected support,

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.550
community in her life.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:00.490
She doesn't have
anybody supporting her

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:03.520
with real job skills and job
training and things like that.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.250
So just to think about what's
going on for this young person

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.600
and intersectionality.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.120
I think also really
quickly, I'll

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.650
just say that the life
expectancy of a black trans

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.850
woman in our country
is 35 years old.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.639
And so I mean, we should
say it again, right?

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:26.210
The life expectancy of a black
trans woman in our community

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.590
is 35 years old.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:33.934
And so we need to hold that.

00:34:33.934 --> 00:34:35.850
SPEAKER: Thanks so much
for sharing that story

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.040
and for the other
stories that were shared.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.690
I think part of why
I invited everyone

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:42.909
that is doing this
on the ground work

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:47.860
is to show what is happening
in our communities,

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:53.040
in our LGBTQ community,
and to really

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.020
get us motivated to understand
where people are coming from,

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:02.290
and to act on that and get
involved in any way we can.

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:05.040
I think it's
important to know how

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.540
all these different factors,
different aspects of identities

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.700
combine to limit
access to resources.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:15.270
And even though we're all
here coming from resources

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.480
that are funded,
they're set up, they're

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.524
supposed to be giving care and
giving services and getting

00:35:20.524 --> 00:35:23.300
youth, getting kids,
teenagers, children

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.302
out of these situations
that you're describing,

00:35:26.302 --> 00:35:27.760
there are so many
factors that have

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.426
to do with the racial
identity and queer

00:35:29.426 --> 00:35:33.710
identity and oppression that
intersect to limit access

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:39.360
to those resources that are
supposed to be helping them.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.070
I was going to ask
about, what are

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.980
some typical misconceptions
about the youth that you all

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.000
serve?

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.940
And I think Stephanie, you
just touched on a lot of those.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.080
Why can't people-- if there
are services like foster

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.490
care all the way until
21, why aren't they in it?

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.481
Does anyone else want to
speak to misconceptions

00:36:01.481 --> 00:36:02.980
about the youth
that they work with?

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.590
And also maybe some
innovative ways

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.620
that they've identified their
needs and met their needs

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.170
in the face of all
of these barriers.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.470
ZAKIYA HARRIS: Well, I've
worked with young people

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.630
my whole career, over 13 years.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.420
And I've worked in a
variety of settings

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.910
as a classroom teacher,
after-school programs.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.020
And I think one
misconception that I always

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.540
hear, particularly in
workforce development, which

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.350
is the work I'm doing now, is
a surprise at the brilliance

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:35.600
of young people of color.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.260
Oh my God, they're so smart.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.130
Oh, they really get it.

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.060
They really know how to code.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.470
They really want to be better.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.650
They're great leaders.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.210
And then this thinking of,
like, we're making them leaders,

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:52.260
or we're imbuing
them with something.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:56.170
And I think that our young
people are so resilient.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:58.730
Young people are so
freaking resilient.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.170
And I feel like all
the young people

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.780
I've had the
opportunity to work with

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.230
have overcome tremendous
barriers every day

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:10.690
just getting up in the morning
to make it to the program,

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:11.710
to your point.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.350
You know, all the
hurdles that most adults

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.620
would have failed at hurdle
number one, literally.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.700
And they get no credit for that.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.380
And the expectation
is just like, oh well.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:30.060
And I think that a lot of
work gets put into the tools,

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.570
whether we want to train
them to do this or train

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:33.660
them to do that.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.200
But we don't talk
about the trauma.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.810
We don't talk about the
21st century skills.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.610
We spend a lot of
time at Hack the Hood

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:45.370
talking about the future of
work and the new set of tool box

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.690
that every young
person has to have now.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:51.000
And the fact that all of the
rules that apply to everyone

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.370
in this room are dead.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.880
They don't apply anymore.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.510
What it takes for a young
person to navigate childhood

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.470
into any type of
career trajectory

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.210
is completely nuanced now.

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:07.540
It has to do with your
social network, who you know.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.690
It has to do with your
navigational capital,

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.920
your ability to see where you
want to go and to understand

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.650
what it means to get there.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.150
You have to be able to speak.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.550
You have to be able
to code switch.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.130
There's so many other things
that you have to be able to do,

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.384
and it's not just
the technical skill.

00:38:25.384 --> 00:38:26.800
And I think a lot
of times we just

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.340
focus on this technical thing
that a young person's supposed

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.600
to know, like we got to
where we are because of just

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.780
the technical skill, right?

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.150
Like, we all navigated
something new.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.010
But when we're talking about
communities, because we're

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.500
othering these communities
as someone else,

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.360
we want to put a new
set of rules on them.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.092
And those rules just
don't fit anymore.

00:38:50.092 --> 00:38:51.550
So I think that we
have to-- again,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.690
I think it's a design
challenge, right?

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:55.890
We have to start designing
differently, thinking

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.780
differently, and really
starting with the assets

00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.710
of our young people.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.095
And so at Hack the
Hood, we do as strengths

00:39:02.095 --> 00:39:04.960
finder assessment-- you
guys probably did that--

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.450
with all of our young people.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.730
And we have found it to be,
like, it just kind of makes

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:14.090
everyone's back stand
taller when they recognize

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.990
the fact that they
have gifts, they

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:18.490
were born with strengths that
are something that they love

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.150
and something that
they're good at.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.290
And we really focus
on that and think

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.380
about technology as a
tool that they can use

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.440
to kind of harness that work.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.080
So we're not kind
of putting them

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.880
on a track towards anything.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.770
We're allowing them to
really harness their gifts,

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:38.660
and we don't limit the
conversation around technology

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.300
to a few companies like
Google and Facebook.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.817
You know, there is
no career trajectory

00:39:43.817 --> 00:39:45.400
that any of our young
people are going

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.236
to go into where technology
is not at the center of that.

00:39:49.236 --> 00:39:51.630
We don't think about being
an entrepreneur as something

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.630
that you have to become.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.130
Everybody's an entrepreneur
in the 21st century.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.390
It doesn't matter if you've
got a main job, a side

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.090
hustle, a passion project.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:00.740
You're not just going
to have one job.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.320
You're probably
going to have three.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.464
So how do we prepare
young people?

00:40:04.464 --> 00:40:06.880
And then when we start adding
all the barriers, oh my God.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.410
Now you've got the low
income, the youth of color,

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:12.180
the queer, the
homeless, the mom.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:17.540
All those other barriers
get stacked on top of that.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.520
And then when we
talk about housing

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.690
and we talk about
homeless, when we

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.130
look at some of the homeless
folks on the streets,

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.480
we're working with
their youth, you know?

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.260
That's another level
of trauma of seeing

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.530
Auntie sleeping in a tent.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.420
And so just not recognizing
all of those connections

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.600
in that young people are kind
of surviving against all odds.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.440
So you know, I'm just
proud of all of our youth.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.820
I think that young
people really get it.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.080
They have the answers.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.410
They don't need anybody
kind of telling them.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.040
We really need to listen more.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.840
We need to be quiet and
let the youth speak,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:00.250
and really just kind of
use them as our teachers,

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:04.540
because they have so much vision
and inspiration to guide us in.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:08.330
And I think that's part of what
it means to just really honor

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.630
youth where they're at, and
also kind of start debunking

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.469
those misconceptions.

00:41:14.469 --> 00:41:15.260
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.150
JOCELYN WONG: Yeah, I
super agree with all that.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:20.540
I think a common
misconception that I've

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.630
seen a lot of young people deal
with is that they don't know

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.540
what's best for them,
that they're young,

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.270
they don't know the
real world, or they

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.530
don't know, like, what's
in their own best interest.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.860
But that's usually
many times coming

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.250
from people that aren't
facing the same problems

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:40.850
and struggles that those
young people are facing.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.130
So if anybody knows the
problems that they're facing

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.040
and how to deal
with those problems,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.600
it's those young people
that are dealing with them.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.380
They're growing up
in a world or they've

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.240
been living in a world
that didn't exist before.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.570
And you know, thinking
about how maybe we grew up,

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.020
we didn't have the technologies
and the things that were

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.540
going on that's happening now.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.764
And so they're facing
problems that some of them

00:42:05.764 --> 00:42:07.180
are new problems,
and some of them

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:10.810
are systemic problems
that have always existed.

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:12.290
But they definitely know.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:16.420
Like, they want the
best for themselves.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.360
It's not like they
don't want the best

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.430
possible life they could get.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:27.590
But you see a lot of times,
people with money, affluence,

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:29.350
privilege coming in
and saying, well,

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:34.520
we know the best way for you
to be economically empowered.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.590
And so you follow this
path that we followed,

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.490
and you'll be in the
same place as us.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.890
When it's like, they're
starting from a whole

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:43.860
different-- they're
on a different island

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.740
in another country.

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.700
Like, it's a totally
different trajectory

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.450
that they're going
to have to follow.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:53.620
And so if anything, if
you maybe provide access

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.790
to resources or
access to knowledge,

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.050
they can solve the
problems for themselves.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.240
Like, we're not trying to
solve problems for them.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.990
We just want to maybe give
them tools or tips or skills

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:07.740
so that they can solve
their own problems.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.780
Because chances
are, I have no idea

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.500
what the problem they're
facing is to begin with.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.170
I might conceptually understand
a problem they're faced with,

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:19.640
but they have the experience
of what this problem is

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.770
and how to solve it in
the best way for them

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.177
and their community.

00:43:24.177 --> 00:43:26.760
ERIK MARTINEZ: Yeah, I kind of
want to add to what both of you

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.259
were saying.

00:43:27.259 --> 00:43:29.402
You know, queer youth
of color are fierce.

00:43:29.402 --> 00:43:29.902
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:29.902 --> 00:43:31.360
They are strong.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.550
You know, I think back to just
some of those early documented

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.820
experiences on film.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.790
You know, "Paris Is Burning"
is a great example of how

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.910
communities can create their
own communities of resilience

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:45.230
and cultural capital
and social capital,

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.750
even when facing multiple
points of marginalization.

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.580
I think one of the unique
things about, I think,

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.320
and where I sit in
the school district

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.466
is I get to see kids at
multiple ages, right?

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:57.090
I get to see them in
elementary school,

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.310
I get to see them
in middle and high.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:01.670
And currently,
I'm in the process

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:04.080
of hiring some staff
for some of our schools,

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:09.740
that I'm seeing graduates
return after college who want

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.160
to work with their schools.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.240
And one thing I'm
noticing is how

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.450
experiences of
marginalization also

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:20.860
affect the way they
show up, because they

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:24.364
have to work twice as hard to be
perceived to be strong, right?

00:44:24.364 --> 00:44:26.530
It's not about whether or
not they're strong or not.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.130
It is about perception.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:32.495
And to me, just looking
at queer candidates,

00:44:32.495 --> 00:44:35.060
our white queer
candidates are coming in

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.340
with that sense of entitlement,
that sense of, I am capable.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.700
I can do this, and be able to
sell themselves really well.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.639
Whereas a lot of our
candidates of color,

00:44:44.639 --> 00:44:46.180
they're groomed to
think that they're

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:50.200
lucky to be given the little
bits and pieces that they're

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:50.950
given, right?

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:54.960
So how they come off in a job
interview can be very, very

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.880
different, even though on
paper they are just as amazing,

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.750
they are just as strong.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:03.170
So I think about Pablo
and my first meeting

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.570
with him, when I first met
Pablo, he was at Mission.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.640
He was a sophomore-- freshman.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.006
I mean, this kid was fierce.

00:45:11.006 --> 00:45:12.880
I was like, why am I
coming into this school?

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.950
[LAUGH]

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.930
It looks like he
has it going on.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:20.090
But it was really a matter
of, how do I as a queer adult,

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.820
as a person who has
achieved privilege,

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.460
but also understands the
path that he's going through,

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.744
to mentor him to not
just find his strength,

00:45:26.744 --> 00:45:27.910
but believe in his strength?

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.460
Because it's already there.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.425
He just needs to see it, and
they just need to believe it.

00:45:32.425 --> 00:45:34.550
So I think when we think
about queer youth of color

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:36.460
in particular is that
they have the answers,

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:40.510
they have the power, and it's
our responsibility as adults

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:42.506
to help them realize that.

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:43.880
To show a mirror
and be like, no.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.160
You got it.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.910
Don't believe this other BS.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.978
Like, you have it
and you can do it.

00:45:49.978 --> 00:45:51.143
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:45:51.143 --> 00:45:51.830
Yeah.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:51.960
Applause.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.720
[LAUGH]

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.580
On that note, I
guess, what do you

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.870
see-- where do you see queer
leadership and queer youth

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.200
leadership taking place?

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.040
And what form is that
taking with the youth

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.090
that you're working with?

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.380
We talk a lot about the
barriers that they're facing,

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.630
but how are they surpassing our
expectations in terms of taking

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:19.280
on their own leadership?

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.190
ZAKIYA HARRIS: Well, I
think that, again, we

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.710
need to ground ourselves
in the reality.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:34.880
The March on Washington was
organized by a queer man.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.800
You can Google a great speech
by Huey P. Newton, founder

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.490
of the Black Panther
Party, talking

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:43.880
about how the black
nationalist movement needs

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.470
to work with queers as
allies and hold them close.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.540
The entire Black
Lives Matters movement

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:53.690
was created and catalyzed
by black queer women.

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:56.530
They've changed the
entire national narrative,

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.230
and arguably the
global narrative,

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:03.150
pushing not just black rights,
but rights for everybody

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.780
into the forefront.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.630
So again, we've
always been here.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:09.800
We've always been pushing.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.040
I think now with
technology, and there's

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.270
kind of a different lens
and a different way,

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:16.900
you know, we're
using these stories.

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.358
But I think that we just need
to recognize that we're still

00:47:19.358 --> 00:47:21.630
standing on the shoulders
of great leaders,

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.490
and continuing
that conversation.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.060
And oftentimes,
that conversation

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.190
just hasn't been heard.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.356
It's like, police brutality,
it was always going on.

00:47:28.356 --> 00:47:30.190
We just didn't have it on tape.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.390
So it's like the same thing
with the queer rights movement.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:34.520
It's always been there.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.390
And now because of technology
and because there's

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.930
a spotlight, some
of those stories

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:40.780
get to percolate up further.

00:47:45.094 --> 00:47:46.760
KATE CALIMQUIM: I
think kind of speaking

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.840
towards that, I
think as our nation,

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:54.080
as we become more diverse,
as awareness is raised

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.310
towards gender and sexual
orientation, all those things,

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.150
I see just the
millennials growing up

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.280
and moving into those
leadership positions.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.030
I think as we
become more diverse,

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:07.769
our young people
are leading the way.

00:48:07.769 --> 00:48:09.310
They're doing the
work that they need

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:13.560
to do on that ground
level, and easily

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.830
see in a few decades from
that-- or a few years

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.124
from now doing really well.

00:48:19.124 --> 00:48:20.790
ZAKIYA HARRIS: If I
could add, I mean, I

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.710
think the work needs to happen
from the other folks that

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.080
aren't in the queer community.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.900
I don't think the
onus is on, what

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.480
is the queer community doing?

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.780
It's more like, how can other
people be allies and support

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.340
the work of the queer community?

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.980
And there was a
great quote or tweet

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.160
that was going around
after the Orlando massacre

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.460
that I read that said, dear
heterosexual black man,

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.506
will you stand for us
the way we stood for you?

00:48:48.506 --> 00:48:50.460
From a gay black man.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.860
And so that's a question.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.760
Will everyone else
stand up the way

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.300
that they have been standing
up on the front lines for us?

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.690
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:08.160
On that note, what would you say
allyship and advocacy actually

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.990
looks like for coming from
queer people of privilege,

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:16.100
relative privilege, white,
cisgender, male, affluent,

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.720
able-bodied people?

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:25.530
And how can we redefine help
to be defined by the people who

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.670
are needing that?

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:30.610
ERIK MARTINEZ: One of
my favorite definitions

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:33.796
of allyship and
thinking about the fact

00:49:33.796 --> 00:49:35.170
that this work
has been happening

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:39.040
for some time, a
really great ally

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.420
is someone who takes the
hit, but not the credit.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.550
So someone who can
use their privilege

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:48.250
to really shield and
protect and move forward

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.160
without claiming that
somehow they made it up,

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.940
or they're bringing
this to light.

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:55.670
And that happens
all the time, and I

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:59.884
think allies need to really
check their egos in this work.

00:49:59.884 --> 00:50:01.300
Is it really about
the communities

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:05.036
that you're working
with, or is it about you

00:50:05.036 --> 00:50:07.947
needing to be seen as a savior?

00:50:07.947 --> 00:50:09.530
And I think that's
a real conversation

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:12.169
and reflection that a lot
of our allies need to have.

00:50:12.169 --> 00:50:13.960
STEPHANIE PERRON: I
really agree with that.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.770
And I think just
thinking tangibly

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:19.840
about if I'm thinking
about queer and trans

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.460
youth I'm working
with right now,

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.430
I'm thinking about something
that somebody said earlier

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:26.720
about letting young people lead.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:30.800
So I'm thinking about having
money available to young people

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.420
to make their dreams
come true that

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.170
doesn't have any
strings attached to it,

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:38.640
or doesn't have to be,
like, evidence-based

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.220
or something like that, right?

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.160
Like, are we supporting
communities and coming up

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.420
and doing what they
know already works?

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:49.130
And so how are we
funding that situation?

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:51.360
I think also
tangibly, I can't help

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.510
but think about housing
and just all the queer

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.870
and trans young folk that
we've probably all seen

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.870
that just don't have housing.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:04.380
There's the host housing program
that happens in Minnesota

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.430
that I've always been dreaming
of learning more about,

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:12.850
where folks in the community
are housing folks for queer

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:13.350
and trans.

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:16.370
Even where queer and trans youth
get to interview them and like

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:20.180
decide if they're safe enough
for them to go stay with.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.250
But I wonder about
getting really

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.550
creative about housing
strategies in the Bay Area,

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.610
and how we could all
really work together

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:30.420
to form a network of support
for our young people.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.970
Because the reality
is that there's not

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.470
the funding or the
institutional support.

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:39.690
Like, it's not going to happen
just through one program

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:42.079
because the need is
so great right now.

00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:44.162
Those are some tangible
things I'm thinking about.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:50.066
KATE CALIMQUIM: Some--

00:51:50.066 --> 00:51:52.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:55.420
Something I find, I
think as we are all here,

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.900
I think we're in a sense
maybe speaking to the choir.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.676
I think we like to think that
we're aware, we're conscious.

00:52:02.676 --> 00:52:04.800
And I think I want to
challenge folks to bring that

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.030
back to your families,
your friends who may not

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:09.820
be so supportive or aware.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.070
Have those really tough
conversations over family meals

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:17.520
and family reunions
where auntie or uncle may

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.800
be spouting something
where it's just like, no,

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.780
that's not right.

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.940
I think those are ways
folks can show up.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.830
Because we can't have those
conversations because they

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:27.080
don't care about us.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.160
But if they're talking to
you who they adore greatly,

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.590
that has more
resonance, and I think

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:38.710
can help really allow
folks to critically think

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:39.820
about the issues.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:54.770
SPEAKER: So I think after
the event also, we're

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:57.380
going to pass out some
information to all

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.440
the attendees about
kind of concrete ways

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.835
that people can contribute
and get involved,

00:53:01.835 --> 00:53:03.460
but is there anything
else anyone would

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:06.250
like to say in terms of, what
are things we can do right

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:10.450
now, today, in terms of
donation, volunteering,

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:15.922
mentorship that your
organizations might be needing?

00:53:15.922 --> 00:53:17.380
ZAKIYA HARRIS:
Well, we love money.

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:20.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.940
But that's not all you can do.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:25.310
That's not all you can do.

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:28.860
I think that particularly
around the whole digital tech

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.420
inclusion conversation,
one thing that's

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.890
been really apparent
for my work at Hack

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:36.520
the Hood is that
we love the checks.

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:43.400
However, if y'all not hiring--
so when we talk about those

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:48.480
pathways and on-ramps,
you know, is that real?

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.320
Because the check is
only going to go so far.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.530
And think about
the personal trauma

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:56.370
and how debilitating that
is for our young people who

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:59.930
are working so hard to get
something, and then to find,

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:04.440
again, all that 21st century
skills stuff starts popping up,

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.200
because the technical
is not enough.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.260
I think on a personal
level, everybody

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.027
needs to do some serious
anti-oppression work, you know?

00:54:14.027 --> 00:54:16.610
And not just the people who are
coming to train you at Google.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:18.270
You know, your
own personal work.

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:20.190
Privilege is transitory.

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.070
We all have it.

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:23.250
We navigate it constantly.

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:26.570
So really focusing on your
own personal privilege

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:29.330
and how that shows up,
again, holistically,

00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:32.620
in all aspects of your life
from the housing decisions

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.960
that you're making to the
neighborhoods that you live in.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.750
I think we need to
vote with our dollars.

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:40.250
Every time you're
spending money,

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:41.890
you're making a
conscious decision

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:44.580
to support the new world
that we want to create

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.650
or an old system that we
see the havoc that it's

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:51.180
wreaking on the world.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:54.560
And I think starting
with your own community,

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.580
you know, I think what
has been echoed here,

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.340
I think the tendency
is always to go

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.870
outside of your community.

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:02.870
Well, we've got experts
in our community.

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:05.230
We really need you
being on the front lines

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.720
of your own community,
spreading this gospel,

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.240
pushing the narrative, pushing
your peers, your family

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.540
members, having those
uncomfortable conversations,

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.240
not needing to tokenize
the folks of color

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.190
or the queer people in the room
to bring up the folk of color,

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.530
queer people conversations
in the meeting.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.960
How can you be an ally if you
don't identify with that way

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.800
to stick up for those
folks, and really

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.730
make sure those
conversations are being had?

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.940
So I think we have
to kind of start

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:35.480
small as well,
and kind of really

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.470
looking at what we
can do at all times.

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:41.970
Even myself, I'm always
having to confront

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:44.400
that conversation
as well as someone

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.820
that is an American citizen.

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:49.310
I had to do a lot of work
on expanding my own lens

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:53.380
about undocumented youth not
just being limited to Latinos,

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.872
to have to really be allies to
my African brothers and sisters

00:55:56.872 --> 00:55:58.830
and my West Indian brothers
and sisters who are

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:00.490
part of the African diaspora.

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:01.610
And like, wow.

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:04.780
I didn't even think about you in
the undocumented conversation,

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.150
and knowing that I have
people in my own community

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:09.250
that were facing those
barriers, you know?

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:11.490
So how can I be
more of an advocate

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.655
when immigration in these
conversations come up?

00:56:13.655 --> 00:56:15.780
And not just thinking, oh,
that doesn't include me,

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.320
or that doesn't
include my people,

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.440
because it actually does.

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:26.370
JOCELYN WONG: I think
just bouncing off

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:31.480
that, I think-- yeah,
you can write a check,

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.340
and maybe even hire people.

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:38.370
But there's the problem of
getting them to stay as well.

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:43.416
And so I've worked
with two young people

00:56:43.416 --> 00:56:45.040
in particular that
I'm thinking of that

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.780
did go through work development,
job skills training.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.331
They got jobs.

00:56:50.331 --> 00:56:51.830
And a couple months
into it, they're

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:54.190
just like, I don't want to
work for this white lady.

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:55.697
Like, I can't really
deal with this.

00:56:55.697 --> 00:56:57.780
Like, there's all these
microaggressions, and over

00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.450
and over, and they're out.

00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:03.870
I mean, they did all the steps
that they were shown to follow,

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:05.000
and they got the job.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.147
Like, they were there.

00:57:06.147 --> 00:57:07.230
They made it, or whatever.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:14.650
But then the cultures that
all these different privileges

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:17.380
and biases that we have that
have been ingrained in us

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.430
since day one, they're
still going to show up.

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:21.900
Even if I hire the
person of color,

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.850
I hire the young
person of color,

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:25.590
but then I make it
kind of uncomfortable

00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:31.040
for them to stay there, how
good is that on its own?

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.860
Like, you did kind
of part of the job,

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:37.074
but it's actually incomplete
because they're leaving shortly

00:57:37.074 --> 00:57:38.240
after they're getting there.

00:57:40.905 --> 00:57:42.446
I just wanted to
say that [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:42.446 --> 00:57:44.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:45.242 --> 00:57:48.510
SPEAKER: Anyone else?

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:51.150
I think there's so
much valuable stuff

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:54.590
to say about this topic and
about economic empowerment

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:56.630
for the youth that
are really struggling,

00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.906
getting them there,
keeping them there, getting

00:58:00.906 --> 00:58:04.390
all the benefits that
come for queer people,

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:07.510
working within
professional organizations,

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:11.040
professional companies as I
mentioned at the beginning.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:15.440
So let's do it.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.740
I think with that, I want to
open it up to the audience

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.330
to ask questions.

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.740
And if you can just stand
up and shout out something,

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:27.418
and I'll repeat it
so everyone can hear.

00:58:27.418 --> 00:58:29.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:34.726
Just to repeat so everyone
can hear, but yeah.

00:58:34.726 --> 00:58:36.990
How do the people who
are being oppressed

00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:40.820
have to not be the ones to
educate others about how

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.270
not to oppress them, right?

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.802
I learned.

00:58:43.802 --> 00:58:44.646
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:48.420
ZAKIYA HARRIS: Well, we have a
module at Hack the Hood that's

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:49.960
called code switching.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.510
And we really frame code
switching as something

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:54.690
that you're not trying
to be someone else

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:57.890
and really rooting
that, but you understand

00:58:57.890 --> 00:59:01.960
that there are ways that we
have to show up sometimes

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:02.860
in different rooms.

00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:04.276
And it doesn't
mean that you don't

00:59:04.276 --> 00:59:07.212
get to be your authentic self,
but you are aware of that.

00:59:07.212 --> 00:59:08.920
And sometimes our
young people don't even

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.610
understand that that's even
anything, that they are even

00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:12.450
aware of that.

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:14.980
So I think empowering young
people with that language.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:17.750
We also introduced the
concept of microaggressions.

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:19.790
We want them to
understand that language,

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:23.780
to have vocabulary to understand
that they have their own power

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:24.940
to navigate.

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:28.340
And it was one of the most
difficult modules to create,

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.130
and I did a lot of
work writing it,

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:33.420
because there was no
solution at the end.

00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.387
It wasn't like, OK.

00:59:34.387 --> 00:59:35.970
I'm going to teach
you how to do this,

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:37.440
and then everything's
going to be OK.

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.481
It's like, you know what?

00:59:38.481 --> 00:59:41.240
I'm going to give you some
language and some tools,

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:45.180
and I really hope that
you can use these in life.

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:48.950
And I think that that really
speaks to that 21st century

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:51.850
tool box that I talked
about where we're empowering

00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:54.020
young people with a
set of tools that they

00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:56.130
can use to navigate
and architect

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:59.730
and build a life that
they want to live.

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:02.600
And that they have
the self-confidence

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.740
to give that pushback
in a corporate setting

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.850
to a supervisor, to
speak their truth,

01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:09.490
to understand how
they can navigate,

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:13.740
to have a support system, and
to start addressing these things

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.350
and understanding
that there's also

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:18.350
some systematic things at
play that we haven't really

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.140
talked about.

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:23.040
We've done a lot of talk
today about individuals

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.790
and organizations,
but there's also

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:26.840
this whole system
we're part of called

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.750
the United States of America
that's a capitalist system.

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:34.320
And so, you know, how
are we also bringing that

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.022
in as well to the conversation?

01:00:37.022 --> 01:00:39.110
Even from something
as simple as what

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:44.260
it means to be an entrepreneur,
and reframing what that means.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.901
And so just making
money isn't sufficient.

01:00:46.901 --> 01:00:48.400
If you're not
thinking about people,

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.108
if you're not thinking
about the planet--

01:00:50.108 --> 01:00:54.150
so we don't have to
just limit businesses

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.210
to capitalist endeavors.

01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:00.570
So you know, it's a whole
kind of context, I think,

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:02.770
that we really have
to work to build.

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:05.930
And for young people to see
themselves as part of that

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:10.100
and to understand
that your job doesn't

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.940
define who you
are-- something else

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.350
we do is we create a life title.

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:15.641
Every young person creates
a life title for themselves.

01:01:15.641 --> 01:01:17.480
Not a job title, a life title.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.440
So your job title
will come and go.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.250
Some people don't
have a job, so they

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:25.404
might feel like they don't have
any-- what is their purpose?

01:01:25.404 --> 01:01:27.570
And so young people use the
strength finder activity

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:30.920
to actually create a life
title, like, I'm a solutionary,

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.820
I'm a pathfinder, I'm
a strategic cultivator.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.970
So they understand
that your worth is not

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:42.990
defined by your job and
who's bigging you up,

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.860
that you're part of
something bigger than this,

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.066
and that this job is one
part of a very long journey

01:01:49.066 --> 01:01:50.190
that you're going to be on.

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:53.640
So again, it still comes back
to the confidence building,

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.070
and how can we really
work to address

01:01:57.070 --> 01:02:03.920
the trauma that really keeps us
from being our greatest selves?

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.670
SPEAKER: So in light
of all the negativity

01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:07.500
that we've been
feeling this week,

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.599
in light of the incident
over the weekend in Orlando,

01:02:10.599 --> 01:02:13.140
what are some positive takeaways
about the impact that you're

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.470
making in your organizations
and how we're really reaching

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:20.030
people and making change?

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:23.370
STEPHANIE PERRON: So there's--
I'm not going to remember

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:26.548
the website right now, but
I'm going to get it to you.

01:02:26.548 --> 01:02:27.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.710
I will get it to you.

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:31.000
But we had the
honor and privilege,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.910
seven queer and
transing people who

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:36.540
come to Our Space made these
really dope digital stories

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.800
about the impact of mental
health on their life.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.490
So they're not always, like,
the easiest stories to watch.

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:45.695
But it's kind of
amazing that there's

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:48.599
this really cool free
curriculum thing out there.

01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:50.390
So I think that's one
cool thing that we're

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:52.306
doing, is we're trying
to change the narrative

01:02:52.306 --> 01:02:55.462
around mental
health particularly,

01:02:55.462 --> 01:02:57.670
holding queer and trans
youth of color at the center.

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:00.280
And so it's really cool,
and it's really cute.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.300
And there's a flyer
back there with pictures

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.082
of the young people on it.

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:05.790
It's really cute.

01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:12.200
KATE CALIMQUIM: So one question
that I meant to answer earlier

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.440
was just kind of what I
would want you to know

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.930
about the population we serve.

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:20.430
The thing with homeless
youth in San Francisco,

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:24.110
any one of y'all, any of the
youth that I work with can be

01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:26.340
amongst y'all, and y'all
wouldn't even know.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.141
So I mean, I think there's
this kind of stereotype

01:03:29.141 --> 01:03:31.640
of what a homeless person looks
like, a homeless youth looks

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.400
like.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.470
And I mean, I think the
youth that I've worked with,

01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:38.324
they've gone to Stanford,
they've worked at eBay.

01:03:38.324 --> 01:03:39.990
So I mean, it's just
one of those things

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:42.220
where homelessness
can happen to anyone.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.350
And our youth in
general, given the fact

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:48.240
that 40% of all
homeless youth are

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.010
LGBT, that says a lot in
terms of the experiences

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:56.700
they have of rejection
and exclusion.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.730
Couple that with challenges in
the educational system where

01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:02.880
youth are bullied and
the fact that, I believe,

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.200
30 some odd states don't
have nondiscrimination laws

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.990
for LGBT people.

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.072
You know, I think with all
those kind of challenges,

01:04:12.072 --> 01:04:15.500
being able to be
in a space watching

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.151
young people grow for two
years, kind of blossom

01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:18.817
into themselves.

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.210
One of my favorite
stories is a young person

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:29.930
who came into services, and very
beginning of their transition.

01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:33.650
Very isolated, very
disconnected from their family,

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:35.290
a lot of mental
health challenges.

01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:39.455
And through our work together,
really blossomed into her own.

01:04:39.455 --> 01:04:42.770
Finding her community, being
able to fully transition,

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:44.950
and be on the path.

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:48.030
Getting education
down, employment,

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:52.026
you know, stably
employed for one year.

01:04:52.026 --> 01:04:54.380
A lot can happen in two years.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:57.620
And so I think with the right
support, the right mentors,

01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:01.900
the right kind of folks
pushing or encouraging folks,

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.436
pushing for success, I think
that can make a huge impact.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:12.580
If I may add one
more story, I think

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:18.130
another aspect is-- there
was a quote that someone

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:23.745
had mentioned where like
trans-- and this one,

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:26.580
was it related to trans youth?

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:30.310
It was like,
trans-affirming services

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:34.610
can be a form of
suicide prevention.

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:39.040
And so looking at how we can
be culturally competent, how

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.850
we can be strong
allies, that can

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:45.920
be the solution to help kind
of ease things for folks.

01:05:48.504 --> 01:05:52.166
ERIK MARTINEZ: Yeah, I think
for me, a little bit of conflict

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:53.540
with this question
just because I

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.500
was raised by two
Mexican-Catholic parents.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.070
So humility.

01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:57.313
It's all about humility.

01:05:57.313 --> 01:05:58.120
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.610
So I'll try a little bit.

01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:02.380
So I think for me, I think
one of the daunting tasks

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:05.260
was being an LGBT programs
coordinator in a system

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.240
of about 60,000 kids.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.290
So what does impact mean?

01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:10.470
What does it mean
to change a system?

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.780
And I think I arrived
at a point where I was

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.050
like, I can't do it all alone.

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:16.140
I have to work with community.

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.530
So over the past two and a half
years, it's been really about,

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:22.929
how can I not just work
with kids individually,

01:06:22.929 --> 01:06:24.470
get them access to
services, but then

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:27.690
also make sure my community
is on board to support me

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:29.120
in this work?

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:34.430
In this last year, I was really
lucky to implement a program

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:38.120
where we provide
confidential LGBT support

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.650
groups across
multiple high schools

01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:45.980
where students who identify
can come in without stigma

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:49.420
and seek mentorship and
information from other queer

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.290
adults like them.

01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:53.890
And not just any queer adults,
but also queer adults of color.

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:57.410
So in creating that program and
kind of in advocating for it,

01:06:57.410 --> 01:07:00.904
I was unapologetic in
my ask to my colleagues,

01:07:00.904 --> 01:07:02.320
to our program
directors of, like,

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.420
if we're going to
do this right, we

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.180
need to have clear
POC staff on board.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:11.630
And it was challenging,
but we made it happen.

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:14.220
And this year, which
is our first full year

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:19.820
of implementation, we had
contact with about 75 queer POC

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:22.466
kids in our school
district, which

01:07:22.466 --> 01:07:23.590
to me is an accomplishment.

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:27.400
Because in the past, I think we
over-relied on extracurricular

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.830
clubs to catch kids.

01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:32.595
And what we found was there
were some kids in there,

01:07:32.595 --> 01:07:35.140
and we had a lot of
enthusiastic allies.

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.610
A lot of girls, which is great.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:40.390
But that's not always
the means in which

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.920
we can work with our kids
directly and go deeper.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:47.250
So I think the school
system has seen the need,

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:51.280
and I think have seen the
positive relationships that we

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.210
can have across generations.

01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:54.610
And so continue
to push for that,

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.920
and continue to push for
community to be involved,

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.975
and to infiltrate our
systems is very important.

01:08:00.975 --> 01:08:02.870
And I also want to
give a shout out.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:06.260
There's an audience member,
Dar Garcia over there,

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:08.420
who was one of my
infiltrators as well.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.860
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:16.220
PABLO RODRIGUEZ: So I'm kind
of feeling a little weird

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.556
about that question.

01:08:17.556 --> 01:08:18.055
Sorry.

01:08:18.055 --> 01:08:21.240
But-- well, actually not sorry.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.555
I feel a little weird,
because every time

01:08:25.555 --> 01:08:28.200
we talk about a lot of the
things that we were talking

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.740
might seem negative.

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.640
But I actually don't
see them as negative.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.770
I actually see them
as constructive.

01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:37.300
So it really depends out to
you how you want to take that.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.810
I see that very constructively,
all of the stories and things

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:42.260
that we're currently sharing.

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.460
And even if it's
negative, I feel

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:49.160
like society has created
this social amnesia where

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.010
we want to not really see that.

01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:54.355
We want to, like, pretend
that it's not there.

01:08:54.355 --> 01:08:59.297
And because we're talking about
it, it's opening that wound.

01:08:59.297 --> 01:09:01.130
All of the things that
we're currently doing

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:04.029
is, like, creating
a small Band-Aid

01:09:04.029 --> 01:09:09.430
on the bigger social challenges
that are currently happening.

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.970
So if you ever
feel a trigger, you

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:13.840
feel like a wound is
currently opened, it's OK.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.520
You know, it's OK if you
feel any type of feeling,

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.340
if you think it's too negative.

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.189
It's fine.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.779
It's totally fine.

01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:29.290
The positive is I'm embracing
right now that I'm alive.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.430
Just the fact that a
queer person of color

01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:35.870
is alive today, that's
a positive, actually.

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:37.850
And just think about that.

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:42.010
Just think about how the fact
that a queer person of color

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:44.830
is just breathing is
actually a positive thing.

01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:47.930
Because we were supposed to
be dead from colonization

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:49.529
500 years ago.

01:09:49.529 --> 01:09:54.069
500 years ago, my
two-spirit people

01:09:54.069 --> 01:09:56.830
were supposed to be
completely exterminated,

01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:58.370
but I'm still here.

01:09:58.370 --> 01:10:00.880
So the fact that I'm here,
it's like a positive.

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:07.660
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:09.729 --> 01:10:11.520
SPEAKER: So for all of
you that are working

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.050
on the ground with youth,
you have so much to give

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.200
and so much to offer,
but what is the one thing

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.340
that you would hope
that youth take away

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:24.802
after having some contact
with you through your work?

01:10:24.802 --> 01:10:26.510
ERIK MARTINEZ: I'll
keep it really short.

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:28.900
A moment of relief.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:32.230
I think being able to talk to
someone and maybe be authentic,

01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:35.330
and even in a second, can
be a life-saving moment,

01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:37.100
can bring at least
a moment of hope

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.290
or at least plant that seed.

01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:40.266
So to me, relief stands out.

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:46.529
STEPHANIE PERRON: I
think fierce love,

01:10:46.529 --> 01:10:48.320
that they know that
they're fiercely loved,

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.060
that they don't ever
have to silo off

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.820
any piece of their identity
to show up and be with us.

01:10:56.379 --> 01:10:58.420
ZAKIYA HARRIS: I would
just want them to remember

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.000
that they have the power.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.530
You have the power,
is what I would

01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:06.190
want them to be able to
hold in times of difficulty.

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:08.710
That everything that
they need is within them.

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.765
KATE CALIMQUIM: During
challenging bits,

01:11:15.765 --> 01:11:18.560
I tell folks, hey, we got you.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.816
Now let's get some work done.

01:11:25.585 --> 01:11:26.835
JOCELYN WONG: Oh, was that me?

01:11:26.835 --> 01:11:28.775
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:32.312
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:32.312 --> 01:11:33.700
JOCELYN WONG: Oh.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:34.500
This better?

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.000
Yeah.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.496
I really like
Zakiya's statement.

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:45.290
I guess with the youth
that I'm working with,

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:53.330
I want them to know that they're
their own answer for things,

01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:54.450
for whatever it is.

01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:58.337
Like, they can be the
best solution for whatever

01:11:58.337 --> 01:11:59.420
it is that they're facing.

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:04.720
PABLO RODRIGUEZ: So I also
work with youth, actually,

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.840
which is fun to do
because I'm also youth.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.000
And we actually
did this activity

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.560
before too where [INAUDIBLE]
we went around with, like,

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.150
which was the word
that came to their mind

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:22.510
when they first saw me?

01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:24.570
And they were like,
the colonization.

01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:26.410
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:27.480
And I'm like, yay.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.956
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:28.956 --> 01:12:30.740
So the colonization.

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.740
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.010
SPEAKER: Real talk.

01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:41.380
Any final questions?

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:44.130
So I think the question is,
how can companies like Google

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:46.760
and other tech
companies represent

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.360
the stories and the
identities of the people

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.480
who need that represented and
need to see more of themselves

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.795
within those spheres?

01:12:59.477 --> 01:13:02.060
ZAKIYA HARRIS: I think there are
two things that came to mind.

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.620
I think folks gotta work harder.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.310
I think that-- and we love
Google, and I love Google--

01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:10.950
but I think we have to go
beyond just a Google search.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.770
I think that their
stories are out there,

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:17.360
but you have to work a
lot harder to find them.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.620
And I think that even with
hiring, that's always the MO.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.880
We don't know anybody.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.807
You know, and it's
always like-- I

01:13:23.807 --> 01:13:25.890
feel like white privilege
always gets to say that.

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:27.370
We can't find enough people.

01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:28.710
We don't know anybody.

01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:30.220
We couldn't see the thing.

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:31.920
And it's like,
people of color never

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.836
have that privilege of
saying they don't know.

01:13:33.836 --> 01:13:35.990
Go to a job and tell
your boss you don't know,

01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:37.950
they'll find someone
else to do the job.

01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:40.750
But white privilege always
gets to say they don't know.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.160
And so I think the
stories are out there.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.820
There's tons of
stories out there.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:50.240
So how can companies
like Google work harder

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.730
to maybe move beyond just
the people that are trending

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:55.600
or the stories that
we get bombarded with?

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.100
Like you were saying that you
were reading all these stories

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.290
about Orlando.

01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:01.840
We get these dominant
messages that

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.870
are made the program of the
week until the new conversation,

01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:08.400
the new traumatic thing.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.860
And we can't just focus
on that narrative.

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.620
We have to seek
other narratives.

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:15.300
We have to seek other
sources of information.

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.780
We have to seek
other communities.

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.860
Like, we're all local.

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:19.100
We're all in your community.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.830
How many of you
guys knew about us

01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:22.090
before walking into this room?

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.370
And it's great that
this is a platform,

01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:27.430
but we can't just
become so complacent

01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:31.460
that we only give an
ear to what's easy

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.640
and what's easy to find.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:38.390
And so I think folks just have
to work a little bit harder

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:41.980
to lift up those stories and
to understand that sometimes

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:43.550
they're not going
to be as polished

01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:46.820
and not going to be as
savvy, and maybe you're

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.729
using a different language.

01:14:48.729 --> 01:14:50.520
Maybe you're speaking
with a different kind

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.840
of dialect and tone.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.090
They might dress
differently, hairstyles

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:59.260
might look-- we have to open
ourselves up to gaining wisdom

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:04.380
from people who maybe
don't personify, you know,

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.810
a cis white male
of what you know,

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:09.270
what a construction
of power looks like.

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:12.620
We have to kind of start
unpacking that a little bit.

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:13.798
So that's one thing.

01:15:13.798 --> 01:15:18.010
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:20.284 --> 01:15:21.700
JOCELYN WONG: Yeah,
on that too, I

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:28.116
think it might be
less in terms of,

01:15:28.116 --> 01:15:31.251
what algorithm can we write so
that different news stories can

01:15:31.251 --> 01:15:31.750
come up?

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.990
But I think a lot of
it is from internal.

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:38.330
Because if you have a very
specific demographic that's

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:41.840
running the show,
thinking about how

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:46.050
they can change to address
this other demographic,

01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:48.400
you might as well just
get the other demographic

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:54.930
to figure out how a company
could be run or function that

01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:55.810
would address them.

01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:57.910
Because, you know,
if you're going

01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:02.140
to have maybe like a straight,
white cis male that's

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:04.410
really affluent,
trying to figure out

01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:09.190
what we can do to help maybe
a queer person of color,

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:12.170
it's probably best to just ask
the queer person the color.

01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:14.840
Hire them, bring
them in, and then

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.290
the needs of that
community and the ideas

01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:18.915
and the solutions
of those people

01:16:18.915 --> 01:16:20.910
and those communities
are naturally

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:24.430
going to get infused into the
environment and the products

01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:26.940
and the services that a company
provides, because they're

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:29.610
the people that are
part of the company now,

01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:32.624
and they're making these things.

01:16:32.624 --> 01:16:34.550
So, yeah.

01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:37.060
To think about how a company
can better address stuff,

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:42.160
I think it really might be
really effective to just bring

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:47.476
those people in to the first
point of decision making.

01:16:47.476 --> 01:16:48.850
SPEAKER: For
everyone in the room

01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:52.480
that's come here to see
you guys speak and share

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.480
what you do, what can we do?

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.910
What's the one concrete thing
that we can do right now,

01:16:56.910 --> 01:17:01.216
go home and do to help
contribute to make change?

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:07.250
ERIK MARTINEZ: I think the first
thing that comes to my mind

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:11.130
is it's Pride Month.

01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:12.930
So right now is a
great opportunity

01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:15.910
to really get involved
in local communities.

01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:17.930
And I'm not talking
about pink party

01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:21.510
or whatever happens at
Civic Center or the parade.

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:24.010
I'm really thinking about
all those opportunities

01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:26.767
in which especially folks of
color and queer folks of color

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:27.850
are telling their stories.

01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:29.225
We're talking
about storytelling.

01:17:29.225 --> 01:17:31.216
We're talking about information.

01:17:31.216 --> 01:17:32.590
And all these
little local events

01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:33.840
are happening in the Mission.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.298
They're happening
in San Francisco.

01:17:35.298 --> 01:17:36.970
They're happening in Oakland.

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:38.110
Go.

01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:39.970
You know, patronize
those artists.

01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:41.920
Patronize that community.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.440
Give them your money.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.640
Really get a sense of
what's going on with them.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.910
Because they're telling
their stories now.

01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:49.880
They've been telling
their stories for years,

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.010
and especially
this month they're

01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:52.093
telling their stories now.

01:17:52.093 --> 01:17:53.640
So really seek
those opportunities

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.380
to engage community, to
think about ways in which you

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.060
can help local artists,
local community,

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.190
and really get involved.

01:18:00.190 --> 01:18:02.970
I mean, the time is now.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:05.100
ZAKIYA HARRIS: I would
say educate yourself.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.790
Be a lifelong student.

01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:13.181
I'm always trying to learn more
information about everything,

01:18:13.181 --> 01:18:13.680
pretty much.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.721
I'm a student of history.

01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:17.990
I think history informs
so much of the present.

01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:20.540
I think you did a great job
of really framing that for us,

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.880
that so much of this
has just been going on.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:27.090
And I think when you're informed
from a place of history,

01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:30.510
you have more
perspective and insight

01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:33.420
on how to address the future.

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.890
So I think education.

01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:37.090
And I think just
starting really small

01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:39.800
and starting with yourself.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.370
Like, Google's
made up of people.

01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:42.200
You're a person.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.800
So start with yourself.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.726
I think sometimes, again,
we're always going outside.

01:18:46.726 --> 01:18:48.100
How can the company
do something?

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.880
Well, how can I do something?

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.340
And what am I doing every day?

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:55.080
And how am I making
that something

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.630
that happens during Pride
Month, but something

01:18:57.630 --> 01:18:58.767
that's a lifestyle?

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:01.100
Because that's what we're
always trying to really engage

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:01.990
our young people on.

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:05.240
We're really trying to
disrupt the status quo

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.900
and get them on a new track
so they can kind of have

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.830
a different context for life.

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:15.330
And I think that everybody
needs to be part of that shift.

01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:18.840
So how can we start thinking
about every single thing we

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.610
do, from the clothes
that we're wearing,

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:23.640
to the way that we're engaging
the people that we live in

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.290
and the communities
that we live in,

01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:26.930
and where we're
spending our dollars,

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:28.520
and the groups that
we're coming to,

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.580
and the friends
that we engage with,

01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:33.410
and the conversations that we're
having and and the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:36.470
Every single part of
life is an opportunity

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:37.960
to really be that change.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.880
And I think that
the more we start

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.740
thinking about our
lives that way,

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:45.080
we then become the catalyst
for change as a collective

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.275
and as a global community.

01:19:47.275 --> 01:19:48.900
STEPHANIE PERRON:
There's this question

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.400
that we always ask ourselves
and center our work around.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.769
We say, how do we show
fierce love for ourselves

01:19:53.769 --> 01:19:54.685
and for our community?

01:19:54.685 --> 01:19:56.320
And so I think I
would maybe leave you

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.750
with that question for you
to reflect on for yourself.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:01.580
And I think I would
also say that-- I mean,

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:03.880
I'm a person who really
believes that relationships

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.382
are at the heart of everything.

01:20:06.382 --> 01:20:07.840
We have to connect
with one another

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.381
and build community
with one another.

01:20:09.381 --> 01:20:12.140
So my earlier
invitation still stands

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.360
that we have a monthly
intergenerational community

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.070
dinner, potluck
style, at Our Space.

01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:19.780
And I think if you want,
you can come and start

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:23.010
building community with
young people there.

01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:23.929
Or in other places.

01:20:23.929 --> 01:20:25.220
Everybody's doing amazing work.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.510
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.320
JOCELYN WONG: All right.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:38.700
Yeah, I think definitely
starting personally

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:43.294
is probably, I
think, the best way

01:20:43.294 --> 01:20:44.960
if you want to take
some sort of action,

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.280
really reflecting on yourself
and your own privileges.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:53.520
And you know, if you have a
certain number-- this, like,

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.310
bucket of privilege
that you have,

01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:59.130
how do you want to use that?

01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:05.170
And how do you want to
spend that privilege?

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:08.940
You can just go out and
party, have a great time,

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:11.210
enjoy a really nice life.

01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:14.510
But you can sacrifice
some time or energy.

01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:16.856
Writing a check's really great.

01:21:16.856 --> 01:21:18.810
I'm sure any of
the organizations

01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:19.930
wouldn't mind a check.

01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:23.570
But there's something that can
go a lot more, which is like

01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:27.070
if you volunteer
with youth or get

01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:29.580
involved with an organization,
provide services.

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:32.920
Like even just your technical
skills that an organization

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.190
might need to pay
somebody for, and they

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:38.230
can't afford to pay
somebody for that position.

01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:41.410
You come in and providing,
like, operations

01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:46.312
or some sort of
systems admin skill,

01:21:46.312 --> 01:21:48.020
something that you're
already doing maybe

01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.300
here at your own job,
and just providing

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:54.030
that in another context where
maybe you're spending time

01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:56.720
and you're not
getting paid for it.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.110
It might be in an environment
that's not really cush.

01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:04.650
But getting uncomfortable and
giving a little sacrifice.

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:08.450
Like, there's a lot of
people under oppression that

01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:13.790
are constantly uncomfortable
and spending time that's

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:16.582
unnecessary on just
daily acts of living.

01:22:16.582 --> 01:22:18.540
And if we're lucky enough
and privileged enough

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:22.440
to not have to be uncomfortable
in our work environment,

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:26.100
in society, and we're not
spending time and money just

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:32.290
trying to get our daily
lives done, I mean,

01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:35.120
that's really lucky for us to
not have to deal with that.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.960
So I think getting
uncomfortable and being

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.320
willing to make sacrifices
that some people are doing

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:45.220
on the regular because they have
to, that's definitely a way,

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:48.867
I think, to get involved more.

01:22:48.867 --> 01:22:50.950
ZAKIYA HARRIS: I wanted
to add a little something.

01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:53.870
Any parents in the room?

01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:54.520
Oh my God.

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.530
You're so young.

01:22:56.530 --> 01:22:57.500
I'm a parent too.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.410
There's three of us.

01:22:58.410 --> 01:22:59.110
That's awesome.

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:01.410
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:06.460
But you know, aunties,
uncles in the room?

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.430
OK, yeah.

01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:08.560
Nieces and nephews.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.640
Hopefully you're connected
to some young people,

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.770
whether they identify
as queer or not.

01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:15.949
I think to some extent,
we're getting older,

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:17.240
we've got work to do as adults.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.670
But sometimes I
look at the adults

01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:20.920
and I'm just kind of
like, all is lost.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.340
Let's focus on the
young-- I'm joking.

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.190
I'm joking.

01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:26.600
But you know, let's really
focus on the young people.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:29.420
I think we forget
that sometimes,

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.870
that we have young
people in our families,

01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:34.872
in our lives that
we're around, and we

01:23:34.872 --> 01:23:36.330
have to make sure
that we're really

01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:41.310
training them and educating
them to be the type of adults

01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:44.290
that we want to have to
really be global citizens.

01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:45.790
And I don't say that lightly.

01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:48.950
I mean, there's young
people who don't even

01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:52.050
know how to speak to someone
when they walk into the room.

01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:54.870
Or do they know how to
acknowledge difference?

01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:57.850
Do they understand
the same conversations

01:23:57.850 --> 01:23:58.600
that we're having?

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.760
Like, how can we
really also work

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.910
with young people who
are really the future?

01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:04.997
Because they're the
ones that are building.

01:24:04.997 --> 01:24:06.330
And They're not even the future.

01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:07.367
They're the now, right?

01:24:07.367 --> 01:24:08.950
They're the ones
that are really going

01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:13.460
to be inheriting all these
problems on the planet.

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.500
And so we have to make
sure that we're really

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.300
empowering the next
generation of young people

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:20.970
who maybe don't have
all these barriers to be

01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:22.790
able to be at the
table with folks that

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:24.650
do have the barriers,
because that's

01:24:24.650 --> 01:24:26.550
kind of where the
work really-- where

01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:28.250
the rubber meets the road.

01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.850
I think there's a
lot of work that we

01:24:29.850 --> 01:24:32.200
need to do in that arena.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:38.710
San Francisco has less children
than any other major city

01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:39.290
in America.

01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:41.680
It has the smallest
population of children.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.840
It also has the greatest
disparity economically.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.220
So some of the richest
children in America

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:51.250
live in San Francisco, and
some of the poorest children

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:52.610
live in San Francisco.

01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:54.970
And the majority of the
folks that are maybe

01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:56.820
on the lower side of
the economic spectrum

01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:58.270
are folks of color.

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:00.260
There's also more dogs
here than children,

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.570
which is very interesting.

01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:06.370
But I mean, that also speaks
a lot to the culture, right?

01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:10.270
So I mean, again, how are we
really empowering young people

01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:12.900
and really making sure
that they are trained up

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.400
to navigate this world?

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.965
PABLO RODRIGUEZ:
I have two dogs.

01:25:18.965 --> 01:25:21.755
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:27.020
So again, I agree
with everything

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:28.050
that was said before.

01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:31.340
So I think that it should
start from the inside,

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:32.760
so you're starting
with yourself.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.410
But I just want to share this.

01:25:34.410 --> 01:25:38.115
I'm not going to say names,
but I was hanging out

01:25:38.115 --> 01:25:40.220
with one of my friends
on 24th Street,

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.800
and she said, oh,
one of my friends

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.180
is coming over just
to hang with us too.

01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:45.261
And I was like, oh, fine.

01:25:45.261 --> 01:25:45.760
Great.

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.190
Cool.

01:25:47.190 --> 01:25:49.340
Whatever.

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:52.690
But before the friend
came with us, I asked her,

01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:54.820
so is she white?

01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:55.926
And she said, yes.

01:25:55.926 --> 01:25:57.050
And I was like, is she new?

01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:58.160
And she was like, yeah.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.743
She's been living
here for two months.

01:25:59.743 --> 01:26:02.090
And I'm like, OK.

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:07.090
We meet, and I was
carrying some feathers.

01:26:07.090 --> 01:26:09.210
And she says, what is that?

01:26:09.210 --> 01:26:11.610
And I said, oh, you know,
I'm [INAUDIBLE] dancer.

01:26:11.610 --> 01:26:12.830
And she says, wait.

01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:13.450
What is that?

01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:15.330
And I'm like, uh,
well, I'm usually

01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:17.377
dancing at 24 and Mission.

01:26:17.377 --> 01:26:18.960
And then I ask her,
where do you live?

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.410
And she says, 24 and Mission.

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:26.340
And I'm like-- can
I drop the mic?

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:28.970
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:30.600
She says, 24 and Mission.

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.120
And I looked at
her and I said, oh.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.400
Interesting.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.390
So engage.

01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:41.110
I just want to say that.

01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:44.010
Like, 24 and Mission
and she hasn't even

01:26:44.010 --> 01:26:49.480
seen the fact that I've been
there dancing for a long time.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.280
And it's just crazy.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.580
So when you stand
anywhere you are,

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:56.160
try to acknowledge yourselves.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.534
Try to acknowledge the
people that are around you.

01:27:00.534 --> 01:27:01.700
Even if you don't know them.

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:02.590
You don't have to say hi.

01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:03.798
You don't even have to smile.

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:10.320
If you're one of those
persons that walk really fast,

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.190
try to walk slower.

01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:14.590
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:16.091 --> 01:27:18.132
SPEAKER: Thank you so
much, everyone, for coming.

01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:22.398
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.680
Just my last words.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.610
Your work is life changing,
and in a lot of ways,

01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:34.740
it's life saving.

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.890
And I don't exaggerate there.

01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:40.360
So really, to be on
the ground, working

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.610
with all of these youth
in desperate situations

01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:45.850
and youth that are
seeing them thrive

01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:48.500
and seeing them come
through that, it's amazing.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.500
And every day is hard.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.260
So thank you.

01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:52.910
Thanks again.

01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.800
So one more round
of applause, please.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.400
Thank you.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:59.345
[APPLAUSE]
