00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.100
Everyone agrees that education is hugely important

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.460
The thing is we're not particularly sure what we want from it

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.900
The aim of education should be to prepare us for the challenges of adult life

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.440
Yet from this perspective it's clear that schools fail all but for tiny portions of their students

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.820
Whether in highly academic private schools

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.400
Or in deprived government-run ones trouble-dealing with life's challenges

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.920
remains very wide spread indeed

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.940
Human ingenuity, energy, goodwill, and talent

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.860
is being lost on an industrial scale

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.020
to get more ambitious about education doesn't necessarily mean spending more money

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.340
building more schools, employing more teachers or making exams more difficult

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.340
Rather, it should mean focusing more on the real purpose of education

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.980
There are two fundamental tasks it should help us with: working and sustaining good relationships

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.720
In order to address these needs a future national curriculum might specify

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.780
that the following subjects be studied

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.800
Firstly, capitalism

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.120
A conspiracy of silence exists around the economic system we live within

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.020
We find it hard to change its bad sides or defend its strengths

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.840
because we simply don't fully understand how it works

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.840
A subject like maths should be geared to teach its number one utility for 99% of the population

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.480
dealing with money

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.980
Such classes would demistify the global economy

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.060
by teaching students the importance of the means of production and how profits are made

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.720
The role of cashflow, HR leadership, marketing, and competition would also be studied

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.440
In a perfect school system you'd also then study a really big second subject

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.600
yourself

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.240
Young students would be introduced to the idea that we humans

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.800
are extremely prone to misunderstanding ourselves

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.220
They would be taken through the concepts of delusion, defensiveness

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.740
projection and denial in everyday life

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.560
Individual tutors would be on hand to help students towards personality maps

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.220
with particular attention paid to their neurosis and fears

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.900
Doing this would ensure that students learn a lot

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
about how complex they truly are

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.040
and what types of people they would be best suited to hang out with

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.260
A crucial unit would be devoted to career self-knowledge

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760
What job are you best suited to?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960
Students would spend three hours a week

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100
exploring what they might do with their futures

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
Then we would sutdy relationships

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.360
Being intensely aware of the social and individual cost of every unhappy relationship

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.560
An ideal education system would emphasize

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.560
the acquisition of skills that help people

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.200
to live better together

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.700
There would be units on kindness and forgiveness

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.700
as well as on anxiety-reduction techniques

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.840
In this educational utopia it wouln't only be children who would go to school

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.340
but adults as well

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Schooling would be for life

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.020
Education wouldn't just be taking place in classrooms

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.780
media and the arts would be made to maximize their teaching potential

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.320
and help to teach people what they actually need to learn

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.140
We're so hung up on the challenges of running a massive education system

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.980
we're failing to pinpoint the real source of its problems

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.580
These are primarily about money, salaries or discipline

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.280
These are only a consequence of a more fundamental problem

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.420
Right now and with no-one quite meaning for this to happen

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.340
we've simply got the wrong curriculum
