[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:07.350
DUKE DUKELLIS: All right.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.299
Hello, everybody.

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.590
Welcome to Google I/O. Thank
you for coming all the way

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.110
out here.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.776
I know we're in the
furthest booth here,

00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:18.030
but it's a beautiful day.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.370
Really excited to have
you all here at I/O.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.610
And it's just incredible to
see how much apps have really

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.300
taken off.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.980
And the functionality you guys
are delivering in your apps.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.140
There's no question
apps have become

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.739
an essential part of
everybody's daily lives now,

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.030
and that's really great to see.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.130
And something my team
is really, really happy

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.960
about is we get to be here with
you helping you succeed here.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.950
And we know this because we're
excited, we see this number--

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.180
we're in a million apps
across Android and iOS--

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.220
and it's just very exciting for
us to see this kind of usage.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.190
So here's another number
we're really, really proud of.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.310
We've paid out over
$3.5 billion dollars

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.950
to app developers in ad revenue.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.379
And we're just going to keep
investing in this platform.

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.920
We're going to make
this number grow,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.440
and grow, and continue to grow.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.420
So at Google, we want to
help you develop your apps,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.960
grow your users, and earn.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.480
And today, we're going to focus
here on Earn because that's

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.850
where AdMob can really help make
a difference in your business.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.760
And for some of you,
in-app purchasing

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.380
is something that works
really well for monetization.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.110
But we know that for most apps,
most users are not paying.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.840
And most apps are
free downloads.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.530
And so that means advertising
is an essential part

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.000
for a lot of you.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.410
So it's really our mission
here to really make the best ad

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.930
experiences, and to help
developers succeed as much

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.390
as possible by
delivering those great ad

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.130
experiences to your users.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.170
So these are questions that
we wake up with every day.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.731
We're always
thinking about this.

00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.480
Sometimes these questions
actually keep us

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.900
up very, very late at night.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.480
Things like, is there a better
way to match ads to users?

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.910
Is portrait, which we
see more and more--

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.160
is that the new horizontal?

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.540
Or how do we manage a bunch of
these regional networks that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.040
are coming up and
providing the--

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.440
how do I manage all
of them when I'm just

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.180
either a small
developing shop, or how

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.920
do I use less engineers in
these large, large developers?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.670
And these questions,
they're pretty important.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.110
They really do
keep us up at night

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.700
because the thing is,
advertising is really about

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.070
more than just making money.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.010
Advertising, we
truly believe, is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.180
what powers the free
and open internet.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.910
So if we get that right, we'll
enable more and more apps

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.830
to proliferate and
help you be successful.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.860
Now, we know that a very,
very small, small percentage

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.740
of apps, when they're
downloaded, are paid for.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.949
And that means that
most of the apps

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:14.490
that you guys are
building right now?

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.200
They're probably free.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.370
Or freemium.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.300
Somewhere in that area.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.420
And as users, I
mean, I love that.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.460
You probably love that.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.293
I bet if you pulled out
your phone right now

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:28.260
and you looked at all of your
apps, I bet almost all of them

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.880
are probably free.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.710
And that's great for you,
and you, and you, and me

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.370
because we're getting a
lot of value for free.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.840
But here's the challenge.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.120
If you switch to
our developer hats,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.907
that statistic doesn't
look so good, right?

00:03:44.907 --> 00:03:46.240
And that's really the challenge.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.540
So the thing that we're
thinking about here

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.430
is how can we help
you get more paid

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.510
downloads, if that's the part
you're in, and at the same time

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.180
how can we work
on that other 95%

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.760
of users who don't pay
for your apps in general?

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.030
And how can we make money off
of advertising for that group?

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.640
How can we do both
at the same time?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.430
So that's something that's
front and center in our minds.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.190
So here's one solution to
this that we've been investing

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.070
quite a bit in lately.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.360
This is a rewarded
video ad, and this

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.830
is something we launched on
our platform about a year ago.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.650
And we worked with a
number of other partners.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.635
And just in March,
at GDC, we announced

00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:32.510
that we're going to
start serving ads as well

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.680
from the Google Ad network.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.900
And so this is zeptolab's
Crash Arena Turbostars.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.340
So if you haven't played
this game, it's a lot of fun.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.690
You get to be one of these cars.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.148
You design your car and you go
to battle with someone else,

00:04:45.148 --> 00:04:47.420
and you get to have
these constant battles.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.840
Now, in this game you
want to have a great car.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.040
And to make a great
car, you need parts.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.910
And to get parts,
they come in crates.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.100
And to get crates,
you earn these crates.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.540
But when you earn these crates--

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.660
you see that timer.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.840
I've got to wait two hours
for my crate to open.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.500
Now, in this case I can either
open it right now by using some

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.190
gems-- now, gems cost money,
so that's the IAP side--

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.800
or I can accelerate
that and I can

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.530
skip 30 minutes of that wait
time by watching a video.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.700
I think I watched probably
24 of these yesterday, or 20.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.100
It helped me move through
the timer very quickly.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.076
So then I can go ahead
and get my parts.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:27.950
So let's go ahead and
click that skip button.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.991
And this is what happens.

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:30.610
So we see a video here.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.100
We see the timer is
on the upper right.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.080
Usually, it's about
a 30-second video.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.170
There's an end card here
that we saw right at the end.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.210
There's a call to
action on the bottom.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.890
And we're seeing really good
user engagement with these ads.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.210
Now, maybe I click,
maybe I don't click,

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.450
but either way I'm pretty
happy because I just

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.890
took 30 minutes off the clock.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.730
I feel like I got value out of
this ad, so that's good for me.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.570
And I'm leaving this feeling
happy and more engaged.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.170
We move on from there, I get
my 30 minutes, and we go on.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.060
So here's the thing.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.890
This isn't just about ad revenue
because the developer is making

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.320
money off of this,
but every time I

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.390
watch a video I'm
getting a little bit more

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.260
invested in this game.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.310
And that might
drive me ultimately

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.460
to be more likely to
make in-app purchases.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.480
So here we've done
something very interesting.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.730
We've balanced--
not even balanced--

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.670
we've gotten the best
of both worlds where

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.840
we've gotten some ad revenue
as well as more engaged users.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.420
And zeptolab introduced this.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.810
Once they introduced
our Google demand here,

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.530
they saw AdMob revenue
go up by 3x in their app.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.590
That's an awesome stat to see,
and we're seeing more and more.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.360
A lot of these developers who
were strictly in-app purchasing

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.500
are now using these kinds
of strategic formats

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.380
because it's helping both
the engagement as well

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.887
as the in-app purchasing.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.780
Right.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.960
Now, the bulk of
these downloads--

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.400
we know they're free.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.130
And like I said, it's a very,
very small number at the top.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.690
There is also a
group down below that

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.384
are sort of business
supportive apps

00:07:11.384 --> 00:07:13.050
and so forth that
don't charge anything.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.270
But the bulk of
downloads we see today,

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.370
they're free or freemium.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.200
And this is really about--

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.470
what we're seeing is it's a
high, high focus on developer

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.950
experience.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.530
And advertising
maybe historically

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.830
was a little less focused on UX.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.900
So we've got to find a
way to bring those two

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.840
things together.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.173
And one of the ways we're
doing that is with native ads.

00:07:34.173 --> 00:07:39.040
So here we're seeing Perfect
Corporation's YouCam Perfect

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.780
app.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.140
This is an app that's had well
over 50 million downloads.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.700
So it's a pretty impressive app.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.200
And you'll see the button here
on the left for the camera.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.766
The next button over, you
can edit your cameras.

00:07:51.766 --> 00:07:53.640
Make myself look a little
bit more beautiful.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.590
Can't get enough of that.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.180
Then we also see a collage.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.580
And then if you go and see
the lower left larger button--

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.300
what they've done is they've
taken a relevant app ad

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.710
and they placed it right
inside their experience.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.230
So it doesn't really
destroy the experience.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.120
And a lot of these
developers are looking

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.810
for something that's seamless.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.190
It just fits in well.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.290
It matches the font.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.960
It matches the colors.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.980
Et cetera.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.850
And so you can expect to see
a lot more of these native ads

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.450
as we continue to drive into
the better UX experience going

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:27.950
forward.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.039
So we've also been working
on some very interesting

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.600
innovations in video.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.289
So one thing we've
done is we took

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:44.400
a huge supply of these
horizontal videos

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.239
that advertisers have really
provided us over the years,

00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:48.780
because a lot of
these advertisements

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.750
originally came from
the desktop site.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.340
And those assets
are all in place.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.630
Now, we've said, gosh, a lot of
apps now are actually portrait.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.329
We'd love to see these
in portrait mode.

00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:00.870
But we don't want
the small portrait.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.520
We want the big portrait.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.070
Because we know if we
put big portrait there,

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.269
the user engagement is higher.

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:09.810
So we put our machines to work,
and through some really fancy

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.393
machine learning we've managed
to take these horizontal videos

00:09:12.393 --> 00:09:17.160
that automatically convert
them from horizontal right

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.200
over into portrait.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.885
And that means better user
engagement, better CPMS--

00:09:21.885 --> 00:09:24.000
so better all the way around.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.580
We've also found a way to
reduce a lot of these videos

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.510
from 30 seconds automatically,
again through machine learning,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.780
down to the seven-second shorts.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.110
And that means we can produce
and show a lot of these videos

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.630
in smaller places,
and other places.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.120
For example, a third area
where we've been working

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.740
has been on cellular networks.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.860
Now, a lot of your users,
when they're using your games

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.262
they're on cellular networks.

00:09:48.262 --> 00:09:50.220
Now, you might want to
show them some video ads

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.280
because the engagement
is pretty high.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.950
But over cellular networks,
that's always been pretty hard.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.820
So we found some
tricky innovations here

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.720
where we can deliver these
videos while the user is

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.030
on a cellular network.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.560
And that really
improves the number

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.810
of users that are
seeing these great ads.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.530
And so as we see smartphones
just continue to proliferate,

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.630
and as we see internet
coverage continue

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.760
to just grow and grow and
get cheaper and cheaper,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.850
we can expect to see a lot
more videos and a lot more

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.840
innovations in
this video format.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.000
Let's not forget about staples.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.600
Banners and interstitials.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.752
So on interstitials,
one thing we've

00:10:32.752 --> 00:10:34.710
introduced here in
innovation, and we announced

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.200
it last March, is playables.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.650
So these are fun,
interactive ads

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.990
that go right into
an interstitial space

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.200
so the developer doesn't
have to do anything.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.304
But we see the engagement on
these is really, really high.

00:10:49.304 --> 00:10:50.970
And that's really
good for the developer

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.890
because it makes you more money.

00:10:56.601 --> 00:10:57.100
All right.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:01.850
So if you were a developer
and you're doing pretty well--

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.600
and I have this
conversation a lot.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.870
We've done so well in
these mature markets,

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.240
but what do we do now?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.000
We're not seeing
a lot of growth.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.410
How do we go about it?

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.920
Well, if I told you if you
took a look at the top 1,000

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.780
ad-grossing apps that use
our platform, 95% of them

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.220
are live in more
than 200 markets.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.420
So that's a lot.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.510
It's a higher number
than I had expected,

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.290
but it sort of speaks to it.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.570
And if you go further than that,
out of all of their revenue

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.840
85% of it is not from
their home country.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.810
If you remember, apps in the
early days, when we released--

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.320
we released to or home country
or maybe some countries where

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.800
it's the same language--

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.490
but now it's really
just gone global.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.130
So there's one
simple answer I have

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.800
to these conversations, which
is if you want to increase

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.020
and maximize your revenue,
a very simple thing

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.670
you can do here is go global.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.980
Go global quickly.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.540
And if you go with
the right partner

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.180
on this, someone who's
got global reach,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.560
they can help you.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.440
Now, if we think about this
even further into the future--

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.210
in the not-too-distant future--

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.430
the next billion
users that are coming

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.980
online with smartphones-- do you
know where they're coming from?

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:23.990
They're coming from
unsaturated emerging markets.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.550
So the good news in there
is the cost of acquisition

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.580
we see in mature markets
versus these emerging markets

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.840
is very different.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.060
So a much lower cost
of acquisition if you

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.870
partner with the right partner.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.890
And also, in a lot
of these markets

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.410
you probably would
expect that advertising

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.870
is going to play a
more important part

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.100
than in-app purchases.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.040
Not for all of them.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.020
We see some skew
across countries.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.200
But for most of these
markets, advertising

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.120
will be increasingly important.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.880
So what does it all mean?

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.920
It means that if you
aren't releasing globally,

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.190
you're leaving serious
money on the table.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.310
It also means there's a
whole new level of complexity

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.110
to your advertising strategy.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.350
I mean, can you imagine having
to go country by country,

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.980
finding ad networks that
fit just that country,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.510
and lining that up with
not just one of your apps

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.370
but all of your
apps, and managing

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.280
that across different formats
where some networks serve

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.360
some formats but not others.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.030
So this could get really
complicated really,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.230
really quickly.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.770
So there's got to be
an easy way to handle

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.190
all of this complexity.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.150
And this is what we've
been working on at AdMob.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.970
We're trying to solve these
global developer challenges.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.322
And when we say global,
we really mean global.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.405
So for one thing-- because
we're a single platform

00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:48.376
and we're live in more than 200
countries, with a single click

00:13:48.376 --> 00:13:50.750
we can push out to all of
these countries simultaneously.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.080
So that's great.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.420
We also have some very
big announcements today--

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.160
I should say yesterday--

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.950
around how to manage this
complexity in a simple way

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.640
across both the developer
experience as well as mediation

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.280
groups.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:06.780
All right.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.180
So one of my favorite
things about this job

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.415
is I get to go out
and talk to developers

00:14:12.415 --> 00:14:14.040
and learn from
developers all the time.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.915
I've probably talked to
hundreds and hundreds

00:14:15.915 --> 00:14:17.850
over the last couple of
months, and my team's

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.640
talked to several thousand
in the last 12 months.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.260
Like actual conversations.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.880
And this is great.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.755
We get a lot of feedback, and
it's all positive, I promise.

00:14:27.755 --> 00:14:29.130
So we're listening
and listening.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.876
What can we do better?

00:14:30.876 --> 00:14:32.250
What are your
biggest challenges?

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.090
What can we do to help
you earn more money?

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.330
That's what we're focused on.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.860
And we really bucket those
things into three main areas.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.880
The first main
area is around just

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.970
let's make it dead simple to get
started, to get up and running,

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.095
and to manage this
across the globe.

00:14:50.095 --> 00:14:51.720
When I'm talking
about that one button.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.820
It works globally.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.920
Help me on that.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.420
The second area is
really around scale.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.510
OK, so I had one app.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.670
And now I need to
get more specialized.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.930
Maybe different areas.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.870
Maybe I've got 100 apps
now, or 50, or even 10

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.130
is hard to manage.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.160
So help me on this scale
problem that I've got.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.900
And the third area is, hey,
I've got a lot of data now.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.850
And Google, you've
got a lot of data too.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.380
So can we maybe put these things
together and help me optimize?

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.300
Lets make even more
revenue because we've

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.370
got the data to do it.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:30.110
But it's hard and there's a lot
of logistics around that data

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.780
and so forth.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.880
So let's work on optimize.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.870
So let's walk through
these three areas.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.370
All right.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.970
So the first area
is really monetize.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.670
And this is always the first
priority the developer has.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.160
Let's get in there, let's get
started, and let's get going.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.490
And it's the first part
you need to lock down.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.430
So the good news here--

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.850
when we think about
monetize, what

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.016
can we do in the background?

00:15:52.016 --> 00:15:53.980
Things that you don't
have to worry about.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.884
Well, we've got a lot
of global advertisers.

00:15:55.884 --> 00:15:57.300
And that's good
because that means

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.966
if you want to go to
a lot of countries,

00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:01.540
you need a network that
reaches a lot of countries.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.870
So you need these
global advertisers.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.240
And I already mentioned
we have a million apps,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.410
but here's why that matters.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.350
It's because over
on the right side,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.400
you see there's at least
1.3 billion unique user

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.020
devices that we know about.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.235
We know things about them.

00:16:17.235 --> 00:16:19.110
So that means when we're
trying to figure out

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:24.099
which ad to serve to
that particular moment,

00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:25.890
we're good at it, and
we're getting better,

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.080
and we're constantly
learning from that.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.300
And that means you
can get higher CPMs.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.210
It means the advertisers are
targeting exactly the people

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.710
they want to advertise.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.440
So that connection there
is really a win/win

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.439
for advertisers and developers.

00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:40.980
And we're just going
to keep pressing

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.790
that as hard as we can.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.372
And that's a great baseline.

00:16:44.372 --> 00:16:46.080
But there's a lot more
we can improve on,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.890
and this is where we really
put on our listening ears.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.470
These are things that we heard.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.270
Can we make simpler onboarding?

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.830
Maybe progressive signup?

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.900
And can you show me where
the documentation is earlier

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.910
or easier in the process?

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.829
Things are still
reasonably complicated.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.920
This is tech, and
it's fast-moving.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.970
Format coverage.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.369
I talked a little bit
about native and rewarded.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.290
Can you keep pressing those
around native rewarded video,

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:15.790
especially?

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.220
I just want to see
more and more of that.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.480
And can you simplify adding
a creation even more,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.520
and make testing easy?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.280
I want to see exactly
what I've got.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.050
And the thing we
heard the most here

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.830
was really about
faster access and, can

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.294
you quickly show me
how well I'm doing?

00:17:36.294 --> 00:17:37.960
I want to see how
much money I'm making.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.209
I want to see if I'm missing,
if I'm not missing, etc.

00:17:40.209 --> 00:17:43.810
Just can you do that really
quickly all in one place?

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.060
So these are the main things
that we heard, so we went

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.494
right to work on this stuff.

00:17:48.494 --> 00:17:50.660
So this is what we've been
doing the last 12 months.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.200
So introducing AdMob Beta.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.780
Yesterday we went live
with this in the afternoon.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.830
We announced it.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.970
This is an entirely new
user experience for you.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.270
We took a hard, hard look
at the developer journey

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.100
and we figured out
through there what can

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.700
we do to make this
as easy as possible.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.740
And yes, you can go
to AdMob right now

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.350
and sign up and go
through this experience

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.360
because it is, in fact, live.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.160
All right.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.080
So why don't you
come on up, Ali?

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.000
And we're going to
go to a live demo.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.850
So that means I'm
slightly nervous.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.570
All right.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:40.480
So here we are on AdMob.com,
and we're looking at--

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.910
this is Red Hot Labs.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.420
And they're using the
new AdMob experience

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.310
for their game Bingo Blast.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:53.220
Now, Bingo Blast has
about a million downloads,

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.340
30,000 five-star ratings, it's
available in the iOS store as

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.485
well as Google Play Store, and
it's a simple app that uses IP.

00:19:02.485 --> 00:19:05.900
It also uses an interstitial.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.460
OK.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.376
So the first thing you're
going to notice here

00:19:08.376 --> 00:19:10.130
is this gray bar across the top.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.930
All right.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.164
Now, this is the all-in-one
immediately how am I doing?

00:19:14.164 --> 00:19:15.330
Just give it to me straight.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.830
And we can see from this
that in the last 28 days,

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:22.060
over on the right you see
they made about $1,250.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.820
So that's pretty good.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.084
And let's see.

00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:28.750
Now fortunately, let's
say we're looking

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.080
at how's our fill rate doing.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:30.830
This is important.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.930
I want to know.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:32.800
I've got inventory.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.090
Are you serving ads into them?

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.350
So we're seeing about
99.4% fill rate.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.029
That's pretty darn good.

00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:41.570
Definitely higher
than most industry.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:46.360
And you also see this
ECPM is around $19.33.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.490
That's also looking pretty good.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.480
So we've got a pretty
nice looking app here.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.260
It's going on.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.180
Now, this is a pretty
simple account,

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.680
and if you were
just getting started

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.820
this is the kind of thing
that you'd probably see.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.050
You get going.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.290
So why don't we switch
over to something

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:06.310
that, as you're growing,
would be a slightly more

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.330
sophisticated account.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.870
So here we're looking at
the Lab Pixie's account.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:15.630
All right.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:19.830
So they're based in Israel, as
you can see from the currency.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.020
And they've got dozens of
apps in the Google Play

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.090
Store and the App Store.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.740
So you see this dashboard here.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.140
Now, for them this is
a nice unified view

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.740
as well because they're able
to collapse a lot of apps

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.160
all into one place.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.690
And you're going to see, as
you have more and more apps,

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:43.270
AdMob becomes more and
more powerful for you.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.610
And you're going to see
these dashboard cards.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.650
See these cards over
here on the right.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.140
As you use more features,
more of these cards

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.250
start to appear--

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.870
cards that are relevant
to what you're doing.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.360
Now, Lab Pixies-- they use
some of their older apps--

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.155
so you can see across
the bottom here.

00:20:58.155 --> 00:20:59.530
They use some of
their older apps

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.090
to test out some of
these new ad formats

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.951
and different experiments.

00:21:04.951 --> 00:21:06.700
Some of them-- their
tests-- maybe they're

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.540
not doing as well as we saw
in the Bingo Blast slide.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.370
We also, if you just look at the
stats on this performance side,

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.640
you see, OK, our match
rate-- yeah, that's

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.010
not exactly the same.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.380
I wonder what's going on here.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.800
So that's a little
bit different.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.710
The CPMs are quite a
bit different than we

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.830
saw on Bingo Blast.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:30.400
And then over on the right,
we're using mediation.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.004
And here's one
space where you can

00:21:32.004 --> 00:21:33.670
see all of the different
mediation we're

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:37.950
using all in a single place,
how they're each performing--

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.680
again, all in one place.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.860
And right now, let's go
back to this bottom left.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.950
So right now we see
our top performers here

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.640
are Color Drips and Flood It.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.980
And there's also
this selector here.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.030
So you know what?

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:56.020
Let's take a look at our
top and bottom movers.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.054
So let's see who's moved a lot.

00:21:58.054 --> 00:22:00.220
Now, this is one of the
things I heard over and over

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.250
in my discussions.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.830
I've got all of these apps.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.455
There's data across all of these
networks, different countries,

00:22:05.455 --> 00:22:06.700
et cetera.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.380
Can you just tell
me who's making

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.170
a lot more and a lot less so
I could pay really, really

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.212
close attention to that?

00:22:13.212 --> 00:22:14.920
You should be able to
detect that for me.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.680
So here we go.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.210
So we built this functionality.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.850
So here we see Color Drips.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.000
OK, so they've really
done a good job of--

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.150
something's popped there.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.080
Something's good.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.760
And some of these Flood It--

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.020
OK, something's not
quite as good there.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.260
But this highlighting--
really, really, I heard,

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.010
happy we have this in
the [INAUDIBLE] now.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.540
So we could investigate
what's going

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.830
on in Color Drips in a second.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:43.590
Now, before we do that, let's
go over to the app selector.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.200
So I'm looking over
at this left nav bar.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.780
Now, one thing we
realized is that when

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.700
you're working and
managing your apps,

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.140
sometimes you're very
focused on one app.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.772
And sometimes you're
focused on all of your apps

00:22:59.772 --> 00:23:00.480
at the same time.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.021
You want to do
something and you just

00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:04.210
want it to apply all the
way across the board.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.930
And so we split out these
two different workflows

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.830
to really get them in here to
match exactly how you work.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.657
So when we're thinking
about the one app side,

00:23:13.657 --> 00:23:15.990
if you click on that you can
see all the different apps,

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.531
you can search for
the apps you want.

00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:19.830
I mean, some of these
lists are thousands long.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.230
You can really
imagine the scale.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.950
So it makes it
quick to select it.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.470
And you also see down
below, if I skip down,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.440
there some account-level things
like reports and mediation.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.820
And we also heard that things
like ad controls and payments--

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.430
you know, I need really quick
access to that no matter

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:36.030
where I am.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.860
So we brought that
right to the front.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.310
But then, since we
clicked on an app,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.770
that section expanded
right below Color Drips

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.600
and you see all
the relevant things

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.190
that you want to do with
the app right there.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:53.250
And on top of that, we're now
in an app-specific dashboard.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.200
So before we had the
account-level seeing

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.240
everything that was happening.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.266
And now we're in an
app-specific dash

00:23:59.266 --> 00:24:01.890
that's showing everything that's
happening with a specific app.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.723
So you can see everything
right at a glance.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.750
So here we're seeing our
dashboard across the top

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.040
again in gray.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.480
And what's nice
about this is you

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.430
see across all of the
networks all in one place.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.160
You see what's happening.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.340
And you also see a
total revenue card.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.250
And you can see that revenue
over the last seven days

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.540
versus last week.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.540
We could also expand
that out to 28 days.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.670
See what's going on.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.830
And we see, OK,
how are we doing?

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:35.370
Interesting.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.122
So we had a really
good week last week.

00:24:38.122 --> 00:24:40.580
I'm not sure what's happening
in the two weeks before that.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.030
I think we might have
taken our ad unit down.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.350
So we put it back up.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.600
We ran a promotion, etc.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.037
We also see the network
performance down at the bottom,

00:24:54.037 --> 00:24:55.370
and we see how we're doing here.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.460
So we've got a match
rate of about 95%.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.480
So not as good as that
last one we saw it 99%,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.670
but still pretty good.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.030
And a CPM of 33,
probably because we're

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.480
showing a lot more impressions.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.820
So I'm also looking now
at the bottom right card.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.096
Now, this card basically says--

00:25:16.096 --> 00:25:17.720
so there's a network
we're using there,

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.120
but we're seeing a
lot of queries go in

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.430
but not a lot of impressions.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.920
So that's something we should
probably go investigate,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.480
and we can take you right there.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.938
So what's great
about this is we've

00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:30.320
surfaced this insight
right here to your ad ops.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.850
This is not
something engineering

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.620
and analytics had to go do.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.970
This is something that's
instantly available to you.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.470
So why don't we click on that
report and go right into that?

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.200
OK.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.490
So here we're looking at--

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:48.672
let's see.

00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:50.880
Let's go ahead and take a
look at the last seven days

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.130
to see what was going on here.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.727
So the last seven days.

00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:55.560
This is interesting.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.480
We weren't getting any
impressions through,

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.960
so that's not so good.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.410
So let's zoom back out
to 28 days, or 30 days,

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:02.610
and see what was going on.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.440
Last 30 days.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.750
So we had some
impressions going through.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.040
Still a little concerned here.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.080
It's not as high as I
would have expected.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.440
That's not a good fill
rate, so something's off.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.070
Now, what's nice is when we
click that Go See This Report,

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.235
it puts some filters in
place for us automatically.

00:26:19.235 --> 00:26:21.610
We don't have to type all the
filters in and choose that.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.870
We just went straight right in
to say, this is Color Drips,

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.930
this is this network, and let's
take a look at what's going on.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:31.500
Now, I don't know if this
is a Color Drips problem

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.269
or a total network problem.

00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:35.310
So why don't we get rid
of the Color Drips filter

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:39.740
to see how the total
network is doing.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.350
So here I am seeing thousands of
impressions are going through,

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.930
so the network looks
like it's performing OK.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.470
But we've got a
problem then that must

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.590
be not in these other apps,
but in this app specifically.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.090
So that's good intel.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.130
So I can now go
find an engineer,

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.140
say, OK, I know
where the problem is.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.550
Something's wrong in this app.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.860
With Something's wrong
in the configuration.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.130
Go solve this problem.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.820
So that's a lot of power that
historically was something

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.780
that is hard to go to surface.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.280
OK.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.490
To summarize here, we've got
an app-centric front end,

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.010
actionable dashboards,
intuitive navigation,

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.210
and richer insights.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.954
And these are a lot
of good features

00:27:15.954 --> 00:27:17.120
we just announced yesterday.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.811
We're very, very proud of the
user experience improvements.

00:27:21.811 --> 00:27:22.310
All right.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.254
So now let's move on to scale.

00:27:24.254 --> 00:27:25.670
Let's say you've
had some success.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:29.030
You've grown from-- let's
say you took one app that is

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.670
immensely successful--
you're trying to specialize--

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.580
or you've grown thousands,
and we've seen this before,

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.070
thousands of apps--
smaller apps-- all together

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:39.030
and you got to the
same place of success.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.654
So how do you manage all that?

00:27:40.654 --> 00:27:42.820
And you need a partner who's
not just an ad network.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.660
You need a platform
that you can grow with.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.300
And that's what we're
really focused on right now.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.780
So in the past, some of
our bigger partners--

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.640
I've actually talked
to partners who

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.900
have 30, 40 engineers
working just

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.370
on things like
extracting data from web

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.720
sites from different
networks, transferring it

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.510
over country by
country, inputting,

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.940
coming back, and cobbling
together all the things.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.920
We looked at that
and we said, gosh,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.950
do you really want to be having
that many engineers spending

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:14.780
that much time on it?

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.190
And their answer was,
of course we don't.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.970
We'd rather use those engineers
to make apps, and make our apps

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.450
better, and make the apps fit
better, and improve and compete

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.350
in the market.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:29.410
So we basically said, OK,
we know we can fix this.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.610
This is a new problem.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.000
It's a scale problem
because of your success.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.980
So let's get right
to work on that.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.200
So the first thing we did is
we made it enterprise scale.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.275
So we knew we had to
handle thousands of apps,

00:28:44.275 --> 00:28:45.900
and so we went right
to work to do that

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.420
and we still maintain a
reputation for stability.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.550
That's something we
hear about often.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.180
The second thing we did is
we said, OK, you're at scale,

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.210
you're global, and you
want lots of networks.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.930
So we provide support to
over 40 media networks,

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.840
and if that's not enough we've
got custom network support.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.090
Third thing we did
was we said, well,

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.450
with a lot of those
networks, why don't we

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.070
pull in the
information so you can

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.470
get all of that
information in one place?

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.220
And so we've been
supporting over 20 networks.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.370
And the fourth thing we did
is we enabled campaigns.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.840
Now, what are campaigns?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.170
Well, if you've got one
app and then you grow to 10

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.120
and you want to
cross-promote your apps,

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.360
these developers were saying,
yeah, I want to use my own ads.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.700
And one thing that's really
nice about this campaign's

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.220
capability is you
don't have to build out

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.020
your own ad-serving
infrastructure,

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.450
or build in specific
ads into a release

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:41.190
and change it in
the next release.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.465
Here you do an ad slot,
and you can manage those

00:29:43.465 --> 00:29:44.340
from the server side.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:44.840
Very simple.

00:29:47.397 --> 00:29:49.230
But we knew there was
more that we could do.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.210
And so, again, we
took to the streets,

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.580
we asked the questions,
and we said, you know what?

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.330
We know we can manage.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.280
We've got problems
that the user said--

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.650
we want to be able to
manage media more rapidly,

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:06.060
we want more reporting detail,
we want more of this inbound

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:10.260
aggregation so we don't have to
go site to site, and we want--

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.270
some of us launched
on other platforms

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.860
before you had rewarded ads.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.740
Can you give us more adopters
so we can tap into demand?

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.110
So the good news is
we're solving each

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.980
and every one of these things.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.120
And I want to talk
about mediation groups.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.410
We're going to
switch over to demo.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.150
So mediation groups--
I'm really, really

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:30.350
proud to announce this.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.500
This was a tough one.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.110
It's a powerful
new capability so

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.570
that you don't have to
manage hundreds or thousands

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.560
of mediation chains.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:42.050
Instead, the concept here is
take one unique combination

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:46.070
of ad network lists,
and countries,

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.020
and apply all of your ad
units to that one thing.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.440
So you don't have to create
over and over and over.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.230
And then when you make
changes, it's just to that one.

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:56.090
So as you'll see, these
mediation groups--

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.410
it really takes
this issue head-on.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.482
So first, you'll see we went
ahead and clicked on mediation

00:31:01.482 --> 00:31:02.190
over to the left.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.162
And that's how we
got to this screen.

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:05.870
And now we're going
to go ahead and we're

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:06.990
going to see this in action.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.948
So let's go ahead and
create a mediation group.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:12.750
Right.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.910
And as I mentioned,
some of these developers

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.710
are using this for
dozens or hundreds

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:17.870
or even thousands of apps.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.036
So to scale with them, I'll
show you how to do this.

00:31:20.036 --> 00:31:23.880
So first you choose a
format and a platform.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.626
And the reason those
two you choose first

00:31:25.626 --> 00:31:27.000
is the mediation
groups, you tend

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.390
to make them specific to
the format and the platform.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.310
Now, let's go ahead
and create a title now.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.980
We're going to call
this one Android

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.900
Banners in High CPM Countries.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:38.429
OK?

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:40.470
And we're going to choose
which countries that we

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:41.760
can include or exclude.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.200
So we're going to choose the US.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.900
And how about the UK, maybe?

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.160
Japan.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.795
So high CPM
countries in general.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.250
So we've got our countries.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.910
Let's add some ad units
to this mediation chain.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:58.380
Now, here's what's great.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.000
It can be across
all of your apps.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.680
They can all attach
to the same ones.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.990
So you do your homework
on which ones you want.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:09.370
So you attach these apps with
different ad units into here.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.910
So now we've got that group
set up, but now we need to say,

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.950
what's the order of
networks we want to serve?

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.430
So we already see
AdMob is in there,

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.070
and now we're going to
add another network.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.360
So why don't we add--

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.940
why don't you just choose one?

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.310
Let's add one here from Unity.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.600
Sounds good.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.575
And we can either
choose to optimize,

00:32:29.575 --> 00:32:31.950
which is this automated concept
I was talking about where

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.140
we pull the data
automatically and then

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.110
the ordering is done for
you, which is awesome.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.450
Or we can go ahead and
manually specify this.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.880
Sometimes we manually specify
at the front just in case

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.620
the credentials
aren't working right.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.480
And we continue.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.960
And then we answer
our ad unit idea.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.600
So Unity is going to say,
here's an ad unit for this app

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.050
and here's one for that app.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.960
And it's very important these
things are kept separate

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.180
so we can optimize to each
one because they're going

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.920
to give different performance.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.140
We really want to
optimize for every unit,

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.544
so we go ahead and say that.

00:33:02.544 --> 00:33:03.960
And now we have a
mediation chain.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.530
So that's it.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.110
It's that simple.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:13.300
We did this across all of
our apps for that chain.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.200
So we see we've got four
different mediation groups.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.774
Great.

00:33:16.774 --> 00:33:18.690
And we can dive right
in and see what's there.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:23.850
We can also see how these
guys are doing across

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.780
by just clicking and
dropping that down.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.660
So we just did that group to
people who serve UK, US, Japan.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.660
These other groups, they
serve different formats

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.620
in different countries.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.080
And if nobody's caught, we've
got AdMob to catch everything

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.580
at the end.

00:33:43.131 --> 00:33:43.630
All right.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.910
So we also have
this-- let's see--

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.320
we have this consolidated
view of what's going on.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.040
So you see that
bar across the top.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.940
So this gives you queries,
impressions, and fill rates.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.200
That's across everything.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.080
We've done some really
hard, tricky math here

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.349
to make sure that when we
say queries, we mean queries.

00:34:01.349 --> 00:34:03.390
We don't mean double
counting or triple counting.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:04.890
That's really
confusing when you've

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:07.620
got a bunch of network
calls all happening

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.920
for the same impression. how
to add those up and then not

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.235
duplicate or triplicate count.

00:34:12.235 --> 00:34:13.860
You've also got the
network [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.679
right at the top, which is a
feature that was asked for.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:21.899
There's also the possibility
that you've got--

00:34:21.899 --> 00:34:23.699
let's say that someone's
come in and said,

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:26.429
hey, I've got a deal
for you. $20 CPMs.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:27.580
Put me in there.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.639
So we can go ahead
and add that network

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:32.969
pretty easily to
our mediation chain,

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:35.020
or if that network
is already in there.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.670
So let's go right in there.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.159
Let's modify this network.

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:39.960
Let's put $20 CPMs in.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.010
So let's change this
Unity ad to $20.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:52.719
We change it here, and
instantly that's done.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:53.949
Now, that's powerful.

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:55.489
Again, across all the
apps and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:55.690
OK.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.273
Another thing.

00:34:56.273 --> 00:34:59.927
Let's say we want to add
another app with a new ad unit.

00:34:59.927 --> 00:35:01.510
Well, we've already
done the hard work

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:02.468
of the mediation chain.

00:35:02.468 --> 00:35:05.500
So we take that ad unit,
and we can attach it

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.930
right into the same mediation
group that we already had.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:15.510
So let's go ahead and add
an ad unit from TriPro.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:20.010
Let's add that unit, add it,
game ID, again that placement

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.810
ID, and we're done.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:22.900
Just like that.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.800
So we took all of the networks
across the globe, packed it

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.390
into that one change,
and we're done.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.151
And it's a really,
really good way

00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:31.400
to save hours and hours that
we've seen in the market.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.250
So you've just seen
this in action.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:40.197
Let's go ahead and
flip back to the deck.

00:35:40.197 --> 00:35:41.530
You've just seen this in action.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.920
We're continuing to work on
these features-- simplified

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.850
management.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.837
We also allow you to call these
other networks multiple times

00:35:48.837 --> 00:35:50.170
now in our new mediation groups.

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.920
That's something
that was asked for.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.920
We've got more coverage.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.030
We're now up to 25
networks where we

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.100
can pull in data automatically.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.200
We've got rewarded
inbound adopters now

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.140
for three networks.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.940
So we've just added Fiber, which
is something that we've heard.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.000
So now let's move
right over to optimize.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.940
So this is something where
we've got data, you've got data,

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.110
so let's put it together.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.590
So the first thing we know
is, if you're using mediation,

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.680
we have this real-time
CPM capability.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.710
It's a single click and it
lets us bid into every auction.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.016
So if we think we can
make you more money,

00:36:24.016 --> 00:36:25.640
we'll go ahead and
give you more money.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.190
So that's been seen to
really improve performance.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:32.450
Second thing is we have these
optimized refresh banners.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.040
If you have banners,
you probably

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.160
notice the speeds on the
refresh are changing.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.025
So why should we ask you to go
do run all these A/B tests when

00:36:40.025 --> 00:36:41.630
we have a lot of data on this?

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.450
So we're automatically
changing that if you opt in.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:46.660
We find that even though
we show less banners,

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.040
if we pick the right
amount of time,

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.780
you get better performance.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.690
The third thing we've seen
is this dynamic allocation

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:54.980
for your campaigns.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.756
So maybe you want to show a
million impressions, or 10%,

00:36:58.756 --> 00:37:01.130
but you don't want to lose
out on these really high-value

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.270
auctions.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:05.300
This dynamic allocation lets you
keep those high-value auctions

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.940
that make money and
still serve the goals

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.180
that you're trying to do.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:10.790
OK.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.320
So here I want to--

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.320
we're basically-- again,
we took to the streets.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.440
These are some
problems that we found.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.620
It's really around
complexity of revenue streams

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.890
across these different units.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.000
So I want to introduce you to
this new two-way integration

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.740
with AdMob and Firebase
we announced yesterday.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.370
And we're going to dive right
in and see this thing in action.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.790
So the first thing you see
is this app's dashboard.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.200
So this is a revenue card.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.850
Now, here's what's awesome.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.550
You've got AdMob
revenue in blue.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.880
You've got mediation revenue
from other networks in red.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.520
And in yellow you've got
in-app purchase revenue.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.160
All in one place.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.390
This is hard.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.270
And it's really because of
the marriage of Firebase,

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.750
which is bringing in the
in-app purchase and our network

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.840
optimization products, which
are bringing in the external,

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.270
and we put it all in one place.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:06.710
Also, we have this other card,
which is about user metrics.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.857
So we're pulling this
data in from Firebase,

00:38:08.857 --> 00:38:10.940
and you've got some really
interesting new metrics

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.560
like ad exposure.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.960
How much are my users
actually seeing right now?

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.940
Ads versus the app.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.580
You see 11% in this case,
but with banners sometimes

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.660
you see much higher.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.440
And you can see when
it's high or low,

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.830
and when things might not
be functioning correctly.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.350
You can also see when you're
running experiments-- are they

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.060
helping or are they hurting?

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.910
And how's my retention
doing in average sessions?

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.800
All right here in
your dashboard.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.810
So we're going to
run a very fast demo.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.830
So this is an account--
it's a complicated account.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.470
You've got the FloodIt app.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:51.690
You've got a lot of
advertising data.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:52.490
Not a lot of IAP.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:58.890
You see 46% ad exposure, which
is pretty common for banners.

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:02.415
And why don't we flip right over
to a different kind of account?

00:39:02.415 --> 00:39:03.540
So this is a different one.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.090
This is Bingo Blast, which
you see is really about IAP

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.140
and interstitials only.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.020
And a lot of IAP there
that you see in red.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.760
You see ad units
at exposures 0.5%.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.187
That's really low.

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:17.520
So that's an interesting number.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.570
I didn't know.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.730
Maybe we could grow
higher because we also

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:25.170
see, if you scroll down,
that we're at 99% fill rate.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:28.140
So I bet we could increase
exposure, drop fill rate,

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.650
and then we can closely watch
how long these sessions are--

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:34.080
the sessions per user--

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.790
and retention, and see
if that's working or not.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:39.150
So that's a pretty powerful
way to manage your business,

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.840
and this automatically comes as
soon as you integrate Firebase.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.590
Very simple.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:44.640
Link the accounts.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.500
This data
automatically flows in.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.607
You don't have to
set anything up.

00:39:48.607 --> 00:39:50.190
So that's a really
powerful innovation

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.530
we're very proud to show you.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.344
And then we'll flip back over,
and we'll go ahead and wrap up.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.590
So a lot of things to show
on the AdMob and Firebase

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.259
integration.

00:40:05.259 --> 00:40:07.050
We've got some great
partners who have seen

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:09.490
some tremendous results so far.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.180
It's really simplifying what
they had a lot of engineers

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.340
working on, or just not doing.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.110
So we're giving you that power.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:21.330
And again, monetize with
this new beta we've released.

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:23.160
Mediation groups.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.430
And Google Analytics
for Firebase.

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.350
You put those together-- we're
really proud of this platform.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:29.980
We're always looking
for new ideas.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.740
So if you have things
you want to tell us,

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.420
by all means please
reach out to us.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.045
And this is it.

00:40:35.045 --> 00:40:36.211
This is what it's all about.

00:40:36.211 --> 00:40:38.430
Make developers like you
as successful as possible

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:42.000
and give you the best ad
experiences that are possible.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.750
Some other things.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.700
Tomorrow morning
at 8:30 to 9:30 is

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.150
the session solely on the
Firebase and AdMob integration.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.730
We've got office
hours right now.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:54.150
And we've got a code lab that's
happening tomorrow morning

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.000
from 9:30 to 12:30 where we
have people on-site to walk

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.705
through Native and Rewarded.

00:40:58.705 --> 00:41:01.330
If you want someone technically
to walk you through everything,

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.920
those range between a
half hour and an hour.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.330
We've got a Firebase Analytics
presentation as well.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.920
So thank you very, very much.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.420
