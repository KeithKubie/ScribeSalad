00:00:04.096 --> 00:00:06.046
&gt;&gt;Kate: The objective
of this lesson was

00:00:06.176 --> 00:00:08.936
to use a project-based
learning activity

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:11.436
to have the students teach
one another the key concepts

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:12.286
for chemistry.

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:14.976
Students are really engaged
when technology is involved.

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:28.876
&gt;&gt;So get a partner, quietly
sit, and set a goal together.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:32.546
&gt;&gt;Kate: The assignment is
for students to work in pairs

00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:35.456
and to develop a lesson to
present to the students.

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:39.526
I'm really big on trying to hit
all the different types of learning,

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:44.446
so they were required to have three
main categories, and under that,

00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:46.576
they got to choose how they did it.

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:50.456
So the first category was
to have some type of visual

00:00:50.486 --> 00:00:51.496
for our visual learners,

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:55.456
so that could be a
PowerPoint, a video, a poster.

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:59.136
&gt;&gt;Boy: Right now we're using Google Docs,
so we're using Google Presentations,

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:01.646
and we're going to make
the presentation slides

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:02.396
and stuff like that.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:07.356
&gt;&gt;Kate: The second category was to be
some type of handout for our students

00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:09.046
that like to take notes
and write along.

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:11.206
&gt;&gt;Boy: We'll just give them
notes, and the notes,

00:01:11.206 --> 00:01:14.396
they're like fill-in-the-blank, so
they have to look at our presentation

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:15.706
in order to finish the notes.

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:18.366
&gt;&gt;Kate: And then the final
category was to do some type

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:22.106
of engaging activity, such as a
crossword puzzle or a word search.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.376
&gt;&gt;Boy: Yeah, I think projects
make learning more effective.

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:28.276
I feel if you're hands-on with
everything, you'll learn it better.

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:31.196
&gt;&gt;Kate: It is a biology
class. However, next year,

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:33.826
due to budget cuts, we
won't be having chemistry

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:35.136
as one of our core sequence.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:37.266
However, I felt it was
definitely necessary

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.696
that they got some more
prerequisite skills for chemistry,

00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:43.196
so I decided to switch my
end-of-the-year project

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:45.816
to more of a chemistry idea.

00:01:46.136 --> 00:01:47.736
&gt;&gt;Kate: Use your resources.

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:49.886
&gt;&gt;Kate: The first thing that most of
them have done are like the Keynote,

00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:53.756
and then I find that they tend to
go with a handout because that comes

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:56.506
with the Keynote, and then
their final stage is going

00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:57.826
to be the activity.

00:01:57.946 --> 00:02:00.386
Some of them are doing chemical
reactions, and so they want

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:04.406
to create a volcano and do the
vinegar and the baking soda.

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:08.156
Recently our school has
been engaging in Google Docs

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:10.596
and Google Presentations because all

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:14.146
of our students have an e-mail
address based upon our school that's

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:15.526
through a Google account.

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:19.066
And on the Google Docs, they can
have Word and Presentations and stuff

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.326
like that because it enables
students to share with one another

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:25.066
if they're working with partners,
and it also enables teachers

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:27.916
to see what they are
doing and easily edit.

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:33.246
&gt;&gt;Boy: And we sign into our school
email and we go into Documents

00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:36.286
and it opens up all the projects
we've done, all the essays,

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:38.886
and then we go into Presentation,
and we can make one of these

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:40.466
like little presentation things.

00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:43.686
&gt;&gt;Kate: But it's really neat because
one student can be at home working

00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:46.266
on it while the other student can
be at school and working on it.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:50.296
It also decreases the hassle of
having students have to bring

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:55.356
in flash drives or saving it and
not remember where they saved it.

00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:56.806
&gt;&gt;Boy: So right now I'm
moving the picture,

00:02:56.806 --> 00:02:59.206
and you can see it
on his computer too.

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:02.236
So right now, see, he's on the
same slide as I am or basically

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:05.236
on the same presentation, so he
can see everything that I'm doing

00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:07.716
in the presentation to benefit
it or change something up.

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:10.746
&gt;&gt;Kate: This was specifically a
project, as well, because I know

00:03:10.746 --> 00:03:13.426
as a teacher I learn the material
best when I have to present

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.576
and teach it to another person,
so I feel like they are best able

00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:20.146
to learn the knowledge when they
feel like they have to teach it.

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:21.126
It's higher stakes.

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:27.016
&gt;&gt;Girl: If you're trying to find out
how much 4.5 kilograms is in grams,

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:29.266
you would set up a
proportion like this.

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:35.036
&gt;&gt;Kate: Today, Natalie and Nikki
presented on the different SI units,

00:03:35.536 --> 00:03:37.096
so kilograms and stuff like that.

00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:39.116
They gave the students guided notes,

00:03:39.116 --> 00:03:41.586
so the guided notes
have the key points

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:42.916
and then have fill-in-the-blanks

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:45.206
so that students can follow
along and listen as well.

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:49.526
&gt;&gt;Girl: Since 1960, scientists
use a set of units called SI.

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:53.506
&gt;&gt;Kate: They also had some practice
problems, so they did one as a class

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:58.156
and then they have practice
problems for the students to work on.

00:03:58.186 --> 00:04:00.776
A lot of these students
are very tech-savvy,

00:04:00.776 --> 00:04:06.206
and they already know
how to do this stuff.

00:04:06.826 --> 00:04:09.206
&gt;&gt;Kate: We provide them with
different ideas and resources,

00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:11.526
like the Google Docs, but
if they have other ways

00:04:11.526 --> 00:04:14.316
to get their point across, like
Pinterest or some other type

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:17.526
of technology that they know
about, they are more than welcome

00:04:17.526 --> 00:04:21.536
to use that, as long as
it gets the point across.
