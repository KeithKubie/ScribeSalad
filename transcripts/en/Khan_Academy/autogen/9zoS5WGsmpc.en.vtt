00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:02.211
 In this video will 

00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:06.131
 we summarize cell breathing. 

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.991
 It may seem like a very intense process, 

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:10.591
 my charts might look confused, 

00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:12.511
 but are clearer than that, 

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.111
 which actually happens in your cells and organs. 

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:16.892
 Here we will show how exactly 

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:18.782
 we can produce ATP from glucose, via glycolysis, 

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:22.521
 cycle of Krebs 

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.261
 and oxidative phosphorylation. 

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:26.642
 In fact, any molecules can be involved 

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:28.463
 in different parts of the process, then go out 

00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:31.323
 from it and to include other metabolic pathways. 

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:35.097
 Here we will tell 

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.957
 traditional history, 

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:39.356
 I'll start with glucose. 

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:42.336
 We have a chain of six carbon atoms. 

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:45.816
 We also have the process of glycolysis that is going on 

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:49.736
 in the cytosol of our cells. 

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:51.336
 If this is a cell here, 

00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:53.737
 we can imagine that glycolysis 

00:00:54.307 --> 00:00:58.119
 this is here. 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.972
 In the glycolysis process, the glucose molecule, 

00:01:01.972 --> 00:01:04.175
 containing six carbon atoms, 

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:05.655
 is divided into two molecules with three carbon atoms. 

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:07.995
 These molecules have three carbon atoms 

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:11.365
 are called pyruvate. 

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:14.119
 They're drinking. 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.549
 In this process 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.289
 we can produce ATP, which is 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.026
 the main goal of glycolysis. 

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:23.366
 We produce four molecules of ATP, and we use two. 

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.866
 We generally win two ATF molecules. 

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.806
 I'll make a table here to track the number of ATP molecules produced. 

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:32.283
 We produce two molecules of ATP 

00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:34.922
 and in the same time 

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:39.308
 we reduce two molecules up to NAD. 

00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:41.748
 Remember, in the reduction, we gain electrons. 

00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:43.988
 Here we see that this compound is positively charged, 

00:01:43.988 --> 00:01:46.728
 and this is neutral, it has received a hydride anion. 

00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:48.410
 This is a reduction. 

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:49.476
 Reducing. 

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:52.203
 If we go through the whole process and get to 

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:54.083
 up to oxidative phosphorylation 

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:58.343
 and the electron transport chain, we will see that NAD is reduced 

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:02.619
 to NADH, which can then be oxidized, 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.699
 which will deliver more energy 

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:07.999
 for the production of ATP. 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.549
 We will get two molecules NAD. 

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:13.756
 Two molecules of NAD will be produced. 

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:16.166
 At this stage, it must be taken 

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.846
 solution. 

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.966
 If there is no oxygen around the body 

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:21.806
 or for any reason, 

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:23.326
 he does not want to continue 

00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:25.226
 with cellular breathing, or can not, 

00:02:25.226 --> 00:02:27.826
 this pyruvate will be used for fermentation. 

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:30.006
 We have videos about fermentation, 

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:32.935
 lactic acid or alcoholic fermentation, 

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:35.695
 in the fermentation pyruvate is used, 

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:40.196
 to oxidize NAD to NAD. 

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:42.682
 Thus NAD can be used again for glycolysis. 

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:45.400
 Although NADN has energy, 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.480
 which can be turned into ATP, 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.984
 although pyruvate has energy, 

00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:51.806
 which can be turned into ATP, 

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:54.286
 in fermentation, we ignore all this 

00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:55.826
 we consider these compounds only as waste products. 

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:59.986
 We use the pyuva to turn NAD back into the NAD. 

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:03.196
 Then glycolysis will be able to run again. 

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:05.436
 But let's assume that the process will not 

00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:07.816
 go to fermentation, 

00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:09.176
 but will continue to the traditional one 

00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:12.217
 aerobic cell breathing that uses oxygen. 

00:03:12.787 --> 00:03:14.247
 The next thing that will happen is, 

00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:16.467
 that this carboxyl group - 

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:17.458
 Everything I will show now, 

00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:19.047
 will happen to each of these pyruvate molecules. 

00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:21.147
 You can imagine all this repeated twice. 

00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:24.080
 That is why I will multiply the products of the reactions in two. 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.548
 In the next step, 

00:03:25.548 --> 00:03:29.548
 I have this carboxyl group which, 

00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:33.168
 is detached from the pyruvate and is excreted 

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:35.351
 in the form of carbon dioxide. 

00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.135
 This is the carbon dioxide released. 

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:40.735
 And the rest of the pyuva 

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:45.260
 is an acetyl group which is attached to coenzyme A. 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.150
 You will often hear about coenzyme A. 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.810
 It is sometimes referred to as CoA, 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.470
 and sometimes as CoA and then 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.825
 sulfur bonded to hydrogen. 

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:55.485
 The reason we draw 

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.885
 the sulfur is that it connects 

00:03:57.885 --> 00:04:00.695
 with the acetyl group here. 

00:04:01.702 --> 00:04:04.600
 So, we have carbon dioxide that separates 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.020
 and an acetyl group that binds to sulfur, 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.078
 thus obtaining acetyl-CoA. 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.825
 With this designation (CoA), we see only acetyl-CoA 

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:15.801
 three letters, 

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:17.431
 but in fact it is a very complex molecule. 

00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.361
 Here's a drawing of acetyl-CoA. 

00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:20.961
 I know it's very small, 

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:23.201
 but I hope it shows how complex the molecule is. 

00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:25.241
 The acetyl group we are talking about 

00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:29.292
 here's the part here. This is coenzyme. 

00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:32.292
 Helps to transport this acetyl group, 

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:33.692
 we will see this in a second. 

00:04:33.692 --> 00:04:35.552
 It is fun to look at these molecules, 

00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:37.112
 because we see the same patterns 

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:40.252
 over and over again in different parts of biology and biochemistry. 

00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:43.032
 In acetyl-CoA, we have adenine here. 

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.329
 It's hard to see, but we also have ribose, 

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:47.909
 as well as two phosphate groups. 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.841
 This end of acetyl-CoA is in practice 

00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:53.471
 ADP. 

00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:54.797
 But it is used as coenzyme. 

00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:56.157
 All I talk about 

00:04:56.157 --> 00:04:57.657
 is assisted by enzymes, 

00:04:57.657 --> 00:04:59.837
 and the enzymes will have 

00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:03.830
 cofactors and coenzymes, 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.375
 which also help the reactions. 

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:08.675
 As we can see, the acetyl group is linked 

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.722
 with coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA, 

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.852
 but this is a temporary connection. 

00:05:13.852 --> 00:05:16.432
 Acetyl-CoA will bring in 

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:19.252
 acetyl group 

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:22.633
 in the Krebs cycle. 

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:24.492
 It will carry these two carbon atoms 

00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:28.552
 to the oxalacetate to give the citrate. 

00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:30.472
 It will carry these two carbon atoms 

00:05:30.472 --> 00:05:33.832
 to this molecule having one, two, three, four carbon atoms, 

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:38.382
 to obtain a molecule of one, two, three, four, five, six carbon atoms. 

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:39.947
 But before we deepen the Krebs cycle, 

00:05:39.947 --> 00:05:41.907
 I want to make sure that 

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:43.827
 we do not lose the number 

00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:46.968
 of the produced ATPs and NADNs. 

00:05:46.968 --> 00:05:49.588
 In this step here, in the decarboxylation of pyruvate, 

00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:53.088
 we switched from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, 

00:05:53.088 --> 00:05:56.370
 we also have a reduction of NAD to NAD. 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.910
 This will happen with each of the pyruvate molecules. 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.701
 When Counting Received 

00:05:59.701 --> 00:06:00.605
 ATP and NADH molecules, 

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:02.483
 we are talking about the resulting, upon decomposition of one molecule of glucose. 

00:06:02.483 --> 00:06:03.883
 From one molecule of glucose we will get two pyruvate molecules 

00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:05.623
 and they will be used in the next steps of the process in the same way. 

00:06:05.623 --> 00:06:07.223
 - 

00:06:07.223 --> 00:06:09.682
 This will be multiplied by two. 

00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:10.844
 We will produce 

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:15.215
 two molecules NAD in this step, 

00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:17.425
 when we move from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. 

00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:20.055
 the main part 

00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:23.397
 from the catabolism of organic compounds, 

00:06:23.397 --> 00:06:26.355
 through which we will receive ATP, 

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:27.815
 is happening in 

00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:29.862
 the Krebs cycle also called the citric acid cycle. 

00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:32.122
 It's called the citric acid cycle because when 

00:06:32.122 --> 00:06:35.200
 transfer the acetyl group of coenzyme A 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.621
 on the oxalacetate, we get citrate or citric acid. 

00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:40.281
 Citric acid 

00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:42.921
 is found in lemons or orange juice. 

00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:45.581
 This is the molecule here. 

00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:49.181
 The citric acid cycle and the Krebs cycle are the same thing. 

00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:51.722
 When you see it for the first time it looks very complicated 

00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:54.262
 and some people really think that. 

00:06:54.262 --> 00:06:57.782
 But I will summarize the processes in it. 

00:06:57.782 --> 00:07:00.382
 The citric acid, which has six carbon atoms, 

00:07:00.382 --> 00:07:03.322
 continues to break down in the next steps. 

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.302
 Here I do not show all the details. 

00:07:06.302 --> 00:07:08.742
 The citric acid is degraded until it is again converted to oxalacetate. 

00:07:08.742 --> 00:07:12.042
 Then he can accept the two carbon atoms again. 

00:07:12.042 --> 00:07:14.121
 And to make it clear when the two carbon atoms 

00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:16.516
 are released due to coenzyme A, 

00:07:16.516 --> 00:07:18.835
 it can be reused, 

00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:21.816
 to decarboxylate other pyruvate molecules. 

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.555
 There are several cycles that are spinning. 

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:26.119
 The important thing is that going through 

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:29.029
 the citric acid cycle, passing from one intermediate product to another, 

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:33.083
 we redraw molecules up to NAD. 

00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:37.538
 We do this three times each turn 

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:39.318
 of the citric acid cycle. That will happen 

00:07:39.318 --> 00:07:42.438
 for each acetyl-CoA molecule. 

00:07:42.438 --> 00:07:43.798
 For each pirate. 

00:07:43.798 --> 00:07:46.158
 With one molecule of glucose, it will twist twice. 

00:07:46.158 --> 00:07:47.917
 We'll twist the loop twice 

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:50.126
 for each molecule of glucose. 

00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:55.032
 Here we have produced one, two three molecules NAD, 

00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:57.250
 but since the cycle will rotate twice, 

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.231
 because we have one 

00:07:58.231 --> 00:07:59.911
 glucose molecule, 

00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:01.494
 we can say we have six 

00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:06.065
 molecules NAD. 

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:10.584
 Either six NAD molecules are reduced to NAD. 

00:08:11.174 --> 00:08:12.434
 In this process 

00:08:12.434 --> 00:08:14.901
 we're going through the molecule with 

00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:17.221
 six carbon atoms, to a four carbon atom molecule 

00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:20.420
 and release carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. 

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.100
 Normally, we also have GFF conversion 

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.599
 in the GFP or sometimes the ADF in the ATF, 

00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:32.166
 but functional GLP is equivalent to ATP. 

00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:34.466
 - 

00:08:34.466 --> 00:08:36.329
 Remember, all this happens twice for one molecule of glucose. 

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:40.133
 We can report 

00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:41.733
 two molecules ATP for easier. 

00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:44.833
 We can say GFT, but I'll take it for ATF. 

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:47.672
 Once again, I repeat that this happens once every turn of the cycle, 

00:08:47.672 --> 00:08:50.410
 but for each glucose molecule, the cycle is rotated twice. 

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.849
 We have another coenzyme here - 

00:08:53.849 --> 00:08:56.715
 FAD, which is reduced to FADN2, 

00:08:56.715 --> 00:08:59.147
 but remains covalently associated with the enzymes, 

00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:01.779
 who support it. 

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:05.099
 So it's ultimately used to reduce it 

00:09:06.156 --> 00:09:08.802
 coenzyme Q to QH2. 

00:09:08.802 --> 00:09:10.682
 I will write QH2 here. 

00:09:10.682 --> 00:09:12.482
 Since the cycle will rotate twice, 

00:09:16.332 --> 00:09:21.102
 write two on QH2. 

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:22.854
 Now let's think about the net 

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:25.314
 profit. 

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:28.254
 - 

00:09:28.254 --> 00:09:30.914
 I'll write it down abridged. 

00:09:30.914 --> 00:09:32.734
 We will go into more detail in other videos. 

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:36.539
 These coenzymes, NADH and QH2 

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:40.619
 will be oxidized 

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:42.979
 in the oxidative phosphorylation 

00:09:42.979 --> 00:09:44.999
 and the electron transport chain, 

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:47.319
 to create a proton gradient 

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:50.638
 on both sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. 

00:09:50.638 --> 00:09:52.098
 We will explain all this in much more detail in the following videos, 

00:09:52.098 --> 00:09:53.516
 but the proton gradient will be used for 

00:09:53.516 --> 00:09:56.434
 producing more ATP. 

00:09:56.434 --> 00:09:58.901
 To understand this process, 

00:09:58.901 --> 00:10:03.221
 we need to know that every molecule NAD - 

00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:06.421
 I've seen ideas that performance is important 

00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:08.623
 and the location of NADN 

00:10:08.623 --> 00:10:11.081
 will be produced. But thanks to every NAM molecule 

00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:15.641
 we produce between two and three ATP molecules. 

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:21.414
 Each molecule of the reduced coenzyme Q- 

00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:23.874
 QH2 

00:10:23.874 --> 00:10:27.311
 will be involved in the production of 1.5 molecules of ATP. 

00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:28.830
 Scientists are still up and running 

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.230
 to understand all the details of this process. 

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.610
 Depends on cell efficiency 

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.914
 and what is the purpose of the cage, what it wants to do. 

00:10:34.637 --> 00:10:37.277
 I would often give a space - 

00:10:37.277 --> 00:10:41.267
 between 1.5 and 2 molecules of ATP. 

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:43.743
 These are approximate calculations. 

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.366
 Think about the general bill. 

00:10:46.366 --> 00:10:49.226
 If we collect all the ATP or GTF molecules, 

00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:52.906
 we will have two here, two here. 

00:10:52.906 --> 00:10:55.067
 We'll have four directly 

00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:58.997
 or nearly directly synthesized ATP molecules. 

00:10:59.147 --> 00:11:00.827
 How many NAD molecules? 

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:04.117
 We have two, four, and then we add six. 

00:11:04.117 --> 00:11:05.433
 We have ten molecules NAD. 

00:11:05.923 --> 00:11:09.159
 Ten molecules NAN. 

00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:13.677
 Then we have two coenzyme Q molecules. 

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:16.323
 Two molecules QH2. 

00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:18.453
 Here I have four ATF molecules. 

00:11:18.453 --> 00:11:20.037
 - 

00:11:20.037 --> 00:11:24.257
 We'll get here 

00:11:24.257 --> 00:11:25.937
 between 

00:11:25.937 --> 00:11:28.687
 20 and 30 ATP molecules. 

00:11:29.837 --> 00:11:32.327
 And here, between three and four 

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.810
 ATP molecules. 

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:36.120
 If we collect them, 

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.940
 if we gather all the lower bounds, 

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.780
 to see - 20 plus three, plus four. 

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.982
 These are 27 molecules of ATP. 

00:11:42.982 --> 00:11:46.282
 27 molecules ATP. 

00:11:46.282 --> 00:11:48.305
 Let's see what we get for the upper limit. 

00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:51.055
 We have four plus 30, plus four. 

00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:52.531
 We get 38. 

00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:55.161
 38 molecules ATP. 

00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:57.531
 38 molecules ATP is considered 

00:11:57.531 --> 00:11:59.791
 for the theoretical maximum that can be synthesized. 

00:11:59.791 --> 00:12:01.414
 But in fact, when monitoring these processes in cells, 

00:12:01.414 --> 00:12:05.217
 it seems to produce around 29-30 ATP molecules. 

00:12:05.217 --> 00:12:06.837
 Again, I will note that these values ​​depend on 

00:12:06.837 --> 00:12:10.097
 what the cage wants, cell type, and efficiency. 

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:13.458
 All this happens in cellular breathing. 

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:14.878
 Explain 

00:12:14.878 --> 00:12:16.958
 where these processes are going. 

00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:17.746
 Where does all this happen? 

00:12:17.746 --> 00:12:20.006
 We have said that glycolysis occurs in the cytosol. 

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:23.726
 The citric acid cycle 

00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:28.311
 flows into the mitochondria. 

00:12:28.311 --> 00:12:30.771
 In this space here 

00:12:30.771 --> 00:12:32.414
 the citric acid cycle proceeds. 

00:12:32.414 --> 00:12:34.994
 In this space stained in the manga. 

00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:36.334
 This is the matrix. 

00:12:36.334 --> 00:12:37.614
 We talk about the mitochondria video 

00:12:37.614 --> 00:12:39.214
 much for him. 

00:12:39.214 --> 00:12:41.834
 And the transformation of coenzymes 

00:12:41.834 --> 00:12:44.674
 and processes in the electron transport chain 

00:12:44.674 --> 00:12:47.734
 flowing into the crystals' membrane. 

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:51.314
 Christians are creases or crests 

00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:53.554
 in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. 

00:12:53.554 --> 00:12:57.354
 This happens in the membrane 

00:12:57.354 --> 00:13:01.634
 of these critics. 

00:13:01.634 --> 00:13:05.697
 Christa is the only number, the crystalline - the multiple. 

00:13:05.697 --> 00:13:08.527
 We will talk more about this in other videos.
