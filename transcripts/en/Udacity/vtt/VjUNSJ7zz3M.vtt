We've talked about how frameworks
provide templating, URL management and

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.810
event handling to control an app's data.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.820
These are the V and the C in MVC speak,
but where is the data or the M in MVC?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.130
How is the data being
managed by the client?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.610
Does it live on the client?

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.180
And what happens with the data
when we stop using it?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.020
If we take another look
at the to do NVC site,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.570
we'll see that it doesn't
start with any data.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.150
This is a common scenario.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.000
The app starts out empty waiting for
the user to provide the data.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.100
Then when data is added
more features appear.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.030
Now that we have our data, what happens
to it when we're done with the site.

00:00:39.158 --> 00:00:43.150
To do NVC used local storage to
save the user provide the data.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.720
This, however, is not permanent,
and is only saved on this computer.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.570
If I open up the developer tools,
go to the resources tab, and

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.170
open up local storage,
you can see the tasks I entered.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.920
If I delete these entries and

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.120
refresh the page,
you'll see that the tasks are gone.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.800
Browsers can make use of web storage,
like local storage or index DB for

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.080
temporary storage.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.160
But typically, a framework will send
their data off to a server to be saved.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.470
Then, when they need that data,
they'll just fetch it from the server.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.340
For example, firebase is a platform
that let's you store and retrieve data.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.110
It has a rest server, and can easily be
integrated with a front end framework.
