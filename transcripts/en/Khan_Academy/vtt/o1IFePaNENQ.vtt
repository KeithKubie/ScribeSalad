00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:02.471
As we've already seen,

00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:04.374
the end of fighting in World War I,

00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:05.502
or I guess we have the end

00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:06.563
of fighting in World War I

00:00:06.563 --> 00:00:08.479
at the end of 1918.

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.979
In 1919 it's time to talk about

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.735
the terms for peace.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:15.718
This happens at the
Paris Peace Conference.

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:17.054
At this conference, you have all the

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:19.158
parties of all the major warring parties,

00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:20.674
but the terms of peace

00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:23.074
are dictated by the winners.

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:24.821
The major powers among the winners

00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:27.001
are led by these
gentlemen right over here.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.142
This is Prime Minister
Lloyd George of the UK,

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:30.738
Vittorio Orlando of Italy,

00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:33.068
Georges Clemenceau of France,

00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:36.144
President Woodrow Wilson
of the United States.

00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:37.914
They come to the Paris Peace Conference

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:39.480
with very different outlooks of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.069
what the peace should look like.

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:42.349
We already learned about

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:44.336
President Wilson's "Fourteen Points".

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:45.555
It was very idealistic.

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:46.871
It talked about making the world

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:49.011
safe for democracy, how people should

00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:50.974
determine their own fate,

00:00:50.974 --> 00:00:53.645
how we should have the self-determination,

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:55.688
the end of empires, free trade,

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.759
creating a League of Nations so that

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:00.266
you can avoid things
like World War I again.

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.402
The European side was not quite

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:04.479
as idealistic, especially the French.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.069
As you can imagine, the U.S. lost a lot

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:08.406
of soldiers in World War I, but

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:10.567
the French lost a significant fraction

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.900
of their adult males in World War I.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.567
The ugly western front was fought

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:17.154
in their country, so they were much more

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:21.076
eager to make Germany
pay for what it's done.

00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:23.941
The terms of the treaty with Germany,

00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:25.858
the Treaty of Versailles,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.272
and the Treaty of Versailles,

00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:28.407
it's important to note, is only one of

00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:30.672
several treaties that came out of the

00:01:30.672 --> 00:01:31.677
Paris Peace Conference.

00:01:31.677 --> 00:01:33.142
It tends to get the most attention

00:01:33.142 --> 00:01:35.149
because it was a treaty with Germany,

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.205
Treaty of Versailles, and many people

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.399
blame it for being part of the cause

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.161
for World War II.

00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:42.872
It so humiliated Germany that it was

00:01:42.872 --> 00:01:44.343
so unacceptable, that it allowed

00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:46.576
a character like Hitler to come along

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:49.486
and lead Germany back into war.

00:01:49.486 --> 00:01:51.231
The Treaty of Versailles was the treaty

00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:52.259
with Germany .

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.215
You have other treaties; with
the Austrians and now since

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.598
the Austro-Hungarian
empire is being broken up,

00:01:56.598 --> 00:01:59.681
the Hungarians, the
Ottomans, so on and so forth.

00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:02.256
The Treaty of Versailles
did several things.

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:04.143
First, this was kind of in line

00:02:04.143 --> 00:02:06.821
especially with the French-thinking, is

00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:08.816
it assigned the guilt to Germany ...

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:10.276
So war guilt.

00:02:10.276 --> 00:02:14.646
War guilt for Germany.

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.065
And depending on where you view,

00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:17.311
you could view this as
a fairly strong thing.

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:19.276
The argument for saying Germany is

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:21.241
responsible for the war is in

00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:25.457
late July, early August of 1914,

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:27.630
it didn't take much for Germany

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.544
to declare war on Russia, then on France,

00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:31.411
and then invade Belgium.

00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:33.457
This was literally a matter of days.

00:02:33.457 --> 00:02:34.756
It was pretty clear that Germany was

00:02:34.756 --> 00:02:36.320
already mobilized to do this,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.364
it was eager to do this,

00:02:37.364 --> 00:02:40.796
and it did do this
without much provocation.

00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:42.047
At that point, it was really just based on

00:02:42.047 --> 00:02:43.463
Russian mobilization.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.659
Those who would argue
this was a little strong,

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.394
would say Germany definitely played a role

00:02:48.394 --> 00:02:50.602
in the war, in maybe escalating the war,

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:52.663
but it didn't start the war.

00:02:52.663 --> 00:02:54.299
You have the assassination of

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.468
the Archduke of Franz Ferdinand,

00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:59.337
of Austro-Hungary.

00:02:59.337 --> 00:03:04.128
It was supported by elements in Serbia.

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:05.793
Then you have the Austro-Hungarians who

00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:08.659
put out these very hard terms to

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.395
the Serbians, bring
these people to justice

00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:12.617
immediately, otherwise
we're declaring war.

00:03:12.617 --> 00:03:14.398
It seemed like they wanted to declare war.

00:03:14.398 --> 00:03:16.809
They do declare war in July of 1914.

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.331
The Russians, they don't let that be

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.250
a little regional conflict,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.214
the Russians decide to start mobilizing,

00:03:22.214 --> 00:03:26.213
giving the Germans the pretext to

00:03:26.213 --> 00:03:27.962
justify their invasions,

00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:29.468
to kind of trigger this blank check

00:03:29.468 --> 00:03:31.292
that they've given the Austro-Hungarians.

00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:34.001
There's a lot of blame
that could go around,

00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:36.121
but the Treaty of Versailles places it

00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:37.976
with Germany.

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:40.386
This justifies the rationale to make

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.028
Germany pay for the war.

00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:45.270
This leads to reparations ...

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.685
Reparations for Germany,

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:47.510
which is essentially is like,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.620
"Look, Germany, you don't have to pay

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.394
the ally powers for all of their lost,

00:03:51.394 --> 00:03:53.532
especially their losses to their

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:55.949
economy due to the fact that you

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:01.539
are guilty of starting of this war guilt."

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:02.660
The reparations were not just in

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.050
paper currency, the reparations were

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.138
in gold, in resources.

00:04:07.138 --> 00:04:10.547
It was a very tangible reparations.

00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:11.799
It's an interesting question because

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.127
these reparations are often referred to

00:04:14.127 --> 00:04:15.623
when people talked to,

00:04:15.623 --> 00:04:17.212
these were disabling reparations.

00:04:17.212 --> 00:04:19.332
They brought the German economy down.

00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:22.423
It is an open question. They were large.

00:04:22.423 --> 00:04:24.549
In modern dollars, the
estimates I've seen,

00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:25.664
they were approximately

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:31.056
$400 billion in 2013 money.

00:04:31.056 --> 00:04:33.398
That is a very, very large number,

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.801
but it's not a huge number for

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:37.208
a reasonably-sized economy like Germany.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:38.887
Although the economy was in bad shape

00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:40.633
at the end of World War I.

00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:43.547
It's not clear whether it by itself

00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:46.243
would have debilitated their economy.

00:04:46.243 --> 00:04:48.712
More likely, or if you were to think

00:04:48.712 --> 00:04:50.541
it's a cause, it's more
the humiliation of it,

00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:52.539
that generations of Germans,

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.792
many of them; 10, 20,
30 years in the future,

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:56.540
had nothing to do with World War I,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.730
would be continuing to pay

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.191
reparations to the allies.

00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.887
So there's a question of its impact on

00:05:01.887 --> 00:05:05.626
the economy and there's just the question

00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:10.331
of how humiliating it was.

00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:12.273
As we go, the reparations only last

00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:14.133
for about 10 years and

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:16.323
Germany pays the equivalent of about

00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:18.657
$60 billion in modern terms,

00:05:18.657 --> 00:05:20.803
$60 billion in 2013 dollars.

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:22.469
That's equivalent to about $5 billion

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.654
in 1920 money.

00:05:25.654 --> 00:05:27.454
On top of the reparations,

00:05:27.454 --> 00:05:29.796
the allies were not interested in

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.609
fighting another war with Germany,

00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:33.236
although ironically, by having very harsh

00:05:33.236 --> 00:05:34.805
terms of the treaty, they might have

00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:37.126
triggered the next war in World War II,

00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:38.126
The Rise of Hitler.

00:05:38.126 --> 00:05:40.292
Since they didn't want to have another

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:41.667
war with Germany, they essentially limited

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:44.924
the German army to 100,000 men,

00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:46.660
which is a very small army,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.955
as we've seen in many of the battles.

00:05:48.955 --> 00:05:51.393
You had battles with
400,000 or 500,000 men,

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.598
so this is pretty much just like a

00:05:53.598 --> 00:05:56.130
police force, it's not really an army.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.948
They weren't allowed any longer to have

00:05:57.948 --> 00:06:01.201
submarines, U-boats, any kind of

00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:03.824
heavy military equipment, artillary,

00:06:03.824 --> 00:06:06.255
heavy artillary, military airplanes,

00:06:06.255 --> 00:06:09.160
battleships of any kind.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.186
It was really just a scaffold of an army

00:06:11.186 --> 00:06:14.893
so that there wouldn't be another,

00:06:14.893 --> 00:06:16.527
or they hoped there would not be,

00:06:16.527 --> 00:06:18.642
another German invasion.

00:06:18.642 --> 00:06:23.035
On top of that, Germany
was stripped of territory.

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:24.677
... Territory ...

00:06:24.677 --> 00:06:27.121
Some of that was directly in Germany.

00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:33.020
Poland was carved out of part of

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.623
the German empire.

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:36.475
This is the new Poland that's carved out

00:06:36.475 --> 00:06:38.403
out of the Paris Peace Conference.

00:06:38.403 --> 00:06:40.448
You see right over here, it cuts Germany

00:06:40.448 --> 00:06:41.672
into two pieces.

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:43.136
East Prussia is still part of Germany,

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.730
but it's all by itself right out here.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.465
Poland is cut out,

00:06:46.465 --> 00:06:48.672
Germany loses Alsace-Lorraine, which

00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:50.540
it captured in 1871 after the

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.030
Franco-Prussian war.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.468
Mineral-rich region, the French had been

00:06:54.468 --> 00:06:55.775
eager to get it back.

00:06:55.775 --> 00:06:57.581
The Germans, actually
that was one of their

00:06:57.581 --> 00:06:59.532
arguable justification why they wanted

00:06:59.532 --> 00:07:00.619
to premptively attack France,

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.107
because they knew that France was

00:07:02.107 --> 00:07:03.787
eager to capture it back

00:07:03.787 --> 00:07:05.571
at some point in the future.

00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:09.147
On top of that, Germany lost its colonies.

00:07:09.147 --> 00:07:11.660
Germany was nowhere near as big of an

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.604
empire as the British or even the French,

00:07:13.604 --> 00:07:14.804
it was actually a fairly new country

00:07:14.804 --> 00:07:19.463
formed in 1871, but it did have an empire.

00:07:19.463 --> 00:07:22.340
It had colonies in southwest Africa,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.862
I'll do this in darker colors,

00:07:23.862 --> 00:07:27.934
actually throughout
Africa and had colonies

00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:29.436
in the Pacific.

00:07:29.436 --> 00:07:34.603
It even had a colony in China.

00:07:34.603 --> 00:07:37.912
All of that was then given over to

00:07:37.912 --> 00:07:40.106
the allies.

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:42.830
The big idea, from the
Treaty of Versailles,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.930
is that, most historians would say it

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.667
was really kind of sticking it to

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:47.522
the Germans.

00:07:47.522 --> 00:07:48.850
The Germans felt it was humilating

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.311
and one could argue that it led to

00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:53.150
some of the extremism that we'll see

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.338
in the next few decades of Germany.

00:07:55.338 --> 00:07:57.090
The one win that Woodrow Wilson was able

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.503
to get out the Treaty of Versailles,

00:07:59.503 --> 00:08:01.516
is it did set up the League of Nations.

00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:05.840
The League of Nations.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.344
The irony here is that the US does not

00:08:08.344 --> 00:08:09.883
ratify the Treaty of Versailles because

00:08:09.883 --> 00:08:11.176
it's suspicious of these kind of

00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:13.355
extra national organizations.

00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:14.888
It actually wasn't happy with some of the

00:08:14.888 --> 00:08:16.942
territorial distribution, that it was

00:08:16.942 --> 00:08:18.754
just giving it from empire to another

00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:21.335
as opposed to having self-determination.

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.633
The US was not actually a signatory,

00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:26.167
it did not actually sign the treaty.

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:28.275
It did not ratify the
Treaty of Versailles.

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:30.586
Regardless of that, the
Treaty of Versailles

00:08:30.586 --> 00:08:34.811
had a huge impact in
sticking it to the Germans.

00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:36.571
On top of that, the
Paris Peace Conference,

00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:37.600
as we've already said,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.427
had various treaties with the other

00:08:39.427 --> 00:08:42.520
central powers and some of the,

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.470
and I'm not going to go into detail

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.539
on what happened, especially

00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:46.682
the Ottoman Empire, that's
worth another video,

00:08:46.682 --> 00:08:50.068
but the big effect on the Austro-Hungarian

00:08:50.068 --> 00:08:51.689
Empire is that it essentially is not

00:08:51.689 --> 00:08:52.491
an empire anymore.

00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:54.267
It was split up into various countries.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:57.270
Austria was set up as a separate country.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.455
Actually the Treaty of Versailles,

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:00.300
in the Treaty of Versailles,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.068
Germany is forbidden from in any way

00:09:03.068 --> 00:09:06.641
merging with Austria, a
German-speaking country.

00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:11.481
You have Hungary becoming
a separate state.

00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:14.069
You have a new state of Czechoslovakia.

00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:18.332
You have a new state of Yugoslavia.

00:09:18.332 --> 00:09:23.140
All of a sudden, the trigger of

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.745
World War I, the desire of having this

00:09:24.745 --> 00:09:26.669
unified southern Slavik state is now

00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:28.337
becoming a reality.

00:09:28.337 --> 00:09:32.019
You have Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia ...

00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:33.615
and Slovenia are taken out of

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:36.534
the Austro-Hungarian empire.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.894
You have a major redrawing of the map

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:39.755
of Europe.

00:09:39.755 --> 00:09:41.734
Some of these new nations here

00:09:41.734 --> 00:09:44.267
in eastern Europe are out of

00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:45.878
the old Russian empire.

00:09:45.878 --> 00:09:47.452
They were able to declare
their independence,

00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:49.402
some of it short-lived before becoming

00:09:49.402 --> 00:09:50.918
satellite states or becoming part of

00:09:50.918 --> 00:09:53.060
the USSR, but they had their

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.056
short-lived independence after the fall

00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:57.672
of the Russian empire.

00:09:57.672 --> 00:10:00.257
The map of Europe is dramatically changed

00:10:00.257 --> 00:10:01.923
due to the Paris Peace Conference,

00:10:01.923 --> 00:10:02.916
the Treaty of Versailles,

00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:04.814
the fall of the Russian empire,

00:10:04.814 --> 00:10:07.915
the other treaties that were outcomes

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:09.591
of World War I.
