both face recognition as well as

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060
both face recognition as well as
 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.180
both face recognition as well as
liveness detection the latter meaning

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190
liveness detection the latter meaning
 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.210
liveness detection the latter meaning
making sure that you are a live human it

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220
making sure that you are a live human it
 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.950
making sure that you are a live human it
turns out life detection can be

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960
turns out life detection can be
 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.960
turns out life detection can be
implemented using supervised learning as

on that instead I want to focus our time

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660
on that instead I want to focus our time
 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.020
on that instead I want to focus our time
on talking about how to build the face

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030
on talking about how to build the face
 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.780
on talking about how to build the face
recognition portion of the system first

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790
recognition portion of the system first
 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.670
recognition portion of the system first
let's start by going over some of the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680
let's start by going over some of the
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.250
let's start by going over some of the
terminology used in face recognition in

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260
terminology used in face recognition in
 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.350
terminology used in face recognition in
the face recognition literature people

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360
the face recognition literature people
 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.840
the face recognition literature people
often talk about face verification and

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850
often talk about face verification and
 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.540
often talk about face verification and
face recognition this is the face

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550
face recognition this is the face
 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.880
face recognition this is the face
verification problem which is if you're

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890
verification problem which is if you're
 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.790
verification problem which is if you're
given an input image as well as a name

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800
given an input image as well as a name
 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.660
given an input image as well as a name
or an ID of a person and the job of the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670
or an ID of a person and the job of the
 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.940
or an ID of a person and the job of the
system is to verify whether or not the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950
system is to verify whether or not the
 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.340
system is to verify whether or not the
input image is data to clean person so

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350
input image is data to clean person so
 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.290
input image is data to clean person so
sometimes this is also called a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300
sometimes this is also called a
 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.020
sometimes this is also called a
one-to-one problem where you just want

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030
one-to-one problem where you just want
 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.699
one-to-one problem where you just want
to know if the person is the person they

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709
to know if the person is the person they
 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.160
to know if the person is the person they
claim to be so the recognition problem

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170
claim to be so the recognition problem
 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.680
claim to be so the recognition problem
is much harder than the verification

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690
is much harder than the verification
 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.740
is much harder than the verification
problem to see why let's say you have a

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
problem to see why let's say you have a
 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.040
problem to see why let's say you have a
verification system that's 99% accurate

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050
verification system that's 99% accurate
 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.400
verification system that's 99% accurate
so 99% might not be too bad but now

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410
so 99% might not be too bad but now
 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.000
so 99% might not be too bad but now
suppose that K is equal to 100 in a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010
suppose that K is equal to 100 in a
 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.060
suppose that K is equal to 100 in a
recognition system if you apply this

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070
recognition system if you apply this
 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.750
recognition system if you apply this
system to a recognition task with a

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760

hundred people in your database you now

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
hundred people in your database you now
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.550
hundred people in your database you now
have a hundred times of chance of making

have a hundred times of chance of making
 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.770
have a hundred times of chance of making
a mistake and if the chance of making a

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780
a mistake and if the chance of making a
 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.530
a mistake and if the chance of making a
mistake on each person is just 1% so if

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540
mistake on each person is just 1% so if
 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.960
mistake on each person is just 1% so if
you have a database of a hundred persons

you have a database of a hundred persons
 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.990
you have a database of a hundred persons
and if you want an acceptable

and if you want an acceptable
 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.150
and if you want an acceptable
recognition error you might actually

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160
recognition error you might actually
 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.640
recognition error you might actually
need a verification system with maybe

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650
need a verification system with maybe
 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.090
need a verification system with maybe
99.9 or even higher accuracy before you

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100
99.9 or even higher accuracy before you
 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.490
99.9 or even higher accuracy before you
can run it on a database of a hundred

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500
can run it on a database of a hundred
 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.100
can run it on a database of a hundred
persons and have a high chance and still

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110
persons and have a high chance and still
 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.259
persons and have a high chance and still
have a high chance of getting incorrect

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269
have a high chance of getting incorrect
 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.300
have a high chance of getting incorrect
in fact if you have a database of

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310
in fact if you have a database of
 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.770
in fact if you have a database of
hundred persons you probably need this

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780
hundred persons you probably need this
 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.880
hundred persons you probably need this
to be even quite a bit higher than 99%

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890
to be even quite a bit higher than 99%
 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.160
to be even quite a bit higher than 99%
for that to work well but what we'll do

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170
for that to work well but what we'll do
 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.680
for that to work well but what we'll do
in the next few videos is focus on

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690
in the next few videos is focus on
 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.010
in the next few videos is focus on
building a face verification system as a

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020
building a face verification system as a
 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.289
building a face verification system as a
building block and then if the accuracy

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299
building block and then if the accuracy
 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.630
building block and then if the accuracy
is high enough then you'll be able to

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640
is high enough then you'll be able to
 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.420
is high enough then you'll be able to
use that in a recognition system as well

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430
use that in a recognition system as well
 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.550
use that in a recognition system as well
so in the next video we'll start

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560
so in the next video we'll start
 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.640
so in the next video we'll start
describing how you can build a face

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650
describing how you can build a face
 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.380
describing how you can build a face
verification system it turns out one of

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390
verification system it turns out one of
 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.540
verification system it turns out one of
the reasons that is a difficult problem

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550
the reasons that is a difficult problem
 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.270
the reasons that is a difficult problem
is you need to solve a one-shot learning

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280
is you need to solve a one-shot learning
 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.760
is you need to solve a one-shot learning
problem let's see in the next video what

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770
problem let's see in the next video what
 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.160
problem let's see in the next video what
that means
