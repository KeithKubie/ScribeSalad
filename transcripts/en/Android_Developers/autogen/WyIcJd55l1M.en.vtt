see here at Google and therefore it
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.759
see here at Google and therefore it
enables us to actually build tooling

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769
enables us to actually build tooling
 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.410
enables us to actually build tooling
around that to provide better

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.030
opportunity identification and guidance
to your fellow developers so that you're

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
to your fellow developers so that you're
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.070
to your fellow developers so that you're
better equipped to understand how you're

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
better equipped to understand how you're
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.309
better equipped to understand how you're
performing and so whenever I think about

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670
understanding you can build it back up
 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.210
understanding you can build it back up
to a full solution and so the key kind

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
to a full solution and so the key kind
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.240
to a full solution and so the key kind
of opportunity to optimize your business

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250
of opportunity to optimize your business
 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.430
of opportunity to optimize your business
no matter how complex it is is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440
no matter how complex it is is
 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.020
no matter how complex it is is
understanding how all of these

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030
understanding how all of these
 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.270
understanding how all of these
components and all these facets fit

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
components and all these facets fit
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.309
components and all these facets fit
together and so in terms of

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319
together and so in terms of
 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.770
together and so in terms of
consultations being able to look at this

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
consultations being able to look at this
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.330
consultations being able to look at this
allows me to better understand the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340
allows me to better understand the
 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.190
allows me to better understand the
business and be able to support its

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200
business and be able to support its
 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.530
business and be able to support its
growth and continued success over time

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
growth and continued success over time
 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.229
growth and continued success over time
and so to give you kind of a concrete

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239
and so to give you kind of a concrete
 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.210
and so to give you kind of a concrete
example of this I'll talk about

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220
example of this I'll talk about
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.800
example of this I'll talk about
something that I think is universally

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
something that I think is universally
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.660
something that I think is universally
applicable to everybody in this room and

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670
applicable to everybody in this room and
 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.520
applicable to everybody in this room and
it's thinking about what is the audience

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530
it's thinking about what is the audience
 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.770
it's thinking about what is the audience
of your game or your app and in the

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780
of your game or your app and in the
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.569
of your game or your app and in the
context of this discussion what I mean

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579
context of this discussion what I mean
 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.670
context of this discussion what I mean
by audience I'm really talking about all

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680
by audience I'm really talking about all
 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.620
by audience I'm really talking about all
of the Android users around the entire

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630
of the Android users around the entire
 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.569
of the Android users around the entire
globe who have your game or your app

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579
globe who have your game or your app
 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.759
globe who have your game or your app
installed and if you think about that

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769
installed and if you think about that
 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.650
installed and if you think about that
audience you can start to break it apart

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660
audience you can start to break it apart
 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.479
audience you can start to break it apart
into two different sections the first

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489
into two different sections the first
 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.970
into two different sections the first
being your active users whether your

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980
being your active users whether your
 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.860
being your active users whether your
most meaningful unit of time is daily

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870
most meaningful unit of time is daily
 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.770
most meaningful unit of time is daily
weekly or monthly who are those users

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780
weekly or monthly who are those users
 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.240
weekly or monthly who are those users
that are coming back at that frequency

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250
that are coming back at that frequency
 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.910
that are coming back at that frequency
and on the opposite side they

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920
and on the opposite side they
 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.380
and on the opposite side they
you have all of those users who churned

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390
you have all of those users who churned
 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.240
you have all of those users who churned
out of your app they haven't been active

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250
out of your app they haven't been active
 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.920
out of your app they haven't been active
in the recent past but they do still

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930
in the recent past but they do still
 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.990
in the recent past but they do still
have it installed on their device so

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
have it installed on their device so
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.760
have it installed on their device so
they do make up that full kind of your

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770
they do make up that full kind of your
 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.040
they do make up that full kind of your
audience portion and then each of these

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050
audience portion and then each of these
 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.170
audience portion and then each of these
you can decompose even further your

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180
you can decompose even further your
 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.360
you can decompose even further your
active users this is largely the new

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370
active users this is largely the new
 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.860
active users this is largely the new
users who coming into your app of your

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870
users who coming into your app of your
 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.050
users who coming into your app of your
game for the very first time each day or

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060
game for the very first time each day or
 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.600
game for the very first time each day or
the returning users your regular users

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610
the returning users your regular users
 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.190
the returning users your regular users
who are coming back on a frequent basis

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200
who are coming back on a frequent basis
 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.170
who are coming back on a frequent basis
and on the flip side when we think about

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180
and on the flip side when we think about
 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.120
and on the flip side when we think about
those churned users it's really

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130
those churned users it's really
 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.100
those churned users it's really
important to understand what's

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110
important to understand what's
 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.900
important to understand what's
potentially driving them out of the game

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910
potentially driving them out of the game
 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.030
potentially driving them out of the game
what kind of technical performance

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040
what kind of technical performance
 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.250
what kind of technical performance
issues were maybe causing a poor user

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260
issues were maybe causing a poor user
 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.290
issues were maybe causing a poor user
experience causing them to leave the app

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300
experience causing them to leave the app
 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.650

and so what our team has been doing is

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660
and so what our team has been doing is
 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.590
and so what our team has been doing is
working really hard to uncover a lot of

in core metrics so these are the really

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290
in core metrics so these are the really
 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.460
in core metrics so these are the really
really fundamental foundational metrics

model I used to be an app developer we

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310
model I used to be an app developer we
 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.190
model I used to be an app developer we
used to use these to really understand

how we could optimize our businesses but
any model like this is only as useful as

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360
any model like this is only as useful as
 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.420
any model like this is only as useful as
the data that you plug into it because

the data that you plug into it because
it's a great way of thinking but to make

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380
it's a great way of thinking but to make
 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.710
it's a great way of thinking but to make
it work for you you need fantastic

metrics now when I look at this I could

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210
metrics now when I look at this I could
 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.090
metrics now when I look at this I could
already see parts of the model that

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100
already see parts of the model that
 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.980
already see parts of the model that
frankly the play console right now is

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990
frankly the play console right now is
 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.260
frankly the play console right now is
not great at giving you data for

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270
not great at giving you data for
 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.320
not great at giving you data for
returning users for instance today you

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330
returning users for instance today you
 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.270
returning users for instance today you
can't get returning user data in the

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280
can't get returning user data in the
 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.700
can't get returning user data in the
console and that's a problem it's a

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710
console and that's a problem it's a
 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.500
console and that's a problem it's a
problem because the app ecosystem has

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510
problem because the app ecosystem has
 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.380
problem because the app ecosystem has
evolved and moved on when we look at

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390
evolved and moved on when we look at
 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.960
evolved and moved on when we look at
global data we see that on average

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970
global data we see that on average
 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.620
global data we see that on average
between 20 and 25% of all installs are

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630
between 20 and 25% of all installs are
 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.170
between 20 and 25% of all installs are
returning installers these are people

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180
returning installers these are people
 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.390
returning installers these are people
who have installed you before

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400
who have installed you before
 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.770
who have installed you before
uninstalled and decided to give you a

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780
uninstalled and decided to give you a
 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.030
uninstalled and decided to give you a
second go that's an average

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040
second go that's an average
 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.950
second go that's an average
well so for some of you that percentage

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960
well so for some of you that percentage
 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.320
well so for some of you that percentage
is going to be much much higher if you

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330
is going to be much much higher if you
 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.540
is going to be much much higher if you
want to understand your active users and

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550
want to understand your active users and
 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.160
want to understand your active users and
how you acquire users you need to

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170
how you acquire users you need to
 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.860
how you acquire users you need to
understand these kind of metrics

metrics and it's also as saying that all

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:44.860
metrics and it's also as saying that all
 

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.780
metrics and it's also as saying that all
of these subscribe to a very stringent

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:48.790
of these subscribe to a very stringent
 

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.940
of these subscribe to a very stringent
user privacy as well so we're doing this

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:50.950
user privacy as well so we're doing this
 

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.769
user privacy as well so we're doing this
within the bounds of Android strong

privacy models now we've taken the the
way to think about these metrics we've

00:09:58.889 --> 00:09:58.899
way to think about these metrics we've
 

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:01.500
way to think about these metrics we've
instituted it directly into these stats

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:01.510

page this is one of the most powerful
 

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.670
page this is one of the most powerful
metric page on the console so just like

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680
metric page on the console so just like
 

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.710

today you'll be able to select up to two
metrics that you can compare but then we

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839
metrics that you can compare but then we
 

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:12.449

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.040
be much more powerful of developers to
actually see how they compared against

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.050
actually see how they compared against
 

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.260
actually see how they compared against
their top peers right I completely get

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:21.270
their top peers right I completely get
 

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.080
their top peers right I completely get
that and you know thanks for bingling

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.090
that and you know thanks for bingling
 

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.760
that and you know thanks for bingling
yeah so your data is always useful to

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:25.770
yeah so your data is always useful to
 

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.950
yeah so your data is always useful to
you but context is even more useful

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:27.960
you but context is even more useful
 

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.320
you but context is even more useful
because context helps you understand

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.330
because context helps you understand
 

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.480
because context helps you understand
what your data looks like compared to a

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:32.490
what your data looks like compared to a
 

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.220
what your data looks like compared to a
much much broader ecosystem of

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:34.230
much much broader ecosystem of
 

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.890
much much broader ecosystem of
information now this leads us on to what

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:36.900
information now this leads us on to what
 

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.340
information now this leads us on to what
I think is a amazing fantastic product I

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:40.350
I think is a amazing fantastic product I
 

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.050
I think is a amazing fantastic product I
could talk about it for ages but I'm not

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.060
could talk about it for ages but I'm not
 

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.000
could talk about it for ages but I'm not
the best person to do so because Karina

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.010
the best person to do so because Karina
 

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.770
the best person to do so because Karina
here has been leading our teams working

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:45.780
here has been leading our teams working
 

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.900
here has been leading our teams working
on ecosystem benchmarks so I'd like to

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:47.910
on ecosystem benchmarks so I'd like to
 

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.280
on ecosystem benchmarks so I'd like to
hand over to her to tell you all about

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:49.290
hand over to her to tell you all about
 

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:57.440
hand over to her to tell you all about
them thanks Tom hi everyone I'm Karina

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.450
them thanks Tom hi everyone I'm Karina
 

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.570
them thanks Tom hi everyone I'm Karina
and I'm an engineer on the Play console

00:13:59.570 --> 00:13:59.580
and I'm an engineer on the Play console
 

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.030
and I'm an engineer on the Play console
so I'll tell you about some of the great

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040
so I'll tell you about some of the great
 

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.450
so I'll tell you about some of the great
insights you can get from benchmarks now

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:05.460
insights you can get from benchmarks now
 

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.450
insights you can get from benchmarks now
as Adam and Don mentioned imagine you're

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:08.460
as Adam and Don mentioned imagine you're
 

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.190
as Adam and Don mentioned imagine you're
trying to assess how your app is doing

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200
trying to assess how your app is doing
 

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.010
trying to assess how your app is doing
so go in the Play console and you look

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:13.020
so go in the Play console and you look
 

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.480
so go in the Play console and you look
for instance at your user acquisition

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:14.490
for instance at your user acquisition
 

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.170
for instance at your user acquisition
and your user loss if this is what you

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180
and your user loss if this is what you
 

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.500
and your user loss if this is what you
see what do these graphs tell you well

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:21.510
see what do these graphs tell you well
 

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.050
see what do these graphs tell you well
your user acquisition is going up so

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060
your user acquisition is going up so
 

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.790
your user acquisition is going up so
that's good right that means you're

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800
that's good right that means you're
 

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.820
that's good right that means you're
doing well but your user loss is also

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:28.830
doing well but your user loss is also
 

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.520
doing well but your user loss is also
going up so what does that mean maybe

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:31.530
going up so what does that mean maybe
 

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.350
going up so what does that mean maybe
that's not so good because you'd ideally

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360
that's not so good because you'd ideally
 

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.100
that's not so good because you'd ideally
want to retain user and not lose them

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:36.110
want to retain user and not lose them
 

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.930
want to retain user and not lose them
this is where benchmarks can be very

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940
this is where benchmarks can be very
 

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.450
this is where benchmarks can be very
useful because they cannot context to

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:41.460
useful because they cannot context to
 

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.160
useful because they cannot context to
these numbers and help you evaluate

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.170
these numbers and help you evaluate
 

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.220
these numbers and help you evaluate
these trends now let's look at your

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:46.230
these trends now let's look at your
 

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.500
these trends now let's look at your
performance if we compare it next to a

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:48.510
performance if we compare it next to a
 

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.520
performance if we compare it next to a
benchmark in this case you can see that

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:52.530
benchmark in this case you can see that
 

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.350
benchmark in this case you can see that
your acquisition is not only doing well

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360
your acquisition is not only doing well
 

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.990
your acquisition is not only doing well
it's actually doing really well because

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000
it's actually doing really well because
 

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.030
it's actually doing really well because
your acquisition is going upwards even

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040
your acquisition is going upwards even
 

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.240
your acquisition is going upwards even
though the benchmark is going downwards

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.250
though the benchmark is going downwards
 

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.920
though the benchmark is going downwards
this means you're doing much better in

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:03.930
this means you're doing much better in
 

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.930
this means you're doing much better in
this area so it's a good reason for you

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940
this area so it's a good reason for you
 

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.330
this area so it's a good reason for you
to celebrate and probably not invest or

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:08.340
to celebrate and probably not invest or
 

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.140
to celebrate and probably not invest or
focus too much and for user loss you

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.150
focus too much and for user loss you
 

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.630
focus too much and for user loss you
also see a positive sign this time

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:14.640
also see a positive sign this time
 

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.730
also see a positive sign this time
because even though it is going upwards

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740
because even though it is going upwards
 

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.130
because even though it is going upwards
it's doing so at a slower rate than the

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:19.140
it's doing so at a slower rate than the
 

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.069
it's doing so at a slower rate than the
benchmark and this is where I find that

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079
benchmark and this is where I find that
 

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:23.360
benchmark and this is where I find that
benchmarks can give you really

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:23.370
benchmarks can give you really
 

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.910
benchmarks can give you really
interesting insights what this probably

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920
interesting insights what this probably
 

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.889
interesting insights what this probably
means is that there is limited

00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899
means is that there is limited
 

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:30.290
means is that there is limited
opportunity in the market in this area

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300
opportunity in the market in this area
 

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.389
opportunity in the market in this area
because the trend that you see it's

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399
because the trend that you see it's
 

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.699
because the trend that you see it's
common to the wider market and it's not

00:15:34.699 --> 00:15:34.709
common to the wider market and it's not
 

00:15:34.709 --> 00:15:37.060
common to the wider market and it's not
something that is specific to your app

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:37.070
something that is specific to your app
 

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.100
something that is specific to your app
so in this example you can see how

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:40.110
so in this example you can see how
 

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.990
so in this example you can see how
benchmarks help you get an overall

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000
benchmarks help you get an overall
 

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.560
benchmarks help you get an overall
positive picture of your performance but

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:45.570
positive picture of your performance but
 

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.660
positive picture of your performance but
now imagine that your performance is

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:47.670
now imagine that your performance is
 

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.180
now imagine that your performance is
still exactly the same and the benchmark

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:50.190
still exactly the same and the benchmark
 

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.780
still exactly the same and the benchmark
instead looks like this in this case

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:53.790
instead looks like this in this case
 

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.690
instead looks like this in this case
your acquisition is going upwards but

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:56.700
your acquisition is going upwards but
 

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.819
your acquisition is going upwards but
it's doing so at a slower rate than the

00:15:58.819 --> 00:15:58.829
it's doing so at a slower rate than the
 

00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:01.400
it's doing so at a slower rate than the
benchmark now the difference might be

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:01.410
benchmark now the difference might be
 

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.069
benchmark now the difference might be
pretty tiny today but if this trend

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079
pretty tiny today but if this trend
 

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:06.259
pretty tiny today but if this trend
continues that difference will increase

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:06.269
continues that difference will increase
 

00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:08.690
continues that difference will increase
so you probably want to monitor this

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:08.700
so you probably want to monitor this
 

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.940
so you probably want to monitor this
area and start thinking about how you

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:10.950
area and start thinking about how you
 

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.210
area and start thinking about how you
can address it and this time you user

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220
can address it and this time you user
 

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.519
can address it and this time you user
loss is actually not doing that well

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:16.529
loss is actually not doing that well
 

00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:19.040
loss is actually not doing that well
because your user loss is going upwards

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.050
because your user loss is going upwards
 

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.350
because your user loss is going upwards
but the benchmark is going downwards in

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360
but the benchmark is going downwards in
 

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.710
but the benchmark is going downwards in
this area this shows that there's a big

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720
this area this shows that there's a big
 

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.600
this area this shows that there's a big
opportunity here for you and a lot of

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:26.610
opportunity here for you and a lot of
 

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.480
opportunity here for you and a lot of
headroom for improvement and this is

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:29.490
headroom for improvement and this is
 

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.189
headroom for improvement and this is
exactly what benchmarks highlight in

00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199
exactly what benchmarks highlight in
 

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.470
exactly what benchmarks highlight in
these examples the areas with

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480
these examples the areas with
 

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.870
these examples the areas with
opportunity in the market and how large

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880
opportunity in the market and how large
 

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.420
opportunity in the market and how large
these opportunities are so it can

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:38.430
these opportunities are so it can
 

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.069
these opportunities are so it can
hopefully help you prioritize the things

00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079
hopefully help you prioritize the things
 

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:42.400
hopefully help you prioritize the things
you want to focus on next

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:42.410
you want to focus on next
 

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.000
you want to focus on next
but there's one challenge in benchmarks

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.010
but there's one challenge in benchmarks
 

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.319
but there's one challenge in benchmarks
comparing absolute numbers of

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.740
configurations that Tom mentioned
earlier and we will also add benchmarks

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:12.750
earlier and we will also add benchmarks
 

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.590
earlier and we will also add benchmarks
all of these change rates and hopefully

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600
all of these change rates and hopefully
 

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.929
all of these change rates and hopefully
with all these additions we'll be able

00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939
with all these additions we'll be able
 

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:20.000
with all these additions we'll be able
to give you better context on how your

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.010
to give you better context on how your
 

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.220
to give you better context on how your
app grows over time but also a

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:22.230
app grows over time but also a
 

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.409
app grows over time but also a
meaningful comparison that you can use

00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419
meaningful comparison that you can use
 

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:28.189
meaningful comparison that you can use
to assess that growth so in all this is

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199
to assess that growth so in all this is
 

00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:28.879
to assess that growth so in all this is
a

00:17:28.879 --> 00:17:28.889
a

here's some example of the kind of

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:30.870
here's some example of the kind of
 

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.899
here's some example of the kind of
insight and analysis you'll be able to

00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:32.909
insight and analysis you'll be able to
 

00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:35.990
insight and analysis you'll be able to
get from the play console for instance

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000
get from the play console for instance

you'll be able to compare how quickly

00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039
you'll be able to compare how quickly
 

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:40.639
you'll be able to compare how quickly
you're acquiring users or you'll be able

00:17:40.639 --> 00:17:40.649
you're acquiring users or you'll be able
 

00:17:40.649 --> 00:17:42.619
you're acquiring users or you'll be able
to check if your uninstall rates are

00:17:42.619 --> 00:17:42.629
to check if your uninstall rates are
 

00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:45.919
to check if your uninstall rates are
abnormally high or even compare how your

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:45.929
abnormally high or even compare how your
 

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:48.230
abnormally high or even compare how your
growth performs versus the benchmark in

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240
growth performs versus the benchmark in
 

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.539
growth performs versus the benchmark in
specific countries or in some specific

00:17:50.539 --> 00:17:50.549
specific countries or in some specific
 

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:52.249
specific countries or in some specific
devices so like benchmarks are really

00:17:52.249 --> 00:17:52.259
devices so like benchmarks are really
 

00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:54.200
devices so like benchmarks are really
cool but they're only as valuable as a

actionable insights I think that's a

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:02.580
actionable insights I think that's a
 

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.919
actionable insights I think that's a
great point and that's where I

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:03.929
great point and that's where I
 

00:18:03.929 --> 00:18:05.690

personally find benchmarks really

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700
personally find benchmarks really
 

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.269

do so with very strong privacy
 

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:42.440
do so with very strong privacy
protection so no individual app or games

social apps to streaming media so you'll

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:00.450
social apps to streaming media so you'll
 

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.779
social apps to streaming media so you'll
be able to compare your growth to a

00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:02.789
be able to compare your growth to a
 

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:05.149
be able to compare your growth to a
benchmark performance computed on a very

actually looks like and what I'm hoping
is that you guys are going to be able to

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.150
is that you guys are going to be able to
 

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:37.460
is that you guys are going to be able to

partners for that program was that they
 

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.220
partners for that program was that they
didn't know whether this metric was good

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:43.230
didn't know whether this metric was good
 

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.680
didn't know whether this metric was good
or bad and that's why when we first

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:45.690
or bad and that's why when we first
 

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.870
