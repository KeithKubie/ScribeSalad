00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.960
Okay.
We're coming to the end of this

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.220
short course.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.840
Here, I want to show you the SPECS
acronym one more time and

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.230
the five ideas it helps us remember.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.720
It may be helpful to write these
down on a piece of paper and

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.910
stick it someplace close
to your computer, so

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.100
you can remind yourself of these when
you are actually doing code reviews.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.307
Now before we end,

00:00:20.307 --> 00:00:24.461
I want to share with you a few
reviews that we think are excellent.

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:28.467
These reviews incorporate all of the
five ideas from the acronym SPECS that

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:32.345
we've been talking about in this course
and will give you a benchmark for

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:35.539
the kind of quality that we're
looking for in our reviews.

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.230
So skip ahead to read some of these
reviews that we consider to be stellar.
