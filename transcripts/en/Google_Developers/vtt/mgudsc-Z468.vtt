SUNIL VEMURI: Hello everyone.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.905
My name is Sunil,
and this is Barnaby.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:06.980
BARNABY JAMES: Hi.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.229
SUNIL VEMURI: I'm a product
manager on the voice team.

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.980
Barnaby is a software
engineer, our technology leader

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.190
on the team.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.460
We're here to talk to you about
what Google does with voice.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.389
And one of the
interesting things

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:23.430
with this conference that,
at least, I've noticed

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.770
is so many of the
talks that came

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.950
prior to this mention Voice.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.370
In the keynote yesterday,
you heard about Voice

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.110
in things like Brillo,
and even this morning, we

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.380
heard about how Voice is used in
Android Wear and Android Auto.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.470
We want to use this
time as an opportunity

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.270
to tell you a little bit
more about what Google does

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.830
with Voice, its
capabilities, and also

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.810
mention a little bit about some
of the developer facing tools

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.740
that we have where you can
use Google's voice capability

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.980
to build products on this.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.740
So as we're going
through this talk,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.040
we'll give an overview
of what we can do.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.640
But I'd love for you to keep
in mind one of the things

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.380
that you are building or how you
envision voice, and at the end,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.120
either now or we have office
hours afterward as well,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.620
we'd love to hear from you about
what are some of the things

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.880
that you would love to
do with Voice as well.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.030
So with that, let
me get into it.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.820
You might have
seen this already,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.584
but this is some of
the things we can do.

00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:31.250

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.810
-It's not going to
fit up the stairs.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.540
-What time does Goodwill close?

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.900
-Goodwill is open until 9:00 PM.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.400
SUNIL VEMURI: Let's
start that over.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.275
-Lift with your legs.

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:42.696
-It's not going to
fit up the stairs.

00:01:42.696 --> 00:01:44.410
-What time does Goodwill close?

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.940
-Goodwill is open until 9:00 PM.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.570
-Show me a moving
company nearby.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.420
-Moving company
within six miles.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.800
-How do I get to
3221 Carter Ave.?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.180
-326 High Street.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.460
-Here are your directions.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.160
-When does my package arrive?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.900
-Your most recent
order has shipped.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.940
-Thank you.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.290
-Setting new home address.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.550
-Text Mom.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.260
-I really like it here.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.271
SUNIL VEMURI: Set a
timer for 20 minutes.

00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:15.679
GOOGLE NOW: OK, 20 minutes.

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.179
Starting.

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:22.490
SUNIL VEMURI: All right
that's how much time I have,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.406
so that we have time for
questions at the end.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.600
So let me back up a bit
before I talk about Voice.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.970
Let's go back to our
original mission here.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.970
We were founded to connect
users to information,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.910
and it started with
the web searching.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.230
You go to a desktop browser,
you type in a query,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.540
and get to a
particular destination.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.610
But nowadays, as we're seeing
more and more emerging devices,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.770
and mobility is becoming
increasingly important,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.470
the ways that users are
wanting to interface

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.670
with their technology
is changing.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.319
And so this is why Voice is
an example of something that's

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.360
important to us, and why
it's important to Google

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.350
to invest in this area, to
provide new ways for people

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.100
to interface with their devices.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.440
So we get a lot of traffic.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.774
Huge amounts of traffic.

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:19.690
And the other thing
that's happening over time

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.030
is more and more of this
thing is becoming mobile.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.390
Again, we started with
desktop, but there's

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.830
countries like US
and Japan where

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.960
the majority of the
traffic is coming in

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.080
on our mobile devices, and
that trend is continuing.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.780
So again, more and
more reasons for us

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.910
to find ways to give users the
way to express what they want,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.700
and use Google as the
conduit to get to places.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.160
And in many times,
the destination

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.392
of these are things
that you built.

00:03:47.392 --> 00:03:49.350
Websites that you have,
information you provide

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.790
services that you provide.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.460
Having a much more
seamless experience

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.980
where a user wants
to ask for something,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.290
and get to that destination,
and get to that answer,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.140
is one of our goals.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.050
So now let's talk a
little bit about Voice.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.090
We did a study, a little
survey, a little while ago.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.860
And we learned some things
about how people are using Voice

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.341
and who is using Voice.

00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:15.090
So for example, one
of the things we found

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.390
is that teens are using
Voice more than adults.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.510
So not only are we seeing more
and more applications embracing

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.510
Voice, we're seeing that
the younger generation are

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.640
using more and more Voice
in the types of things

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.530
that they're doing
with technology.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.290
So when we drill into this, what
are people doing with Voice?

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.790
So we see a little
bit of difference

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.390
between teens and adults.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.540
Asking for directions is common.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.775
But teens are using it to
help with their homework.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.180
I know my children ask their
technology for questions,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.220
like who is the president
at a particular time,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.320
or things like that.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.730
So we're seeing more and
more examples of the younger

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.830
generation using this.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.640
For messaging, however, adults
are using Voice a little bit

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.450
more.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.560
So there are a
variety of ways where

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.570
we see Voice is increasingly
used for a number of purposes,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.360
and also the difference
between the ages.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.931
So when are people
using Voice search?

00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:21.430
There a number of
interesting things

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.300
here about where this is taking
place and some differences

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.265
between teens and adults, also.

00:05:26.265 --> 00:05:28.390
But the one thing here that
kind of stood out to us

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.670
is this thing in the bathroom.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.300
OK.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.040
So we don't know why exactly,
and I've asked some people why.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.870
If any of you have
ideas about this,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.230
if you're using voice
technologies-- doesn't have

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.480
to be ours-- in
the bathroom, I'd

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.910
love to hear a little
bit more about it.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.965
Yeah you have a question?

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:51.657
AUDIENCE: How do you know
they're in the bathroom?

00:05:51.657 --> 00:05:53.240
SUNIL VEMURI: That's
a great question,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.100
and I have a very
un-creepy answer to this.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.140
We ask them.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.005
So hopefully I'm not
violating any confidentiality

00:06:05.005 --> 00:06:06.630
saying we do not have
a technology that

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.202
detects when people are
in about the bathroom.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.868
I'm sorry could you
repeat the question.

00:06:10.868 --> 00:06:11.784
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:15.153 --> 00:06:17.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.620
SUNIL VEMURI: You know, we're
going to repeat and update

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.200
this survey.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.490
I'll make sure we come up
with some way of metricing

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.920
the honesty on this one.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.300
But yes, the
bathroom seems to be

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.814
an important place for Voice.

00:06:34.814 --> 00:06:36.730
So here's where we have
the idea section here.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.110
What do people want
to use Voice for?

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.550
Pizza, find the remote,
and find the keys.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.500
So this might give some
interesting product

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.210
ideas for any of you,
which is the ability

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.860
to order a pizza while
you're in the bathroom.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.300
So this is the direction Voice
may be going, I don't know.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.580
But hopefully it'll inspire
some great minds out there.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.440
And hopefully by the
end of this talk,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.940
you'll see we have
some of the tools

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.250
necessary to build
some of these things.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.330
And hopefully maybe
somebody in this audience

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.940
will take up one of
these tasks of building

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.540
a product like this.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.500
So that's how people
are using Voice.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.580
Now let me pause for a moment
here and talk about something

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.750
that we at Google have built
out over the years that helped

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.194
and able some of this.

00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:29.110
And this is what's called
the Knowledge Graph.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.280
Now this technology
isn't just for Voice.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.340
It's applied for a number
of different projects

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.790
within Google, but voice is
one of the beneficiaries of it.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.610
So what is the Knowledge Graph?

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.520
This is a technology that
has information about things

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.490
and the relationships
between things.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.280
So, for example, we know the
Eiffel Tower is a building.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.240
It's a structure.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.479
And there are other
structures that might

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:53.770
be related to the Eiffel Tower.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.510
The Eiffel tower
has some properties,

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.560
like its height
and its location.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.450
So knowing that the
Eiffel Tower isn't just

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.670
a sequence of characters,
but is a thing,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.480
and it has these
other properties,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.880
helps us figure out when
we hear a query, what

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.030
is the intent of it and
what is the relationship

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.480
of that piece of information
to other things out there.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.460
So let me give you
an example that

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.180
illustrates what the benefit
of Knowledge Graph is,

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.990
and how it connects to Voice.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.480
Suppose I gave this query.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.010
Who wrote the Declaration
of Independence?

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.890
Well, hopefully,
it's not too unknown.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:30.870
It's Thomas Jefferson.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.190
He wrote the Declaration
of Independence,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.409
among others by the way.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.679
Now, a voice query like this.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.450
How old was he when he died?

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.090
And I didn't say how old was
Thomas Jefferson when he died,

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.110
how old was he when he died.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.800
Well if we did something
like this, what would we get?

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.240
Thomas Jefferson
died when he was 83.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.240
And then we see these
other bits of information,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.920
for example, the presidents.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.970
So this is where the
Knowledge Graph came in.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.220
It knew that Thomas
Jefferson was a president,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.700
there's some metadata
information about him,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.200
and there's a relationship
to these other people that

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.450
are listed here, including
Ben Franklin, who

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.750
was not a president here.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.090
So those relationships are
encoded within the Knowledge

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.340
Graph.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.460
OK.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.100
So now let's continue
this a little bit.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.510
On what day did he die?

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.230
So does anybody know what
date Thomas Jefferson died?

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.110
Or where I'm going with this?

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.840
July 4, there we go.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.580
So July 4, 1826.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.450
That's when Thomas
Jefferson died.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.280
And again, I didn't say what
David Thomas Jefferson die.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.730
What day did he die?

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.210
And this gets into how people
want to speak naturally.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.490
When we speak, we
don't reformulate

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.200
every detail of every
query, and resolve

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.110
all the pronouns, et cetera.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.440
We want to be able
to speak naturally.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.500
And the Google Engine is
capable of these things.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.260
Now, these may be things you
haven't tried as much as some

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.940
of your other queries, but
that capability is there.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.200
And I wanted to illustrate
this is the kind of engine

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.700
that we are working with.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.420
And the world-class
capability that's

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.081
underlying some of
our technology here.

00:10:08.081 --> 00:10:08.580
OK.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.190
Well, I've got another
trivia bit for you.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.570
How about John Adams?

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.735
Anybody know this?

00:10:13.735 --> 00:10:14.010
AUDIENCE: Same day.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:14.968
SUNIL VEMURI: Same day.

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:16.150
Exactly.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.940
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams
died exactly the same day.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.580
July 4.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.110
So interesting bit
of trivia here,

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.890
that may be the one thing
you take away from this,

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:27.894
I hope it's not.

00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:29.810
But as many of you who
have done presentations

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.490
knows, sometimes
that's the way it goes.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.660
OK.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.890
So that is what
the Knowledge Graph

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.900
gave as part of this thing,
as part of our underlying

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.570
technology here.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.380
Let me take a moment to
say a little bit more

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.250
about our speech
capabilities here.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.240
Now, at Iowa this year,
Sundar Pachai, our CEO,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.450
gave some some statistics about
how our speech recognition

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.000
technology has improved.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.700
So the word error rate--
one of the metrics

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.060
we use to determine how
well a speech recognition

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.700
engine works, like
how many errors you

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.950
get per, say, 100 words--
has improved from 20% percent

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.220
to 8%.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.190
At the time of Iowa,
that's what we reported.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.930
At that level, now we're
getting into a technology

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.010
that can really be
used in a greater

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.610
number of circumstances.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.990
If any of you who have either
played in the speech field

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.640
or worked in the speech
field, even decades ago,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.490
you know it was relegated
to certain niche areas.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.370
Or for certain fun things,
you can get a little program

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.120
on your computer, talk
to it a little bit,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.160
but it was still hard to use.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.070
Nowadays, with this
level of performance,

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.980
we can really build valuable
products out of this.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.729
And that's another area that
Google has invested a lot in.

00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:51.270
But it's not just
our word error rate

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.561
that's improved over the years.

00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:55.290
We've also increased the number
of languages that we support.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.840
Over 20 languages, in fact,
we can handle that speech

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.960
at this point.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.230
So it's becoming much
more widely accessible.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.820
Back in the day, you'd have to
do training of these things.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.072
That isn't the case anymore.

00:12:07.072 --> 00:12:09.030
There have been lots of
advancements in speech,

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.260
and now it's at the time
where you can actually build

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.570
valuable products off of it.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.030
Now, in a moment
Barnaby is going

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.610
to be talking a little bit
about our developer program,

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.410
and our APIs, and
how those work,

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.650
so you can get a sense as
to how people can build off

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.180
of these things, and
examples of developers

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.810
who have built some things.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.670
Before we do that,
let me just give you

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.860
a last little bit of overview
of how some of this works.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:40.180
So typically, they speak
into the Google microphone.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.480
And in this case, it's
on an Android phone.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.000
They speak into that, we
do the speech to text.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.540
We also have a natural language
processing capability that

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.810
interprets what that query was.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:51.800
What does it mean?

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.940
What is the user trying to do?

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.190
And we use the Knowledge Graph
to help figure out and resolve

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.420
these questions of what are
the things that the users are

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.820
asking for.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.170
And in some cases, this
thing goes back to Google,

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.200
and we show results.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.241
Like in the case of the
Thomas Jefferson example,

00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:13.060
that was Google that
providing the answer.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.620
But now, what if
you have the answer?

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.907
Or your service is the one
that can produce a result here?

00:13:18.907 --> 00:13:20.990
This is the part this is
the next part of the talk

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.200
that we're getting into.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.170
How do you inform Google
about your capabilities

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.690
so that you can be the
one that gives the answer?

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.120
I want to give one
last bit here before I

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.700
pass the mic for a while.

00:13:38.925 --> 00:13:41.550
Now, there is speech recognition
and there's the interpretation

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.674
of the speech.

00:13:42.674 --> 00:13:44.340
We've had the Android
speech recognition

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.350
API for some time now.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:51.250
And what this does is,
on an Android device,

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.250
you start the speech
recognizer, and then you

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.900
say just report back
to me what was said.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.890
Here, that's essentially
like a transcript.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.020
Here are the words
that the user says.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.720
It says little about
the interpretation

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.730
of what those words
or what should be done

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.500
as a result of those words.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.950
So this is the first
API that's been around.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.920
And over the past
year or so, we've

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.200
been introducing new APIs that
allowed it to do much more.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.490
Let me pass it to Barnaby.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.240
BARNABY JAMES: Hi.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.650
So we've been steadily
adding voice action APIs that

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.850
let you extend
what the system is

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.890
able to do by completing the
actions inside of your Android

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.149
apps.

00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:30.440
So this kind of breaks down
into three different areas.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.570
System actions, custom actions,
and the voice interaction API.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.570
I'll be talking about all three.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.190
So System Voice
Actions are a sort

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.260
of standard set of common
cases of things that people

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.650
want to do with their phones.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.010
And Google defines the
grammars and then defines

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.770
an API that we will call out
to your app to let you actually

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:49.739
complete the action.

00:14:49.739 --> 00:14:51.530
Here's an example of
someone playing music,

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.660
but it could be things
like setting alarms

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.440
or other common use cases.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.590
Here's a set of
examples, there's

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.990
actually more than this, but
fitness, media, communications,

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.990
messaging, things like
that, search within an app.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.840
So how do you
implement one of these?

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.046
For some cases, it's
actually really, really easy.

00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:09.420
In-app search is
one where we try

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.370
to make it as easy as possible.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.360
If you use the
Android search widget,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.950
you pretty much just have to add
that one line, or four lines,

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.960
I guess, to your
activity intent filter

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.350
that says I can handle the
special kind of search that

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:29.460
comes from the Android
Google search assistant.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.110
And when you say, OK, Google,
search for hotels in Maui

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.620
on TripAdvisor, we do all the
natural language understanding,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.530
and different ways you
may phrase that query,

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.320
and express it as an action that
you want to take semantically,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.770
and then a set of parameters,
in this case, a query hotels

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.820
in Maui, and the app that we're
going to target that intent to.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.420
Similarly, if you
say, "play music,"

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.870
maybe say, "play
classical music,"

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.340
maybe say "play a
specific song or artist,"

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.090
natural language
understanding figures out

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.530
what specific artist it was, no
matter how the user phrases it.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.500
And you get this
common command that

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.670
expresses what the
user's intention was,

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.530
and then a set of extras that
describe more the parameters.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.014
So in this case, it's a
genre, it's classical,

00:16:09.014 --> 00:16:10.430
and the query was
classical music.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.400
If it was an artist,
we would have

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.240
a way of telling you
the specific song

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.630
or a specific artist that
was actually referring to.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.389
But sometimes, the
common use cases

00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:21.680
are not going to cover what
you want to do in your app.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.660
You may have something that's
special to your app, where

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.076
the way that you
want to say it is

00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:29.469
going to be specific to your
application terminology.

00:16:29.469 --> 00:16:31.760
So we started this program
called Custom Voice Actions,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.550
in which you can work with
Google to define actions that

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.320
are available in your specific
app and nobody else's.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.310
So here is an example.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.650
Show me restaurants
nearby on TripAdvisor.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.200
And the way this
works is you provide

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.149
us examples of the action
that you want to do.

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:49.940
So I might say, "start
my car," but there's

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.398
multiple different
parameter types.

00:16:51.398 --> 00:16:53.769
Google Car, driver-less
cars, self driving car.

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:55.560
And then we use the
Google natural language

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.490
understanding to generalize
ways that people might say that.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.900
So "please start my car,"
"warm up my Google car,"

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.701
or "start the driver-less
car," and make

00:17:02.701 --> 00:17:04.200
it a more general
thing that's going

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.730
to be able to
trigger in more cases

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.000
than if we just use the one
example that you give us.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.349
So more than 1,000
apps have implemented

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:18.230
these kind of Voice Actions,
from media to in-app search,

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.359
and we recently
did an integration

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.650
with a bunch of messaging apps.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:26.650
So the messages
are actually sent

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.150
in WhatsApp versus just
sending it through SMS.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.650
OK.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.745
So in Android M, we have a new
API called voice interaction

00:17:33.745 --> 00:17:34.369
API.

00:17:34.369 --> 00:17:36.660
And the idea here is, everything
I've talked about thus

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.440
far just gets you into your
app, and at that point,

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.740
the voice experience stops
from your perspective.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.360
So we go into your
app, but you don't

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.700
have any way of interacting with
the users through their voice.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.430
In a lot of cases, you're either
going to complete the action,

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:52.750
or you're just going to show a
touch UI that you're expecting

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.180
the user to interact with.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.730
So the voice
interaction API lets

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:00.130
you know that the action was
triggered by the user's voice,

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.660
ask back and forth questions to
clarify what it was they meant,

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.540
and then tell the user what
it was they actually did.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.190
And you're able to do all
of this with the screen off.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.235
So to follow on to
Bill's the example.

00:18:12.235 --> 00:18:13.110
We've all been there.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.568
You're in the
bathtub, and you want

00:18:14.568 --> 00:18:16.800
to turn on the
alarm in your house.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.540
So in Custom Voice
Actions, you're

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.370
able to trigger that intent.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.331
But maybe you have
multiple modes

00:18:23.331 --> 00:18:24.580
you can trigger in your house.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.620
For example, there's away
mode where you're actually

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.203
not at home, but
you're in the bathtub

00:18:28.203 --> 00:18:32.640
so you don't want it to turn
on the internal sensors, just

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.680
the external sensors.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.780
So I need to ask a
question to do that.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.710
The Scout app implements
this activity,

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.960
but if you are triggering
it as a voice interaction,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.290
you're able to ask the
question, "what mode of alarm

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.270
do you want to set?"

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.769
And then there's a
bunch of options,

00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:47.900
and they set away mode.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.867
Now it can tell us,
OK, I'm arming away.

00:18:49.867 --> 00:18:51.700
And so now even if you
can't see your phone,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.033
you know that it actually
completed that action for you.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.559
So let's see a demo on this.

00:19:04.904 --> 00:19:08.362
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:10.832
-Please select
which mode to arm.

00:19:10.832 --> 00:19:11.455
Which mode?

00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:12.830
SUNIL VEMURI: I'm
going to reset.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.330
-Away.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.830
Turn on Scout alarm.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.500
-Please select which mode.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.411
Which mode?

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:23.359
-Away.

00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:24.430
-Arming away.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.074
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:25.074 --> 00:19:26.490
SUNIL VEMURI: So
in that case, you

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.760
were in the scout alarm
app, and you're actually

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.097
having dialogue with the user.

00:19:30.097 --> 00:19:32.430
And it pretty much just looked
like the Scout alarm app,

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.930
but there's this plate at the
bottom called the voice plate.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.620
So the idea is the assistant
and your application

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.010
are sort of sharing the screen.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.020
The bit at the bottom, where
this microphone appears,

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.740
is where the Google assistant
is able to do dialogue and show

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.600
the user what the speech
recognition results are.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.850
For the top part of it, it's
actually your application

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.870
running as it normally
would, and you're

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.970
able to use this to
now control the UI

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.840
through your voice
versus just doing it

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.466
through touch interaction.

00:20:02.466 --> 00:20:03.340
So how did this work?

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.790
Is that a lot of work?

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.450
Mostly not.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.340
So you start with
a voice activity,

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.260
or maybe, in the Scout example,
it's actually just the activity

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.300
that a normal app uses, and
they added the voice experience

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.100
onto it.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.340
So you add this category
to your intent filter

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.647
that says, "hey, if I'm
triggered by voice, then

00:20:20.647 --> 00:20:22.230
we'll trigger you
in some special way,

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.070
and you advertise that
you're able to handle

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.000
this kind of interaction.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.890
Then you have a sort of
standard Android activity.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.589
You make this call to
isVoiceInteractionRoot

00:20:33.589 --> 00:20:35.880
that tells you whether or
not it's a voice interaction.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.921
If it is, you run it in
a slightly different way.

00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:41.240
Maybe if it's not, you run it as
just a regular touch activity.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.010
So what kind of
questions can I ask?

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.400
This is a confirmation question.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.220
For example, "are you sure
you want to do this?",

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.470
which is a pretty common case.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.440
If it's something that maybe we
misinterpreted what they said,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.190
or the speech recognition
was slightly off

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.200
you would make sure we're
going to actually do this.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.720
So you get this
voice interaction

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.240
and you say, "I want to make
a new confirmation question.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.980
Are you sure."

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.740
And then you specify what should
happen if they are, in fact,

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.240
sure.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.310
This flag will say whether
it was confirmed or not.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.100
Remember, you don't have to
do the speech recognition.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.980
You don't have to do the
natural language understanding.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.950
So we'll understand all
the sort of common ways

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.570
people say, "are you sure?"

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.070
Yes.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.590
OK.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.500
Make it so all these things will
actually cause it to trigger.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.500
Another common thing that
people will want to do

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.240
is pick an option.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.531
This is what the Scout app did.

00:21:25.531 --> 00:21:28.100
So say we want to
pick what kind of pet

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.914
you want to use for something.

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.330
So you specify all
of the options.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.840
You give dog, cats,
fish, and maybe

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.160
you can specify synonyms
on these as well.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.812
We'll do some amount of
matching to the options of what

00:21:38.812 --> 00:21:40.270
the user said to
actually make sure

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.950
that we pick one of the
options that are available,

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.060
but it's really ambiguous
will re-prompt the user

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.376
and say, "we're not sure
what you meant in that case."

00:21:47.376 --> 00:21:50.000
Then you say "what kind of pet?"
is the question I want to ask.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.680
And these are the options
that I want to use.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.091
And then, finally, it
says what happens when

00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:56.340
it picks one of those options.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.870
And that's when you
implement the code to say,

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:58.930
OK, a pet was selected.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.805
This is probably almost
exactly the same code

00:22:00.805 --> 00:22:02.960
as if somebody touched that
option in the list view

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.010
with their finger.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.390
So we talked about pick option
requests and confirmation

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.080
requests.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.670
Picking from a list or
confirming an action.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.722
There's also another thing
available in the API called

00:22:13.722 --> 00:22:14.430
command requests.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.432
This is a extension
that lets us add

00:22:16.432 --> 00:22:17.640
different kinds of questions.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.556
So the idea is we'll
grow the set of questions

00:22:19.556 --> 00:22:20.920
you can ask over time.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.940
Things like, maybe, ask for
a date, or pick a location.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.396
Something like that.

00:22:25.396 --> 00:22:26.770
And then there's
a set of options

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.644
here which you would
call informing the user.

00:22:28.644 --> 00:22:31.600
So when you complete something
in the Scout app, it told us

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.650
"yes, I set the
alarm to away mode,"

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.430
you want to tell
the user by voice,

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.980
because they started interaction
with voice, that "yes, I

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.100
was actually able
to complete that,"

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.350
so they know that
it's actually done.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.100
If you're just silent
and nothing happens,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.090
how is the user going
to know what happened?

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.770
And then, even more
important, if you're not

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.360
able to complete the action,
tell the user why it is.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.820
Maybe you're offline and
you're not able to complete it.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.622
Maybe you don't have
the account set up.

00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:55.830
But we want the user to know
that this didn't happen,

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.137
and now I understand why.

00:22:57.137 --> 00:22:58.720
And you could ask
follow-up questions,

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.303
but maybe it's
something where they're

00:23:00.303 --> 00:23:05.735
going to have to actually
touch the screen to do.

00:23:05.735 --> 00:23:07.860
So again, just to review,
these are the three kinds

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.740
of interactions you have.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.225
System actions for common
things, custom actions where

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:14.600
we let you define the grammar,
and then voice interaction

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.940
lets you keep that conversation
going into your app.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.440
OK.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.200
So I think we have some
time for questions,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.380
because the beeper
just went off.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.796
And just to
reiterate, we're going

00:23:23.796 --> 00:23:27.774
to doing office hours at 2:30
in the costume shop, which

00:23:27.774 --> 00:23:29.690
I didn't know where this
was so I'll tell you.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.680
If you go out the
front of the building,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.144
and you turn right on Market
Street, there's a vacant lot.

00:23:34.144 --> 00:23:35.560
In the building
right next to that

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.550
is the costume shop,
where they have code labs

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.310
and we'll be doing office hours.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.060
SUNIL VEMURI: Yep.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.440
AUDIENCE: So the
Google speech engine

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.310
is able to resolve [INAUDIBLE]
onthology granularity

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.440
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:57.920
For example, when I say find me
a driver-less car versus find

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.510
me a self-driving
car, there are two--

00:24:03.084 --> 00:24:04.500
BARNABY JAMES:
There are synonyms.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.642
AUDIENCE: A car that
doesn't require a driver.

00:24:07.642 --> 00:24:08.998
Should I could that myself?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.730
SUNIL VEMURI: So
the question was,

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.180
looking back to
the example, will

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.491
Google be able to,
I believe, determine

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:21.240
the self-driving car
and a driver-less car

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.960
are the same thing and
automatically figure

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.910
all that out?

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.250
In the example we
gave there, we showed

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.350
that the developer provides
the various common ways

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.250
of describing the same concept.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:36.710
Now, in some cases, Google
can figure out alternate ways

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.790
of saying those things.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.230
Developers won't have a lot
of transparency into knowing

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.700
what exactly those are.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.680
So in many cases, we ask
people to just give us

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.900
some of the common
examples that make sense

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.100
as synonymous ways of
saying the same thing,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.100
and then it's a better
product for the end users

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.310
if that's the case.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.810
I think I saw a
question over there.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.700
AUDIENCE: How does Google
filter out extraneous words?

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.470
So for example, I have a
friend that really, really

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.880
enjoys testing Google.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.229
He's like, OK, Google,
please plan me this.

00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:15.708
Thank you very much.

00:25:15.708 --> 00:25:17.190
I love you.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.272
Like he gives it a
very long string.

00:25:19.272 --> 00:25:24.550
How does it actually filter
out and calculate what--

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.420
SUNIL VEMURI: OK so the
question is, how do we

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.330
make Google accommodate
the politeness of our users

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.720
and verbosity.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:38.210
So the specific techniques
is beyond the scope

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.770
of what I have time to cover,
and I probably can't describe

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.030
all the techniques anyway.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.680
I can say, yes, there
are capabilities.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.690
We gave an example
where using the word

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.470
please and some other
niceties are adding articles.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.940
Those are some of the things
that are common there.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.340
Now, if your friend has run
into some cool examples where

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.176
we're failing, let us know.

00:26:01.176 --> 00:26:02.550
We want to hear
about this stuff.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.890
Because that's what
people do, right?

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:09.414
It should have
the right outcome.

00:26:09.414 --> 00:26:10.830
think I saw a
question there next.

00:26:11.812 --> 00:26:16.231
AUDIENCE: Is this still
invitation only program?

00:26:16.231 --> 00:26:22.140
Or can anyone develop
[INAUDIBLE] actions?

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.360
SUNIL VEMURI: So the question
was, is this an invitation only

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.490
program?

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.160
What you saw there, Barnaby
outlined three APIs.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.100
System actions, custom
actions, voice interaction API.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.900
System actions are totally
open, voice interaction API

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.850
is completely open.

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.270
These are documented
publicly on our website.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:43.260
Custom actions, that is
something where, right now,

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.420
our waiting list is a bit long.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.310
And we've gotten
a lot of requests.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.720
So if you want to
do custom actions,

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.600
please come talk to
me afterward and then

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.369
we can get you on the
wait list for this.

00:26:57.369 --> 00:26:57.910
OK over here.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:58.788
BARNABY JAMES: Last
question, I think.

00:26:58.788 --> 00:27:00.519
AUDIENCE: Do you have
anything in place

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:03.942
to help people who are building
endangered language translators

00:27:03.942 --> 00:27:05.409
and speech solutions?

00:27:05.409 --> 00:27:08.832
Because we don't have
speech handlers for them.

00:27:08.832 --> 00:27:09.862
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:09.862 --> 00:27:10.570
SUNIL VEMURI: OK.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:15.920
So do we have anything to help
with endangered languages?

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.970
So our team doesn't work
on that specific thing.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.064
But maybe that's something
you can come talk

00:27:22.064 --> 00:27:23.230
to us about at office hours.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.160
I'd love to learn
a little bit more

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.540
about what you're looking for.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.180
And even if our
team can't help you,

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.680
then we can try to redirect the
question to the right place.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.670
Are we out of time?

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:33.980
Yes, we're out of time.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.440
We have office hours
at the costume shop.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.284
We'll be there
for the next hour.

00:27:40.284 --> 00:27:41.700
I know lots of you
have questions.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.160
Please come there, we'll be
happy to answer your questions

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:43.680
there.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.630
Thank you.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:51.680
