&gt;&gt; Female presenter: Welcome to Authors@Google.
Long one of our most acute

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.190
and insightful novelists, Russell Banks often
examines

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.310
the interesting boundaries between our intention
and our

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.439
actions. With his uncompromising and morally
complex new

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.670
novel, Lost Memory of Skin, the two time Pulitzer
Prize

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.710
finalist is at the peak of his powers. Russell
Banks is

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.850
a prolific writer of fiction. His many books
include

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.270
Continental Drift, Cloudsplitter, The Darling
and the short story

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.440
collection, The Angel on the Roof. The Sweet
Hereafter and Affliction

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.789
have been adapted into feature films. Banks
has won

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.900
numerous awards and prizes for his work. Among
them the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.900
Guggenheim Fellowship, National Endowment
for

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.900
the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship and the
literature award from the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.690
American Academy of Arts and Letters. He's
the founding

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.320
president of Cities of Refuge, North American
and the past

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.100
president of the International Parliament
of Writers.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.410
Please join me in welcoming Russell Banks
today.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.410
[applause]

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.550
&gt;&gt; Russell Banks: Thanks, Shannon. It's a
pleasure and of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.550
interest to me to be here and speak with you
guys. It's

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.360
not what I would call a regular stop on a
book tour [audience chuckles]

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.149
talking to Google and talk to employees at
Google. I'm

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.810
happy to do it. It's kind of a nice break
from the usual

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.959
routine where I'm sitting in a studio or TV
studio or

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:52.210
at a bookstore doing a program. And so, this
is kind of nice.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.500
Last week I was in Good Morning Miami television,
CBS,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.160
television studio. In the green room with
me, going on

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.000
just before me, were two of the cheer leaders
for the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.250
Miami Marlins. [laughter] Silver Lame bathing
suits, bikinis along with Billy the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.670
Marlin the mascot. This is going to be a hard
act to follow. I'm glad they aren't here today.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.950
[laughter]

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.850
And actually,it was a hard act to follow.
The woman whose show it was interviewed them

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.910
briefly.
And then, they actually had a routine where

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.810
they did a cheer.
And then, she said, "And now, for something

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.820
different." [laughter] Mr.
Banks has written a novel about convicted

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.900
sex offenders moving
under a causeway. And since she brightened

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.060
it, "And it's
right here in Miami." [laughter] The local

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.390
pride kind of overcame
her horror on the subject matter. And then,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.690
I had my
three or five minutes of interview while she

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.650
read a
teleprompter and I tried to answer questions

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.130
in that short space, which is
impossible. But that is a more likely venue

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.010
for someone
like me who's on a book tour for a novel than

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.650
this. This
is a more welcoming one I think. But I guess

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.180
it would be
most useful to you. And that's really what

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.290
I wanted to
do is be of use to you. Is really talk about

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.880
the book a
little bit and read some passages from the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.690
book. And
then, really just turn it back over to you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.030
for questions
and run about till -- what do you say, Shannon?

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.100
Till what
time? Quarter of 11 or thereabouts.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.360
&gt;&gt;Female presenter: That'd be great.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.470
&gt;&gt;Russell: Somewhere in there.
Okay. The woman whose show Good Morning, Miami

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.510
-- was
right it is set in Miami. Although it's not

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.840
called
Miami. It's called Calusa. And also involves

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.300
the
Everglades and they're not called the Everglades.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:11.710
They're called the Great Pensacola Swamp.
And I think, even though anyone who knows

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.720
anything about south Florida and Miami recognizes
immediately

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.039
the setting, I didn't want to call it Miami
for a number

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.490
of reasons or give it its real names for a
number of

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.960
reasons not just to protect the innocent but
really so

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.400
that I would be free to have events and incidents
and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.730
even locales occur in the story that don't
occur in

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.290
reality that I wouldn't be bound by the geography
and the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:51.810
history and the demographics and so forth
of the city and

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.270
of the region. That I would be free to leave
things out

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.590
put things in shape it around the needs of
story telling

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.889
because it's a novel first and foremost. It's
a story.

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:11.120
And I wanted the traditions and the conventions
and the

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.660
discipline and rigor that story telling brings
with it to

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.310
determine what went into the story rather
than the place

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.070
itself. The way investigative journalists
might do it or

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.160
sociologists or documentarian or someone else,
a non-fiction writer would use the material.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.830
And the material is real, too, in a sense
or, I should say, based

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.780
in reality as well. The material that is the
context for

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.580
the story. And I spend 6 months a year in
Miami and the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.020
other 6 upstate in New York, in the Adirondacks.
So you can imagine which

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.610
six months I spend in Miami. [laughter] And
I have an apartment

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.440
down there in Miami Beach that looks out over
Biscayne Bay ; it's over on the bay side.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.969
It looks over towards the Miami skyline and
mainland.

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.180
And from that, I can see this Julia Tuttel
Causeway which

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:15.000
Barrier Islands to Miami beach. And about
four years ago

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.140
articles started appearing in Miami Herald
and a couple

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.210
other papers about a colony of convicted sex
offenders

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.760
who had served their time in prison and were
now living

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.230
underneath that causeway in a kind of encampment,
a shantytown they had built there and they

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:44.699
had been dropped off there with
the connivance and cooperation of law enforcement

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:52.700
officials and parole officers and so forth
because of a

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.780
regulation which had been passed in Miami
Dade count that

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.100
forbade any convicted sex offender from living
within

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.100
2500 feet of anywhere where there were children
are likely

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.320
to have gathered which means schools or playgrounds
or

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.280
day care centers or anything of the sort.
And so, there

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.740
was no place therefore for them to live anywhere
in the

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.680
city. And so, they had gathered down there,
sort of like

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.870
trolls under a bridge and outcasts. And it
was -- and I

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.780
could see it from my terrace -- a terrace
in my

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.180
apartment. I could look out and see, this
sort of like a magnet in a

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.590
way. Wow, what must that be like. Talk about
the

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.759
unintended consequences of good intentions.
You end up

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:52.419
with this situation and you've got, you know,
psychopathic serial rapists and pedophiles

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:59.030
alongside some poor
old guy who got busted for urinating in a

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.870
parking lot at 3 in the morning
in the morning. He got drunk and got busted

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.699
for indecent exposure, that's a sexual crime.
Or you

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:11.020
got some 21-year-old kid who had sex with
his high school girlfriend who is under 18

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.600
and that's statutory rape and that's sexual
crime. And

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.960
they're all just thrown together. We make
these

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.270
distinctions between first, second, third
degree sex

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:26.949
offenses when we prosecute and convict and
sentence a sex offender,

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:29.870
but after that, they're all lumped together
and they're

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.550
all on the national sex offender registry
online. You

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.429
can click right straight to it. They're there
permanently.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:43.809
Their face will pop up, location where they
live, where

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:48.529
they work etcetera will pop right up when
you click right

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:53.089
onto any neighborhood in America you want
to go to.

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:55.839
Thanks to Google, you can --. [laughter] Any
neighborhood

00:08:55.839 --> 00:09:01.350
you want and click on a house or a block as
the kid does

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:08.230
here. I'll read a little episode where that
takes place. And they're all wearing electronic

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.110
anklets so
they're under permanent surveillance with

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:17.459
a GPS unit attached to make sure they
don't go within 2500 feet of where children

00:09:17.459 --> 00:09:23.399
are gathered and don't leave the county in
terms of their parole as well. So anyhow,

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:28.699
this is a growing
population of these people that little cluster

00:09:28.699 --> 00:09:35.290
of them in
Miami seem to represent a growing social phenomenon.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:39.779
And
that reflected a whole lot of other aspects

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:46.300
of our
society as I began to dig into it. And, because

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.500
I
started doing a lot. I knew nothing about

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.029
this world
really at all. So I began to investigate

00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:57.740
different aspects of it. Of just the nature
of the

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.730
crime, for one thing, the psychology of what
may be driving some of these

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:10.819
crimes and the circumstances that may have
led to some of

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:11.819
these crimes. These particular range of crimes.
And

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:15.569
also the legal history regarding these sex
offenders.

00:10:15.569 --> 00:10:22.269
And also the psychology of the rest of us.
You know,

00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:28.480
those of us who shape the laws and regulations
and so

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.529
forth with regard to sex crimes. The fears
that drive us

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:38.309
to try to protect our children as it were.
Feel that

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:42.399
they are protected in some secure way. I was
interested

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:47.190
in finding out as much as I could about that.
And much

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.459
of this led me to the Internet. And Internet
addiction

00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:56.889
among young males particularly and then -- and
that

00:10:56.889 --> 00:11:04.800
connection of that to pornography and pornography
addiction as well. And how the line between

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.589
fantasy and
reality especially as regards our erotic life,

00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:14.329
our sex
lives, sexual behavior and so forth. That

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:19.120
line has
gradually become erased and replaced by a

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.300
zone more than
a line. And so, that more and more it becomes

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.689
difficult
to know when you pass out of fantasy into

00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:32.250
reality or vice
versa. You drift back into fantasy. And increasingly

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.660
so
many of us are living in that gray zone between

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.589
the two
that our human contact especially our perhaps

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:44.910
our erotic contact with
each other takes place there, in a digitalized

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.189
format
rather than through our skin. And thus the

00:11:49.189 --> 00:11:55.889
title: Lost the Memory of Skin. And there
are many forms in which we've lost the memory

00:11:55.889 --> 00:12:00.420
of skin our basic form of
connection between each other -- basic form

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:06.129
of intimacy
is through our skin and how that's being displaced

00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:09.310
and
challenged. Perhaps you people working here

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:14.179
know more of that than most
of the people in the country. But the rest

00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:17.269
of us are, nonetheless,
participating in it. It's part of our ongoing

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:23.870
condition,
our ongoing lives. So anyhow, the book kind

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:28.790
of arose out of all
that. Out of that massive material that I

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.119
accumulated
without really intending deliberately to write

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:40.139
a novel,
emerged a character of a kid. And it was called

00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:43.189
"the Kid"
in the novel. He wasn't given -- we never

00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:47.929
know his "real"
name, whatever that is. Everybody has a handle

00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:52.759
anyhow online and
elsewhere and this story. The convicted sex

00:12:52.759 --> 00:13:01.869
offenders
tend to use pseudonyms. Real names, they don't

00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:22.910
want to circulate because you can go online
get their real name and find out they're a

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:34.180
convicted sex
offender. You don't want to rent them an apartment

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:43.899
or give them a
job and so forth. You can't discriminate based

00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:48.269
on the
race or sexual orientation or any other socially

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:50.799
identifiable
category. But you can discriminate on the

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:53.959
basis of
people being a convicted sex offender in terms

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:58.069
of housing or employment. Anyhow,
the Kid emerges from the material for me.&gt;&gt;

00:13:58.069 --> 00:14:01.622
And when I had
the Kid and I had his inner life starting

00:14:01.622 --> 00:14:02.622
to emerge in my
imagination, I knew I could begin to write

00:14:02.622 --> 00:14:03.622
a novel about
the experience of this young guy -- 22-year-old

00:14:03.622 --> 00:14:04.622
guy -- as
a kind of lost person in many ways like a

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:05.622
lot of kids.
Feral child, as I think of him, who raised

00:14:05.622 --> 00:14:06.622
himself, essential. Single parent kid, we
used to call latch key kids. Mother was at

00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:07.622
work all day, then is home briefly then is
.

00:14:07.622 --> 00:14:08.622
out at night. His only friend
turns out to be his only connection -- thing

00:14:08.622 --> 00:14:09.622
he could
love -- person he could love -- is an iguana

00:14:09.622 --> 00:14:10.622
which he raises, to a monstrous four foot
long.

00:14:10.622 --> 00:14:16.290
I don't know if anybody here has ever spent
any time with

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.259
iguanas. You have?
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Well, in my classroom when I

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:19.709
was in some grade school, we had an iguana.
We

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:26.750
all had to take turns taking care of it. That
was a long time ago. But it was an experience.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.749
&gt;&gt; Russell: [chuckles] They're actually quite
unthreatening beasts and

00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:33.800
passive and sweet. And they're actually fairly
intelligent. They

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.490
do engage human beings pretty easily. They're
vegetarians. But

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:48.589
they look monstrous. They strike fear into
the hearts of people when they see them. Anyhow.

00:14:48.589 --> 00:14:53.220
The
iguana. That's the iguana on the cover. That's

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.059
the kid's pet. Iggy is his name; named after
Iggy

00:14:55.059 --> 00:14:57.619
Pop. Naturally who I found out later is named
Iggy Pop

00:14:57.619 --> 00:15:05.921
because his first band was The Iguanas. [chuckles]
So it came back full

00:15:05.921 --> 00:15:06.921
circle back to real iguana. Anyhow, let me
read to you a

00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:12.619
little bit to give you some sense of the novel.
Deal with

00:15:12.619 --> 00:15:18.249
any questions that you want to ask. I'm just
going to

00:15:18.249 --> 00:15:24.670
start right at the front for a little bit
and then jump.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:28.139
The thing about a novel reading from a novel
trying to

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:32.239
give you a sense about the novel if it's a
good novel, and

00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:35.480
one always hopes it is, the pieces of it have
been

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.759
integrated and meshed one hopes in such a
way that it's

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:42.790
very hard to excerpt. I also write short stories.
I

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.399
love reading short stories aloud because there's
a

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:50.040
beginning, middle and end. Good, that's it;
it's done now. You either get it or you don't

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.959
get it. You
like it or don't like it, but you've got the

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:56.839
whole thing. You can't do it with a
novel and I don't like to spend a lot of time

00:15:56.839 --> 00:16:00.889
explaining
and I'm sure you don't like to hear a whole

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:03.079
lot of
digressive explaining of various characters

00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:07.690
who show up.
I'm just going to read the first few pages

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:12.429
and then jump
to a section that gives you an idea of the

00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:17.399
world that the
kid is living in down there. And then, I'll

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:30.519
jump to a
passage toward the end which gives you some

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:36.290
overview
really of the kid's community. This is how

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.600
it begins
[reading] It isn't like the kid is locally

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.439
famous for
doing a good or a bad thing. And even if people

00:16:42.439 --> 00:16:45.420
knew his
real name, it wouldn't change how they treated

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.059
him unless
they looked it up online which is not something

00:16:48.059 --> 00:16:51.990
he wants
to encourage. He, himself, like most of the

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.609
men living underneath
the causeway is legally prohibited from going

00:16:55.609 --> 00:16:59.019
online. But
nonetheless, one afternoon biking back from

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:04.130
work at the Mirador he strolls into the branch
library on Regis Road

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.640
like he has every legal right to be there.
The Kid isn't

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.300
sure how to get this done. He's never been
inside a

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.340
library before. The librarian is a fizzy lady.
Ginger-

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:23.520
colored hair around her head like a bug light,
pink lipstick, freckles --. wearing a floral

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.720
print blouse and khaki
slacks. She's a few inches taller than the

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.000
Kid, a small
person above the waist but wide in the hips

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.500
like she'd be
hard to tip over. The sign on the counter

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.610
in front of
her says Reference Librarian Gloria, something.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:44.320
The Kid
is too nervous to register her last name.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.930
She smiles
without showing her teeth and asks if she

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:54.950
can help him.
"Yeah, I mean, I guess so. I don't know actually.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.440
What
are you looking for? You're like the reference

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.180
lady,
right? Right. Do you need to look up something

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.870
in
particular?" The air-conditioning is cranked

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.600
and the place
feels about ten degrees cooler now than it

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.530
did when the Kid came
through the door and he suddenly realizes

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.080
he's shivering. He thinks at first it's the
air-conditioning.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.060
But the Kid's not cold, he's scared. He's
pretty sure he

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.290
shouldn't be inside a public library even
though he can't

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:29.540
remember there being any rules specifically
against entering one as long as he's not loitering

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.830
and it's not a school library and
there's no playground or school nearby. At

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.970
least none
that he's aware of. You can never be sure

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.950
though.
Playgrounds and schools are pretty much lurking

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.410
everywhere.
And children and teenagers probably come in

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.590
here all the
time this late in the day to pretend they're

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.450
doing
homework or just to hang out. He looks around

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:56.390
the large
fluorescent lit room scans the long rows of

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.950
floor-to-ceiling, book-lined shelves. It's
like a huge supermarket with nothing on the

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.970
shelves but
books. It smells like paper and glue. A little

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.610
moldy
and damp. Except for a geeky looking black

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:13.060
guy with
glasses and a huge Adam's apple and big wind-catching

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.300
ears sitting at a table with
half a dozen thick books and no pictures open

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.530
in front of him like he's trying to look up
his ancestors, there's

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.850
no other customers in the library. A customer
-- that's

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.760
what he is. He's not here to ask this lady
for a job or

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.590
looking to rent an apartment from her and
he's not pan

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.480
handling her and he's for sure not going to
hit on her.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.920
She's way too old, probably forty or fifty,
at least and pretty low on the hotness scale.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.050
No,
the kid is a legitimate legal customer who

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.290
strolled into the
library to get some information because libraries

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.220
are
where the information is. So why is he shaking

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.620
and his
arms all covered with goose bumps like he's

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.210
standing naked
standing in a meat locker? It's not just because

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.080
he's
never been inside a library before, even when

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.320
he was in high school and it was sort of required.
He's shivering

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.290
because he's afraid of the answer to the question
that

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:13.650
drove him here even though he already knows
it. "Listen,

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:18.820
can I ask you something? It's kind of personal
I guess."

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.250
"Of course," well, see I live out on the north
end and

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.360
the people in the neighborhood, my neighbors,
they're all like telling

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.800
me there might be like a convicted sex offender
living

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.330
there. In the neighborhood. And they tell
me you can just

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.200
go online to this site that tells you where
he's living

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.840
and all and they ask me if I'd check it out
for them.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.920
For the neighborhood. Is it true? Is what
true? You

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.300
know, that you can just like go online and
it will tell

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.080
you where the sex offender lives even if you
don't know

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.660
his name or anything? Well, let's go see she
says like

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.610
he asked her what's the capital of Vermont
and leads

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.520
the Kid across the room to a long table where
six computers

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.220
are lined upside by side and no one's using
them. She

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:12.170
sits down in front of one and does a quick
Google search. See, I'm name dropping there.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.491
[laughter]
Placement -- product placement.

00:21:13.491 --> 00:21:19.650
&gt;&gt; Male #1: When I saw that, I thought it
was a bit search.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:24.560
&gt;&gt; Russell: [reading] She sits down in front
of one -- the computers -- and

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.180
does a quick Google search under "convicted
sex

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:38.330
offenders." and up pops the National Sex Offender
Registry which links straight to www.familywatchdog.us.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.520
The Kid stands in a forward tilt behind her
shifting his

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:48.050
weight from one foot to the other. He thinks
he should run now, get out of here fast

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.900
before she clicks again, but something he
can't resist,

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.500
something he knows is coming that is both
scary and

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:01.500
familiar keeps him staring over the librarian's
shoulder at the screen the same way he used

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.700
to get held
to the screen when cruising pornography sites.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.580
The
librarian clicks "find offenders," and then

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.380
off the menu hits
"by location." And another menu jumps up and

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.680
asks for the
address. You're from Colusa, right? What's

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:26.490
your neighborhood's
ZIP code? "it's 33135." Any particular street

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.550
you
want to look up? He gives her the name of

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.160
the street
where his mother lives and he used to live

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.470
and she types
it in and hits "search." A pale green map

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.650
of his street
and the surrounding twenty or so blocks appears

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.950
on the screen.
Small red, green, and orange squares are scattered

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.571
across
the neighborhood like bits of confetti. Any

00:22:48.571 --> 00:22:53.220
particular
block? The Kid reaches to the screen and touches

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.440
the map on the
block where he lived his entire life before

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.690
he enlisted
in the army and where he lived again after

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:05.030
he was discharged. A red piece of
confetti covers his mother's bungalow and

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:10.620
the backyard where he pitched
his tent and built Iggy the iguana's outdoor

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:16.430
cage. The librarian clicks on to the
tiny square. And suddenly the Kid is looking

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:21.240
at his mug
shot. His forlorn bewildered face. And he

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.940
feels all
over again the shame and the humiliation of

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.830
the night he
was booked. There was his full name -- first,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:33.000
last, and
middle -- date of birth, height, weight, his

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.760
race, color
of his eyes and hair, and the details of his

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.260
crime and conviction. Slowly the librarian
turns in her

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:42.810
chair and looks up at the Kid's real face.
Then back at

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:49.260
the computerized version. That's you, isn't
it? I got

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.660
to go he whispers. I got to leave. He backs
away from

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:58.760
the woman who appears both stunned and saddened,
but not

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.880
at all afraid, which surprises him. And for
a few

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.560
seconds, he considers trying to explain how
his face and

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.480
description and criminal record got there
on the computer

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.140
screen. But there's no way he can explain
it to someone

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.950
like her, a normal person, a lady reference
librarian who

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.230
helps people look up the whereabouts and crimes
of people

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:26.690
like him. "Wait, don't leave," I got to go.
I'm sorry.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.600
No kidding. I'm really sorry. Don't be sorry.
No, I'm

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.660
probably not even supposed to be here, he
says, in the

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.420
library, I mean. He turns and walks stiff
legged away.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.320
And then as he nears the door he breaks into
a run and

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.330
the Kid doesn't stop running until he's back
up on his

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.910
bike heading for the Causeway.
So that's how it begins.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:58.180
I'll jump to a couple pages later under the
Causeway.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:07.290
"While he waits for the blue butane flame
of his camp stove to heat his

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.180
supper, the kid stands beside his tent in
the damp

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.460
semi-darkness beneath the Claiborne causeway
and contemplates

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:20.410
the smooth blue waters of the wide Colusa
Bay, and the southern outflow of the thousand

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:25.620
mile long Atlantic
intercoastal water way. Bumper to bumper cars

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:30.190
trucks buss
and intermittent motorcycles rumble over him

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.190
crossing
between the mainland and the Barrier islands,

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:39.920
on the eastern side of the Bay. It's the
end of a long late summer day. Everyone's

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.450
headed home.
Everyone's home is in one place or the other.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:51.010
The
mainland or the islands. There or over there.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:55.030
Definitely not here. Not here on the broad,
flat,

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.700
concrete peninsula that anchors the rusting
steel piers that

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.670
hold up the Causeway. He pretends that he
is alone down here.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:10.090
He turns away from the polyurethane lean-tos
and tents and the salvage plywood huts nearby

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.920
and the men
who live in them standing around like bored

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.480
ghosts. And
he gazes out at the Bay thinking not of where

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.300
he is but
where he would like to be. This is how he

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:26.840
has learned to
endure being where he is. He peers out at

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.630
the bay. He
tracks charter fishing boats and a few large

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.410
white yachts
and dozens of small private fishing and pleasure

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.640
boats
returning from open waters after a long day's

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.670
pleasure at
sea and, in some cases, work. He would like

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.900
to be aboard
one of those boats, a pleasure boat or charter

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.810
fishing
boat or shrimper. Any one of them would do.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.510
That one or
that one. Or that 50-foot cabin cruiser shaped

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.830
like an
arrow. The flotilla passes through Kidds Cut

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:04.890
from the open sea into Calusa Bay
and plows steadily northward keeping down

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.230
town Calusa portside and the great Barrier
isles

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:12.460
off to starboard. Individual boats peel off
and make

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:17.000
their way to the thousands of marinas, dock
yards, piers, and

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.400
slips, scattered along the mainland and islands
and canals that filigree

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:27.490
both the mainland side of the bay and the
barriers where the fleet finally disintegrates.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.059
The kid
listens to the rumble and roar overhead of

00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:33.770
day's end
traffic crossing the Clayborn Causeway and

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:38.850
trying to hear
his thoughts he turns and looks south at the

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:43.260
clustered
skyscrapers of downtown Calusa. 50 story towers

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.270
of smoked glass and
gleaming sheets of aluminum and steel high-rise

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.720
hotels
Marriotts and Hyatts and Holiday Inns built

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.820
for business travelers. They're a
domed convention centers and international

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.970
banks and
insurance company office buildings and whole

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:02.190
colonies of
condominiums stacked on top of one another

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:07.030
like gigantic
poker chips. A condo downtown would be fine,

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:10.720
he thinks.
He doesn't need to live on the Barriers. Even

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.800
a small
studio with a low floor without a view would

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.740
do. He'd
furnish it simply for one person alone with

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.720
a single bed
and a table and two chairs and a lamp or two

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.760
and a
dresser. Maybe a few small pictures, some

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.440
dishes and
pots and pans. Sheets and blankets and towels.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.809
Keep it
simple. Keep it neat and clean. He doesn't

00:28:35.809 --> 00:28:38.550
really
require a view, but it would be nice to have

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.080
one. To
stroll to the fridge and take out a frosty

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.890
Corona and
crack it open and flop in his Lazy Boy recliner

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.200
and check out
the city below. At this time of day he'd watch

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.660
the glass and metal towers cast their long
shadows over the cluttered port where cranes

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.110
and gigantic elevators load and off load rows
of room

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:06.180
sized steel shipping containers from wheezing
freighters, heading to and from China, India,

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.120
and
Brazil. He considered three of the creamy

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.130
cruise ships line up like floating amusement
parks

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.950
beside the docks and warehouses sleepily waiting
to be

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:20.040
restocked with food and liquor and refilled
with fresh island

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.880
hopping, limbo dancing tourists from the north.
If the

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.930
Kid were a deck hand, he'd have his own bunk
at one of

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:31.440
those ships. He'd have access to a galley
where the cook

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.090
prepares meals and the crew eats them. A recreation
room

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:39.500
for watching TV and movies on DVD. He'd be
able to

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.220
travel to Asia or South America or to the
islands in the

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:48.270
Caribbean. Out were the sprawling city dwindles
and finally ends

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:53.630
beyond where the malls and bungalows and gated
communities of the suburbs turn into trailer

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.980
parks and the
trailer parks eventually merge with palmetto

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:03.870
scrub and cane fields and mangrove marsh
out beyond the great Pensacola swamp, a flattened

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:08.050
red sun
glimmers near the low, unbroken horizon. Streaked

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:13.480
with tangerine strips of cloud the
western sky turns turquoise and then orange

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.870
all over and
finally scarlet. The Kid can see that evening

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:21.120
sky from
here beneath the Causeway, but only if he

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.830
walks out to
the end of the concrete peninsula and stands

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:29.120
at the
water's lapping edge and looks up. A pair

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.260
of 747s depart
simultaneously from the international airport

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:37.309
west of
downtown. Parallel white contrails scratch

00:30:37.309 --> 00:30:42.470
the darkening sky.
Then directly overhead one plane slowly veers

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:46.840
northeast in a lone
arc toward England while the other bisects

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.410
the dark sky above the black and green gulf
stream on the line that follows the tropic

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:56.400
of cancer
straight east all the way to north Africa

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.360
and beyond. He
gazes along the smaller great barrier islands

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:05.110
and the canals between them and the
bayside back sides of the palatial homes of

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.460
singers,
professional athletes and movie stars and

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.260
the men and
women who import and export drugs and manage

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.090
and
launder other people's ill-gotten and sometimes

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.360
inherited
money and hedge-funds and offshore accounts

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:24.980
in the Caymans, Turks and Caicos and Bahamas.
Along the canals the mostly Moorish-styled

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.080
estates hide flood-lit manicured gardens,
terraces and

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:34.950
Olympic-sized pools behind ten-foot walls
alarmed and topped with razor wire. Looking

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:38.430
east
beyond them he can see the tall seaside hotels,

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.740
their
pastel walls splashed with warm light. Neon

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.100
signs chum
the names of the hotels against the purple

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:52.090
eastern sky
and blot out the stars. Conquistador. Casa

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:58.620
Calusa. Monteview. Mirador. The cars, buses
and trucks on the Causeway

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.850
and bridges and the north/south interstate
and the

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:06.470
traffic jam turnpikes to the suburbs have
switched their

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:13.059
headlights on. And the high-rises and skyscrapers
downtown, fluorescent night-lights ignite

00:32:13.059 --> 00:32:18.220
floor after floor as the cleaners,
janitors and watchmen begin their night's

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.490
work and from
the rooftops and pent houses, slender beacons

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:26.960
reach like
lone pale arms into the darkness. An offshore

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.510
breeze
puts a sudden chill in the air. Night has

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:35.510
fallen in the
city down here wide loud Causeway that connects

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:47.860
the two. [ends reading]
&gt;&gt; Russell: Then a paragraph towards the end

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:54.520
I'll read to you. I
guess it's the summation of the situation.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.190
[reading]
"He's charging up the battery here in this

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:05.171
scene of his
anklet, electronic anklet that he wears. It

00:33:05.171 --> 00:33:08.021
takes half an hour to fully
charge his monitor battery. And during that

00:33:08.021 --> 00:33:13.910
half an
hour, the kid feels intimately connected to

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.000
the millions
of other convicted sex offenders young and

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.070
old and in between. Gray genitals on a bus,
public

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.550
masturbators, voyeurs, and escalator gropers.
Impulsive

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:30.290
seducers of teen-aged boys, coaches who couldn't
keep their hands off

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:35.860
their athletes. Men who talked dirty in Internet
chat rooms to people they thought were teenage

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.910
girls and then arranged to meet them for sex.
Fathers and

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:45.920
uncles who drunkly reached out for their teenaged
daughters as they passed by the sofa. Porn

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:52.580
addicts and fantasists. Lost in the
misty zone between reality and imagery no

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.020
longer able to
tell the difference. All of whom at this moment

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.430
had plugged
their electronic shackles into outlets and

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.760
are sitting in
the bedrooms, living rooms and basements of

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:11.169
houses, apartments and mobile homes. And
garages and homeless shelters; public parks,

00:34:11.169 --> 00:34:14.799
in airports
and train stations in waiting rooms offices

00:34:14.799 --> 00:34:19.369
and the back
rooms of fast food restaurants. And under

00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:23.289
Causeways and
overpasses. As if they were all trembling

00:34:23.289 --> 00:34:27.989
leaves on the
branches large and small of a vast electrical

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:32.220
tree that
casts its shadow across the entire country.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:36.659
[ends reading]
Of course at that point, I'll turn it over

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:40.319
to you. If you have any questions you want
me to

00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:46.109
entertain, I'd be delighted. Yes
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Is the anklet locked on to the

00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:53.679
person's leg so it
can't be moved?

00:34:53.679 --> 00:35:01.859
&gt;&gt; Russell: Right. And you have to keep the
battery charged.

00:35:01.859 --> 00:35:02.859
Because you're monitored, you know. Thanks
to Google

00:35:02.859 --> 00:35:03.859
technology. [laughter] And you're basically
you break

00:35:03.859 --> 00:35:06.960
parole if you don't keep yourself monitored.
You could

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:12.619
be sent back to jail
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Can it be stipulated beyond parole?

00:35:12.619 --> 00:35:14.999
&gt;&gt; Russell: You mean the anklet?
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah?

00:35:14.999 --> 00:35:18.730
&gt;&gt; Russell: There are places where legislators
are

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:30.820
trying to make it a life time form of surveillance,
yes. And no -- I mean there are challenges,

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:36.119
you
know, to the constitutional rights of people

00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:40.359
regarding the sentencing of sex offenders.
In all

00:35:40.359 --> 00:35:50.940
parts of the country. It's an easy political
platform to run on in this country. And -- because

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.450
everybody's afraid of sex offenders in ways
that are

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.100
almost taboo to think about -- to examine.
Just

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:03.950
kind of blanket way. And, you know, without
making

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:10.119
any distinctions or discriminations or getting
up

00:36:10.119 --> 00:36:12.109
close enough to understand the differences
--

00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:15.990
different types of sex offense, different
conditions

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:20.359
that lead someone into it, and different degrees
of

00:36:20.359 --> 00:36:24.950
disturbance that bring someone to it, and
we decided

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:29.220
lumping this whole population together once
they're

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:33.549
out of jail. You know, I've done some talk
shows

00:36:33.549 --> 00:36:37.700
while I'm doing this tour. Call-ins, radio
call-in shows,

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.869
and some people -- they haven't read the book
--

00:36:40.869 --> 00:36:43.020
that's necessarily the first question I ask
when

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:48.430
they come in swinging like that. They call
in, and they say

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:51.789
"You're just justifying the offender, the
perp and

00:36:51.789 --> 00:36:54.150
blaming the victim." I said, well, have you
read

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.769
the novel?" And they say, "No, and I'm not
going to

00:36:56.769 --> 00:37:06.239
either. I think these people should be executed."
They really mean it. They're not kidding.

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:09.569
There's
no discussion of course with anyone like that.

00:37:09.569 --> 00:37:11.690
Brings anger and agenda. And they usually
identify

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:16.319
themselves as a victim of sexual crime. And
what

00:37:16.319 --> 00:37:20.950
can you say to that? All I can say, "Well,
it's a

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.559
novel, and it doesn't blame the victim in
any case.

00:37:23.559 --> 00:37:26.011
And you really have to kind of read the novel
to see

00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:30.019
that and understand that." But then I've walked
into kind of a defensive position that I don't

00:37:30.019 --> 00:37:36.820
want
to be in. But there's a movement afoot all

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:41.490
across
the country to basically make it a life sentence.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:44.500
&gt;&gt;Male #2: How do other countries deal with
this?

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.019
Other cultures?
&gt;&gt; Russell: As far as I know, there's nothing

00:37:48.019 --> 00:37:52.190
like the
American panic over sex offender. In Europe,

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:56.289
Canada -- just this morning I spent an hour
on the

00:37:56.289 --> 00:37:59.930
radio talking to CBC journalist talking about
it.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:06.839
She was comparing Canadian approach to American
approach which is far less punitive and makes

00:38:06.839 --> 00:38:12.940
much sharper distinctions and doesn't have
this ongoing after. She was sort of shocked.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.309
"Is
it really true you can go online and you can

00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:17.950
go to
your own block and your own neighborhood and

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:21.069
locate any
convicted sex offender who may have been convicted

00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:24.260
ten
or 20 years ago." Yeah, it's there. Just do

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:28.690
it; try it. It's really
amazing and she couldn't believe it.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:33.759
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I think just a follow up. I think
in

00:38:33.759 --> 00:38:36.140
Italy, they punish the sex offenders by reelecting
them. [laughter]

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:42.069
&gt;&gt; Russell: Yeah, to higher office.
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I want to ask what your writing

00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:48.339
process is
like. How do you go about crafting a significant

00:38:48.339 --> 00:38:53.080
novel?
&gt;&gt; Russell: Well, umm -- it varies somewhat

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.920
of course
from book to book. In this case, when I was

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.250
describing how I kind of accumulated mass
of

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:04.289
material that without a real intention at
the time,

00:39:04.289 --> 00:39:06.609
at first anyhow, to write a novel about it
I didn't

00:39:06.609 --> 00:39:08.420
know what I was going to do with it. I was
just

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.640
trying to satisfy my own curiosity and try
to

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.700
understand a phenomenon that I couldn't look
away

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.940
from any longer and so on. And then the Kid
emerged -- the character -- I began to imagine

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:23.470
the
kid like that. Not based on anybody. It was

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.089
easy
for me to imagine a kid going into that circumstance

00:39:27.089 --> 00:39:31.700
getting locked into a kind of shadowy world
on the

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.470
edge of sex offending because of pornography
and

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.599
addiction to pornography and losing track
of his own sex

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:43.069
life. I mean, the Kid's a virgin. He's a convicted
sex offender who was a

00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:47.319
virgin, that was a first thing I wanted to
say But in terms of the actual process from

00:39:47.319 --> 00:39:51.210
what's
there. I tend to work with two outlines. One

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.829
is
kind of an arc of a whole story and that is

00:39:55.829 --> 00:40:01.890
very
rough, very approximate. It's sort of as if

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:02.890
I'm
saying, "Okay. I want to climb that mountain

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:06.220
and I
know it's east of here." That's about all

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.220
I know.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.220
[chuckles]

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.809
Between here and there, I've got to go up
and down,

00:40:09.809 --> 00:40:12.099
through the valleys and through the forests
and

00:40:12.099 --> 00:40:14.430
foothills and so on to get there. But I'm
not sure

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:18.980
where the trail is going to lead to get there.
I

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.339
can see in the distance the peak at least.
And that

00:40:21.339 --> 00:40:26.160
large outline governs that direction. It's
like a

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.030
compass really. And then, I tend to make a
short

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:34.950
outline that only covers the next ten, 15
pages --

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.529
next scene sequence is the way I think of
them. I

00:40:37.529 --> 00:40:42.500
tend to write in scenes. Visual -- episodes
that

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.760
you can visualize the way you could with that
scene

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.609
with the Kid in the library. That's a scene.
And I

00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:56.180
tend to write chapters that seem to have evolved
over the years into three or four. Someone

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.579
can do
an analysis on it better than I. Three, four

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:02.990
scenes. And that's a fairly detailed outline.
Where I sort of know which

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.400
scene follows what. After the library, I want
him

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.570
to get back on his bike back on the Causeway
that's

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:15.760
where we meet Iggy the iguana and one or two
of the other guys living under the Causeway

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:20.880
Take it to that.
And the scene where the night is falling.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.849
So that
will give us the physical surround of the

00:41:23.849 --> 00:41:26.710
place.
The city that surrounds it and the bay and

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:31.720
all the rest of it. The socioeconomic part
too. So I can lay that out and then

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.060
work with that. And be open at the same time
to

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.440
developments that may come in along the way.
I

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.230
might discover a character as indeed I did
when I

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:45.059
wrote when he goes back under the Causeway
from the

00:41:45.059 --> 00:41:49.519
library this character shows up who's a shyster,
a

00:41:49.519 --> 00:41:53.829
really scary. Called the shyster because he
had

00:41:53.829 --> 00:42:01.880
been a lawyer and a state legislator who was
arrested for pedophilia and soliciting sex

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:07.180
from little
girls in a sting operation. But I just brought

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.630
him
in because I thought, "You know, I've got

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:13.999
this kid
who -- yeah, he broke the law but we already

00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:18.289
kind of
sense it wasn't a big deal. He's not a pedophile.

00:42:18.289 --> 00:42:28.859
He's not a rapist. It's something else he
did wrong. We don't know what it is but it's

00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:30.769
not a big deal. But
there are guys down there who are serious

00:42:30.769 --> 00:42:32.190
criminals
or psychopaths or sociopathic. So I needed

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:35.560
one. So
I brought him in. Suddenly he's there. This

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.309
guy is
really scary. Now he's there. I don't want

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:42.079
to let
go of him. I want to keep him as kind of a

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:46.980
weight
on things, develop the story in ways that

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.980
make him a
part of it, too. He's going to have someone

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:48.980
in there
that's really evil. And so, he plays that

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.279
role. It
goes like that. Then I have it, affecting

00:42:51.279 --> 00:43:03.339
the rest of it. One or two more?
Yeah, another question

00:43:03.339 --> 00:43:10.990
&gt;&gt;Male #4: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Russell: I can walk over from my place.

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:20.799
Yeah, and I walk over and spend a little time
there.

00:43:20.799 --> 00:43:24.580
Not a lot. I wasn't doing any investigative
journalistic

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.789
approach to it. I was doing it as a novelist.
What

00:43:27.789 --> 00:43:33.130
I wanted were the physical details of it.
I wanted

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.109
to know what does it smell like and what does
the

00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:36.759
sound of the 24 hour rumbling cars overhead.
What

00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:38.880
is it like to be under metal and concrete.
Right

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:43.989
there on the edge of the water -- the bay
-- tide

00:43:43.989 --> 00:43:50.840
going up and down. You know, trash coming
up out of

00:43:50.840 --> 00:44:10.739
the bay. Flotsam and jetsam, garbage and whatnot.
People throwing stuff off the Causeway as

00:44:10.739 --> 00:44:14.190
they
drive. Beer cans bouncing down. Stuff like

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.720
that.
I mean, I wanted to see the physical details.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.059
And I
talked to some of these guys who were not

00:44:19.059 --> 00:44:21.920
adverse to
talking about their situation. Of course,

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.369
many of
them would especially plead their story and

00:44:25.369 --> 00:44:29.630
how innocent they are. What raw
deal they got. This that and the other thing.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.099
I
worked in prison before. I know how that goes.

00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:37.680
Nobody's guilty when you start talking to
people.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.130
But they weren't threatened by my being there.
They

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:45.740
all felt as though they were being treated
very

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.619
badly. I mean, one guy just kept repeating,
"Don't

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:58.059
forget, we're not animals. We're not animals."
That was a cry. And I think he was speaking

00:44:58.059 --> 00:45:00.960
for a
lot of them. Yes?

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.549
&gt;&gt;Male #5: How do you make decisions about
how many

00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:09.680
words you kind of dedicate to describing say
a city

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:17.079
or, you know, describing like a person's physical
attributes. And how do you decide how much

00:45:17.079 --> 00:45:20.869
per
chapter per book you want to like dedicate

00:45:20.869 --> 00:45:23.410
to those
types of descriptions?

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:26.509
&gt;&gt;Russell: That's an interesting question.
I can't

00:45:26.509 --> 00:45:34.950
say I can quantify it ahead of time in any
way. [chuckles] But I do know I

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:41.640
use enough words -- I like phrasing it that,
it's an interesting question. I like enough

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:47.150
words so I can visualize or hear what's being
said.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:53.400
If you're just talking about exposition, right?
Just descriptive language there.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:58.000
&gt;&gt;Male #5: So that excerpt was a lot about
the city.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.430
Russell: A Yeah, surround. The world that
surrounds

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:07.499
him. And I wanted to see it as a writer, you
know?

00:46:07.499 --> 00:46:09.849
Visualize it. And so, I use enough so that
I could

00:46:09.849 --> 00:46:13.390
see it. I mean, I'm already familiar with
it. I

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:16.279
see it every night there where the sun goes
down.

00:46:16.279 --> 00:46:24.820
But I wanted to really almost like mentally
photograph it for myself or film it as it

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:30.799
were. And
I mean, Joseph Conrad, the great novelist

00:46:30.799 --> 00:46:31.799
wrote,
"Above all else, I want my reader to see."

00:46:31.799 --> 00:46:35.249
And he
meant not "understand," but literally see.

00:46:35.249 --> 00:46:39.259
Visualize it. I feel similarly. I want myself
to see first of all.

00:46:39.259 --> 00:46:42.989
Because in a sense what I'm doing here in
fiction is I'm

00:46:42.989 --> 00:46:47.490
creating visual and oral hallucinations. You
are

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:54.380
seeing things that don't exist really
and you're hearing voices that are from another

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.890
place. It's out of the body travel really.
When

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:00.229
you're reading fiction if it's any good at
all, you

00:47:00.229 --> 00:47:03.109
forget where you are. You go into that world
and

00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:07.769
you start having visual and aural hallucinations.
I

00:47:07.769 --> 00:47:12.029
mean, dialogue is just that. People are talking.
There's no one in the room but you're hearing

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:17.020
voices, if it's
any good, if it's good dialogue. And so, that's

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:22.150
what I want to induce in
myself as a writer when I am writing. And

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:25.299
then keep
on revising in that direction. And, if it

00:47:25.299 --> 00:47:29.109
works for
me, then it will work for a reader as well,

00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:33.400
I hope. I trust
that either both yourself and/or the reader

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:38.730
will.
Okay. Well I think it used up the time. One

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:39.830
more
question, sure.

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:46.430
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Do you have someone who worked
to make it more compact, to

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:52.079
change word order?
&gt;&gt; Russell: A I have a very good editor I've

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:56.140
had for a
number of books already. And then, before

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.119
him
similarly ten years. My editors either die

00:48:00.119 --> 00:48:08.460
or
retire [laughter] All of them -- I've had

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.500
four editors over
the years that I work closely with -- and

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.880
they all
work pretty much the same way. I write pretty

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:23.539
cleanly myself. I go through the whole manuscript
at the end. We sit down at the table and they'll

00:48:23.539 --> 00:48:30.109
have a mark here and a mark there and turn
the page.

00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:31.109
Sometimes it will be a whole sentence "What
did you

00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:40.140
mean here? It seems kind of vague." Just poking
poking poking. And saying -- you know, forcing

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:44.020
me
to look at it in a way I might not have otherwise

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.359
have
question myself. But no real heavy-handed

00:48:46.359 --> 00:48:50.980
editing . I never really had that. My first
editor

00:48:50.980 --> 00:49:00.660
was a great editor named Ted. Boy was he wonderful.
Great literary editor. And Ted used to do

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:05.589
that and
go through it. You know, have the pages. Spend

00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:08.509
a
whole couple of days at my house or in our

00:49:08.509 --> 00:49:09.749
offices.
And, but every decision, every crossing, he

00:49:09.749 --> 00:49:13.329
would say,
"Don't forget, this is your book, not mine.

00:49:13.329 --> 00:49:19.499
And you're
only going to have -- you're maybe going to

00:49:19.499 --> 00:49:23.190
have ten
or fifteen books in your lifetime." I'm going

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:29.410
to have
ten or fifteen books that I edit every year

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.190
or more. So this is
not my book; this is yours. So the responsibility

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:35.839
also passed over to me. I said, "Wow, this
is

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:39.700
right. I'm not going to have another one for
another three years. Better try to get it

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.380
as well done
as I can.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:46.960
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Do you give him a electronic copy?
&gt;&gt;Russell: Yes, I do. Everything is done -- we

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.849
don't
ship any paper anymore. And I work on the

00:49:51.849 --> 00:49:55.469
computer.
I write longhand still the first draft, because

00:49:55.469 --> 00:49:58.799
I
grew up writing in longhand and then working

00:49:58.799 --> 00:50:01.749
on a
mechanical typewriter. Getting a electrical

00:50:01.749 --> 00:50:06.799
typewriter is a big deal. I still have my
little Olympus portable or mechanical that

00:50:06.799 --> 00:50:12.220
I carried around with me in my teens and
twenties. And so, it sits like a monument

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.640
in my office. [chuckles]
I couldn't use it today.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:24.540
&gt;&gt;Male #7: How much do you do that sort of
editing

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.540
before you present the manuscript to the
editor?

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:30.219
&gt;&gt;Russell: Quite a lot. I get it pretty refined
down. I go through dozens and dozens of drafts.

00:50:30.219 --> 00:50:35.289
Of
course, working, you know, on the computer,

00:50:35.289 --> 00:50:38.949
you can
revise endlessly and there are paragraphs

00:50:38.949 --> 00:50:45.329
-- places
in there where I have revised, it seems, endlessly.

00:50:45.329 --> 00:50:50.289
Go through
rapidly. But I turn the manuscript in, I'm

00:50:50.289 --> 00:50:53.910
pretty
convinced it's done. Except for a little bit

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:59.849
of
this fine tuning that I mentioned earlier.

00:50:59.849 --> 00:51:02.079
Yeah.
Okay, guys, thank you all very much.

00:51:02.079 --> 00:51:02.349
[applause]
