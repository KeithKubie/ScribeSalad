00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:02.836
- YES!
- HOLY COW!

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.005
THAT KID IS A JOCK!

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.473
LOVE TO SEE WHAT HE COULD
DO IN THE POOL.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.242
I BET HE'S GOT GREAT WALTZ.
- YEAH.

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.010
ALL THESE KIDS,
THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN OUT THERE.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.745
A LOT OF THEM PROBABLY
HAVEN'T EVEN SPROUTED PUBES.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.347
PUT ME IN--
I'M A REAL MAN.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.983
I'VE GOT A VERY DENSE BUSH.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.518
- MAN, LOOK AT THAT VISOR.
THAT THING'S RAD-ASS.

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.019
HE LOOKS LIKE
COBRA COMMANDER.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.888
- HIS TOUCHDOWN DANCE
IS A LITTLE WEAK.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.557
WHAT I WOULD DO, IF I EVER
ACTUALLY PLAYED FOOTBALL,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.459
IS I'D DO THE DANCE
BEFORE THE PLAY EVEN STARTED.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.693
LET 'EM KNOW WHAT'S UP.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:27.861
JUST A LITTLE...

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.363
- RIGHT.
- OH.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.665
- YEAH.
VERY FUN DANCE.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.033
- TIMBERLAKE.
- I LIKE IT.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.469
UM, IT'S KIND OF STUPID
TO DO IT BEFORE THE PLAY,

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.870
'CAUSE THEN THE OPPONENT KNOWS
THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET THE BALL.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:40.207
- I BET YOU $100 I WOULD
STILL BE ABLE TO SCORE.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.241
- I DON'T BET, SO...

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:43.377
- I BET YOU DO.
- I BET I--

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.746
NICE TRY.
- YEAH, I GOT YOU, DUDE.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.648
- I USED TO BE A MAJOR PLAYER
IN THE GAMBLING WORLD,

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.283
ALL RIGHT?
- MM.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.584
- I LOST EVERYTHING.
- HMM.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.686
- INCLUDING MY MIND.
HAVEN'T GAMBLED SINCE.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.255
- NO, I REMEMBER THAT.
YOU LOST, LIKE, 80 BUCKS.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.057
- IT WAS MONEY YOUR GRANDMA
GAVE YOU FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.892
- NO, BUT SHE HAD TO CANCEL
HER SUBSCRIPTION FROM CABLE

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.227
FOR A MONTH.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.295
SOMETIMES,
WHEN YOU'RE A GRANDMA,

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:02.829
A MONTH'S ALL YOU GOT.
