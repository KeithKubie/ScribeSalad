00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.630
And it's my pleasure to have
been here today at a concert

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.970 position:56%
in the Library of Congress sponsored
by the American Folklife Center

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.680
that featured three extraordinary
musicians from Albuquerque,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.920
New Mexico, at least
where they live right now.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.370
A trio lead by the great
oudist from Baghdad originally

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.440
and now a long-time
American citizen,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.240
refugee from the Saddam
Hussein regime playing oud,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.540
composer as well.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.130
Just recorded a new
album coming out in 2017

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.360
with Smithsonian Folkways
Recordings,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.300
accompanied by Sourena
Sefati, a Persian oud--

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.740
sorry, a Persian santour player.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.150 position:56%
Santour is one of my most favorite
instruments in the world by the way;

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.830
I hope you enjoy it as well.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.570
He also lives in Albuquerque.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.760
He's been there a little
over a year from Iran,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.980
and also the great percussionist
and discipline and protégé

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.220
of Rahim AlHaj, Issa
Malluf, playing a host

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.270
of different musical instruments.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.670
And now, it's a great pleasure
for me to ask you to join us

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.130
in a conversation with the
great oudist, Rahim AlHaj.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.610
Rahim, it's great to
be together again.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.310
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: It's great to be
with you always amigo, you know?

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.610
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yes.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.320
I especially like this
very elegant stage setting.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.620
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Isn't it?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.920
This is [inaudible]?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.220
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Like we're
really indulged with it.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.520
[ Laughter ]

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.820
So, listen.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.120
So, we've talked many times before

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.930
but I don't think we ever
really talked about, you know,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.140
just right from the
basics, you know.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.610
Like for example, tell us
about, what was it like--

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.690
what family were you born into?

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.920
You know, what was it like
family life when you are young

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.220
as far as you can remember?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.070
Where was it-- You know, what
was day to day life like, as--

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.370
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.780
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: -- as far
back as you can remember?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.000
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: I was born in
Iraq, Baghdad, in an area--

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.300
it's called the Thawra,
the revolution.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.520
And for actually poor people
who are after the revolution

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.670
against the royalty's
family in Iraq.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.970
And so they give them--
each family are given one--

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.610
or a person actually-- a piece
of land to build their house.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.910
But it's limited.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.530
It's like 145 meters,
something like that.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.720
And we are-- I'm the
youngest of my family.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.400
We are a big family actually.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.850
I have five sisters
and two brothers.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.770
And, I was born as a
miricle like my mom said,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.550
because she had me when she was 45.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.990
And 45 during that time in
1968, is like a miracle.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.160
No woman can get birth
through that time.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.140
It could happen here and
there about within that frame

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.210 position:56%
of [inaudible] things its a miracle.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.550
So I'm born when I was for--
my mom like I said, 45.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.000
When I grow up, I don't remember
really my mom was my mom,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.310
because she's old.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.610
It's like my grandma.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.540
So my sisters-- they
took care of me.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.790
And that's what I think
they are my mother and that

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.720
because she has white hair.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.920
And my mom is the most beautiful
woman I've ever really seen.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:08.190 position:56%
And, she's so wise to the point
like she framed and I gave her a lot

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.500
of credit of making Rahim
AlHaj as a musician.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.140
And my father was a typical
Middle Eastern father who is--

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.640
his power and his authority
has to be in a place

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.980
and the kids has to
follow the rules.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.330
And I call him the stick, actually.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.930
So-- And my mom she's, you know,
is ruled that kind of house.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.390
And because I'm different
and because I was born

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.430
in different time, in
the wrong time, right,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.160
to my father according to my mom.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.930
And so, I started my life
with this kind of environment

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.490
of beautiful people who
loves me and adore me

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.390
because I'm the youngest, right?

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.660
And I'm their toy because they
don't have kids that time.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.470
There's nobody.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:13.170
So, since-- then I started
my initiation to music.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.950
And like I said, again,
when my mom played a role--

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:23.260
a huge role in my music career and
my personality at the same time.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.940
I remember so vividly, one
day when I was in practice--

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.370
I practice a lot and my
father doesn't need me

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.570
to be a musician, never ever.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:43.050 position:56%
And in fact, I remember so vividly
that he hold a gun actually one time

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.180
and he put it to his head.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.990
He said, "If you really continue
music, I'm going to kill myself."

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.380
So, he needs me to
do something else.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.800
And I did, actually.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.860
In fact, I went to-- And I studied
Arabic literature with music

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.160
in conservatory--

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.000
Baghdad Conservatory because
that's the only way I can continue

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.960
studying music.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.030
But I remember my mom told him--
One day they have conversation

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.820
and she told him, "Can you please
don't give this kid a hard time,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.760 position:56%
because he will the most of
important oud player in the planet."

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.630
I don't know what that means,
really, when I'm a kid.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.700
I'm like seven years old, you know?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.000
It's nothing.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.150
It doesn't come to
me what's that mean

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.780
that your mother can see
this potential for a musician

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.590
in you and you have no idea.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.340
All I can do is to play the oud.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.000
So, I remember one time,
I was practicing at night

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.270 position:56%
and usually I developed a really bad
habit sleeping with my instrument.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.850
I mean, I can't for five
years, I cannot go to sleep

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.150
if I don't have my instrument.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.430
So I cover it with a blanket.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.730
I kiss it.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.400
And one time I was there and I
was really tired and I was talking

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.610
to the oud, "I'm sorry
baby, I'm really tired.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.630
So can we play tomorrow,"
and like that.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.670
And just like a real
person, you know?

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.280
So I cover it and I
kiss it and I cover it

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.580
and was father was passing by.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.770
And he went to my mom and
he said, "Our son is insane.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.620
We need to do something about it."

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.310
So I'm like [inaudible].

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.570 position:56%
And-- So he really wasn't into music

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:44.620
but he has the most beautiful
voice I've ever heard in my life.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:54.020
And when he sing, the depth
and the sensibility in it,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:00.270
he took this voice to cry.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:07.470
Because he came from-- And my mom
at the same time, they are cousins.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.200
It came from a Marsh
Arabs in the south.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.930
And the Marsh, as you
know, is just water, right?

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.280 position:56%
That's how they-- and then when they
go to the boat from house to house

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.970
and there's the trees high.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.920
So that's where they use
their voice, singing.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:30.430
And he has absolutely
haunting voice, haunting.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.280
I remember one time he was
singing and he went and grab my oud

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.330
and I want to know which kind
of maqam he used, you know,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.620
what kind of maqam he sing to.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.790
And my mom just stopped and
she said, "What are you doing?"

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.340
I said, "What?

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.640
I want play with him."

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.830
She said, "No, no, no, son.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.610
He is actually crying.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.800
Did you not see?"

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:01.420
I said, "No wonder why this is so
deep in sound of sadness in it."

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:08.570
After that, actually I remember
my mom bought me the first suit

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.870
when I went to perform.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.660
I was in second grade
of-- in literature school.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.320
And, you know, suit and
something like that.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.170
And my father never actually
came to any of my concerts.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.370
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Can you remember
any of those songs that he sang?

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.670
Can you sing any of them?

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.970
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah, of course.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.900
There's some maqams which
is really interesting

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.780
and very important in
Iraq, specifically.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.420
We use maqam as [inaudible].

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.280
Now the south actually
is fascinating.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.080
The maqam they use-- And that's my
theory when I did that in school,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:55.060
when I was a student when I
graduated from a conservatory.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.820
I did my paper of the difference
between the north and the south

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.440
over the maqam, how they
use it and how the Kurdish

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:10.150 position:56%
and the north they use are different
from people who lives in Ahwar,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.280
which is the Marsh
Arab, for example.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.840
So and then I figured
out that all these people

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.770
who create their own
style and their own voice

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.620 position:56%
but they have no idea what's called.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.800
So when I go there, I said, well,
do you know this, for example,

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.800
you think of maqam bayati?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.670
So all of them are maqam
bayati when you play it

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.320
but the emphasis is different.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.570
So they call them by name,
Swherly [assumed spelling],

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:47.140
Nazry [assumed spelling],
Sultani, and name it.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.000
Like, whether that
frame of bayati or saba.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.510
So, I remember, for
example, when they said--

00:10:54.510 --> 00:11:13.040
[ Singing ]

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.070
It's very haunting but sad.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.270
It's like you're waiting
for something, you know?

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.510
And by in the north, they talk
about something else, like--

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.040
[ Singing ]

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.340
It's very short.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.800 position:56%
Because they live in the mountains
and they do not have the surrounding

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.650
because of the echo of
your-- is what it counts.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.120
It's very interesting.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.680
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Do they
sing words to those songs?

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.010
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Absolutely.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.310
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: All right.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.860
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: And, you
know, I can bring in some song

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.560
but usually they talk
about their life,

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.490
their love for things
or missing things.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:54.400
Most of them are missing things,
and because death is very profound

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.420
in their life, especially when
we're talking about at the south.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:04.360
The south has very
interesting creature I call them

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.430
because they create
everything basically.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.340
I mean, historically actually,

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.970
the Sumerian people
who lived in the south.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:17.750
I mean, the Marsh actually just
last week, they announced it

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.960
as a heritage of UNESCO basically.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.910
I mean, it took them that years.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.210
I mean, they don't understand,

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:29.300
this is actually what the
Sumerian civilization has started,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.510
literary there, you know,
from Ur, Lakish, and Kish.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.810
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Right.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.310
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: So, I started
with that environment of people.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:42.640
Nobody-- Actually my
brother is a good artist

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.180
and very famous artist actually.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.570
He's a visual artist.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:46.870
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What's his name?

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.220
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: He's named Salim.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.690
And he-- My father was OK
with him because he just--

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.320
you know, he's a painter but
I am a troublemaker, right?

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.620
I'm the musician.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:05.800
When I was in the second grade,
I remember this beautiful story

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:11.790
that I was in second grade and
my teacher, he's Arabic teacher.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.050
He's not a music teacher.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.780
And one day, he brought
the oud with him.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.810
And he would sing to us.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.500
He was a communist actually.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.520
And, so he sings to us
and I was fascinated

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.010
by the sound, by the shiver.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.570
And as you know, you
know, in Middle East,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.420
a teacher is like a god, you know?

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.810
It is not like human
being, you know?

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.420
So you cannot just look
them to the eye, right?

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.240
So I was like this and I
wasn't courageous enough

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.200
to ask him, "Can I just touch it?"

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.350 position:56%
And he looked at me he said, "Sure."

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.610
So I raised my hand
and he just touched it.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:04.810
And there is something
profound and things come to my--

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.910
all of my body is just like, "Oh."

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.380
In fact, they have
chill, I remember.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.190
So I couldn't sleep from the hand
that touched this instrument.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.850
And next day or the day after,
I remember he brought it again

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.940
and I said, "Can I touch it?"

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:26.560 position:56%
Because I have this beautiful
ecstasy when I just touch this wood,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.070
you know, so soft and
like it's beautiful.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.860
And he looked at me and said,
"Do you want to play it?"

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.640
I said, "Yeah."

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.300
So, he hold it to me and
he said, "Be careful."

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.010
And it was like really bigger
than me, you know, the oud.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:47.950
So he hold it to me and
I tried to imitate him.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.950
So I put my right hand and then--

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.730
like this and then
I put my left hand.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.240
This is exactly like him.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.100
And I was so nervous and he
strums something and he's shocked.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.460
And he said, "Wow.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.680
You want to be a musician?

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.500
Take it." Can you imagine--

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.800
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.100
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: -- a
teacher give you ouds

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.780
because of a new like instrument.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.570
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And you never
sing or played a note before?

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.130
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: No, in my life.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.700
I mean, I heard it in
the radio or TV but--

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.000
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.100
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: So he started
actually teaching, you know,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.050
basics of maqam [inaudible]
and major and minor.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.310
And then the next day I was
just like doing something,

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.540
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.630
The song-- And he just freaked out.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.030
I mean, how do you know this?

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.910
You can play it but you do
not know which maqam is.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.730
I said, "I have no idea."

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.480
So, by the second grade-- I mean

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.920
in third grade I did there my
first solo concert basically.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.380
I was in elementary.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.910
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: He let
you take the oud home or--

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.210
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.510
In fact, that's a beautiful
story that.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.920
You know, going home with
oud bigger then me, I can't.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.220
I just can't let go.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.340
So I asked him politely if I can--

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.000
if he can just walk me because
the kids they're going to take it

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.260
from me or they, you know,
usually they throw rocks

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.440
on you or things weirdly.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.970
So he went with me to my home
and told my mom in that time,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.960
and teacher is very respectful
and they respected that.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.300
So, when the teacher come to your
home, it was like a big deal.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.750
It's a huge deal.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.680
So he told my mom, "Well, he
has really a great potential

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.270
to be a musician, and I
can see he's a musician.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.190
And this instrument I'm
going to give it to him.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.490
So he didn't steal it.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.280
He didn't-- You know, that's his.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.960
And I will teach him
little by little, you know?"

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.550
And she was thrilled.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.350
Now the problem after
six months and he said,

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.100
"Rahim, I'm not a music teacher.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:52.500
You need a real one who can teach
you, you know, how to either write

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.780
and system and theory
and something like that,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:01.770 position:56%
to be able to continue your career."

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.820
And then he followed me to
another teacher, [inaudible name]

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.240
which is wonderful human being
who taught me for I think,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.680
one or two years at that time.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:21.740
By then, I just find myself how
to create my own voice and own--

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:27.560
and I always was interested really
about peace and justice, you know,

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.530
social justice basically.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.120
And we can talk to you
about it later about that.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.230
But that's the environment
actually--

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.660
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So
you're maybe 10 years old,

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.390
12 years old, or something
like that--

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.690
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Correct.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.990
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: --
now, right, actually?

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.290
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.540
That time when I-- Yeah,
by 13, I started composing.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:55.750
In fact, by 13, I win the national
youth, composer youth of Iraq.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.050
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: We
heard one of your songs--

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Correct, that's one.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: -- at the concert.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:00.950
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Absolutely.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.250
So--

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.550
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: That was it?

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yes, that's the one.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.760
And I compose it because it was
something that maybe, you know,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.370
for them it was like
very interesting.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:13.030
How this kid can take this
maqam dasht and transform it

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:18.970
to maqam bayati and make mode
of it with rhythm is called a--

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.510 position:56%
it's very Iraqi rhythm, specifically
Iraqi rhythm culturally.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:27.470
[ Singing ]

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:32.640
So it was innovative things
at that time, you know?

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:39.090
It's not-- So, since then, when I
win that composer for the youth--

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.330
composer in Iraq when I was 13.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.630
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What
year were you born?

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.930
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: 1968.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.230
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: 1968.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.530
So here we are at 70 or around--

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.830
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: 40--

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.130
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: -- 81?

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.430
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yes, right.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.730
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.470
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: After that, you
know, I was like became famous TV

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.590
and newspaper and magazine.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:02.760
And-- But my father, he's
never took it seriously.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.660
Never. He's never really--

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.270
we're watching TV and
newspaper and magazine.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.510
I mean, big deal there, you
know, when you are in TV.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.810
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Right.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.110
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: It's a big deal.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.410
And even in newspaper,
your picture, you know,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.370
smiling or something like that.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.460
But my father, I think, he-- he's--

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.480
I mean, when I look at him
right now, he did what he can.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.780
He thought, you know,

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.380
being a musician it will
make me a troublemaker.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.270
He doesn't know I'm a
troublemaker anyway,

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.050
you know, with or without him.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:36.510
So that's actually the
environment that I grew up with.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.810
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: In the concert,

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:42.590 position:56%
I don't know if what the exact
story was but you mentioned counting

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.010
to four and that your
mother would give the kids--

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.310
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.610
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What
was that about?

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.910
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.750
This is a-- When I was there, you
know, always practicing always,

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.600
compose music and-- because it--

00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:00.090
the oud to me, it was
my breath and still.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.340
And I cannot breathe
without my-- never.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.920
I mean, I never ever been away from
my oud except one year and a half

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.470
when I was in Brazil, you know?

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:20.170 position:56%
And in fact I did-- I wrote my first
concierto actually in the prison.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.230
But this piece actually,
I remember my mom used

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.670
to clap like, right, like that.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.550
And she made up some
whatever Habibi,

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.870
sweetheart, to keep them down.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.360
And I was like, "How this
Irish rhythm came to you?"

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.210
And then I find out,
well, actually yes,

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:43.640
because we are occupied
by Britain that time.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:48.040
So, they brought this rhythm with
them and introduce it to Iraq

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.180
because this is-- we
have like for Georgina,

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.860
we have Laxom [assumed
spelling], we have, you know?

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.910 position:56%
That's what the Iraqi-- specific
Iraqi but not one, two, three, four.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.210
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Right.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Usually we have 6/8,
we have 10/8, we have 32, you know,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.580
like very complicated
rhythm not, you know,

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.350
some rhythms one, two, three, four.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.610
So I-- I'm haunted by it.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.170
I was like, well, this
is a beautiful tune

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.450
to compose on this-- in her memory.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:22.780
Actually, I compose it for
actually string quartet that time.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:28.360
By then I think as a musician,
as a human being, well,

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:34.450
you would be influenced around
what environment you live with.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.460
Now, I'm-- why my generation
actually,

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.960
we are very unlucky
generation actually.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.500
Because we-- I call them
the generation of war.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.140
I grow up when the
Iran-Iraq war started,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.820
which is eight years, right?

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.120
I mean, huge.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.420
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What
year would that have been?

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.670
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: It was
1980 and ended in 1988.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.230
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And as I recall,

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.840
more than a million
people died in the war.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.140
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Correct.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.400
So we lost one million from the
Iraq and one million for Iran.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.710
And that's beautiful, now we are
playing together-- the Iranian.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.810
I mean, that's what's
significant about it.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:18.410 position:56%
By the way I remember so vividly, I
was in Paris at one time and there's

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.360
in Iran-- I never saw Iran.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.730
I had never in my life.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.760
I mean-- Because they
are our enemy, right?

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:32.100
That's how they show it
in TV and in the media.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.190
So-- And I was in Paris and there
is an Iranian man who came to me,

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.720
in the concert, introduced
himself as an Iranian.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.160
And I was shocked.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.550
Because I never saw Iranian
human people as, you know,

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.360
just like touch me and--
because that's how I see it,

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.110
this war-- killing, death.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.110
Because used to-- the
regime that time used

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:00.870
to show everyday, 8
o'clock at night.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.290
In the national TV or to--

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.660
because we have one TV actually
with just two channel and owned--

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.810
of course controlled
by the government.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:14.440
They have showed [foreign words],
is like pictures of battles.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:19.010
So whatever the battles happen
there, you know, across the Iraq,

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:23.990
they show all these dead
people and soldiers of Iran.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.620
And that's all the
picture of Iran I have.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.930
It's fascinating.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:35.090
So, years and years later, I'm
playing with Iranian musician.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.380
So, I remember I had
a chill when this guy,

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.490
the Iranian is a human
being, in Paris.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.890
That's why actually it
lead us to this point

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.440 position:56%
that I figured out this is not fair.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.040
This is-- When I come
back, I said, "No, no, no.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.970
This is not fair."

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.700
There is no justification
for this war.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.880
We lost one million people

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.410
and we have 600,000 disabled,
both sides by the way.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:14.260
And I started protesting
the war and compose music,

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.820
actually criticizing the war,

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.410
criticizing the government
that time.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:23.320
Which lead me to be in trouble
with the government that time.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.760
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What was the
song or the piece that you--

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.060
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yes.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.360
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: --
an example or what?

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.660
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Correct.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.380
I remember I composed one
piece this called "Why".

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.100
Composed-- Actually written
by a dear friend of mine,

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.410
my childhood friend [inaudible
name] who is still alive actually.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:45.310
Last year when I went there,
I was searching for him.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:49.300
And we wrote-- he wrote
these lyrics about--

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.680
it's called "Why" [inaudible]
criticizing because that time,

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.030
we cannot say directly
what's going on.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.600
We have to go, you know, around it.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.100
I mean, we interpret
our poetry or music.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.580
You cannot say "Saddam is a
dictator," we cannot say that.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:14.560
So why was comparison
between good and bad,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.530
to ask why there is rich
people and poor people?

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:24.590
Why there is hungry
people and not hungry?

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:30.080
Why there is justice and injustice?

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.010
We go on and on and
there's why, why, why.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:39.020
So when you hear it,
you don't really prefer

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.050
to criticize the government.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.040
You can defend it to some degree.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.450
But I think the regime is smart
enough to figure out that.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.180
And what happens later, actually,

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.080
this piece becomes
very popular in Iraq.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.590
In fact, one time, I remember
so vividly, we sing in weddings.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.540
In weddings.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.650
And me and Drod [assumed
spelling] and friends,

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.040
[inaudible] was a friend of ours.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.090
His brother was getting married,
which he didn't like that

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.830
in the wedding and
they stopped singing,

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.630
and they stopped singing
that "Why" song.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.460
And Drod said, "I didn't
wrote this piece."

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.180
"You're the composer?"

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.080
I said, "I'm not the composer
of this piece," really.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.910
So finally, you know, they
get-- they find out, you know,

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.320
who wrote this piece
and who has composed it.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.630
He was very famous, you know?

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.780
They used in their
wedding, you know,

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:41.120
whatever things they
can have opportunity to.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.540
Because for them, it's become
a voice, to what they hold

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.260 position:56%
against the regime during that time.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.010
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And when
you say they found out,

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.180
you mean people in
the regime found out?

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.480
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Correct.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.780
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: The regime, you
know, they have a lot of mukhabarat,

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.070
you know, intelligence and
[inaudible] there which is very--

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.540
like any dictatorship
anywhere in the world

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.960
because they are very strong.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.680
And Saddam was very
strong, a very strong person

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:16.100
who controlled the country
in very bad way, anyway.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:22.280
So, soon they find out I'm the one.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.870
And it was-- actually like
I said, I was speaking

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.540
out against the Saddam regime.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.840
And then beyond.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.140
You know, I thought I'm going

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.000
to change the regime,
of course, you know?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.060
And I joined a lot of
group who believe in that.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.330
And it was difficult at that
time because if you find out,

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.070
they want to execute
you no matter what.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:50.110
So, actually, I fled to the North.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.510
And I was the messenger
between the Baghdad

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.120
and the people who lives in--

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.660
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: At
Like Mosul or what--

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.960
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: No.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.260
And it took in the Kurdish--

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.560
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: The Kurdish.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.860
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Kurdish.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.160
That's why we played
this one-- Kurdish one.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:11.240
So I spent for like one year
and a half, actually in prison.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.130
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And what--
how did that happened?

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.760 position:56%
What-- So when you are in the North?

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.750
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: No, in Baghdad.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.740
They catch me in Baghdad actually.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.590
Not just me, there's a lot,
you know, of people who--

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:31.110
young and older people who--
from different kind of belief.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:36.370
Actually, there is this Islamic
group and there's communist group

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:41.400
and there's a nationalist group
who is whatever somebody he is,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.470
you know, poets, writer,
novelist, whatever who is speaking

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.950
out against Saddam
regime that time, he was--

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:53.430
they will end up to this matter.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:29:02.200
So I remember so vividly one day
I get tired of it from the torture

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.750
of the day, you know, like, we
are very [inauduble] in room

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:10.030
with seven to eight feet.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:12.650
We sleep in turn.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:23.550 position:56%
So I remember, all I needed that
time to save my fingers, all I need.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.320 position:56%
So, when they put you on the chair--

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.310
so I put my hands, I
will hide my finger.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.180
Because they are stupid,
they need to charge me.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.970
It's like spread my
fingers and that's it, done.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:43.300
So I was hiding it and
make my body available.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:47.640
So he can torture me as much as
he can but don't break my fingers.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.670
That's all I need.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.570
You know, for one year and a half--

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.280
And now actually I'm
talking about it openly,

00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.670
for years it means I
couldn't really talk about it.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:06.140
One day I've decided to
finish it, to end it.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.060
Because the pain was too
profound and inconceivable

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.360
to some degree, you know?

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:17.620
You see your friend, you know,
everyday in turn, today is me,

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:23.850 position:56%
tomorrow is Dan, tomorrow Sabah
[assumed spelling], Salim, whatever.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:28.210
I decided this is it,
it's not worth it.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:32.450
I have to finish it.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.410
They way you have to
finish it is to--

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.200
I thought about it--
is to provoke this guy.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.150
He can just beat me up to death.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:47.870
So I started to provoke
him actually, to finish it.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:51.000
But he didn't have-- He was
torturing me and blah, blah, blah,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.120
blah, but he didn't have the
authority to finish it, to kill me.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:07.600 position:56%
But that was the moment I thought
this is it, I can't take it anymore.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.150
But then, you know,
for 1 year and a half,

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:18.230
some of them actually it's
here, been here, you know?

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:24.100
And sometimes I'd just be
emotional when I go back to that.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:29.430
I remember one time I
had a concert in Chicago.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:36.460
And there's a dear friend of mine,
Basim, and actually he was here.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.020
He came I think four
years after I came here

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.550
in 2004 or something like that.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.450
So I have there and he came
and I said, "Well, look,

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:45.750
there's an Iraqi-- they told me

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.280
that there is an Iraqi
restaurant, they sell kebab.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.740
You know, I would love to see this

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.500
because I haven't seen
it for a while.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.800
They said, "Yeah, yeah.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.100
There's a restaurant."

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:59.800 position:56%
So we took a taxi and he knows where
the restaurant and we went there.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.140
So I'm happy to see Basim.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.090
And we seated there and
talk in the restaurant.

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.430
I'm pretty excited.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:13.800
And there is a guy who
just go back and forth,

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.630
like a heavy guy and
was [inaudible].

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:23.690
And I don't know who is this guy,
but he was really staring to me

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:26.800
and look at me and
look at me [inaudible].

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.300
And 10, 5 minutes whatever
it is, and he came to me

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.100
and he said, "Do you know me?"

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.270
I said, "Not really.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:37.500
You know, I see a lot of
people of everyday, you know?"

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.490
And that's true.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.790
I have a problem with--

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.090
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yes.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.390
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: As you know.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:44.690
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: I know you do.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:45.990
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.290 position:56%
I have a problem with name and date.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:50.080
So he said, "Do you remember me?"

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.590
And I said, "No, not really.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:52.890
I'm sorry.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.330
I'm really sorry."

00:32:54.330 --> 00:33:02.750
And he-- in one second,
he showed me his legs.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:09.700
Just like that he took his
pants up and I saw his leg.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:19.190
And I remember it just
came like that.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:25.560
I started crying because
I know this leg.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.110
I saved it.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.390
In North he got shot by the regime.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:35.260
And we are in the North, because we
fight in Saddam regime that time,

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:39.650
and he got shot by the Iraqi army.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.840
And I tried, you know, really
to save his leg that time.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:48.750
And I looked at him
and say, "Oh my god."

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.140
But, you know, he became
bald and, you know,

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.680
really-- I don't remember that.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.290
He left in 1991.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.700
And I haven't seen him for
like, what, 25 something years,

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.080
you know, more than that.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.180
But I don't remember his
face but I remember his leg.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.890 position:56%
So, I went it and kiss it, you know?

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:13.360
I was like, wow, this is the leg
that I was crying and saved it.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:20.090
And he came to United States, you
know, refugee like anybody else.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:21.390
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Wow.

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:23.250
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Sometimes we think
of-- I mean, of course, you know,

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.230
after that they came
to the concert a lot.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:28.010
And he's the owner
of that restaurant.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.310
[ Laughter ]

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:32.450
The restaurant we went,
he is the owner of that.

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:33.750
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: In Chicago?

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.050
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah, in Chicago.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.550
It's incredible.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:42.490
So that environment, that's
what shaped, to be honest,

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:45.980
my music, the social justice.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:52.280
In two topics, I'm fascinated by--
and actually not just fascinated,

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:59.690 position:56%
I'm obsessive about talking about in
my music is in children and women.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.510
Children and women is the most
important to me because children,

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.610
they do not have voice and
women at the same time.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:10.370
Trying to be their voice, take
their stories and write it down

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:15.330
and take their story to be
heard so we can make a change.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:19.290
So I'm really putting my
music in that direction.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.600
Just women and children,
that's it, and of course that.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.040
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Could
you say a few words

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.450
about your memory of leaving Iraq?

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:31.750
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:39.290
Yeah, actually, it was the
most and the most crucial--

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:51.130
crucial and more painful --
inconceivably, to my time.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:55.550
Just because-- First of all, I
cannot leave Iraq because I am--

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.520
I was the black sheep, right?

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.110
I'm, like my father said,
a little troublemaker.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:05.800
And my Mom decided to get me out.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.790
I mean, the only way to get me out
is to buy me a travel document--

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:15.150
false travel document because
I cannot leave Iraq legally.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:22.020
So, she-- a bribed a
guy, he said I'm going

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.730
to provide him the passport

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:33.450
and he needs 1 million
dinar which is $25,000.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.450
That time was really 1981.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:40.090
It was a lot of money and
it's still a lot of money.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.800
So my Mom had to do anything.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.230 position:56%
I mean, she sold everything, all her
belongings including her clothes,

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:53.420
including her clothes just
to save me, to get me out.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:37:01.370
And secretly nobody knows except
me and my Mom and brothers and her

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:05.060
and this guy who has to take me
from Baghdad to Jordan to Amman

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.170
with false [inaudible]
and a different name.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:20.920 position:56%
And it was difficult because I-- the
moment I put one step out my home,

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.510
the gate, and I was walking.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:36.240
And then I said, "Just don't look"
because my father was sitting

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.720
and smoking his cigarette.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:49.070
He said, if I look back,
I'm not going to go.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:54.810
So, I took my oud and I let my
brother take my books, my suitcase

00:37:54.810 --> 00:38:00.020
and from that other gate,
you know, outside the gate.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.450
So I was walking.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:08.460
Opened the gate and my
father is still smoking.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.970
I just turned like that.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:15.190
And he just looked at me like this.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:18.590
He says, "Rahim, just
leave, just leave."

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:26.900
I left. And my brother and-- we
went there and the guy and I took

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.270
that taxi and we go to Jordan.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:38.380
In the borders between Iraq and
Jordan, I didn't have anything.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.250
I have my books and oud, that's it.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:49.550
And I have mustache because we need
to make it something different.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.900
That time, when you go out of Iraq,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.550
you cannot take two things,
books and instrument.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.970
It's illegal.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.850
Unless you have a permission from
the Ministry of Culture saying, oh,

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:04.680
Rahim is doing concerts in Jordan
or whatever or United States,

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.080
so you are-- and you have the
permission from the Ministry

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.420
of Culture so you can
take your instrument

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.150
through otherwise there's
no way to--

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:15.380
for it to allow you to
take an instrument outside.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:21.240
So when we get to the
border-- the custom, right?

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.670
And they took it, because
it was there.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:30.070
And I said, "Where
are you taking that?"

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.050
And he said, "No, no.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:33.350
You're allowed to take it."

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.990
I said, "No, no, no it's mine."

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.540
I said, what do you mean?

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.030
You're not.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.330
Are you a musician?

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:42.960
And I said, "No."

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.610
"Do you have a paper from
the Ministry of Culture?"

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:49.910
I said, "No."

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.530
I said. "No, I do not."

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:57.130 position:56%
So he took it and he sent it to, you
know, another room with this custom

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.530
where something that you're
not allowed to take with.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:03.760
And they put it like [inaudible].

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.630 position:56%
And I wasn't really-- I was furious.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.810
I need my instrument.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:13.910
Because this-- the
instrument I grow up with,

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:20.080
since I was seven years old,
until I became, what, 22, 23,

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.500
24 something like that
when I left Iraq.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.070
I mean, it's not an
instrument to me, it's my life,

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.220
it's my breathe, like I said.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.520
I grow up with it.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.840
I became musician with it.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.470
I became a human being
with it, actually.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.940
So being-- leaving my
instrument behind, no, no,

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.270
this is not the question.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:44.590
And I can't, because
I can't breathe.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.970
So I went there to the
officer and I talked to him.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:51.800
I was begging him, "Please,
can I have just my instrument?"

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.300
He said, "No, you can't."

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.260
And this guy, he was furious.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:03.470 position:56%
Because if we-- if he catch us-- not
just me, him, he will be in trouble,

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.480
he will be executed just like that.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.660
So he was begging me, Rahim, just
please-- just move, just move.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.490
Because they stamped
our passport, you know?

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.780
So, OK, I told him,
"No, no, no, I can't.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.410
So we go and he was,
you know, really angry.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.320
And he said, "Look, I
will bring it to you.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.760
I promise I'm going
to bring it to you."

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:31.690
So I remember we go to the
bus and then I find myself

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:39.410
like I don't have my
instrument, I go back.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:44.100
I'm running to him, begging him
and crying and crying and crying.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.260
"Just give it to me
because I can't breathe."

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:52.370
And he said, "No, if you
want to go back, you go back.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.260
Take it. If you back to Iraq,
there's no problem, take it,

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:01.080
but you cannot take it out."

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.990
So, in one second I get sick,
really, I get really ill,

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.010 position:56%
in just a minute, I mean really ill.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:11.950
I was shaking, you
know, like something.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.290
My body couldn't take it.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:18.440 position:56%
The whole thing, my body couldn't
really handle that pressure too much

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:25.570
by -- afraid to be caught and
have my breath, I call it.

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.480
I can't really.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.890
And this guy who I was
just begging to get in,

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:38.250
so he pushed me to the bus.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:45.790
So we just passed the
boarders from Iraq to Jordan.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:53.280
And that was the most difficult

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:57.110
and the most crucial
moment in my entire life.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:00.210
I mean, torture I don't care,
but this one was really,

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:05.330
really important to me,
was really profound to me.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:09.090
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So, you went
from Jordan then to Syria?

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:10.390
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yes.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:11.780
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And then
you had experiences in Syria,

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.670
you found something
special in Syria?

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:17.970
What happened then?

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.270
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Right.

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.680
There in Jordan I was hiding
actually during that time.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.640
And actually, before I will go
there which is beautiful but I need

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:30.800
to say something really,
really important about that.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:37.090
This passport, I went-- I was
in Jordan because it was valid

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:47.660 position:56%
for one year because it's different,
name is different, and it expired.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:51.470
I cannot go anywhere.

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:56.300
There is my childhood friend,
his name is Aden [phonetic]

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.410
who lives in Frankfort now.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:02.450
His brother Hamad Sudani [assumed
spelling] which is my dear friend,

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:07.030
also my childhood friend
who is the most famous, now,

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:09.110
visual artist in whole
United States,

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:18.120
I mean like hot, like
million and a half.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.210
And he is a calligraphy guy.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:31.980
He faked the stamp of
Iraqi embassy in Jordan.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.280
He faked it.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:38.690
He wrote it just like this,
as if it's like a stamp.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.960
And we signed it and
valid for two years.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.520
He faked it.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.950
In Syria during that time
there is no relationship

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.250
to Israel-- Iraq, and Syria.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:55.540
So everybody in Syria-- Iraqi
and Syria mean that he is

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.590
against Saddam regime
and vice versa.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:03.650
All the Syrians against the
Syrian regime, they live in Iraq,

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.450
so they don't relationship now.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:10.320
So, all the opposite groups
who worked against Saddam--

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:16.460
the other two countries, was
Syria and Iran at that time.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:24.460
So, they get an invitation to go
to Syria, Damascus, to a concert,

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.360
which is all the opposite
groups they know who I am,

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.430
of course, you know, talk to them.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.990 position:56%
And they said, "Rahim, you need to
get out because Jordan is not safe."

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.520
I was hiding.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.890
I don't need to see-- you
know, because the only country

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:45.090
at time period who is-- has a
normal relationship with Iraq.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:48.250
After the invasion, everything
just collapsed, right?

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:56.650
So the only contact to the
world was Jordan, that's it.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:00.480
So all the Iraqi police, they are
in Jordan, basically, you know,

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.070
because that's how they do it.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:03.370
So I was hiding, like I said,

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:09.320
in that time until I get this
invitation to go to Syria,

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.680
Damascus to do this concert.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.130
Long story short, I
went to Damascus.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:23.020
And in Damascus, you know, when--

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:27.870
as soon as I cross
the border, I'm safe.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:33.040
And they told the taxi
driver to stop, to stop.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:39.170
And he said, "What do you want?"

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.390
I said, "To stop."

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:49.690
So I went out of the car and--
because the minute I put my foot

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:54.050
in the ground of Syria, this is it.

00:46:54.050 --> 00:47:01.160
There's no return to
Iraq, that's it.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.490
So, I kissed the ground
actually on Syria

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.820
and getting teary at that time.

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.120
And he said, "Why?"

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.950
I said, "This is Damascus."

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:15.050
The taxi driver said, "so what?"

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:19.360
But he didn't understand
what I'm talking about.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.810
It's way, way, way, way, way
difficult for him to understand.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.710
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And
you stayed for awhile?

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:27.630
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: It is really great.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:30.480
In fact, I didn't want to
leave Syria-- in Damascus.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.960
I stayed there for eight years.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:39.230
In fact, my first-- my wife Nada,
she was a professional journalist.

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:44.170
And she came to interview me,
which is like one day or two days.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:47.910
And I looked at her, she's
a beautiful, gorgeous,

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:50.200
you know, woman, right, Syrian.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.100
And I said, "Well, could
you please marry me?

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.400
like that."

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.700
[ Laughter ]

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.000
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: There's
something--

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.300
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Just like that.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.600
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Somehow
I believe that.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.900
[ Laughter ]

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:02.200
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: She is
gorgeous, she's beautiful.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.470 position:56%
I said, "Could you please marry me?"

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.310
You know, Arabic woman, shy.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:09.080
And we fall in love.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.040
And I stayed for eight years.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.790
And until 2000, actually, and
I came to the United States.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:21.530
And back to the story of
the password-- passport.

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:24.110
So when you're out of Syria
basically you don't need anything,

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.120
you know, because you
are safe, right?

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.420
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Right.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.960
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: And you are
working with the opposite group

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.990
and Iraqi groups who
were against Saddam

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.810
and the government they don't
bother you with anything.

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.530
They really welcome you.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:40.180 position:56%
So I don't need the passport, right?

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.980
So what we do as an Iraqi,
at that time when we live

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.180
in Syria, is that we fake it.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.900
The government, they told
us just to bring fake one,

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.860 position:56%
and then you can leave, it's normal.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.440
Because they know where
they're going to get, you know,

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.010
Iraqi-- normal Iraqi passport.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:57.660
So we get basically from
the north, from the Kurds

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.630
who are giving them-- smuggling to.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:02.880
And we go on different
name, language,

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.580
to Lebanon I was using
different name.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:12.660
So, that time when I came to United
States, I said I don't need it.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.400
So I give it to my friend Ahmed,

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.660
Ahmed Hashim who was living
right now in Iraq, who was the--

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:23.680
he's a beautiful, wonderful
scholar in French literature.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.950
And now he actually has a
program, Iraq TV [inaudible].

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.700
I said, "Ahmed, take it."

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:35.410
Because the way you can get out
of Syria, you need passport.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.880
So I gave it to him.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.090
He faked it.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:43.390
And he went to Belgium and
he get asylum in Belgium.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:46.810
And he went back to Syria,
you know, just to visit.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.110
And he called me.

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.310
He said, "Rahim, what will
I do with this passport?"

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:52.920
I said, "Just give it
to Nada," you know?

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.190
I was here, United States.

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.170
So he gave them back my passport.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:05.160
You know, it's already expired, you
know, it's like long, all right?

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:09.010
So he gave it to them.

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:13.340
Until last year, I
went back to Baghdad.

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:14.640
And I talked to Nada.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.880
I'm like, "Do you know what
happened to the passport?"

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Nada is your wife.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.480
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah, Nada my wife.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.190
Sorry, I have to clarify that.

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:27.720
She said, "I think, Rahim, he gave
it to us and still in the house?"

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.830
I said, "It would be
great if I could have it."

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:34.800
So we called him and
said, yeah, we have it.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.280
So I said, but now the-- because
the situation in Syria last year,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.670
you can't, you know,
really do normal mail.

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:46.960
I said, can you please send it to
Lebanon and from Lebanon, you know,

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.110
send it in FedEx, whatsoever,
so I can get it?

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:50.590
So they went there and
they said, "No, no, no,

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:56.060
we cannot send a passport
document to America.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.360
We can't."

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.670
Well, what can I do?

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:05.840
And then all of a sudden,
Nada's cousin who is working,

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.070
he is the head of the
Syrian airline.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:11.350
He said, "I have an idea.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:21.250
How about we send it with a
flight attendant in Damascus, huh?

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.400
And soon as they go
to Baghdad we give it

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.940
to somebody there and call you.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.250
You can receive it in Baghdad.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:29.550
Why you need it now?

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:37.030
Go to Baghdad then
you receive it there."

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:40.110
So, I went to Baghdad from
here, from New Mexico.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:41.850
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: From the
States-- Yeah, from New Mexico.

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:48.710
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: I went back
to New Mexico and to Baghdad.

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:51.170
Two days, Nada called
me and she said, "Well,

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:52.860
here's the number you need to call.

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:57.190
This is the guy who
has the passport."

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:58.680
So, I called him and
he said, "Oh, yeah,

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.050
I have this old Iraqi passport.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.840
What are you going to do with it?"

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.140
I said, "Nothing."

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.350
So, where do you leave blah, blah?

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:07.650
He said I'm at this hotel.

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:15.230
And we went, me and my brother
Salim and Hamad, my nephew.

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:20.590
So, I went to the hotel and called
him and he's coming back down.

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:22.610
I was waiting at the lobby.

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.790
And this guy, he came and he
said my name is such and such.

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:30.720
And he just gave it
to me, like that.

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.970
So, I just-- I look at it.

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:36.270
I was in tears.

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:40.390
And I said, I couldn't believe.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:44.310
Oh, my god, this is passport.

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:56.390
I got it from Iraq who cost my mom
$25,000, and saved another life,

00:52:56.390 --> 00:53:03.010
faked in Jordan, and I
received it in Baghdad.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:07.340
That's doesn't happen
in novels, really.

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:10.960
If you need to write it in a
novel, you cannot write it--

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:17.920
the significant things about
that passport because --

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:24.120
issued in Baghdad after 25
years, I received in Baghdad.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.150
I thought about that.

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:28.000
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And
it had a stamp by one

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.580
of Iraq's most favorite artists.

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:30.880
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Absolutely.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.180
[ Laughter ]

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: A beautiful story.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.930
Was that-- You visited a
music store at one point?

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.230
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yes.

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:39.530
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And you
returned from the States

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:40.830
to Baghdad, what year what that?

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:43.450
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: That was in 2004
after the invasion, actually.

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:44.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What happen there?

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:47.370
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: This is
when the invasion happen,

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:51.610
of course that's the only way I
was able to return back to Baghdad,

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:53.410
because before that I can't.

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:59.710 position:56%
And so as soon the invasion
happened and Saddam regime fall out,

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:03.270
and now I can, I can
go back to Iraq.

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:06.270
So I went in 2004.

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:08.420
So, I told Salim.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.170
My brother said, you
know, what I need--

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:14.960
I need to go to places that I
used to go, you know, coffees

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:20.340
and friends meet and talk about
politics and philosophy and music

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:25.120
and art, and the record store

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.070
where we get our cassettes
and things like that.

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:29.910
I said, "Sure."

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.150
So we went there.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.860
Tell him I need to go
L'Chaim [phonetic] Records,

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.820
it's called L'Chaim.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.730
So, I told Salim, "Salim,
could you please tell him

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:43.520
if he has Rahim AlHaj CDs."

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.420
So he went there and he said,
"Do you have Rahim AlHaj CDs?"

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:49.450
He said "Who is Rahim AlHaj?"

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:52.100
He's Arabic what kind
of song he sing.

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.740
He said, "No, no, he's not a
singer, he's an oud player.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:55:02.810 position:56%
So there's a guy behind the counter,
he heard the name, and he came to me

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:05.940
and he said, "You mean Rahim AlHaj?

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.330
The oud player?"

00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:08.630
He said, "Yes."

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:12.100
So he went back into
the store inside.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:16.750
And two, three, five, six
minutes whatever, he came

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:22.200
and he brought a cassette
with my picture in it.

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.210
It's like stupid, you
know, posing like whatever.

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:26.510
It's young.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:29.180
And he said, "You mean this one?"

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.220
And he said to him, "Yes."

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.460
In fact, this is the guy.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:38.940 position:56%
And he looked at me like, I couldn't
believe it-- he couldn't believe it.

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.970 position:56%
So he went from there and he come to
me and he give me hug, kissing me.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:46.630
He said, "Rahim, you
don't understand.

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:52.480
All these years during the
sanction of 13 years and more,

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:59.640
we've been copying this record,
I mean, secretly, secretly,

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:06.510
because it's the only voice for
us to be against Saddam regime.

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:08.830
And it's not illegal for us to--

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:14.030
" because it was illegal to
sell my cassettes in the stores.

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:18.540
So I look at it and I
just, again, I cried a lot.

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.480
I said, oh my god, you know,

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:25.780
like this is like,
what, 1982, '83, right?

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.820
So I look at it and he
said, "Take it, please."

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:34.180
And I said, no, it belongs
here, not to me, you know?

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:35.640
It belongs to Baghdad, not me.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:40.390
I said, what am I going to do with
a cassette in the United States?

00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:41.690
It's here.

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:43.430
He said, "Could you please
just sign it for me?"

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:45.610
So I signed it for him.

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:52.270
And I thought, wow, you know,
that's how-- I left some impact.

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:54.280
I made a difference.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.270
When this guy was telling
me, he said, "Rahim, no,

00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:59.960
we've been copying it and
give it to people who need

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.160
to see Rahim AlHaj,
Rahim AlHaj, you know?

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.160
And I'm not a singer,
I'm a composer, you know?

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.540
I'm an oud player.

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.710 position:56%
So it was really significant to him.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.190
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Do
you have a photo of that

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:10.830
or any copies of it or anything?

00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:12.690
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: I think,
yes, I do to some degree.

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:16.120
I mean, when I went back,
there is a mixed feeling

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.030
down that time when I first visit.

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.490
It was very emotional visit.

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.920
I mean, different form last
visit which is last year.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:27.470
This because I had an idea, all
my pictures, all the pictures

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:29.560
who was saved, and most of
them actually they destroy,

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.400
just because they don't
need any document

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.970
about me even though
they know who I am.

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:41.320
Somehow they figured out.

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.630
So, it came to the idea, I
said, you know, all this memory

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:49.510
and all these pictures belong
here, not belong to me.

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:51.610
I don't know, I get
this, now I regret it.

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:56.940
And I have to bring-- I
mean, I get some of them.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.230
And now actually my brother, he
said-- posting them, you know,

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:04.520
on his page, and said nobody
will know Rahim AlHaj, you know,

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.820
what he was, you know, seven
or eight-- the first concert,

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:10.990
second concert in Iraq and Bagdad.

00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:12.290
That time, you know, I was--

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:18.160
and I toured the world with the
most famous important musician

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.240
in the whole planet
in oud, Munir Bashir.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:25.680 position:56%
And he was my teacher for six years.

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.020
And I had the privilege
actually to be with him.

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:32.300
And I had-- you know, I
was-- not just privilege,

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.990
I was actually fortunate.

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:39.860
I mean, even though actually
he was-- God bless his soul,

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:45.160 position:56%
he believed in me as musician but
he needs me to be part of the regime

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:51.190
and I was refused to do that.

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:56.360
By then, I felt like every
memory, every things that--

00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:01.750
books, and pictures, letters,

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:05.770
that belongs to them not
belong to me, to some degree.

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:10.010
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So,
why the United States?

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:11.310
[ Laughter ]

00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:14.830
In the all-- the whole
resettlement experience,

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:16.930
what are some memorable stories?

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:19.910
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Well, yeah,
this is really interesting--

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:23.490
not just interesting, this
is like hilarious, actually.

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:27.300
When I was in Syria, I wasn't
really-- want to leave Syria,

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:34.350
because Damascus and Sham
is the most beautiful piece

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:37.410
of land on Earth, really.

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:43.130
I mean, I toured the world and
I saw literally all the world.

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:51.240
But Damascus and Sham has
something as-- it's unbelievably--

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:56.700
not normal, in a good
way not the bad way.

00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:00.080
Damascus I call like a mother,
you know, who care about her kids

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.380
but she doesn't know why.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.110
There's a street you walk
in and it's 5,000 years old.

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:10.290
And not only, you know, go and
visit and take picture of it.

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:12.590
No, no, we live in it.

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:16.540
The most beautiful people
and gorgeous women--

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:20.040
all of them gorgeous,
there's nothing that's wrong.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.510
I have one of them.

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.870
So, I wasn't really-- you know,
I don't need to leave Syria

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:29.070
because I was able to--
I have a fake passport

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:31.500
that allowed me to leave, right?

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.390
And I'm safe.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:38.560
Until 2000, the guy,
he said [inaudible],

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.470
he was the executive
director of the settlement

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:46.090
in Syria of the UN settlements.

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:51.640 position:56%
And he-- I had a call from him and
he said, "Rahim, I need to see you."

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.940
"Well, what do you want?"

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.240
He said, "No, no.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.540
Come over tomorrow."

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.110
So I went there.

01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:02.920
The only thing he said, "I
don't need to talk to you a lot.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:08.360
I have one message to
you, which is leave."

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:12.700
I said, "Why?"

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.770
He said, "I cannot give
you an answer, just leave.

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:22.240
And here's the deal, you have
no choice except United States

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.040
of America."

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.080
I said, "No, I don't need to
go to United States of America.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.840
Why do I need to go there?

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.290
Tell me why?"

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.000
He said, "I cannot give
you more than that.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.560
It's up to you.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.170
If you want to leave,
just let me know.

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:43.730
I need the answer tomorrow."

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:46.140
Well, I went back to Nada
and I told her, Nada,

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.760
well, here's the story, right?

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:53.170
I mean, Hamid told
me that that I have--

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:55.840
the only choice is
United States of America.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.860
I need to go to America and I'm
not really interested to go there.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:01.620
She said, "Rahim, just go there.

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.790
If you like it, fine.

01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:10.270
If you don't like it, just
come back, it's that simple."

01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:15.830
So I called him and
I said, "Yeah, fine."

01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:23.190
Two days, I was in Albuquerque,
in two days, literally.

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:25.650
Everything, they made it like that.

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:31.020
And I bought my ticket, in fact,
even Nada didn't come with me.

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:33.060
She said, Rahim, just go.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:38.000
And then she will follow you
soon as she gets [inaudible].

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.760
And I end up in Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.740
And I chose that just
for two reasons, really.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:49.770
One reason because I'm a musician
and I'm interested in arts,

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:54.940
and that's my passion to write
for art, critique, art critique.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.270
Critic, that's what
they call it, right?

01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:01.250
And they told me that
Santa Fe and Taos

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:05.410
and New Mexico is very
important for arts and in music.

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:13.080
And the second reason was the
desert, like Middle East, right?

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.330
So I end up there.

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:20.150
And I didn't understand really
quite sure what I could do there,

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:21.450
you know?

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:29.190
What can I do, where I
can continue my life?

01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:34.290
Courageously enough,
I accepted and I went.

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.120
And they gave me $60.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.220
They bought all my
cigarettes in there.

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:46.360
And then one month later,
my case worker came to me.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.060
And he said, "Hey Rahim,
we found you a job."

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.460
I said, "Sure."

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.090 position:56%
I didn't speak English at that time.

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:55.130
I mean, I can communicate,
but not really.

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:56.430
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Did
he speak Arabic or--

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:57.730
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: No.

01:03:57.730 --> 01:03:59.030
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Or he
spoke to you in English?

01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:00.330
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: He speaks
to me in English, yeah.

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:02.480
And he said, we found you
a job and I said, "Sure.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.810
Where is the job?"

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:06.250
And he said in McDonald's.

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.570
I don't know where
the McDonald's is.

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:11.490
I said, so which kind
of conservatory is that?

01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:15.710
They teach just classical--
western classical music strictly

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:20.970
or they have branch of, you
know, eastern classical music?

01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:23.900
And he smiled and he said, "No.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.200
It's a McDonald's."

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.280
I said, "Yeah, yeah,
McDonald's, yeah.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.120 position:56%
So which kind of institute is that?"

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.600
He said, unfortunately it's not
an institute, it's a restaurant.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.510
And I said, "But I
don't play restaurants."

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:40.040
[ Laughter ]

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.290
I don't play in restaurant.

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:48.120
He said-- Well, he said, well,
you're not playing there, actually.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.470
I said, so what do you want to do

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:53.120
with this McDonald's,
whatever they call it?

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.950
He said, well this is a restaurant

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:57.080
and you need to work
as a dishwasher.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.320
I just lost it.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.200
So whatever bad word I already
learned, I throw them to him.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.660
I said, "No, no, no, no.

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.160
You know who I am?"

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.460
He said, yeah.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.590
I mean, we know you are
one of the blah, blah.

01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:17.370
You are an important
musician in the world,

01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:22.080
but you must make it--
you must make a living.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:30.270
I mean, you have to work and that's
the only job we find you for now.

01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:31.680
I said "No, no, no.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.970
Just could you please
send me back to Damascus?"

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:39.570
You know, when I came back, I
went to United States, again,

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:46.230
I have books, oud, and a lot of
important paintings, that's it.

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:49.790
It's all I have.

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:53.310
Again, that's another,
you know, station.

01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:57.000
You know, I have to take another
chapter of the same oud traveling,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.550
you know, from continent
to continent.

01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:02.470
I said, no, no, no,
I want to go back.

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:08.580
He said, well, yes, but
if you want to go back,

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.310
you have to pay your ticket.

01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:15.230
The one you-- Not just the one you
came in, the one you-- going back.

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.530
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Oh.

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:17.830
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Well,
I don't have it.

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:19.130
I don't have the money.

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:21.420
It's like $4,000, $5,000.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:24.670
And I said, "Well, now what?

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:25.970
I'm stuck?"

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:30.280
I have dear friend of mine,
she is a wonderful human being.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.890
She is still my best of friend.

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:34.160
Her name Kelly [inaudible].

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.420
She was teaching me Arabic
and-- I mean teaching me English

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.630
and I teach her Arabic,
because she is interested.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.550
And she speak Arabic very well
actually that time, I mean,

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:45.670
well enough to communicate.

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:48.270
I said, Kelly, hey,
could you please--

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:52.130
I want make a concert
and collect my leave.

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:55.830
I can't take it.

01:06:55.830 --> 01:07:01.950
They need me to work in
the restaurant, I can't.

01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:07.070
OK. So, I have no-- nothing,
I mean, absolutely zero.

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:08.840
I was sleeping on the carpet.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:13.420
And she gave me-- not the blanket--

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.720
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Sheet or--

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.560
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Sheet,
exactly, and--

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.860
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Pillow.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.160
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Pillow, isn't it?

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.460
That's all I have.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:21.760
And oud and books.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.440
And I told her let's do concert.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.460
And whenever I collect so I
can buy my ticket and go back?

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.240
And she said yeah.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:43.180
And so she went and rented the
hall at UNM, and then, Keller hall.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.840
And we hired for sound guy.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.580
And I remember one time she made
that flyer, right, and she said,

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:57.160
"Rahim, we have to put
the flyer on the street."

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.920
And I said, "I can't put
my flyer on the street."

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.710
"Just stay here.

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:04.830
Just stay here and
practice, you know?

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.800
I will do it."

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.940
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Did she work
in the University of New Mexico?

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.240
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: No.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.540
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Or was she just--

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.840
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: No, she's a friend.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.140
Actually she is a kindergarten
teacher.

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:19.430
Like I said, she speak Arabic
and that's why we were introduced

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:24.700
by mutual friend who
is actually he's here

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:28.120 position:56%
in Washington DC, work here, anyway.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.720
And he told her, well, this guy
is famous and [inaudible] lost

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:37.080
and he needs leave but
he doesn't know how.

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:45.880
So, whenever she has money, it
was like I think $700 or $800,

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:53.900
she put it just to do it to-- I get
money from this concert to go back.

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:58.680
So, we did the concert.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.850
I was-- you know, practice.

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:07.020
In the concert, there's not a
lot of people because of oud

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:12.090
in Albuquerque, you
know, I can't imagine

01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:14.290
like what you do with oud in--

01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:15.980
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: In the year 2000.

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.050
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: In
2000, yes, exactly.

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:24.030
So, what you are going to do with
oud in New Mexico, in Albuquerque?

01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:27.380
Nobody knows the oud, how
come they know Rahim AlHaj?

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:30.710
I was telling Kelly that time, I
said, nobody stops me on the street

01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:34.440
or the cafés and they come
out and love your own music.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.370
Yes, usually that's what I do.

01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:40.720
She said, "Rahim, they do
not know the oud look like.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.020
I said, "Huh.

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.100
Why?" How come they don't
know, because if you go

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.130
to Europe everybody
knows the oud, you know?

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:53.160
Anyway, I did the concert.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.580
And I remember so vividly Kelly
was talking to the audience

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.810
because I cannot speak English.

01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:03.130
And she talked to them and
explained the piece I will play

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:07.420
and it's called blah, blah,
blah, that's about, and I play.

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.310
That was it.

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:12.070
And a very significant
thing happened

01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:14.390
at that time in this concert.

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:18.540 position:56%
When I finished the concert, there's
a guy with his little boy came

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:24.570
to the green room holding the
program with my picture in it,

01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:26.880
you know, program and
the picture, you know?

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.160
And the little boy was crying,
I mean, literally tears.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.180
And I said in bad English, I said
you don't like my music, don't you?

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.570
And he said, no, I loved it
but I need your signature.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.120
Oh, my God.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:51.540
If this little boy understood
what I'm talking about,

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.940
about the suffering
of women and children,

01:10:54.940 --> 01:11:00.490
I'm going to make a difference.

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:06.680
After paying, you know, the rent
for the hall and sound engineer

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:10.890 position:56%
and flyer, I made $700 or
something, less than that, actually.

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:14.820
It's not even close to buy a
ticket to go back to Damascus.

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.120
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Right, right.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.830
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: I said
to this little boy,

01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:23.300
I'm going to make a difference.

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.300
I'm going to stay.

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:32.130
I said to Kelly, Kelly, look,
I don't care about money--

01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:35.770
And still I don't care and that's
what-- my was wife mad at me.

01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:40.690
Because $1 million and $100,000
is the same to me, I don't care,

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:42.730
that's why I don't
have a good shoes.

01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:50.540
So, I told her just book me
anywhere, $100, $200, $500, $1,000,

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:54.470
I don't care, except I need
regular, you know, concert.

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:55.770
I don't care about money.

01:11:55.770 --> 01:12:01.000
She managed me actually for
one year and she get rid of me,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.480
she said I'm unmanageable.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.940
[ Laughter ]

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:09.320 position:56%
And she said now because people when
I did the concerts here and there,

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.270
you know, outpost with Tom
McNickle [assumed spelling]

01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:16.530
who became my dear friend
and then Stephen Feld who was

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:18.590
at the concert actually--

01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:21.130
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah,
the ethnomusicologist?

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:25.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah, beautiful dear
friend and wonderful human being

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:31.750
and a great, great
musicology-- musicologist, sorry.

01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:37.250
And she said we need a CD.

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:42.100
I said, oh, I have cassettes
but I don't have CDs.

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:46.590
And she booked a studio.

01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:50.330
And we have the $300.

01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:54.740
And she said in Arabic,
Rahim, look, we have $300

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:56.990
and we booked this--
this is in Arabic.

01:12:56.990 --> 01:13:00.500
And we booked this
studio for one hour.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:05.610
If you pass one minute after one
hour, they will charge us $300--

01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:09.340
doesn't matter if you spend
one hour or one minute.

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.580
What I need from you,
to finish whole record

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:15.950
in one hour, do you understand?

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:17.250
I said, yeah.

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:23.700
I went there to the studio.

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.400
I did my piece.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.700
Go there and smoked my cigarette.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.570
Come back, just one take.

01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:37.130
One take, whole record,
58 minutes, that's it.

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:39.030
And I did it.

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:44.850
I finished but then
I have to produce it.

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:46.940
I don't have money.

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:52.150 position:56%
So they send me the mail, like, you
know, when they send you this like--

01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:53.450
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Oasis?

01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:54.750
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah,

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.050
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And
there are two companies--

01:13:56.050 --> 01:13:59.590
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah, which is
like, you know, check advance.

01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:02.520
And they said, well, you
[inaudible] for $3,000 in the bank.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.520
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Oh, like a--
Yeah, like an advance on royalty?

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.820
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah, yeah.

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.560
No, no advance of check,
you know, when you--

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.330
oh, you have a credit card and--

01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:12.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Oh, money advance?

01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:13.930
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yes, money advance.

01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:15.230
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Then you
will have to pay it back.

01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:16.530
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Of course.

01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:17.830
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Like a loan.

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.130
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah, exactly
but I didn't understand

01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:20.850
and I told Kelly, "So,
this is my money?

01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:22.570
I can use it?"

01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:25.010
She said, "Yeah, you can use it.

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:26.310
But you have to return it back."

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:28.470
I said, "Yeah, but I
can use it now, right?"

01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:29.770
She said yes.

01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:34.840
And I said, "Well,
so I can do my CD?"

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.140
They give me $2,000.

01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:43.510
And dear friend of mine who
was my childhood friend also,

01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:45.950
actually he's a famous artist.

01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:50.560
Now, he is-- actually he lives
in the United States, too,

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.180
who did the art work,
now he's a professor

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.180
at New York University in New York.

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:56.520
He's very famous, actually.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.710
And he did the art work, right?

01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:01.010
It's free.

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:06.020
And there is man who is
wonderful human being, engineer,

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:09.620
and he fell in love with me and
he fell in love and he said,

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:10.990
whoa this guy, something, right?

01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:15.200
And they told him that the
guy doesn't have even $5.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.890 position:56%
He said I don't need money because--

01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:21.140
He said, I'm going
to master it free.

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.440
So he mastered it.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:28.210
And then we send it to-- and he
couldn't really afford a bar code.

01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:30.030
It's $50. I don't have it.

01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:31.330
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Right.

01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:33.400
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: So
we print the record

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:39.970
without bar code, because
I don't have it.

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:43.890
And they made 1,000 copies of that.

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:47.630 position:56%
I sold 28,000 copies of this record.

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:48.930
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Nice.

01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:51.550
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Within six months.

01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:53.280
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: 28,000
in six months?

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.580
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Six months.

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: That's impressive.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.380
That's impressive.

01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.680
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Absolutely.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.980
[ Laughter ]

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.280
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Coming from a
record company background now?

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.580
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Right.

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: That's impressive.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.180
[ Laughter ]

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Well, that's good.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:13.710
So, now to wind up here,
that was shortly after 2000.

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:18.710
And here we are in 2016, what
are some of the highlights--

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:24.610
I know you've worked with some
enormous very distinguished artists

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:26.520
in the United States and beyond.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.900
Can you just touch-base
of few of those where--

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.200
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.680
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Where is your
career gone up until today?

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.000
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Actually
after that time, I really--

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.270
like I said, I'm fortunate
to be in the United States

01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:40.170
because I have the opportunity
to communicate and collaborate

01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:43.590
with the wonderful musicians
from around, you know?

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:54.890
I collaborate with-- from Rock
and Roll, REM, to Kronos Quartet,

01:16:54.890 --> 01:17:02.010
to Robert Mirabal, a Native
American, to Spanish and--

01:17:02.010 --> 01:17:06.550
I mean, India, China,
and everywhere.

01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:11.550
So I have really the opportunity
to collaborate with that.

01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:14.150
And my highlight actually
started with the record

01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:17.440
with the Smithsonian,
actually, Folkways Recording

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.250
when they really courageously
enough they invited me

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:27.500
to do a traditional Iraqi
music, and I did it.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.240
And that was really wonderful

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:34.050
because it was an introduction
to me to Iraqi music.

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:36.190
Because I was interested
to do my own in music,

01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:38.510
I'm not interested to
do a traditional one.

01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:39.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Well, as I recall,

01:17:39.810 --> 01:17:41.650
there was an interesting
discussion about that.

01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:42.950
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Right.

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.990
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What was
the deal as you remember it?

01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:48.990
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Is that-- In the
beginning, I was that, you know,

01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:53.280 position:56%
that's great, I can have-- you know,
Smithsonian, I know it very well.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:57.340
I know them really well and I
have huge respects for them.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:01.300
And I was, you know, honored
and then excited really.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:07.380
But I wanted to establish
my own composition,

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.780
that's why I'm interested.

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:11.190
But actually I have a question.

01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:15.650
I don't remember you
ask me or even Atesh.

01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:19.450
He said what do you think how
much people they have difference--

01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:23.390
they know the differences between
your music in the Iraqi tradition?

01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:25.690
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: I
know I asked that.

01:18:25.690 --> 01:18:28.670
We both may have asked
that question.

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:29.970
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Raul?

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:31.270
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah.

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:32.640
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: So I think I
said, wow, that's absolutely true.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.940
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah.

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:35.340
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: So give
them the introduction

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.070
to Iraqi music, you
know, traditional.

01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:40.140
And that's what we get
really Grammy Nomination for.

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.440
It was beautiful record.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.040
And it has a lot of story but
we don't have time for it,

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.970
until we finished with
this beautiful record.

01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:48.270
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yes.

01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:50.500
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: And last
month, actually, we--

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.330
I had the privilege actually

01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:58.140
to have this beautiful record
called "Letter from Iraq."

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.980
And Dan Sheehy who really
wonderfully he said,

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.470
"Absolutely yes.

01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:04.860
Send me some music."

01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:06.160
So I sent him some music.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.530
And you heard that.

01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:14.570
It's about Iraqi stories with
eight letters from Iraq, from women

01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:18.720
and children, to United States.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:26.940
And I carefully painted
these letters to music.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:31.050
For oud and a string orchestra,
basically, but we couldn't do it

01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:35.400
as orchestra so we did it with the
string quintet with percussionist

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.700
at the same time, it
was [inaudible].

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:42.470
And that's actually the highlight
of my career in United States.

01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:43.840
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: It's beautiful.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.620
Just to-- Last question
to round this off,

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.690
what's your hope for the future?

01:19:49.690 --> 01:19:53.260
In the United States, particularly,
but anywhere, for your music,

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:55.900
for culture in the United States,
just from your own personal point

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.200
of view, what's you personal hope

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:01.090
for the future connected
to your music?

01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:04.450
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: I mean, again, I
told you that my music is about how

01:20:04.450 --> 01:20:06.460
to make a difference in the world.

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:07.760
I don't care.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.060
I don't care about money.

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.360
I don't care about fame.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.660
I don't care.

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:16.400
I care when I feel there is some
difference to make on this planet.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.210
And all of us, actually,
we are responsible

01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:22.030 position:56%
to do something good to this planet.

01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:26.550
Because it's not just for us,
it's for generation to come.

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:32.990
So, by creating beauty,
creating music, creating art,

01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:38.140
create an understanding
between all of us,

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:42.450
and make this world a beautiful
to generation, what a great honor,

01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:44.920
what a great thing to do.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:49.220
And I will do it until I expire,
actually, that's what I believe is

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:53.350
to just talk about women

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:55.910
and children their
stories, bring them back.

01:20:55.910 --> 01:21:00.410 position:56%
I mean, not just Iraqis and
Syrian-- around the world, actually.

01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:06.490
Whatever I hear woman she's
sad or woman she is in need

01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:09.730
or woman has a story nobody
heard about, I will take it

01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:12.400
and then paint that as a music.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.830
If I hear one children, whatever
in this planet, has a story

01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:22.260
and nobody heard about
it, I would paint it.

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.560
I call that painting.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.430
I don't really call it that
music, really, to be honest.

01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:33.880
Because I'm truthful to the
story, I'm truthful to the moment,

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.340
and truthful to the history.

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.890 position:56%
Because this is going to-- you know,

01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:40.600
10 years from now,
20 years, God knows.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.900
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah,
the musical portraits,

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.500
is really, really is beautiful.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.800
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Absolutely.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:50.490
So my hope is to bring
peace, love, and compassion

01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:52.440
to our crazy world right now.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.240
Because we live really
in an unpleasant moment,

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.320
I mean the whole world, we
live in unpleasant moment.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:02.250
So if we can take that
sadness away, you know,

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:05.700
that pressure away, whatever it is.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.360
If I educate my neighbor
who really think

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:13.510
that Mexicans they don't have
electricity because they are poor

01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:19.750
or other neighbor who I am-- for
I am Muslim and totally a cousin

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:23.410
of Osama bin Laden probably
-- and educating that --

01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:26.240
no, no, no, this is my country.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.010
And I didn't tell you the story.

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:31.860
It was in 2004 after
the invasion, this--

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:38.730
the most beautiful moment I
had when I saw my Mom again.

01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:42.910
It was beautiful, beautiful.

01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:47.090
So I remember 2004-- I
haven't seen her for like years

01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:49.510
and years and years, right?

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:51.830
She is beautiful, gorgeous
82 years old.

01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:54.130
I mean, gorgeous.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:59.390
And one night I was just talking
to her, you know, with my hand

01:22:59.390 --> 01:23:04.130
and my head in her lap and talking
and she's playing with my hair.

01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:09.130
And we're talking about my
sisters and brothers -- happy.

01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:14.450
In just one second, I
remembered New Mexico.

01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:18.250
And all my heart is
-- just like that.

01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:22.750 position:56%
I was like, oh God, I miss this one.

01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:27.330
I said, what is it i need?

01:23:27.330 --> 01:23:35.200
I mean, I had chills when
I'm in my mom's lap, right?

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.410
This is what I need, so
I remember New Mexico.

01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:41.830
And I missed it so much.

01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:47.230
Then, I realize, this is my home.

01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:48.580
And still.

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.420
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Rahim
AlHaj, it's a pleasure

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.510
and an honor to call you habibi.

01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:53.810
&gt;&gt; Rahim Alhaj: Yeah,
you're a habibi too.

01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:55.780
Thank you very much.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:59.650

of the Library of Congress.
