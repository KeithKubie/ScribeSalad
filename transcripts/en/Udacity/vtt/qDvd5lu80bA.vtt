00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.700
What I want to do is work through the,
the slides here and

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.440
the base filter, getting us, to how
we come up with our new belief okay?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.370
So this is just our definition before,
that the belief is the probability about

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.660
the current state, given everything
including, the current measurement,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.660
so we're going to use the Bayes
rule that we just showed

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.060
that says we can swap that around by
putting in the likelihood and the prior.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.300
And the prior is just Xt without
the Zt over here, right?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.820
That was our prediction
about what Xt was and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.640
this is this likelihood model, right?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.840
This is just our sensor
likelihood model.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.428
What's the likelihood
of getting that value?

00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:43.162
All right.

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:47.040
Well our sensor independence that
we talked about before says,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.370
if you have this state, xt,
then none of this stuff matters and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.220
it's just p of zt, given xt.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.540
That's sensor independence.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.090
All right, so here we are.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.540
So the next thing we can do is
remember we talked about this before.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.100
This notion of total probability.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.440
The way we do a prediction.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.130
Okay, for
any given xt what we have to do is say,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.190
well, what's our prediction of
all the possible xt minus 1.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.680
What, why are there many of them?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.930
Well All the possible x's at t minus 1.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.380
If we take all the probability okay,
that we would,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.100
we sum up over all those possibilities,
and here, you notice what we said was,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.250
what's the probability of
going to xt from xt minus 1,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.600
times this probability of xt minus 1,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.890
summed up over all of
those xt minus ones.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.310
That will be the, the prediction,
that will be the prior.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.170
But this value, actually,
can get made much smaller.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.600
Because, notice.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.900
That has this term and that term.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.040
Because remember the Markovian property
says that if we have XT minus one and

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.410
we want to predict XT all this other
stuff doesn't matter except the action.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.300
Right.
So, basically you get me where I thought

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.910
I was before and what action you did,
I can tell you about where I think I

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.330
am now, and that's what this
Markovian step is right there.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.110
One more time, flies up, wow, beautiful.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.560
Okay, keep going.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.350
All right.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.820
Well, now, actually,
we're pretty much done, and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.350
now everything is beautiful and
color coded, all right?

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.920
We start here, right.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.720
This value right here,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.630
that's just our belief about all
the xs at the last time step.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.700
So that's written here.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.710
So now we're already looking at
a recursive algorithm, right,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.440
because on the left-hand side,
we have the belief of xt.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.700
On the right-hand side,
we have the belief of xt minus one, so.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.570
This is a induction, remember we
talked about tracking induction.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.910
This is induction formula that goes
from your belief that T minus one

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.600
to your belief at T.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.580
When you integrate or
sum overall the possible xt minus ones,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.850
these are your predictions
before taking the measurement.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.140
So this is just like we did
with the Kalman before.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.030
To make your prediction, what you do is
you take your belief about where things

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.010
were, you pump it through your dynamics
and you add it onto your uncertainty.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.740
And then what this is showing is,
to get our new belief, okay,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.750
we just multiply that by
the likelihood of the measurement.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.680
Remember it's not the It's not
your probability of where you

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.860
are given the measurement.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.110
It's how likely would this
measurement have been

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.960
if that had been the particular x.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.280
And then we can worry about
this normalization later.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.220
That's how we get
the belief at new time t.
