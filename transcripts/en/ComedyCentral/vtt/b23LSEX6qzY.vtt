00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.635
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELCOME BACK.

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.003
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:09.343
NATION, YOU KNOW, YOU READ THE
PAPERS, YOU KNOW THAT WE

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:12.079
AMERICANS LIVE IN AN
UNPRECEDENTED ERA OF

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:15.249
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, FROM
TABLETS TO SMARTPHONES TO

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.319
FUTURISTIC GLASSES THAT
INSTANTLY SEND THE MESSAGE,

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:20.521
I'M A DOUCHE.

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:23.190
NOW THERE'S A NEW APP THAT HAS
EXPANDED THE POSSIBILITIES FOR

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.726
COMMUNICATION BY DRASTICALLY
REDUCING THEM.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.097
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A NEW SMARTPHONE APP
SIMPLY CALLED YO. USERS CONNECT

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.768
WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH THE FREE
APP AND PUSH ONE BUTTON TO

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:35.969
SEND THE WORD YO TO A CONTACT.

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:42.209
SO FAR, 50,000 USERS HAVE SENT
ABOUT FOUR MILLION YO'S.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:46.013
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, YO,
AN APP ALREADY HUGELY POPULAR

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.183
WITH THE WORLD'S POPULATION OF
SYLVESTER STALLONE.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.853
NOW, WHEN I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT
AN APP THAT BOILS DOWN ALL YOUR

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.890
COMMUNICATION INTO TWO LETTERS,
I EXPRESSED MYSELF IN ONE.

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:57.524
Y?

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.326
( APPLAUSE )
BUT I JOINED--

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.063
<i>( CHEERS )</i>
I JOINED THE YO-TH MOVEMENT WHEN

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:08.135
I READ THE COMPANY BOASTS IT
TAKES 11 TAPS TO SEND THE WORD

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:11.939
YO ON A RIVAL MESSAGING SERVICE
COMPARED TO TWO ON THEIR APP.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.608
THAT'S A NINE-TAP DIFFERENCE
DIFFERENCE.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.243
TAPS YOU COULD BE SPENDING WITH
YOUR CHILDREN.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:20.347
( LAUGHTER )
BUT THE TRUE BEAUTY OF ONLY

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.649
SAYING YO IS IT SAYS SO MUCH.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:27.120
AS ITS DEVELOPER PUTS IT WE LIKE
TO CALL IT CONTEXT-BASED

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.155
MESSAGING.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.190
YOU UNDERSTAND BY THE CONTEXT
WHAT IS BEING SAID.

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:31.291
CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:34.194
IN THE OLD DAYS IF I TEXTED
SOMEONE THE WORD YO, AND I

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:37.831
WANTED THEM TO KNOW WHAT IT
MEANT, I HAD TO FOLLOW UP WITH

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:38.599
GURT.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:42.369
AND YO IS ALSO GOOD FOR
BUSINESS.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:48.575
FOR INSTANCE, AN ICE CREAM TRUCK
CAN YO THE KIDS WHEN ITS

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:49.810
AROUND THE CORNER.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.545
IMAGINE GETTING A YO FROM THE
ICE CREAM TRUCK, AND PARENTS CAN

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:56.016
SIGN UP TO TELL THEIR KIDS TO
STAY AWAY FROM ANYONE WITH THE

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.251
USER NAME "THEICECREAMTRUCK."

00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:00.821
BUT WHY ARE THEY LIMITING THIS
BREAKTHROUGH TO JUST OUR PHONES?

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:06.527
I BELIEVE WE CAN IMPLEMENT YO'S
CONTEXT-BASED COMMUNICATION

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.227
PHILOSOPHY IN EVERYDAY LIFE.

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:08.662
COME ON OUT, JAY.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.230
JAY THE INTERN, EVERYBODY.

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:17.137
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:18.238

00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:21.141
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YO.

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:22.676
&gt;&gt; YO.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.212
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YO.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:25.646

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.148
