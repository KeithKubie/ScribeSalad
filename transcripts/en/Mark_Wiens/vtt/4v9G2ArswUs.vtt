00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.890
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day!

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.810
It's Mark Wiens, I'm
in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.710
And I am part of The Hungry Tourist's

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.610
Best of Sri Lanka Food Tour.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.080
We are starting for lunch today

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.490
at a restaurant called The Station,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.920
which is known for their crabs.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.077
It's right along the beach,
it's in a beautiful setting.

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.490
The crab is gonna be mouth watering

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.815
and we're getting started right now.

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:21.982
(upbeat reggae music)

00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:33.156
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:33.989
What's up?

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:34.861
Thank you so much for having us.

00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:35.880
- Glad to have you here.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.120
- And the restaurant is called The Station

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.650
because it's right next to
the railroad track, right?

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.380
Such a cool restaurant, it's on the beach.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.490
You have sand at your feet,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.780
and you have amazing views of the ocean,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.183
the breeze, beautiful, beautiful place.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.803
Nice to meet you.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.873
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.032
Wow, whoa!

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.723
What size are those crabs?

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:05.797
- It's about 1.4, 1.5 kilos.
- (laughs) Even the claws--

00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:08.770
- But they were from 1.2 to 1.4 kilos.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.000
- The claws are monster, like huge claws!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.553
Like the size of your fist!

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.980
The chefs are getting
started on the crab curry.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.740
These mud crabs are ginormous.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.593
Those claws, literally,
if you make your fist,

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:29.000
those claws are like twice
the size of your fist.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.890
Wow, and then the meat in them,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.040
there's both male and female.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.570
They're just gonna prepare
and clean up the crabs first

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.690
before they make it into the curry.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.503
And these are the spices
and ingredients that go in?

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.010
He's gonna get started on the
Sri Lankan crab curry now.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.480
And first, oil goes in, then garlic.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.660
The aroma of that garlic is unbelievable!

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.670
And now he's about to toss in,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.320
I believe those are curry leaves.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.203
- [Chef] Curry leaves.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.590
- Green chillies and tomatoes go in

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.250
and he's just kinda sloshing that around.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.338
My mouth is already watering
and he hasn't even added in

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:05.404
most of the spices and the crab!

00:02:05.404 --> 00:02:08.571
(upbeat reggae music)

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.160
So chili, cumin, and turmeric
powder and then black pepper,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.580
a small mountain of spices go in,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.780
just kind of slosh that around,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.440
it soaks up, absorbs that flavor.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.660
Oh man, that is a base of just
powerful, beautiful flavor.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.020
So this recipe is actually
your family's recipe, right?

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.480
- Yeah, passed on from my grandmother,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.167
to my mother and the now she's,

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:33.620
yeah, from down south.
- Southern.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.190
- A little family twist to it.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.590
- Oh here come in the crabs.

00:02:42.887 --> 00:02:44.547
I wanna put my face in
there with the crabs.

00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:45.920
And now you're just kinda stirring it

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.330
and kinda shaking it at the same time

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.540
just to coat the crab in that
spice, that thick, rich spice.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.593
Get an aroma full, it is unbelievable.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.350
He added in some water,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.120
and that kinda dilutes the spice paste

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.440
and that spice is just gonna
fully saturate into the crab,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.960
into the meat, into the
roe, into those claws,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.490
and all that flavor is gonna
just mingle into the crab meat,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.490
that's gonna boil away
for about 30 minutes or so

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.610
to really bring out that flavor,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.630
and then coconut milk will be added.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.210
So they're also making a cuttlefish dish.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.270
What's the name of the dish?

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.560
- Hot Butter Cuttlefish.
- Hot butter Cuttlefish.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.530
Hot butter Cuttlefish it's
one of their signature dishes

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.130
at The Station too, they're
gonna prepare that next.

00:03:42.373 --> 00:03:43.740
Taste it right here?
- Taste it, taste it!

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.100
- Alright, this is the
famous Hot Butter Cuttlefish!

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.050
The fumes just went up my nose!

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.350
We gotta taste test it right now!

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.963
- [Man] Yeah, get it, get it!

00:03:54.082 --> 00:03:55.610
- Hmm!
- Yup.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.610
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, baby, oh yeah baby.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.960
- Sri Lankan Chinese influenced dish,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.597
the harmony, the balance, the cuttlefish.

00:04:04.872 --> 00:04:05.705
So good!

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:14.740
The full Hungry Tourist
Sri Lanka Tour is here now,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.620
uh, and they're just
bringing out some oysters

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.883
as that crab curry is still brewing away.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.610
Some raw oyster with some achar sauce.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.920
Oh that achar has a
fruity taste to it too!

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.990
Back in the kitchen again now,

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.760
and they are making
another type of oyster;

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.600
baked oyster with cheese
and what else is in here?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.343
And chili, oh yeah that,
that, that, okay, okay!

00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:43.019
Oh, hmm!

00:04:45.927 --> 00:04:47.600
And the garlic in there!

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.900
The garlic too!

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.080
Yeah?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.370
Really good!

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.537
(upbeat reggae music)

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.670
- [Chef] Fresh water king.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.640
Fresh water black pepper king.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.710
- [David] Let me serve you!

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.509
- River prawns stir fried
in black pepper sauce.

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.707
You can smell that black pepper from here!

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:09.653
(people chattering)

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:11.060
Oh, thank you man!

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.603
Look at the size of that head!

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.273
Massive!

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.503
Oh wow!

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.810
Oh, that black pepper!

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.010
I probably have a black
pepper mustache right now.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.640
I know what we gotta do!

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.416
- [Man] Oh dude get a bite of that roe!

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:35.040
- Thank you.
- Right in, boom!

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.954
- [Man] Are we gonna cheers?

00:05:35.954 --> 00:05:36.787
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:40.865
(all cheering)

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:43.485
(upbeat reggae music)

00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:45.235
- Oh wow, that sauce!

00:05:47.603 --> 00:05:51.420
- [Man] Many of you asking us
about textures of a roe prawn,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.613
I mean a fresh trimming,
that is the texture.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.210
- You taste the pepper pronounced

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.910
but at the same time it tastes like,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.760
harmoniously blended into that sauce.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.140
I didn't even see the lobsters coming!

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.240
It's a surprise!

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.467
Surprise lobsters!
- Surprise!

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.980
- And these are massive spiny lobsters,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.150
looks like they take out the meat

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.030
then stir fry it with some,

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.192
it looks like the black
pepper sauce again.

00:06:14.192 --> 00:06:18.230
And then you're just like
scooping it out by the spoonful.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.690
- With lime!
- Oh, okay!

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.852
- Alright, you ready?
- Thank you!

00:06:20.852 --> 00:06:23.310
- For a little bit of lime?
- Alright, let me focus.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.380
- Okay, some more.
- Oh, thank you, lime!

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.653
Perfect, thank you, Ben.

00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.793
Oh wow!

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.136
Dude, its so tender!

00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:36.320
(laughs)

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.311
- Delicious!
- Oh man!

00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:39.272
- Oh, that is unbelievable!
- Yeah, amazing.

00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:41.243
- [Mark] And with that
citrus, the squeeze of lime.

00:06:42.427 --> 00:06:44.227
Oh the, it just melts in your mouth.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.200
That is unbelievably succulent,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.560
and naturally sweet.
- Oh, yeah!

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.830
- So good man.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.250
And Ochicha said that they're
gonna serve the crab now

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.319
so I'm heading back to the kitchen.

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.990
(upbeat reggae music)

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.730
He added in a bunch of
coconut cream, coconut milk,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.830
and then a little bit of what I believe

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.620
is a tamarin paste like sourness,

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.400
and now just kinda like
letting that slow boil.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.070
The aromatherapy is just out of control.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.230
Oh, awesome, and that's an
ingredient I wasn't expecting,

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.017
he just tossed in a
handful of Moringa leaves.

00:07:30.343 --> 00:07:33.850
(people chattering)

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.223
- Thank you.
- How is it?

00:07:35.223 --> 00:07:38.119
- This is unbelievable.
- Awesome.

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:40.791
Let me get the size of that claw!

00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:41.874
It's massive!

00:07:45.618 --> 00:07:47.160
- So good, the flavor is incredible.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.360
- [Mark] Awesome!

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.410
- [David] Extra dishes, anybody?

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.013
Anybody want some extra spicy?

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.730
Come to papa!

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.273
Okay, that's for Mark, that's for Mark.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.970
- [Mark] Thank you guys.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.243
- And give him some.

00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:05.894
Mealtime!
- Cheers, Doody!

00:08:05.894 --> 00:08:07.510
- A crab.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.440
Oh look, oh look!
(upbeat reggae music)

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.650
- A spicy crab first,
literally the entire plate.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.530
The claw takes up the entire plate.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.880
It goes, if you were to spread this out

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.680
it would cover the entire plate.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.240
Oh (laughs) the claw just,
the claw just fell apart!

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.020
I'm sure you could catch a
ball with this, with this claw.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.140
It is huge, and the meat in there

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.480
is just, you smell the, all the spices,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.830
you smell the curry leaves.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.333
I'm gonna see if I can dismantle this guy.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.770
(laughs)

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.020
Next method, just suck
the meat from the top.

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:47.862
Oh, wow!

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.520
The actual meat, it's
like unbelievably flaky,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.733
unbelievably sweet.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.433
Will you?
- Yeah,

00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:57.266
I'll tie one for you.

00:08:57.266 --> 00:08:59.530
- Will you bib me?
- I will bib you!

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.770
I will bib you!

00:09:02.807 --> 00:09:04.523
- [Man] I'm focused, I'm focused.

00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:07.610
- Alright you're good to go!
- Thank you very much!

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.210
- There we go.
- Always be sure to get a bib

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.080
before you crack a crab in Sri Lanka!

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.800
Thank you!
- You're most welcome.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.200
- [Mark] Oh yeah, it's just sliding out.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.033
This thing is...

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.143
Actually maybe you just
gotta kinda hit it!

00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:25.827
(people laughing)

00:09:25.827 --> 00:09:27.240
- [Man] There it is!

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.940
- Yeah, I know!
- Mark's got it down!

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.720
- Oh yes!
- Yes, look at that!

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.467
- Oh!
- How profesh.

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:34.710
- [Mark] That's such a thick shell.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.750
Okay, now it's time to one-bite this.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.736
I'm gonna add some of
the sauce to it though.

00:09:39.736 --> 00:09:42.903
(upbeat reggae music)

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.290
That's just, just speechless.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.810
The flavor is unbelievable.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.971
And the natural crab is unbelievable.

00:09:52.971 --> 00:09:53.830
- [Man] Good idea.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.770
- And the way it's cooked is just,

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.340
it will blow the taste
buds off your tongue.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.380
The pol sambol next.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.380
I was in Sri Lanka, probably
in 2012, 2013 for a while

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.510
and it, I vividly
remember the amazing food

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.730
but there is one thing
that I ate every single day

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.260
at every single meal,
and that was pol sambol,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.970
which is coconut sambol.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.960
This is my first time to eat
it back in Sri Lanka for my,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.110
this is my second trip.

00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:28.680
It's shredded coconut,
there's chili in it,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.040
they put some dried shrimp in it,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.490
it's so flavorful, it's wonderful.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.420
You literally can eat it on everything.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.430
Now I'm gonna move on to the actual,

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.190
this one is their grandmother's recipe,

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.073
the real Sri Lankan crab curry.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.710
You can see the Moringa leaves in here,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.420
you can see the curry leaves in here,

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.167
you can smell them!

00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:51.887
- [Man] Yeah, of course!

00:10:51.887 --> 00:10:53.498
- Oh wow!

00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:57.160
Oh, you taste the curry leaves,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.040
you taste the blend of spices.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.830
It's not too overly rich,
it's almost like a soup

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.130
at the same time as a
curry, as the same time

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.730
as you're eating the crab.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.600
Body section here, here into this guy,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.760
oh, it's just dripping and
oozing with, oh, look at that!

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.670
It's delicious like stringy flakiness,

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.153
and that's just been like
saturated with that curry sauce

00:11:16.153 --> 00:11:18.790
because it's been boiled for
over an hour with all that,

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.230
I'm just gonna re-juice it actually.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.763
You can never re-juice enough!

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.949
You can never over-juice it!

00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:28.949
(people chattering)

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.920
That original recipe is just stunning.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.090
- Take some of that, soak it in here.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.020
- [Mark] They're teaching me how to eat it

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:40.853
the Sri Lankan way.

00:11:40.853 --> 00:11:41.686
Okay, cool!

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.593
Okay, break bread, the pol
sambol with the gravy with the,

00:11:45.593 --> 00:11:46.801
this is with the dried shrimp?

00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:47.634
- [Man] Yep, yeah.

00:11:47.634 --> 00:11:48.761
- [Mark] And then with the curry sauce?

00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:50.210
- [Man] And then take some crab meat.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.043
- [Mark] And then load up?

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:52.066
- No, take--
- Load up some,

00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:54.820
load up some crab meat on top.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.653
- [Man] Yes, yeah.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.110
- [Mark] One more, and then
one more dunk into the,

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.930
one more dunk in the sauce?

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.737
- Yes!
- Okay, there we go.

00:12:02.737 --> 00:12:07.737
The ultimate Sri Lankan
crab curry pol sambol bite.

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:11.126
(upbeat reggae music)

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.308
Oh, wow!

00:12:14.308 --> 00:12:16.120
That'll blow your mouth away!

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.570
That's just unbelievable
flavor, the curry,

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.720
the fresh coconut so
you've got that crunch,

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.540
the like crab that's just
saturated with the curry sauce.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.173
And it's so, like, tender that it just,

00:12:29.173 --> 00:12:31.708
it just strings apart in your mouth.

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:34.708
(people chattering)

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.290
Yes, oh, thank you very much!

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:44.663
The service!

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.950
Thank you very much!

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.080
- [Man] It was nice.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.710
- Wow, what a stunning, stunning meal!

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.533
- I think that The Station

00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:57.040
is really the first
place that every tourist

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.700
that comes to Sri Lanka has
to come to, has to go to.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.483
Because here they opened
the door for Sri Lanka love.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.300
Here they make you feel welcome,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.175
and here they give you the
pure flavors of Sri Lanka.

00:13:11.175 --> 00:13:12.107
- [Mark] Thank you so much, man.

00:13:12.107 --> 00:13:13.693
- Hey man.
- It was amazing.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.146
- I'm a big fan, so it was an
honor to have you here, man.

00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:18.582
- [Mark] Thank you, thank you so much.

00:13:18.582 --> 00:13:19.540
- [Man] A pleasure man, a pleasure.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.580
- Thank you.
- We'll see you tonight?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.435
- [Mark] Yes, I'll see you this evening.

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:22.611
- See you tonight, man!
- Thank you so much.

00:13:22.611 --> 00:13:25.778
(upbeat reggae music)

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:31.330
Let me introduce you all to Ruzaina,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.640
The Minority Taste.
- Hi!

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.070
- She is an amazing
person, she loves to eat,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.070
she's passionate about Sri Lankan food

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:38.990
and we're gonna be hanging out

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.340
with her a lot during this trip,

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.820
she's planned a lot of
things, a lot of fun,

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.030
a lot of food, but we
finished up at The Station,

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.520
we had amazing crab and just
hanging out with everybody

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.150
and now we, it's a few hours
later, it is time for dinner.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.300
Where are we going tonight?

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.320
- We're going to this
place called Thuna Paha,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.190
so it's like a proper
Sri Lankan restaurant,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.450
a little upscale but it's run
by the Sri Lankan government.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.600
But the food is super good,
it's local and really good!

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.433
- Cool!

00:14:09.433 --> 00:14:11.947
(upbeat reggae music)

00:14:11.947 --> 00:14:12.883
- Hello!
- Hello.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.050
- You must be Mark.
- Mark.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.883
- Mark, I'm Mishan.

00:14:15.883 --> 00:14:18.053
- Nice to meet you, thank you very much!

00:14:18.053 --> 00:14:20.300
Greeted with a stack of Betel leaves

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.052
which represents prosperity, long life.

00:14:23.052 --> 00:14:26.021
- Longevity.
- Longevity,

00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:27.413
and it's a part of the culture.

00:14:27.413 --> 00:14:30.470
- It's a part of the culture.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.570
- Thank you very much!

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.250
They got all the spices laid out here.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.270
They're gonna be making a crab curry,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.120
but also one of the
dishes that's very famous

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.560
to eat in Sri Lanka is a pork black curry,

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.430
and he's gonna cook it
in a clay, clay pot?

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.170
That's the traditional style.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.120
- [Chef] This is mustard seed.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.320
- Mustard seed?
- Yeah.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:52.803
- Curry leaves?

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.180
So we started off with coconut oil

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.630
and waited for that to simmer,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.140
then he added in mustard seed, cumin seed,

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.560
and then curry leaves and pandan leaves.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.130
And as soon as he dropped
that into the oil,

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.240
you could smell the aroma,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.390
just that poof of like curry
fumes came out of that oil,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.037
smells so good, then he
just added in the onions.

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:15.583
- Cinnamon.
- Cinnamon is about to go in.

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:22.685
(upbeat reggae music)

00:15:26.063 --> 00:15:27.729
- Tomato.

00:15:27.729 --> 00:15:28.829
A little bit of water.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.853
This is some coconut milk.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.565
- [Mark] Now it simmers?

00:15:47.565 --> 00:15:49.850
Now it simmers for, it cooks for how long?

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.200
- Hmm, 10 minutes, 10-15 minutes.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.240
- Okay, and then finished?
- Yeah.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.543
- The aromas are almost
too much to handle.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.393
Chef is offering me a taste test.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.013
Wow!

00:16:12.142 --> 00:16:14.700
That's incredible.
- A little spicy?

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.523
- Good, very good.

00:16:23.004 --> 00:16:23.880
Finished with the crab curry,

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.120
that is a stunning dish, the
coconut milk is so thick,

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.450
so rich, so much spice in there.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.290
Now they're gonna start
with the pork curry,

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.710
pork black curry.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.090
So that's just been roasted, curry powder.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.408
- [Chef] We season it.

00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:41.050
Tamarin.
- Tamarin.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.180
He first took the pork,
then he mixed in the spices,

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.270
the curry powder, the roasted curry powder

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.390
which is just curry powder
that's been roasted in a pan,

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.150
and now he's just heating up
some coconut oil that the,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.500
that's then gonna be fried.

00:16:57.243 --> 00:17:00.920
- Cardamon pods.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.090
Garlic.
- But one of the key

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.820
differences is that he added cardamom pods

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.670
which have been crushed.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.023
And now he is adding
in some green chillies.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.663
Oh, that aroma!

00:17:15.862 --> 00:17:19.460
- [Chef] Salt.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.340
- So then the spices that
he mixed with the pork,

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.740
that's just for the marinade,

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.320
but even all the spices
go into the sauce as well

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.470
so the layers, the depth,

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.699
the complexity of spice
on those two layers.

00:17:30.699 --> 00:17:33.866
(upbeat reggae music)

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.990
That curry is gonna cook
for about 20 more minutes,

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.820
just simmer away, let that
pork mingle into the spices

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.633
and the fat melt into the sauce.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:51.603
Oh, wow!

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:55.130
Total different taste
because of that smoked out,

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.950
roasted curry powder.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.805
Amazing, very good.

00:17:59.805 --> 00:18:01.530
And you taste like the,
you taste all the spices

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.080
and then you taste like a
tomatoey undertone of it.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.780
Okay, the dishes are ready,
the entire group is here,

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.653
we're going out to start eating!

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.877
- [Chef] Rice flan in
coconut milk, salt and sugar.

00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:41.083
(upbeat traditional music)
(singing in foreign language)

00:18:49.383 --> 00:18:51.220
- Buffet style but just for our group

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.783
so they set out all the food.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.340
Yeah, so that's, it's very convenient.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.533
Oh and there's that black pork curry.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.240
I'm sorry, pork black curry.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.650
It's not a black pork.
- A lot of music

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.030
from over there.
- It's a black curry!

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.900
They brought out Koththu Rotti which is,

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.770
it's a really flat, very thin Rotti

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.300
and what they do is they chop it up,

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.360
they mix it with curry sauce,
they mix it with spices,

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.920
they mix it sometimes with egg.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.190
This is a special version,

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.720
and then they sprinkle it with chillies,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.720
there's tomatoes, there's onions on top.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.323
Oh yeah!

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.600
It is awesome.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.760
And yeah, just packed full of flavor.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.443
The egg is curdled in there.

00:19:31.443 --> 00:19:34.968
(upbeat reggae music)

00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:35.801
- It's unreal.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.863
Oh my goodness!

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.720
- Burrito style!

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.600
So this is the pork black
curry inside of an egg hopper

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.950
with some of the sambol on it.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.760
That pork black curry
that we saw them making,

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.920
I am going to, look at this
entire fried curry leaf,

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.385
I'm gonna wrap this up.

00:19:52.385 --> 00:19:55.385
(people chattering)

00:19:58.398 --> 00:19:59.231
Mmm!

00:20:00.865 --> 00:20:04.440
It has such an incredible
roasted chili flavor.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.870
The complexity of spices,
the layers of spices,

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.400
brilliant combination of
everything you want in your mouth.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.600
- [Man] The best of
both worlds right there.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.060
- And one of the best things about hoppers

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.540
is how the edges are crispy,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.930
but on the bottom it's like,
pancakey and like spongy.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:22.780
Sinan doubled up!

00:20:23.634 --> 00:20:25.801
(moaning)

00:20:27.442 --> 00:20:28.830
You're dripping!

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.883
- You see, it's coming!

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.923
- And then you get to the
egg, the yolk, it explodes!

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.720
Doody just had a vision,
and he's gonna make me a,

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.450
make me a hopper!
- The crab curry juice,

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.660
it's so tasty, we're not
gonna get a little bit,

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.060
we're just gonna get enough.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.493
And two, and double.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.523
I'm gonna try this one with Rotti.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.987
- [Mark] Oh yeah!

00:20:59.987 --> 00:21:01.410
- [Man] You see?

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.040
You're gonna try?

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.890
It's, nobody's talking about it.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.900
- [Man] It's almost illegal.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.750
- [Man] This is gonna be illegal.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.960
So you see, it's not runny any more.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.740
- [Mark] One more scoop
of that chili sauce?

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.050
This one, yes!
- [Waiter] Challenging spices!

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.870
- I never, never argue with someone--

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.307
- That one is good!
- Who loves what I love.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.830
- Doody special.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.930
You can feel it squishing in your fingers.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.213
Hmm, ah, a whole chili!

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.470
Just finished with dinner,

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.270
I'm here, I don't know
if you can see, oh yeah,

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.890
you can see the reflection
but next to the lake,

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.510
the restaurant is beautiful,

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.970
the food was unbelievably tasty.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.310
We ate those dishes
that we saw them cooking

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.270
but then more dishes, the egg hoppers,

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.530
wrapping them all up, the spices,

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.070
the flavor, the chillies,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.020
an amazing and outstanding meal

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.020
and such a relaxing,
chilled out environment.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.070
It's been actually an incredible day,

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.490
starting with the crab,

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.410
an amazing lesson in
Sri Lankan crab curry,

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.750
the family recipe.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.150
Thank you so much to The Station,

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.590

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.030
