00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.650
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: Welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.920
on a wonderful fall afternoon.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.270
I'm Helena Zinkham, the Director
for Collections and Services.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.790
I'm going to start today's
special program with a few remarks

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.580
about the library's
amazing research resources.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.970
Then Stefan Hansen from the Swedish
Embassy will introduce our speaker,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.810
author and journalist,
Anders Rydell.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.610
He'll talk about his new title
"The Book Thieves: The Nazi Looting

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.730
of Europe's Libraries and the Race
to Return a Literary Inheritance".

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.220
We'll have time for
questions afterwards and then

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.190
at 4 Anders will be available
to sign copies of his book.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.460
At that time you can also
see examples of books

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.390
from the Offenbach Archival Depot.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.560
The Library of Congress
had staff in Europe

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.550
after World War II whose
work included helping

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.500
to return the stolen books.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.560
The display opens with an album of
photographs showing 350 bookplates

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.970
that facilitated connecting
books to their former owners.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.550
For publications that
lacked any indication

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.850
of ownership the Jewish Cultural
Reconstruction group organized the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.970
distribution of the orphans.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.770
The Library of Congress did
receive several thousand volumes

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.490
from the JCR and close to 1500 are
identified in our online catalogue

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.480
with the heading "Holocaust
Era Judaic Heritage Library",

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.790
in other words the library as a
participant in helping to identify

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.430
and make sure the books
remain visible.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.740
These books are cared for by the
Hebraic Section of the African

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.180
and Middle Eastern Division which
has brought three special titles

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.860
to share with you along with a
brochure that describes them.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.270
Why would the Library of
Congress take an active role

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.390
in preserving international
cultural heritage?

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.570
Well, our name does emphasize
that our primary duty is

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.460
to the United States Congress.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.070
We answer questions for them.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.850
We undertake special
research projects

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.880
but we are also the national
library of the United States,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.490 position:56%
America's library and that means
that our mission is global in scope,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.290
to make resources available,
to sustain

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.720
and preserve a universal
collection of knowledge

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.630
and creativity for
future generations.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.670
Just a few numbers, we're
the stewards for more

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.870
than 164 million items
in 470 languages ranging

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.680
from printed books, newspapers and
of course electronic databases,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.930
but also manuscripts and
maps, movies and music,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.410
unique photographs
and sound recordings.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.880
The shelving, they tell me they've
measured it in miles, 840 miles.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.210
We believe you could drive all the
way to Iowa or Wisconsin and return

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.210
and the books of the library would
be lined up along the highway.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.470
While we are known as the
largest library in the world,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.840
what really matters of course
is content and quality.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.620
We're fortunate to
have many divisions

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.410
with subject matter experts
to provide research guidance

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.810
and insight into these
massive collections

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.560
and we serve people
throughout the world.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.690
The Librarian of Congress
likes to say that we preserve

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.640
and provide access to a rich,
diverse and enduring source

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.700
of knowledge in order to inform
but also to inspire and engage you

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.900
in your intellectual
and creative endeavors.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.710
So whether you are new to
the Library of Congress today

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.330
or an experienced researcher, I see
some familiar faces in the room,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.830
we have a world-class staff,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.890
ready to assist you
either online or in person.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.030
Of particular interest
this afternoon

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.360
of course are the collections
from or about Europe which number

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.460
in the millions, covering
Slavic and Eastern studies,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.950
Eastern European studies as well
as Western European countries.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.840
We invite you to visit
us or to reach

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.620
out through the email service
called 'Ask a Librarian'.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.890
Taru Spiegel is our
reference specialist

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.170
for the Scandinavian countries
and organized the talk today.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.580
Grant Harris, Chief of the European
Division is also here today as well

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.650
as our colleagues from the
African and the Middle East.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.350
I'd like to recognize
their collective support

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.840
for preparing this program.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.460 position:56%
Is everyone's cell phone turned off?

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.680
Just to double-check,
okay thank you.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.550
And please also be aware that
this event is being recorded

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.250
for future webcast,
thank you, Stefan?

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.940
&gt;&gt; Stefan Hansen: Good afternoon
everyone and hey Anders.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.690
And first and foremost thank
you Library of Congress

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.820
for hosting this wonderful start
of the afternoon, this event

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.240
and we are very proud to
partner with you in this event.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.730
And my name is Stefan Hansen.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.050 position:56%
I'm the Cultural Officer of the
Embassy of Sweden and we are located

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.190
in the House of Sweden
in Georgetown,

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.560
and if you've never
been visiting us,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.480
please do because we are
having a lot of exhibitions

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.040
and literature events just
like this one, and seminars.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.840
And we are open for the public and
free all the weekends, all the year

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.890
and you can come and visit
us not only for exhibitions

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.860
and theater performances, we also
have a library room for children,

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.970
dedicated for the youngest
ones filled

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.080
with treasures of Swedish authors.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.680
So please come and join us there.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.640 position:56%
The Swedish government is very proud
of our [inaudible] about libraries.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.450
Every municipality in Sweden has
a library, all over the country.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.150
And the libraries' roles are
crucial for a democratic society.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.130
And I would like also to say that
Swedes are the people in the world

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.770
that are reading the most and
that is based on facts [laughter]

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.740
and citizens of today need
to be exposed to training

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.020
and critical analysis of texts,
pictures and video more than ever

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.630
in this day and age
of filter bubbles.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.400
And our minister, the Cultural
Minister is also the Minister

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.000
of Democracy and the Swedish
government believes that culture,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.280
media and literature allows
people to grows as citizens

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.450
and that strengthens our democracy.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.040
But now back to this and back
to Anders, we are thrilled

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.910
that the Library of Congress
has invited a Swedish author

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.350
Anders Rydell.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:36.180 position:56%
Anders is an established journalist,
editor and author of non-fiction.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.510
"Book Thieves" is actually
the second part out of three.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.910
The first part dealt with
the looting of artworks

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.900
in the Second World War and the
third will talk about music.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.070
Anders' work, the Nazi looting of
art and books has been translated

00:07:54.070 --> 00:08:01.340
into 19 languages including German,
Italian, Russian and Chinese.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.330
And the "Book Thieves" is his
first book translated into English.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.180
And this has been a very
busy year for you Anders,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.930
you both published your
first book in English here

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.580
and you also had your son?

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.070
&gt;&gt; Anders Rydell: Yes.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.010
You can, he's part
of the exhibition.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.410
&gt;&gt; Stefan Hansen: So,
congratulations on that.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.510
And please help me to give a
warm welcome to Anders Rydell.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:34.680
[ Applause ]

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anders Rydell: Yeah, I will
first say, thank you for inviting me

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:45.060
to this great library and
as Stefan told before,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.350
this is actually the second
book in a three-part series.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:55.690
The first book came out in 2013
and the last book I'm working

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:00.450
on right now, on the
looting of music instruments,

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.660
sheets of music and
music literature.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:09.530
But, it was when I started working
on the book about the looting

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.150
of art I also discovered
the looting of books.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:18.530
And it was a couple of things that
got me interested in this subject.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.720
First of all, when you
looked into the organizations

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.190
that organized the looting, they
didn't go after the art first,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.460
they went after the
books, especially in France

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.420
and it was quite particular.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.180
And another thing was
the scale of it.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.360
The looting of books,
the operation to loot,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:49.970 position:56%
sort and transport books was much,
much larger than the looting of art.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:54.260
Art was, if you compare
it, a small operation.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.820
But the last and maybe
most important issue was

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.720
that the organizations that
were responsible for the looting

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.810
of cultural items, they weren't
really interested in the art.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.100
The art was sent to the big
collectors like [inaudible]

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.320
and Otto Fichler [phonetic]
of course.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.300
But what they were
interested in was the books

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.180
and not just books
but also archives.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.020
And this was interesting

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:31.110
because these organizations were
also the central intellectual

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.360
organizations in Germany.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.310
It was to, first of all
Heinrich Himmler's SS

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.890
and Alfred Rosenberg's
organization, ERR.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:51.090
The common picture we have of
the book, the Nazis' relations

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:59.630
to literature is this, the book
burnings on the 10th of May, 1933.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:05.400
And it's a very strong picture and
I think this image of the Nazis,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.300
it's still powerful today.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.390
And it's so powerful
because we want to believe

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.880
that the Nazis didn't read
books, they destroyed books

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.440
but the truth isn't that.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.130
And I think the truth is
more horrific actually.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:30.340
The book burning in May 1933 wasn't
done immense destruction of books,

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.450
actually quite few
books was destroyed.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:42.320
Already in 1933 the Nazis started
looting books all over Germany.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:49.770
The book burning was more a
ritual, a symbolic display

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:55.030
where they burned books in
a kind of ritual that a lot

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.500
of Germans at that time understood.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.870
This was something that
went deep in German history.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.820
A hundred years earlier German
students had burned French

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.800
literature of the Napoleon Wars.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.740
But the most important
reference was to Martin Luther

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.640
and his burning of the Papal Bull.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.100
Because, in the Nazi
perspective the burning

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.300
of the Papal Bull wasn't an
act of religious freedom,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.720
it was a nationalistic act.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.750
It was the moment when the
German people freed themselves

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:38.640
from the Catholic Church, the
power of the Catholic Church.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.410
In Berlin 42,000 people
came together on this night

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:50.500
and the speaker here was the new
Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.040
and he said "Here, the
intellectual foundations

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.970
of the November Republic
sinks to the ground.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.190
But from the debris, a new
spirit will raise triumphantly

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.110
like the Phoenix".

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.840
The interesting part
here is the new spirit.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.880
What was this new kind of spirit?

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:19.320 position:56%
The Nazis didn't distance themselves
from intellectuals, from poets,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.450
from librarians, writers,
researchers,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.460
actually they recruited
them and very actively

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:34.880
because they needed them to create
the image of a new human being.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.850
A couple of years later a
new institute was opened

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.020
in Germany, a historical institute.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:47.330
And one of the historians here
described the role of the historian

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:53.640 position:56%
in the new Nazi Germany and this
description I think is valuable also

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:59.040
for other kinds of
academics, writers, poets.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.480
He said "The purpose of research
is not to fight directly for power.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.400
But they can forge their weapons,
it can provide us with the shields,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.070 position:56%
it can train the warriors and awaken
the fire within them, hardening them

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.020
against the trials that lie ahead.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.720
The goal of this Institute is to
develop weapons for the struggle

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:27.190
of thought, one of the most
important challenges of all".

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:31.730
The Nazis always fought to
cancel wars, the first one was

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:40.980
on the battlefield, the battle
of soldiers, tanks, machine guns

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.150
but then they fought the other
kind of war, the intellectual war,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:50.800
the war about ideology, the war
where the Nazis wanted to prove

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.290
that the Nazi ideology
was the only true fate.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:15:01.460
And in this war, the
looting was essential.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:15.560
During the research for this book
I used this map and this map came

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.150
from Alfred Rosenberg's
organization,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.010
Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg,

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.900
one of the most important looting
organizations during the Second

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.200
World War.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.530
And I took this map and made
a travel for almost six months

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:36.070
and followed looters in their
footsteps, from the book burnings

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:41.610
in Berlin to the great Jewish
libraries in Amsterdam, to Paris,

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.320
to Rome, to Thessaloniki and
of course Eastern Europe.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:52.040
And the purpose of this trip was to
see what happened to the libraries

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.390
that were looted, what
came back, what was lost,

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:01.740
but also to get knowledge about
what happened to the people,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.870
the communities, the families

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:09.010
that in some cases had built these
libraries through generations.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:17.020
To simplify it you can say that
the Nazis looted three kinds

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.770
of libraries.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:25.160
The first one was libraries on
socialist and communist literature.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.740
After the invasion
of the Soviet Union

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:33.760
in 1941 the Nazis came upon
enormous amounts of libraries,

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.020
archives especially from
the Communist Party.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.860
But there were also targets
in Western Europe and one

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.340
of the most important institutions
was the institute in Amsterdam,

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.970
the Institute of Social History.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:55.730
And this institute had been
created in the early 1930s,

00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:01.320 position:56%
as you can say a response to what
happened around Europe at that time.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:07.060 position:56%
This institute's goal was to save an
important part of Europe's history,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.450
the worker's movements'
libraries and archives.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:16.690
And just in a few years they
built fantastic collections

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.730
because in the 1930s it wasn't
just political refugees,

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.190
there were libraries and archives
on the road that had been smuggled

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:32.600
out from the Soviet Union,
Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.270 position:56%
and of course from Hitler's Germany.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.150
And one of the most important
archives had been smuggled

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.460
out in the early 1930s
from the Nazi Germany

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.310
and this small paper
here is a part of that

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.740
and maybe you can read
in the bottom Karl Marx.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.580
This is the, what you
can call the first draft

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.750
of the "Communist Manifesto".

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:04.530
They had the hallmarks of
Friedrich Engels' Archive

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:10.550
and this archive was kind of
a Holy Grail for the Nazis

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:16.080
because the Communists, the
Socialists, the Bolsheviks were one

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.980
of the Nazis' main enemies.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.730
But wasn't just the
political enemies,

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:26.340
because there were strong social
influences in the Nazi Party.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.480
Early on, there were parts of
the Nazi movement that wanted

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.700
to nationalize the large
companies for example.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:40.520
You can say that the Communists and
especially the Bolsheviks weren't

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.570
so much a political enemy,
they were something more.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:50.890
They were part of what you call
the Bolshevik Communist conspiracy.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:57.430
The idea that Jews
created the Communists

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.090
and the Jews ruled
actually in [inaudible].

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.900
And these ideas were
put ahead especially

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.270
from Alfred Rosenberg's
point of view.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:16.230 position:56%
And the Nazis always tried to prove
these Jewish Bolshevik conspiracies.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.530
And one of the most
important proofs was of course

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:28.370
that the Communists' ideology
was founded by a Jew, Karl Marx.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:34.280
Another kind of libraries
that were looted was the

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.150
Freemasons' libraries.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.830
The Freemasons were one
of the first organizations

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:46.880
that were attacked in
Germany in the 1930s.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.530
And, why did the Nazis
attack the Freemasons?

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.530
For one instance they
were a secret society

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.570
but they were also an
international organization

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:02.660
and both didn't work very
well in a totalitarian state.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.450
But the Nazis also
had a special interest

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:12.420
for the Freemasons' libraries
and especially the libraries

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:18.820
on the occult, libraries on
witches, black magic, alchemy.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.320
And this interest was
especially large in the SS.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:29.680
I will get back to later what they
wanted to do with this collection.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.040
This is a picture from Klossiana,

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.360
one of the oldest Freemason
libraries in Europe

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.670
and this library was
looted during the war

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:43.340
and had a fantastic collection
on literature on alchemy.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:51.520
But of course the most
affected were Jewish libraries.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:58.100 position:56%
The oldest and most important Jewish
libraries in Europe were looted.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.600
One of them was in Rome,
the library that belonged

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.760 position:56%
to the Jewish community in Rome and
this library had a fantastic history

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.390
because it belonged to a
community with a fantastic history.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.650 position:56%
The Jewish community of Rome was one

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.230
of the oldest Jewish
communities in Europe.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.940
Some of the first Jews came here
as slaves during the Roman age.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:31.750
And this library had, went
through, down through the ages

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.370
and it was saved from
the Inquisition

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.520
in the 15th and 16th centuries.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:44.490
In 1943 this library was
put on a German train

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.150
and the train headed somewhere

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.980
into Central Europe and
then it disappeared.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.940
This library has never been found.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:58.130
The Italian government had
tried to find it for ten years

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.060
but practically it failed.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.750
And the author, Robert Katz
had described what this library

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:11.250
included, the only copies
of books and manuscripts

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.020
from before Jesus'
birth, from the time

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.240
of the Roman emperors
and the early popes.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.220
There were engravings
from medieval times,

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.650
books from the first
printing presses and documents

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.400
that had been passed from
hand to hand through history.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:37.500
But the places that you could
say, that were most affected

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.280
by the looting were a
couple of places in Europe

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.940
that you can describe as places
of Jewish culture and learning.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.760 position:56%
And one of those places was Vilnius.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:56.220
Vilnius was the center, the
heart of the Yiddish culture

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.720
in Eastern Europe and it
was known for its poets,

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.640
its rabbis, its libraries.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.790
And one of the most important
institutions here was YIVO,

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.800
the Yiddish Institute.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:16.860 position:56%
And as the Institute of Social
History this institute had a mission

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.050
to save the Yiddish
culture and history.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:28.400
And during a couple of decades
they collected/sent out hundreds

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:35.460
of historians, authors, researchers
that collected folk tales,

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.100
songs, and ancient manuscripts.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.140
This institution of course was one

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.090
of the main targets
of the Nazi looters.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:51.740
The problem the Nazis had,
especially in Eastern Europe was

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.690
that they got more material
than they had Nazi researchers

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.150
that could read Yiddish or Hebrew.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:05.060
So they solved this in a
very, you could say Nazi way,

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.070
they let the victims do the work.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:14.710
They created slave labor groups of
Jewish academics, writers, poets,

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:21.050
that themselves got to sort through
the collections for the Nazis.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:28.070
The sad story is that these
places of Jewish culture

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:32.680
and learning also were the
places that were hardest-hit

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:39.110
by the Holocaust and the Nazis,
because the Nazis saw this place

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:45.840
as dangerous, as places where
the Jews could fight back.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:53.250
The other great Euro-center
of culture

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.900
and learning was Thessaloniki.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.980
And to Thessaloniki or Thessalonica
as it was called at the time,

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.080
isn't as famous today
as Vilnius and it's

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.370
because its history is almost gone.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.730
Here the Nazis succeeded.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:17.840
This was once one of the
biggest Jewish cities in Europe,

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:23.000
like a center for a very
special Jewish community and one

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.570
of the few European cities when
the Jewish population dominated.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:37.380
And this city had been founded
by Jews that left Spain in 1492

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:42.990
after the Reconquista, when
they were forced to leave Spain.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:48.700
And when they came here from Spain
they brought a unique culture

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.190
because these Sephardic
Jews had been part

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:59.530
of what you call the Arabic
Translation Movement during the

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.740
Middle Ages and when a lot
of the classics from Greek

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.900
and Roman literature were saved,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.980
because they were translated
into Arabic.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:14.520
And they were often, the Sephardic
Jews that did these translations,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.330
so when they moved to
Thessaloniki in today's Greece,

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.250
they took with them their books,

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:26.810
and this city already during
the 16th century became known

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.460
for its libraries, its culture.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:37.820
And when the Nazis came here almost
400 years later people still spoke

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:43.500
Ladino, the ancient
Spanish-Jewish language.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:50.550
This was a society a
culture, a whole civilization

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:56.450
that perished during the Holocaust,
not only the people disappeared

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:01.520
but also their history
and their culture.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:08.230
The libraries and archives of this
culture were looted and scattered.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:13.680
Today when you walk around in
Thessaloniki you see few traces

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:20.730
from this civilization that existed
here for less than 100 years.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.680
But there are some traces,
outside the city walls

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.730
where there today is the
Aristotle University,

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:35.470
was once one of Europe's
largest Jewish cemeteries,

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.790
a half a million graves.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:43.870
During the war this cemetery
was blown up, destroyed

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:48.690
and then they used the
stones as building material.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:53.210
The SS used it to build a
swimming pool at the SS villa.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:58.340
But also, ordinary Greeks used it.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.790
So today when you know
what, where to look,

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.610 position:56%
you can find pieces of this history.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:13.070
I found it at a small wall in
the center that smelled of urine,

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:18.990
in a wall built in the 60s
and here I found a part

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.410
of a Jewish gravestone.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.640
And you can say that these
words on this stone are there,

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.520
some of the few words that still
exist from this lost civilization.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:37.870
Who were the men who were
responsible for this?

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.290
Of course one of them
was Heinrich Himmler.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:46.090
The SS was one of the
big looters of books

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:51.770
and during the war they started to
build a big collection in Berlin,

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:57.820 position:56%
a big library that they called the
Library of the Enemies of the Reich.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:03.050
And it was a library with different
departments for Jews, Communists,

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:08.560
Freemasons, and Catholics, everyone
that they perceived as an enemy.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.610
And at this library they
planned to study their enemy,

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:18.310
but not only to destroy them
in the physical sense but also

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.810
to fight their ideas,
their thoughts.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:26.880
Here they're going to fight
the idea, the intellectual war.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.160
But the SS also did
another kind of research

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.750
and especially research
on the occult.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:40.760
There were some authors
on popular descriptions

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.350
of the Nazi interest in the occult.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.750
It was an interest that went
through the whole Nazi movement

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:51.720
but it was strong especially in SS.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.360
And maybe the most,
the strangest research

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.060 position:56%
that they did was the witch project.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.240
It went on for almost ten years.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:09.610
And in this project they collected
material on thousands of witches

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:14.900
that had been burned from
the Middle Ages and forward.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.370
And they collected this to archive

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.350
that was called Himmler's
Hexenkarrochek.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.780
Why did they do this?

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:28.920
You could say that the Nazi,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:34.340
that Nazi Germany was probably
the only regime in history

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.980
that was positive to witches.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:44.500
They loved witches and they often
described them like Nordic amazons.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:50.250
The Nazi interest in witches
is that, especially the SS,

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:55.390
they saw the witch hunts and
the burnings of witches as part

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.210
of a larger war between
civilizations.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:06.770 position:56%
The witches were victims in a war
between the Catholic, Semitic Church

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:10.070 position:56%
and the true Nordic faith and myths.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:16.060 position:56%
It was a way for the Catholic Church
to destroy the true Nordic religions

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:23.490
and ideas in the SS perspective.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:27.910
The other person that was
responsible for the looting

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:31.700
and maybe the most serious
collector is the man

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.460
in the hat here, Alfred Rosenberg.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.760
He's one of the lesser-known
persons in the Nazi elite

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.910
but I think some of
the most important.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:48.140
In the early 1930s Hitler
appointed him the role

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:54.500
as the Party's spiritual
leader, the chief ideologist.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.800
And Rosenberg's mission
was to purify, develop

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.060
and protect the Nazi ideology.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.390
And Rosenberg realized one thing,

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:11.200
that the Nazi movement
wasn't held together

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:16.010
by its ideology but
by something else.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:22.110
It was held together by the cult
surrounding the man in the middle,

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:27.300
the cult, the Hitler
cult and the Fuhrer cult.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.760
Rosenberg believed that if the
man in the center disappeared,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.130 position:56%
everything would come crashing down.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:42.550
But, how would you build an
empire that would last 1000 years

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:48.860
if you have only, if it all
depends on just one man?

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.160
Rosenberg meant that they
needed something else,

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.770
of course they needed an
idea but an idea can't exist

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.820
without institutions

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.210
and he especially looked
at the Catholic Church.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.710
He meant that what
would Christianity be

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:14.730
without the Catholic Church,
the power of this institution?

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:19.960 position:56%
Would the Christian faith even exist
today without this institution?

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:26.840
Rosenberg meant to create
such new Nazi institutions

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:32.500
and he believed the two most
important areas were education

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.620
and science.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.970
Already during the 1930s the
Nazis started to experiment

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.710
on special elite schools.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.380
They created the Adolf Hitler
Schools for young, gifted boys.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.810
Then they went to the
Ordensburgen Schools.

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:54.990
It was like a military academy
where a boy should read Goethe

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.060
and shoot the machine gun.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.570
You should be what the Nazis
would describe as poetic warriors.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:06.330
And they would finish
their education

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:15.080
at Rosenberg's crown jewel, the
University of the Nazi Party.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.880
This was a school that was
planned to be built in the south

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.730
of Germany after the war.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:29.350
And here the Nazis would create the
future leadership of Nazi Germany

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:31.950
and secure it, the future.

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:36.340
But these institutions
would also be the head

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:42.540
of the other pillar,
research and science.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:48.360
Connected with university
Alfred Rosenberg planned several

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:53.130
institutions, spread out over
Germany that would study some

00:34:53.130 --> 00:35:01.390
of the Nazis' favorite questions,
Indo-German, German history,

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:07.750
folk history, Celts,
Eastern research for example.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:12.980
And it was for, mainly for
this kind, these institutions,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:18.230
the institutes that the Nazis, that
the Rosenberg organization looted.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:24.030 position:56%
But there was only one of these that
was officially open during the war,

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:28.950
the last one, the Institute
of the Jewish Question.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:35.010
And this was an institute
and a question

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:40.050
that Rosenberg meant couldn't
be, had to be dealt right now.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:46.780
And it was actually opened in
1941 when the Holocaust started

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:53.850
and its projects and its operation
was connected to the Holocaust.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:36:04.180
At this institute Nazi researchers
studied Jewish history, language,

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.340
culture and to this institute some

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:12.240
of the most important Jewish
collections were sent.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:19.040
Why was it so important to study
Jewish history and culture?

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.380
When Alfred Rosenberg
inaugurated the institute he said

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:29.680
that it may come a day
when our grandchildren grow

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.170
up in a world freed from Jews

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:38.120
where maybe they can't really
understand the threat the Jews

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.570
proposed for our time,
therefore the goal

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.770 position:56%
of this institute is to remind them.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:51.100
And he said the human
memory is very short.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.870
What Alfred Rosenberg was
afraid of was of course,

00:36:54.870 --> 00:37:01.250
that future generations in a world
without Jews, would judge them

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:08.680
for their actions and that they
wouldn't understand why they had

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.570
to do this horrible thing.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:18.820
I think one of the most important
lessons about the looting is

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:25.090 position:56%
that it wasn't done to eradicate the
history or culture of their enemies

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:28.270
but to take control over it.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:34.780
Because, if you own your enemies'
libraries, if you own their books,

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:40.340
their archives, you also have
the power to write their history,

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.530
that was the main goal
with the looting.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:49.710
As Alon Confino puts it in his
book "A World Without Jews",

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.070
"Remembering the Jews

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:55.950
after a victorious war would
have been important precisely

00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:00.920
because total liquidation of the
Jews could not have been achieved

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:06.210
by physical annihilation alone,
it required as well the overcoming

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:10.180
of Jewish history,
memory and history.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.870
The Nazis struggle against
the Jews was never principally

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:18.180
about the political and
the economical influence.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:23.590
It was about their identity waged
by the means of Nazi appropriation

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.940
of Jewish history,
memory and books".

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:32.780
The Nazis wanted a future
with generations to remember,

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.540
remember what happened
but only by taking control

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.490
of Jewish history and culture.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:43.990
Could the Nazis also take control
over the memory of the Jews

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:48.760
in a world where they
didn't exist anymore?

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:55.150 position:56%
In the Nazi world view the Jew would
become the devil and incarnation

00:38:55.150 --> 00:39:01.520
of evil that would scare the
children long after they were dead.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:07.370 position:56%
After the war these books, libraries
and archives were found all

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:13.350
over Europe and their fate
was very different depending

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:19.080
on who found them and
where they were found.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:27.110
Early in 1945 Stalin in a secret
operation created so-called Soviet

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.760
Trophy Brigades.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.820
And the goal of these brigades
was to take as much as they could

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:39.060
from Germany but also
from Central Europe.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:44.990
And the Soviet Trophy Brigades
took over 11 million books

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:48.520
to the Soviet Union that
were looted and many,

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:54.480
many more from German
libraries and universities.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:01.330
Many of these collections were
scattered, separated and most

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:04.530
of these books have
never been returned.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:11.600
It was a different procedure in the
West where the monuments men sorted

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:19.640
and succeeded in returning millions
of books at the Offenbach Depot,

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.380
a sorting center outside
of Frankfurt, among them,

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.340
many of the books that had been
found at the Frankfurt Institute,

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.070
but there was still a problem.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:37.960
Even if you could find out
who owned a book there wasn't,

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.560
it was far from certain
that there was still someone

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.120
to return the book to.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.550
As one of the monuments
men later wrote

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.350
"In the sorting room I would
come upon a box of books

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:56.850
which the sorters had brought
together like scattered sheep

00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:02.160
into one fold - books from a
library which once had been

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.590
in some distant town in
Poland or an extinct Yeshiva.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:11.940
There was something sad and
mournful about these volumes

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:17.860 position:56%
as they were whispering a tale of
yearning and hope since obliterated.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:22.300
I would find myself straightening
out these books and arranging them

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.010
in the boxes with a
personal sense of tenderness

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:29.170
as if they had belonged
to someone dear to me,

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.090
someone recently deceased".

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:40.760
Many of these books were later
sent out to Jewish communities,

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.740
to institutions around the world.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:51.450
But still despite both the
efforts to loot books after war

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:57.280
and return them, there were
millions and millions of books left

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.380
in German libraries and in
other European libraries.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:08.080
And, when I travelled around
Europe I found them everywhere.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:13.740
In my book I especially
focused on a library in Berlin,

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.310
the Zentral und Landesbibliothek.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:20.370
Today there are estimates
that there could be

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:26.790
around a quarter million looted
books just in this library.

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:38.260
And most of the looted books at
this library aren't valuable books,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:43.610
aren't important books, it's
just books that belonged

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:48.670
to ordinary people because the
Nazis didn't just loot books

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:54.300 position:56%
from important libraries and
archives, they looted from everyone.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:01.180
In 1942 Alfred Rosenberg
initiated the so-called M-Aktion,

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.920
Mobel Aktion.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:09.500
It was an operation where 70,000
homes in France, The Netherlands

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:14.030
and Belgium were emptied
of everything, furniture,

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:18.130
toys [inaudible] and
of course books.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:21.030
And, hundreds and hundreds
of thousands

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.460
of these books were
brought to Germany

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:27.410
and often sold to German libraries.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:35.520
And the library in Berlin,

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:42.910
they don't have big collections
either they have one or a few books

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:49.010
from thousands and
thousands of small libraries.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.600 position:56%
And today a small team of
librarians sort through a collection

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:58.430
of 7 million books by hand and they
have worked for almost a decade.

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:04.100
And they have returned 600
books, so you understand

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:10.670
that this is something that's
going to go on for decades

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.050
or maybe for generations.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:18.210
One question I asked when
I came to this library was,

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:21.730
why hasn't this been
brought up earlier?

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:28.660
The libraries started doing
this research ten years ago.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:34.210
And one important reason was
that it wasn't librarians

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:40.530
that were held responsible
for the crimes after the war.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:47.380
The same librarians ought to be,
that had taken part of the looting,

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:52.160 position:56%
held that position after the war and
often tried to hide this history.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:59.510
They hid the traces and today you
can find a lot of books that look

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:05.600
like this, when you have tried
to destroy Jewish bookplates.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:10.390
In other cases you have, they
have tried to falsify catalogues.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:13.740
During the war there wasn't
a problem to put the 'J'

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.030
in the books for Jewish books.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:21.720 position:56%
It didn't look as good after the war
so they tried to make it a donation

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.610
from someone with 'J', Jiako
[phonetic] or something.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:31.680
And, you can also ask, why is it
important to return these books?

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:37.980
They aren't valuable and ten
years' of work for 600 books,

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:46.200
and it's 600 books to around,
a little more than 100 people.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.830
And in my book I wanted to do,
follow one of these single books

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.720
because I understood that every one

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.360
of these books also
carried a history.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:01.090
And, as one of the librarians
here said it's often a history

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.840
that ends at Auschwitz.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:11.410
And I came in contact with this
book, and this book was a book

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:16.510
that belonged to just an
ordinary German Jewish man

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:21.000 position:56%
that was called Richjart [phonetic]
Kobrak and he was a lawyer in Berlin

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.150
and lived there with his
wife and three children.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:29.200
And he didn't really
have a Jewish identity.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:35.360
The family was Christian and he
had been awarded the Iron Cross

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.030
of the [inaudible] in
the First World War.

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:44.000
So, when Hitler came to power
he refused to leave Germany.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.100
He meant that he was more German
than that Austrian Hitler.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.810
And that was a mistake of course.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.960
After the Kristallnacht
they understood

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.580
that they'd found a big mistake.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:05.050
And they tried to get out
and they succeeded sending

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:08.490
out the three children
but Richjart Kobrak

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:12.560
and his wife died in Auschwitz.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:20.080
I took this book and followed
it to Richjart Kobrak's son,

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.230
Helmet [phonetic] Kobrak.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:31.520
Helmet Kobrak was 15 years old when
he came to Great Britain in 1939.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:37.250
The problem was that the British
didn't see him as a Jewish refugee

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:41.030
so they arrested him and
deported him on a ship

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:44.250
with prisoners to Australia.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:50.860
It took almost 10 years for him to
get back to his sisters in England.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:56.750
I took this book and returned it to
Helmet's daughter, a woman living

00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:00.670
in a small village
outside Birmingham.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:05.350
And this book was the first
thing the family ever got back

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.050
from Richjart Kobrak.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:12.470
This was a man that had
left almost nothing.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:14.030
They didn't have any photographs.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:17.640
They didn't have a grave of course

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:25.290
and in some ways this book was the
only proof that he ever existed.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:29.420
I think this tells something
important about restitution

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:34.130
because with the focus on art,
restitution has been a lot

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:38.180
about the value of
artworks and money.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:43.130
But I mean the moral
center, the moral quest

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:49.650
of the restitution isn't economical
compensation, that's important

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.370
but it's not the moral center.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:53.670
It's to get back.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:55.920
It's to give back something
of the lives

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.250
and worlds that were destroyed.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:05.380
To return a book to Thessaloniki
is a way to return a small part

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.120
of a history that isn't
here anymore.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:15.960 position:56%
And this book here, it's practically
worthless, you can buy it

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.620
for a dollar at the bookseller

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:25.440
but for this family it's the
most important book in the world.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.510
Thank you.

reading with great interest.

In your book I recently began.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:29.330
In your book I began reading the
chapter about Vilnius and one thing

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:35.950 position:56%
that I was wondering is, throughout
your research, were you able to root

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:40.600
out or locate any books that
belonged to the [inaudible]?

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.120
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: I want
to just briefly repeat.

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.730
So, for those who are watching
the webcast later this is an

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:50.990
appreciation for the
talk and then a question.

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:56.860
Has Anders seen any of the
books that were at Vilnius?

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.890
&gt;&gt; Anders Rydell: No, I'm
sorry I haven't actually

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.530
because they aren't there anymore

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:03.970
and as I think some people
here know, a lot of the books

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:08.260
from Vilnius especially
the books that were found

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:11.990
at the Frankfurt Institute,
were actually sent to New York.

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:13.290
&gt;&gt; New York?

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:14.590
&gt;&gt; Anders Rydell: Yeah, to
the YIVO Institute in New York

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:16.530
because YIVO had already at that
time a department in New York,

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:17.830
was like a side department
[inaudible] become the main,

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:19.130
the main YIVO because
[inaudible] was destroyed.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.430
But it was a question at
that time that they wanted

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:21.730
to send the books back to
Lithuania but of course

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:23.030
at that time it wasn't
possible for YIVO to exist there

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.360
because as you know in the
Soviet Union it wasn't allowed

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.660
to have alternative
identities, not officially.

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:26.960

like head to New York City.

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.410
&gt;&gt; Anders Rydell: It was a library
of the Jewish community in Rome.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:37.710
&gt;&gt; In Rome?

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:39.010
&gt;&gt; Anders Rydell: Yeah.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:44.460
They had two libraries and I showed
a picture from the second one,

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:47.310
and it was the lesser
important library.

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:50.950
But the community's
libraries were, it's lost.

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:56.170
And, some believe it's in
Russia but nobody knows.

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:59.080
Some believe it had been destroyed.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.580
And it's really sad because
it's such a fantastic library

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:07.340
and the library was
actually not that old.

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:14.100
It was brought together when they
took down the Jewish ghetto in Rome

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.750
and as you maybe know the Jewish
ghetto in Rome was the last ghetto

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:21.720
in Europe before the
Nazis created them again

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.070
at the end of the 19th century.

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.510
And these books were
brought together

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:30.040
because they had been hidden
because the Inquisition had went

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.830
into the Jewish ghetto
in Rome several times,

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:35.030
collected Jewish books
and burned them.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:40.720
So, these books had been hidden
away from the Catholic Church

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.100
for hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.920

question on this side of the room.

for their libraries and [inaudible]?

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:03.010

is, have any libraries made,

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:06.630
have any families made
claims for their libraries

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:09.290
as they become more aware
that the books still exist,

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:11.780

especially at this library

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:20.560
that I told you about, the Zentral
und Landesbibliotheck in Berlin.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:26.290 position:56%
They accurately search for people
but it's a very time-consuming work.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:29.830
So, what they're doing
right now is putting

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:32.810
up all the information they can
get from a book, bookplates,

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:36.310
names and everything on
the internet so a lot

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:38.780
of people actually find them
when they're doing research

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.640
on the family, on their history.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:45.920
But the problem is of course
that a lot of the survivors,

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.740
I mean were scattered all
over the world, changed name,

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.020
changed identity and
everything so it's.

know who would [inaudible] entitled

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:04.980
to because one of the [inaudible]
went to Australia, one to Argentina

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:17.160
because they understood if the
Germans want to control our memory,

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:22.750
we must protect our history and
get it out somewhere, somehow.

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:28.650
Yeah, and after the, their ghetto

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:38.590 position:56%
in Vilnius was destroyed Herman Kruk
was sent to a labor camp in Estonia.

00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:43.930 position:56%
Herman Kruk was deported to a forced
labor camp in Lagedi, Estonia.

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:50.650
He would continue to keep
a journal to the very end.

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:57.900
On September 17, 1944 he
wrote his final notes.

00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:02.610
I'm burying the manuscripts in
Lagedi, in Herr Schulma's barrack,

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:08.490
opposite the guardhouse, six
people are present for the funeral.

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:12.640
He buried all of his diaries
to save them because he sensed

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.280
that something was wrong.

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.470
Kruk had a sense of
what awaited him.

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:23.170
The next day, he and 2000
other prisoners were forced

00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:29.610
to carry wooden logs to a
forest outside the camp.

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:35.110 position:56%
The logs were put down in long rows
where upon the prisoners were forced

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:37.510
to lie down on top of them.

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:40.890
They had built their
own funeral pyres.

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:44.580
After the Nazi guards had shot
the prisoners in the head,

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:47.990
another layer of logs and
prisoners were added on top,

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:52.580
and thereafter, another,
and another.

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.990
When the Red Army reached
the scene a few days later,

00:58:55.990 --> 00:59:00.230
unburned bodies still
lay in the pyres.

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:05.890
But one of the witnesses of Herman
Kruk's funeral managed to flee

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:11.760 position:56%
and went back to dig up his diaries.

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:17.670
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: I think that
brings us to a good ending.

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:22.910

view some of the books

00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.590 position:56%
