ARTUR TILIERI: Hi.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.770
Nice to meet you.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.850
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.620
My name is Artur.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.120
I work for Cartoon Network.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm the regional
senior digital manager.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.640
That's a fancy thing
to say, but I basically

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.820
work on the content
team at Cartoon Network,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.640
basically creating
content for digital.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.305
I'm a gamer.

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:18.930
I'm a designer.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.760
I graduated in design.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.840
I'm a YouTuber as well.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.400
My channel has an
impressive number

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.260
of 12 followers, 12 subscribers.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.530
So that's fancy for me.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.470
And just to talk a
little bit of what we do

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.729
and what is Cartoon Network.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.680
So this is Cartoon Network.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.680
We are not a TV channel.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.870
We are a strong brand.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.412
And we are working with a
lot of different platforms.

00:00:40.412 --> 00:00:41.370
We have the TV channel.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.070
The TV channel has been
existing for more than 20 years.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.610
So this is the number
one thing that we do.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.460
We are number one in
ratings with kids.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.290
And this is important for us.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.590
We do work a lot with
site, games, applications,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.850
digital, social media.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.410
So this is huge for us.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.390
This has been huge for
more than 15 years.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.650
The Cartoon Network's website,
when I was a kid, like 25,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.870
30 years ago, I used to enter--
not 30, maybe a little bit

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.540
less-- but I used to enter on
the Cartoon Network website

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.620
and I used to play games.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.920
We started building
games from-- at least,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.840
when I was growing up,
I was playing, already,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.923
the Cartoon Network games.

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:23.670
So this was really important
for us from the beginning.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.840
And we do have, also,
a strong licensing

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.010
and live events and stuff
that we do on Cartoon Network

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.510
as well.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.450
So this is a little bit of
who we are and what we do.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.700
So I'm going to talk about some
of the learnings of building

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.330
apps and games from the
past five or six years.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.020
So this is something
of what we came across

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.990
and some of the stuff that
we realized was important.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.860
And I wanted to point out
in a top 10 list of things

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.190
that we learned by developing
our games and our apps

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.110
and we learned from
our audience and we

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.910
learned from our fan base.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.530
And this is the
most important thing

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.290
that you need to understand--
whenever you are talking

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.199
about user acquisition or user
engagement, the first thing

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.020
that you need to do is actually
listening to your audience

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.850
and understanding what they are
asking and how they are asking.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.510
So first of all, I cannot
express the importance

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.530
of your content.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.130
I mean, content is the number
one thing you have to look at.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.460
Whenever you're developing
an idea, creating an idea,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.650
developing a game,
you should consider

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.410
your content and how you're
working with the content.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.850
I mean, the gameplay is key.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.910
I mean, if you're
developing a game,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.670
please take a look
at the gameplay.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.480
How does it work?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.029
How do kids play
with the gameplay?

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.070
This is really important.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.550
And this actually will show
up in the later stage--

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.570
if you don't prepare
your gameplay

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.970
to be fun in the beginning, in
the end stage it won't work.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.610
So this is, specifically,
to Cartoon, I mean, our IPs,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.720
they are everywhere.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.560
They are on games.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.460
They are on TV.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.600
They are on licensing.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.140
They are on live events.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.290
So this is how we do.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.220
We tend to work on a bigger
storytelling approach.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.040
So what happened with
this is that gaming

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.340
is a part of that IP, of
that intellectual property.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.400
So we try to expand the
storytelling approach.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.590
So you will learn some
key things from the game.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.050
Playing the game and
watching the series,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.132
you will learn some new things.

00:03:30.132 --> 00:03:31.590
And this is something
that actually

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.480
changed within Cartoon Network.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.310
Usually, digital was
separated from content.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.820
So the studios in LA that
develop all of our shows,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.630
they were separated
from digital.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.950
So what happened is that
we simply merged together.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.990
So right now, digital
is part of content

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.910
and digital is seen as content.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.360
So we work closely
together with the studios

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.140
to actually create and develop
games and create ideas.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.610
And the storytelling
is a big part of this.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.490
So a lot of our
games are actually

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.060
being worked by the same script
writers that work with the TV

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.660
shows.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.870
So in this way,
you assure that you

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.820
are working on something that
makes sense for the audience

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.410
and it connects
with your brand ID.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.680
So this is really important.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.339
Again, content is
also understanding

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.540
what your kids like.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.920
So look at the kids.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.990
Look at what they
watch, what they play.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.320
Understand what they consume
so you can apply and learn

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.460
from that whenever you're
producing any of your apps

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.410
and whenever you're
working with content.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.130
So if you're working on a
title that has too much text,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.980
maybe that's not something
that a younger kid would like.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.500
Maybe you need to understand
how they're consuming that

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.760
before planning
that into your game

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.550
so you're not
caught in surprise.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.454
We don't want to
have a huge story

00:04:50.454 --> 00:04:52.620
because we know that the
gameplay is more important.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.320
So this is also important
to evaluate whenever

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.920
you're creating your games.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.430
So please always check
on what kids are doing.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.160
So this is an example
that I like to point out.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.690
This is "Steven
Attack the Light."

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.910
This is actually an app
that was released in 2015.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.350
This was an app-- it is
one of our greatest apps.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.230
We worked with the show
crew to develop the app.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.620
Not only the story was
created by the show

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.950
team, the same script writers,
but the full aspect of the app

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.560
was developed by our team
from the studios in LA.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.320
So what we were
doing was like, OK,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.530
let's take a look to be sure
that this app and this game

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.740
communicates to what
"Steven" truly is.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.510
And whenever this
happens, it's really

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.380
fun to just go through
the comments on the store

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.640
and just realize that people
are really commenting like, hey,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.440
this app feels like an
episode of the show.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.570
And this is amazing for us.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.110
And this is part of
working together.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.970
And this is the
results that we have.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.025
So this is something that it's
really important content-wise.

00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:05.400
The second thing
that I would say

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.130
that it's really
important-- and sometimes I

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.250
feel like in the past
maybe we forgot sometimes--

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.380
but you're working with kids,
so you need to think as a parent

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.560
and think as a kid
at the same time.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.790
So you cannot propose an
app that has something that

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.030
a parent might not like.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.490
So for instance,
at one point, we

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.290
were really, oh, it
would be nice to have

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.320
more social appeal.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.720
Let's place Facebook,
like a Facebook plug-in

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.120
so people can share
the app on Facebook.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.310
But when you start
to think on that,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.740
it's really delicate
the way that you

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.000
need to work with your content
so you're not pushing kids

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.120
to someplace that they
are not supposed to be

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.000
or pushing kids to
a place that parents

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.310
wouldn't like the kids to be.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.980
Sometimes the kids
are out there.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.880
We see some research and kids
are saying, oh, I'm there.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.240
My parent doesn't know.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.320
I'm accessing Facebook.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.319
I have an account.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.860
But what happens is that they
are going against their parents

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.693
and we need to think
with the parents' head.

00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:05.450
I mean, if the parent
doesn't like it,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.130
we shouldn't do it as well.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.380
So we need to come up
with a good balance

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.210
and understand what we can
do and what we can offer,

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.080
so we are not
delivering something

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.000
that's not harmful for either
the kid or the parents.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.250
And that's why this
is a strong point

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.590
because I think sometimes we
completely forget about this.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.720
I mean, we're working with
kids, so how should you place

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.210
your in-app purchase content?

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.160
I mean, again, you're
working with kids,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.530
so sometimes we receive
some news like a kid spends,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.347
I don't know, $5,000 on an app.

00:07:39.347 --> 00:07:40.430
So that's not really good.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.070
So you have to really balance
and, again, think as a parent,

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.980
think as a kid, and see
how you are demonstrating

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.240
that inside your game.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.130
So I can go on.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.630
I mean, there's
like-- for instance,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.230
if you're launching
your game on US,

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.710
you have COPPA,
which is legal that

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.260
has some restrictions with kids
and how you collect information

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.250
from kids.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.810
So this is really
sensitive information

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.120
that you need to
consider whenever you're

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.500
producing an app for a kid.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.220
So number three-- I mean,
how does your game stand out?

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.120
I mean, looking
at the app store,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.980
looking at all the games,
looking with the games

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.490
that are trending up, how
you are separating your games

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.190
from what is already launched.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.350
We, in Cartoon, we never
simply, OK, "Flappy Birds"

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.840
is doing amazing.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.258
Let's just create
a "Flappy Birds"

00:08:35.258 --> 00:08:36.299
with a cartoon character.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.030
That's not how we play it.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.520
That's not how we
sell our games.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.080
And that's not how we
envision the creation

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.640
of content and gaming.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.310
So what we usually
do is actually

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.960
thinking a little bit more.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.880
So "Flappy Birds" is
something that works,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.830
how can we learn from that?

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.280
What are the things that
kids are addicted to?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.120
How can we evolve that and add
a new thing inside of our game?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.590
So how can we
innovate on something

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.070
that was already launched?

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.030
So this is number
three because it's

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.510
part of the Cartoon Network
DNA, which is innovation.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.410
I mean, if we take a little
bit from the previous talk--

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.380
I mean, we were learning
about kids curiosity.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.220
So this is important
for us as well,

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.510
which is actually bringing
some new stuff so the kids can

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.080
actually have something new
to iterate and to learn from.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.520
So it's not simply a
copy from another game.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.772
So this is another thing
that is really important.

00:09:29.772 --> 00:09:31.230
And what we learned
a lot from this

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.270
is that iteration-- I mean,
once you have a game project,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.930
from day one to, I don't
know, day five, day ten,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.230
day one hundred, the
game keeps on changing.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.430
I mean, you learn a
lot from play testing.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.524
So you play test with
a kid and you'll simply

00:09:46.524 --> 00:09:47.940
understand it's
something that you

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.610
imagine like, oh, this is just
like a side part of the app.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.100
Suddenly, that's
the thing that you

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.430
need to focus your
efforts on because this

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.570
is the thing that
it's playing the most

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.370
and kids are enjoying the most.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.000
So your game constantly changes.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.230
And the project will
never be the same

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.900
because it keeps on evolving.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.420
And it keeps on
evolving and changing.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.780
So this is an example
that we do as well.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.550
This is "Adventure
Time: Game Wizard."

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.020
This is a game that we released
in 2013, if I'm not mistaken.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.160
And this involved
innovation in so many ways.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.430
I mean, it was like a
platform, I think, on Mario,

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.450
but the big change to this
game is that you could actually

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.520
create your own game on paper.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.870
So you could draw your levels
and you could scan your levels

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.010
through a cell phone.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.290
And that level would
be read by the app

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.750
and you could play the
game on your own level.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.900
And kids could create a
vast majority of levels.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.470
You could play with other
levels created by other kids.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.930
And the way that you
created the level, as well,

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.010
was like really simple.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.160
You didn't have to draw a lot,
but the app understood signals.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.760
So if you designed a plus
sign on a sheet of paper,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.420
it would understand,
this plus sign is a coin.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.320
So it would read that and it
would throw that in the app.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.170
So for us, this is something
that was really cool because it

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.090
was actually uniting something.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.510
Again, when I was a
kid, I used to love

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.610
to do that, which was
basically drawing.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.230
And we are trying
to unite something

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.650
that kids like to do live
and something that they

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.949
like to do on digital.

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:27.240
So this was something that
was really important for us.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.760
And it had a huge
UGC opportunity.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.530
So for us, this was
really cool as well

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.690
because you could share
what we were doing.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.670
It's not a social media,
but inside the app

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.760
you could actually see that
other people were playing.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.580
You could like other
people's levels.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.900
So this was good as well.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.870
Kids love to play
and like stuff.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.050
So this, for us,
enabled other things

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.970
that were really
positive for us as well.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.720
Number four, localization.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.120
Localization, working
with kids, it's a must.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.520
I mean, we learned
this the hard way.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.030
Sometimes we do develop all of
the apps generated by Cartoon.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.650
They are worked globally.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.440
So we release an app
in every single region,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:17.350
like LATAM, we work in the US,
EMEA, which is Europe and Asia.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.560
So for us, what
we understand from

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.350
this is that whenever
we were like, OK,

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.380
let's try to launch
this game in English.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.630
It's a simple game, maybe
it won't damage a lot.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.190
But what do we learned from
this, whenever we launched

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.880
a game in English, it might
be really little text,

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.440
but that little text makes a
difference and people would

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.950
complain, like, hey, this
game is not in my language.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.070
This game is not in Portuguese.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.270
This game is not in Chinese.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.500
This game is not in Japanese.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.050
So for us,
localization is really

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.180
important because kids like
that and the parents like that.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.400
And not only-- if you
think on even going back

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.280
like on TV trends,
you might hear

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.800
in Brazil-- this is really
common-- so you might think

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.940
like, most of the movie
channels, at one point,

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.430
they were all simply
dubbing all their movies.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.140
So this is a trend,
not only for kids,

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.870
this is a trend
for adults as well.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.940
Everyone likes to
read and they feel

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.199
comfortable to hear in
their original language.

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:18.990
So this is a trend.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.656
And whenever people
ask me like, oh, no,

00:13:20.656 --> 00:13:24.760
but how come the TV channel
changed from English subtitles

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.780
to Portuguese?

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.700
This is crazy.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.690
I love English.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.310
But whenever you
look at the ratings,

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.040
the ratings actually
improved after we did that.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.410
And the same applies to apps.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.940
And the same applies
to everything

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.930
that we do in digital.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.260
So whenever we work
with the local language,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.690
we get much more better results.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.410
So this is an important
thing to understand.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.440
And right now this is a
huge gaming market trend.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.507
I mean, whenever you
see any game right now,

00:13:51.507 --> 00:13:52.590
they are being translated.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.440
If you think on the big titles,
on the PlayStation Store,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.750
for instance, they are being
translated to Portuguese.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.700
They have Portuguese voiceover.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.360
So this is really
important for us.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.370
So an example was "Card Wars."
"Card Wars" was a huge app.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.250
I mean, it's one of
our biggest apps.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.170
So it had a lot of text.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.790
I mean, it was massive text.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.850
I mean, think on a card game
with more than, I don't know,

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.320
a thousand cards.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.700
So at one point, we
released a single patch

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.220
with new cards that
didn't have all

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.570
the translations on the cards.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.170
And on the comments, everyone
was like, what happened?

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.670
The app is bugged.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.110
It's showing me English text.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:38.400
So we went back and we saw
that some cards were English

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.300
and we translated it.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.424
And that made a difference.

00:14:40.424 --> 00:14:42.660
People were like, oh,
now they heard us.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.730
Now, it's in Portuguese.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.670
Now, it's OK.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.920
So this is something that's
really, really important

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.503
to understand.

00:14:47.503 --> 00:14:52.290
And yes, it does
make a difference.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.100
So you have to understand
the game lifecycle as well.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.380
It's not like, OK, they
want to launch the app.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.640
OK, I'm done.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.410
I already released it.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.020
Ah, I can just rest and
move on to the next thing

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.320
I'm going to do.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.230
That's not how we see our apps.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.080
I mean, we see our apps
as constantly evolving.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.810
So what happens on day
one, that's day one.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.975
I mean, you had all the
development of the app,

00:15:15.975 --> 00:15:19.620
but day one is day one for
the lifecycle of the app.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.520
So you need to look at the app
and you need to evolve the app.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.220
So I see, like, in
30 days, the comments

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.810
are that this thing is broken.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:28.920
OK, let's fix it.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.230
Oh, people are saying
the game is too short.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.660
OK, let's change it
and add new levels.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.960
So you have to understand
that this is important.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.870
And this will help
push your app up.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.019
So you cannot miss this.

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:45.060
What we do as well, and
what is really important,

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.410
is also adding relevant
content from different seasons.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.570
So let's say, right
now, it's Halloween.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.765
OK, let's produce a special
package for Halloween

00:15:54.765 --> 00:15:58.260
with special Halloween content
so kids can have something

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.530
that they relate that is
happening with their life

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.060
at the same time.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.830
So Halloween is
a topic for them.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.870
I'm sure that if
we have Halloween

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.960
costumes inside an app, a
kid would love to see that

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.040
and to have that.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.580
So this is really
important for us.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.330
And you can think on any
different-- like in Brazil,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.180
you can think like, OK, Carnival
is something really important,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.680
OK, maybe we should
do and we could

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.040
do a development
of, I don't know,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.894
some Carnival themed
stuff for your app.

00:16:24.894 --> 00:16:26.310
And that will show
the difference.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.480
And that will be
pushed up again.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.330
So that's really important.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.887
The app icon, this is something
that we always talk-- I mean,

00:16:34.887 --> 00:16:36.470
like this morning,
people were talking

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.900
about the importance
of the app icon

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.590
and testing it, and
understanding it,

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.930
and looking at our
audience, and changing it.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.140
And that goes to iteration.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.280
And learn from what
you're getting.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.520
And also the app icon-- so if
you're having Halloween, maybe

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.890
you can change your app
icon, show a pumpkin

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.604
or something that has to do
with Halloween so the kids can

00:16:56.604 --> 00:16:58.020
understand, OK,
this is Halloween.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.620
I'm living Halloween,
so this is cool for me.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.210
So here is another
example, "Teeny Titans."

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.579
It's a game that goes really
into the Cartoon Network DNA.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:13.079
It makes a lot of fun
of these kind of games

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.710
that are like Disney
Infinity, like live toys.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.800
And this is a game that's,
mix that with Pokemon.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.560
And we are just making
huge fun out of this.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.819
So what we did with
this app is actually

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.459
you had a lot of different
figurines to collect.

00:17:30.459 --> 00:17:33.000
And this is one of our apps that
is still training right now.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.340
We launched for
more than six months

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.070
and it's still performing
really good for us.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.560
And on Halloween,
for instance, we

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.670
released new collectibles
that had to do with Halloween.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.070
The game had Halloween
all around it.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.080
So for us, it was a nice update.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.890
It had all to do with what
was happening at the time.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:59.190
We also updated-- I mean, we
had the new, not Batman movie,

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.500
but the new Batman
movie, I don't know

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.590
the name-- the "Suicide Squad."

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.260
So for us, I mean, there
were characters in the movie

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.520
that we could include.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.100
It was around the same
time so we included that.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.780
So Harley Quinn was there.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.300
So I mean, we also
looked at what was

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.870
happening in a stronger angle.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.990
And for us, this
matched perfectly

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.480
with what was happening outside.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.931
And for us, this also
showed the results.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.150
Number six, maintain and
nurture your fan base.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.440
I mean, again, this is
something that it's really,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.260
I can say on our end,
it's like huge work,

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.720
but you need to constantly
look at what people

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.890
are saying about your app.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.100
You have to answer to
comments on the store.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.770
This morning, Google was
also saying the benefits

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.640
that you have whenever
you're addressing to comments

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.370
and the reviews.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.980
So people are reviewing your
app and you're constantly

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.610
checking it.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.370
And you're being sure that,
OK, someone reported a bug,

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.030
I'm being sure
that I will fix it.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.860
I will see if it's true or not.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.790
And you can also answer-- and
you should always answer--

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.370
the users so you get feedback.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.580
And that should drive
the ratings of your store

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.390
higher up.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.350
And this will get you
better results in the end.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.580
So social media-- again,
it's not something

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.130
that we push for it, but
social media, sometimes we

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:20.860
search for it.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.240
So even though we
are not like 100%

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.550
giving away our stuff
on social media,

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.210
we are reading
through social media

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.410
to see what are the trends,
what people are saying.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:32.580
We are looking at PR.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.194
We are looking at what the
media is saying about our game.

00:19:35.194 --> 00:19:36.360
We are looking at YouTubers.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.240
Sometimes we get insights
from YouTubers that are just

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.260
commenting on our game.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.910
And they are commenting
like, hey, I like these,

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:42.702
I don't like this.

00:19:42.702 --> 00:19:44.160
We are reading
through the comments

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.320
and seeing the comments and
what people are saying about it.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.420
So all of this empowers our
understanding of our fans

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.800
and what they want.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.060
And this also empowers us.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.600
Sometimes with trends and stuff
that sometimes we didn't even

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.270
imagine, but someone
might say, hey, I really

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.610
love this game, "Imagine,"
version 2, where

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.350
you added this, this, and that.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.800
So we can read some trends and
we can translate these trends

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.790
later on to our
different games or just

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.520
for us to evolve on something.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.910
So again, this is really,
really, really important.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:23.860
And I cannot stress the
importance of this slide.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.540
And here's an example.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.750
This was actually not an
app, but this was more

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.440
to promote "Powerpuff Girls."

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.670
We were relaunching the
"Powerpuff Girls" this year.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.570
And it was important
for us to talk about it.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:45.130
And I mean, we have a huge
fan base that are older people

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.500
because "Powerpuff Girls"
is more than 20 years.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.200
So we wanted to
communicate with an older

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.790
audience that loved the show.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.140
We wanted to let them know
hey, "Powerpuff Girls" is back.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.680
So what we produced-- and
we had an app, a paid app,

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.490
for the "Powerpuff Girls."

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:05.770
And what we did with this
was a web application

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.560
that you could access
through your mobile phone

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.430
or through the site.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.820
And it was a way to spread
out the word like, hey,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.290
the "Powerpuff Girls" are back.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.510
They have a new look.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.540
So it was more of
a marketing tool.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.830
But for us it was
really impressive.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.660
When we launched this, we didn't
expect the success that it was.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.700
I mean, a lot of PR over this.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.990
We did have enabled
social media sharing.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.906
It was not the app.

00:21:34.906 --> 00:21:36.280
It was something
outside the app,

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.480
but for us it was
good either way.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.310
So in this, you had
like, if you're over 13,

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.950
you could publish
this on Facebook.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.530
If you are younger
than 13, you could

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.450
save to your desktop
or something,

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.990
save to your computer.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.660
So again, this is stuff that
kids can manage to-- OK,

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.880
say I'm older, but
either way, it's

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.510
a way that parents feel safe.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.856
Oh, no, Cartoon is
looking at my kids.

00:22:00.856 --> 00:22:02.230
They are not
publishing something

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.120
that I don't want to see.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.040
And again, this was everywhere.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.640
Everyone started
publishing the avatars.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.820
They changed on Facebook.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.570
It was everywhere.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.160
So for us, this
was an initiative

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.930
that helped placing
the "Powerpuff Girls"

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.170
brand in the consumer's mind.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.150
And for us, this was really
important at the time.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.150
Analytics-- key.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:31.450
Again, once you release your
game, take a look at analytics.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.240
Take a look at what is
happening on your game.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.880
So let's say you have a
long tutorial on the game

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.430
and suddenly you see
analytics-- people are just

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:43.410
dropping your game from
the five seconds to start.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.540
You're having a lot of
give ups on your game.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.330
So maybe you should
look at it and change.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.830
Maybe kids don't
want a tutorial.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.920
Maybe it can be skippable.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.590
Sometimes we realize,
you place a skip button,

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.720
and it's not big enough.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.650
Sometimes it's small.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.410
People don't understand.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.970
So even-- and this
is not for kids only,

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.180
but you should consider
adults as well.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.990
Sometimes we are like,
come on, this is so clear.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.380
How come the user is
not understanding it?

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.455
But believe me, the
users don't understand

00:23:18.455 --> 00:23:19.990
it a lot of the times.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.670
So try to change your app.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.690
And that goes with
what I said before,

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.260
which is actually
iteration, which is actually

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.450
changing your app,
learning with your app,

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.300
and looking at the numbers
and see what is happening.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.790
Look, if you change something
and suddenly the numbers

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.100
go down, maybe, OK,
that's not a good move.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.110
Maybe we should reevaluate
and change it again.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.680
So this is something
that you need

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.550
to measure your app
from every single step.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.797
And just keep looking
at the analytics

00:23:47.797 --> 00:23:48.880
and see what is happening.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.480
And see how you can
improve based on hard data

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.160
and not based only
on user feedback.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.310
That's something,
but this is going

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.870
to empower your user feedback.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.740
So if you see analytics
going bad in some place,

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.650
and if you see your users are
complaining in the same place,

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.350
OK, so you have two
things to tackle at once.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:10.870
So this is an important
thing to notice.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.980
Here is about SEO.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.620
So I think I've run
out of time, right?

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.551
I tend to speak a lot.

00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:20.050
Right?

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:20.320
Yes?

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:20.820
Yes.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.760
I'll just move on fast.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.450
So SEO.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.610
Optimize your app for it.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.880
I mean, make sure
that it's searchable.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.660
Make sure that you're
having the right text on it.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.310
Make sure that you're
addressing the right words

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.890
to make it findable.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:39.450
I mean, in the end, everyone
is on search engines.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:41.430
Nine, marketing strategy.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.930
I mean, if you don't have
a marketing strategy,

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.570
think on about how
to make partners.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:52.020
If you don't have money, try
to partner up with other people

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.090
and just understand how you
can empower your marketing.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.260
We do a lot of marketing.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.360
We are constantly
looking at what

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.030
other people are doing, how
they are marking their apps.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.180
And we are constantly
learning from that as well

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.030
and we apply that to our apps.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:11.230
Here is an example that,
for us as a TV channel

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.960
and as a big media
company, we are

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.200
lucky that we have the channels
and we can promote everything

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.390
that we do on a TV channel.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.940
And as being number
one around the region,

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.030
this really helps us to push
everything that we produce.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.280
So this really helps us.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.410
Again, number 10, and
this is it, I'm done.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.470
Public relations.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.450
I mean, think on
public relations

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.100
as something more expanded.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.900
So not only look
for, I would say,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.360
the traditional one, like
talking with the press,

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.580
but think that public
relations, right now,

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.810
is way bigger than that.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.250
I mean, think on YouTube.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.790
YouTube, right now, you
have so many YouTubers that

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.360
are creating just app reviews.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.950
So they are sometimes
as big or even bigger

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.950
than a traditional media press.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.950
So you should go to these
guys and talk with them

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.110
and try to start a
relationship with them somehow.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.440
Give them your app so they
can test it-- if they like it

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.890
or not, or something like that.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.320
So this is something that might
be really good for your app.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.130
And that's it.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.090
I'm sorry.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.397
I ran out of time.

00:26:17.397 --> 00:26:18.230
Thank you very much.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.146
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:26:19.146 --> 00:26:20.940
Thank you.
