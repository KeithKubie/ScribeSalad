00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.113
(light, peaceful music)

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.600
- It's some 30 years since
I first met Martha Nussbaum,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.210
it was I think in Oxford, it
could've been in Princeton,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.980
but what brought us
together on that occasion

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.510
was our common interest
in Greek philosophy

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.950
and literature, that was 30 years ago.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.990
30 years since then that's
just who I am still,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.160
I'm still Greek philosophy and literature.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.730
The difference between us is
that while Professor Nussbaum

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.370
continues to work a great
deal in those fields,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.370
she's expanded her range
of concerns and expertise

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.160
to the point where she's become
the author and spokesperson

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.670
for a quite remarkable
blend of philosophical,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.180
literary, social, political, educational,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.653
and legal contributions.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.020
The names of some of our
former Foerster lecturers

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.360
of course are very familiar,
some less familiar,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.210
but I'm sure no one came
into this room today

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.620
without knowing the
name of Martha Nussbaum.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.620
At a time when public
intellectuals are a rare commodity,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.600
especially ones of authentic
ability and substance,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.363
Martha Nussbaum is a signal exception.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.330
Her publishing productivity
and versatility are legendary;

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.160
in the last decade alone
she's produced a large volume

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.380
virtually every year with books
as different in their scope

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.320
as upheavals of thought,
which is cutting edge theory

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.410
on the cognitive nature of the emotions,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.170
women and human development,
which reflects her social work

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.870
and experience in India, her latest book,

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.830
if I have my facts right,
will be Liberty of Conscience;

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.150
The Attack on America's
Tradition of Religious Equality.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.560
I think we're going to
get a sample of this work

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.560
in today's lecture, with its
reference to Roger Williams,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.050
the 17th century London clergyman

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.343
who became the founder of
Providence, Rhode Island.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.240
Now, Martha's never let up
on her original interests

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.440
in Greek philosophy and
literature, as I said,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.670
and philosophy in general.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.960
In fact, these interests,
and I think especially

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.430
her devotion to Aristotle,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.290
on whom she published her first book,

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.010
have significantly helped
to shape her approach

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.850
to such gigantic modern
issues as affirmative action,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.120
feminism, gay rights,
third world economics,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.233
and international justice.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.270
After all, Aristotelian ethics psychology

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.000
and literary theory presuppose the notion

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.290
that human beings are emotional
as well as rational animals,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.780
rational of course features in Aristotle's

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.480
classic definition of the human being,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.060
but it's central to
Aristotle's ethical view

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.923
that we are emotional animals too.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.360
The importance of tempering
reason with feeling,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.400
or tempering feeling with
reason, seem to me constant

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.820
and consistent themes in Martha's work,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.640
and in the urgency of her voice,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.693
whatever her theme or concern.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.320
Many of us in this room are
instructed in the humanities.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.820
A stark justification for our calling

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.490
is that study of great
literature, or art, or philosophy

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.160
is supposed to enlarge the mind,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.790
broaden the cultural perspective,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.770
and enhance critical thinking.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.070
As members of a public
university, moreover,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.160
we are beneficiaries of tax dollars,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.370
fewer, no doubt, than we would like,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.960
but a sizeable number of dollars,

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.300
and that benefaction reflects the belief

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.173
that what we do as educators
is for the public good.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.320
Yet while Berkeley and many
other American universities

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.890
regularly reap top ranks in surveys,

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.070
the role of the intellectual
as an influential public voice

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.120
in this land, never great, I think,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.540
but the present threatens
to become quite silent,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.100
or at least unheeded.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.830
Fortunately that will not happen

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.600
under the watch of Martha Nussbaum.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.670
She is a tireless speaker and writer

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.120
on behalf of what she
deems to be the public good

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.873
as measured by concepts of
reason, humanity, and compassion.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.870
Now, to play that role
is not only quite rare,

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.870
it also calls for unusual
eloquence and persuasion,

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.140
and for great energy and courage.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.480
By taking on the huge issues that she does

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.710
Professor Nussbaum risks
controversy and criticism,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.610
and she's had her share of
controversy and criticism,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.760
especially from those of us who stay

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.770
within the comfort zones
of our own disciplines

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.060
and ivory towers.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.060
Long may you continue, Martha,
your dedicated activism,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.200
and your life of what Aristotle
calls practical rationality.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.690
As Chicago's first, sorry,
as Chicago's Ernst Freund

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.810
Distinguished Service
Professor of Law and Ethics,

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.770
we are indeed honored
to have you in Berkeley

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.243
as our 2006-7 Foerster lecturer.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.920
We are eager to hear you speak

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.460
on equal Liberty of
Conscience, Roger Williams,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.250
and the roots of a
Constitutional tradition.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.610
So I have much pleasure in
welcoming Martha Nussbaum

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.071
to the podium, Martha.

00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:26.238
(audience applauding)

00:06:31.814 --> 00:06:33.510
- Well, thank you very much Tony,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.053
I really appreciate that.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.050
It's really great to be here,

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.020
the book that Tony mentioned
is a book in progress,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.910
of which you'll get a little sample.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.671
What I wanted to do, seeing
the climate of polarization

00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:53.160
and animosity over issues
of the relationship

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.200
between religion and the public good

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.810
was to try to write
something that I think,

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.880
by tracing some of the philosophical

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.070
and historical foundations of
the constitutional tradition,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.510
we may be able to promote
some kind of stable consensus,

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.180
so at any rate that's the
aim of the book as a whole,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.880
and I'd be very glad to have questions

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.600
about how some of the things I'll say here

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.080
about the early tradition shed
light on contemporary issues

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.600
like the 10 Commandments and
the Pledge of Allegiance,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.890
and so forth.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.110
Okay, two quotations to begin with,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.230
the first is from Roger
Williams's major book

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.463
The Bloody Tenant of Persecution, 1644;

00:07:32.463 --> 00:07:35.330
sixthly it is the will and command of God

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.170
that since the coming of
His Son, the Lord Jesus,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.840
a permission of the most
Paganish, Jewish, Turkish,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.770
or anti-Christian consciences and worships

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.393
be granted to all men in
all nations and countries.

00:07:49.393 --> 00:07:51.830
And the second is a letter
that Roger Williams wrote

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.070
to the governors of
Massachusetts and Connecticut

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.270
who did not extend liberty of conscience

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.430
to all those other groups;

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.600
yourselves pretend liberty of conscience,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.320
but alas, it is but
self, the great God self,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.183
only to yourselves.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.770
Life was tough for the settlers
of 17th Century New England,

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.170
they responded to hardship
by trying to gain God's favor

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.450
for their new colony, which
required, as they saw it,

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.300
establishing and sternly
enforcing a religious orthodoxy.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.810
By punishing or banishing
those who disobeyed

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.160
in word or deed, they
hoped to cast impurity

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.960
from their common life.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.120
The idea that a good
community would be one

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.470
that allowed all people to
seek God in their own way

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.100
took root only gradually
and with great struggle.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.110
This lecture traces that
struggle focusing on the life

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.940
and ideas of one of the
century's great apostles

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.750
of religious liberty and
fairness, Roger Williams,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.750
founder of the colony of Rhode Island

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.860
and seminal philosophical writer

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.800
about the persecuted conscience.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.410
American writings about religious liberty

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.530
were in conversation with
similar work in Britain,

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.300
and there are striking similarities

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.640
between the arguments used

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.380
in Williams's two most influential books

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.670
published in 1644 and 1652,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.680
and those used more famously
and later by John Locke.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.410
Nonetheless, the American tradition

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.790
has some distinctive features

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.260
that ultimately proved valuable in forging

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.550
our constitutional heritage.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.480
The American tradition I wanna recover

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.970
contains first an emphasis
on the tremendous importance

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.800
of a mutually respectful civil peace

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.870
among people who differ in
conscientious commitment.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.920
The vulnerability of all Americans

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.540
in the perilous new world they had chosen

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.220
led to a recognition which
came much slower in Europe,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.810
if indeed it has come at all,

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.330
that people with different views

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.610
of life's ultimate meaning and purpose

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.740
really need to learn to live together

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.750
on terms of equal respect, if
they were to survive at all.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.890
Roger Williams dramatizes
this idea from the start

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.900
by making his work a
dialogue between two friends

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.510
called Truth and Peace, in
which Truth acknowledges

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.290
the deep importance of
reaching accommodation

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.640
with people whom one
believes to be in error.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.490
The second distinctive feature
of the American tradition

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.000
is a personal and highly emotional sense

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.490
of the precariousness
and the vulnerability

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.910
of each individual person's conscience,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.850
that seat of imagination,
emotion, thought,

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.580
and moral choice through
which each person seeks

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.250
for meaning in his or her own way.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.940
The experience of both solitude and space

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.120
that the wild world conveyed
to its new inhabitants

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.920
brought with it a picture of human life

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.320
as a risky and lonely quest.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.310
This idea in turn led to the
thought that this search,

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.460
this striving of conscience,
is what is most precious

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.630
about the journey of human
life, and that each person,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.150
Protestant, Catholic,
Jew, Muslim, or Pagan,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.350
must be permitted to conduct
it in his or her own way

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.680
without interference either from the state

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.040
or from orthodox religion.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.540
To impose an orthodoxy upon the conscience

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.400
is nothing less than what Williams,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.753
in a memorable and repeated
image, calls soul rape.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.940
Third, and perhaps most important

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.630
for the overall argument I'm
trying to make in this book,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.620
Williams grounds his
views of church and state

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.930
in an idea of fairness and impartiality

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.360
of equal respect for conscience.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.360
In my larger project
I argue that this idea

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.060
links the Free Exercise Clause
to the Establishment Clause,

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.240
and provides very good guidance

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.523
as we confront difficult
contemporary issues.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.470
So first, section one,
the wild and howling land.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.750
Life in New England was
fragile and exposed;

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.950
if people did not die on
the voyage to the new land,

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.910
they knew well that they
might die shortly in it,

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.780
whether from starvation, disease, or cold,

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.270
or at the hands of the native inhabitants

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.680
whose claims to the land
they utterly ignored.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.800
On the dubious authority of a land claim

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.300
made by James I they grasped for security,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.280
alleging that the land was their own

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.530
because Englishmen first discovered it,

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.807
something that Roger
Williams called, quote,

00:12:15.807 --> 00:12:18.760
"a solemn public lie," end quote.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.167
He added the sarcastic comment, quote,

00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:24.777
"Christian kings, so-called,
are invested with right

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:28.357
"by virtue of their Christianity
to take and give away

00:12:28.357 --> 00:12:31.963
"the lands and countries
of other men," end quote.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.700
The world around them really was alarming;

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.970
the wind, the seas, the
forests, the deep snows,

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.810
all of this was strange to people

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.410
accustomed to life in England,
whether urban or rural.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.540
Quote, "but oh poor dust and ashes,"

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.087
Roger Williams wrote of
himself and his fellows,

00:12:50.087 --> 00:12:53.167
"like stones once rolling down the Alps,

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:56.967
"like the Indian canoes or
English boats loose and adrift.

00:12:56.967 --> 00:13:01.330
"Where stop we until
infinite mercy stop us?"

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.140
In his remarkable book Key
to the Languages of America,

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.470
a study of the Indian tribes,
their life and languages,

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.270
written during a sea voyage
back to England in 1643,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.490
Williams ponders the
Indians' ability to coexist

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.080
with impermanence and
constant vulnerability

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.200
in what he calls this
wild and howling land.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.480
Astonishingly, the Indians
don't mind picking up

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.290
and moving on to a new place
whenever climate, or insects,

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.840
or sheer inclination moves them.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.317
Quote, "I once in travel lodged at a house

00:13:36.317 --> 00:13:39.177
"at which in my return I hoped
to have lodged again there

00:13:39.177 --> 00:13:42.587
"the next night, but the
house was gone in the interim,

00:13:42.587 --> 00:13:45.920
"and I was glad to lodge
under a tree," end quote.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.590
This sense of life as transient,
as requiring reinvention

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.140
at each moment deeply shaped
the new American's culture

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.743
and ultimately their
religious sensibilities.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.880
The Indians may have made
their peace with transience;

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.380
the Puritans, used to a very different

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.040
sort of life, resisted.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.640
To keep the world at bay
they found it prudent

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.150
to enforce orthodoxy of religious belief,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.550
expression, and practice,
suppressing dissent.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.200
John Cotton, 1595 to 1652,

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.490
pastor of the First Church of Boston,

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.880
one of Massachusetts' most
influential religious leaders,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.420
and Roger Williams's life-long
intellectual adversary,

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.430
wrote copiously in defense
of religious persecution,

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.330
arguing that it was
necessary for civil order.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.130
It was also God's will, he
said, in order to separate

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.870
the diseased element of society
from the healthy element.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.110
As he and Williams wrangled endlessly

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.500
about whether people diverse
in faith and way of life

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.840
could coexist peacefully in civil society,

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.970
Cotton maintained again and again

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.260
that the wholesome parts of a community

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.270
cannot but be corrupted by
the presence of heretics

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.440
and dissentients unless those people

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.600
are brought to judgment, punished,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.593
and if they don't repent, banished.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.680
Sometimes the desire to keep sin at bay

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.570
did not content itself with
persecution and banishment.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.730
Witch trials, as you all know, were common

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.600
in both Massachusetts and Connecticut,

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.070
and John Demos's research shows

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.710
that the most common so-called
victim of the witches

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.210
was not actually the famous teenage girls,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.790
but instead, much more
commonly a young adult male

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.540
of the verge of responsible adulthood.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.370
Demos concludes that
heightened vulnerability

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.460
and uncertainty about
whether one would be able

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.980
to make a life at all led to
the desire to demonize others.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.070
Such reactions to insecurity
are sadly familiar

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.020
throughout America's history.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.770
Arthur Miller was quite right
to connect the witch trials

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.150
to witch hunting of leftists
in the McCarthy era.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.620
Today we're told by our
leaders that we're living

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.610
in another time of heightened
vulnerability, a time,

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.870
a couple of nights ago we were
told that civilization itself

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.240
is actually at stake.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.990
In this situation it's all
too easy to let the longing

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.870
for homogeneity and control ride roughshod

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.100
over the spirit of fairness and respect,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:18.020
projecting the causes of
instability onto other people,

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.160
grabbing hold of Cotton's
seductive metaphor

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.310
of a stain or taint in our
midst that must be removed

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.260
if we are to resist destruction.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.420
There are, however, other ways
of living in difficult times.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.860
What makes Roger Williams
of particular interest

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.100
is not just the quality
of his philosophical work,

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.050
which is high, it is also
the way in which he offers

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.290
an alternative to the paranoid
response to uncertainty,

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.000
urging on his readers'
attitudes of fairness,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.180
reasonableness, and
civility, words which recur

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.830
with obsessive frequency

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.790
throughout the two
philosophical dialogues,

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.810
totaling about some-1,000 pages

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.253
which constitute his major works.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.340
Section two, to ship myself
all alone in a poor canoe,

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.943
Williams's Rhode Island.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.420
Williams is typically remembered

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.700
as a religious and political
leader rather than a thinker.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.920
If his ideas are recalled at all,

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.180
he's identified with one
uncharacteristic phrase

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.010
he used once in a
letter, namely the phrase

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.010
the wall of separation
between church and state,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.180
rather than for the careful
and extensive arguments

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.460
about the evils of persecution,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.343
the primacy of the individual conscience,

00:17:30.343 --> 00:17:33.410
and the jurisdictions proper to the civil

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.140
and the religious fears.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.600
His ideas are rarely set out with care,

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.180
and the relationship of those
ideas to those of more famous

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.800
17th century philosophers,
Locke in particular,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.440
is rarely appreciated,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.070
although in fact his important
writings of the 1640s

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.280
anticipate Locke's letter
concerning toleration, 1689,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.640
in every major point.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.920
But since Williams was a
leader as well as a thinker,

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.750
and since his work needs to be assessed

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.270
in the context of his life and career,

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.200
we first should recount his story.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.720
Williams was born in
England probably in 1603

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.840
to a prosperous merchant family.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.330
He grew up in London
near the Smithfield plain

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.510
where religious dissenters

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.170
were sometimes burnt at the stake.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.150
As a young man he attracted the attention

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.450
of the distinguished lawyer,
who I should say also

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.820
was steeped in stoic
natural law arguments,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.740
so this is the intellectual
background, Sir Edward Coke,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.270
Chief Justice of the king's bench.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.180
Coke arranged for the
young man's education

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.770
at Sutton's hospital, the
future Charterhouse School,

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.240
and then at Pembroke Hall
in Cambridge University

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.910
where Williams received his A.B. in 1627

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.410
after a classical education that focused

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.560
on natural law theories,
deriving from ancient Greek

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.270
and Roman stoicism, which
diffused Coke's work

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.670
and which were much en vogue at the time.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.580
Williams quickly impressed
by his remarkable flair

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.710
for languages, mastering
Latin, Greek, Hebrew,

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.170
French, and Dutch.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.760
In this way he made the
friendship of John Milton;

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.440
he taught Milton Dutch
in exchange for receiving

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.010
Hebrew lessons.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.760
On graduation, Williams took
orders in the Church of England

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.120
and in 1629 accepted the post of Chaplain

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.930
at Otes in Essex, the manor
house of Sir William Masham,

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.250
grandfather of the Sir Francis Masham

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.360
who was Locke's host at Otes in the 1690s.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.500
In 1630 a leading Puritan reformer

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.570
was placed in the pillory.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.650
One of his ears was cut off,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.130
one side of his nose was split,

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.480
and he was branded on the
face with the letters SS

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.540
for sower of sedition.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.420
Later the other side of his nose was split

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.470
and his other ear was cut off.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.300
For good measure the
man was then in prison

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.990
for the rest of his life.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.700
Williams, who witnessed these events,

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.870
and who was already very critical
of the Anglican orthodoxy,

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.280
decided that he could not live

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.600
the religious life he wanted in England;

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.060
he set sail for Massachusetts.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.190
At first Williams was warmly welcomed

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.940
by the leaders of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony;

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.340
although in Boston his views
about the individual conscience

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.580
were found too radical, he was welcomed

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.730
by the congregation at Salem.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.560
He expressed his religious ideas freely,

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.820
at the same time he published a pamphlet

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.420
attacking the colonists' claims
to the Indians' property.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.490
The officials of Massachusetts
Bay called him into court

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.470
but took no action when Williams agreed

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.180
to withdraw the pamphlet from circulation.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.800
He continued, however,
to teach the falsity

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.880
of the colonists' property claim,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.570
he also urged resistance to
a proposed oath of loyalty

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.930
to be taken by all colonists.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.880
During this period Williams
spent some peaceful months

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.010
at Plymouth, where he pursued his study

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.410
of Indian life and languages.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:52.280
By 1635-6, authorities
saw that Williams was bent

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.600
on continuing his divisive teaching;

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.540
they ordered him to be arrested.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.770
Tipped off in advance he fled.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:02.200
Looking back on the incident
from Providence in 1670

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.567
he describes it this way;

00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:08.337
"I was unkindly and
un-Christianly, as I believe,

00:21:08.337 --> 00:21:12.497
"drive from my house and land,
and my wife and children,

00:21:12.497 --> 00:21:14.227
"in the midst of New England winter.

00:21:14.227 --> 00:21:19.227
"Now about 35 years past, I
steered my course from Salem,

00:21:19.297 --> 00:21:23.617
"though in winter snow which
I feel yet, until these parts,

00:21:23.617 --> 00:21:27.557
"where I may say as
Jacob, Penial, that is,

00:21:27.557 --> 00:21:29.870
"I have seen the face of God."

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.280
So begins the story of Rhode Island;

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.470
in keeping with his sense
of divine deliverance

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.313
Williams named the new colony Providence.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.580
The key part of the life
of that new settlement

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.990
was respectful friendship
with the Indians.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.290
Williams had always treated
them as human beings,

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.820
not beasts or devils, he
respected their dignity.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.990
When the great Narragansett
chief Canonicus,

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.620
who spoke no English,
broke a stick 10 times

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.490
to demonstrate 10 instances
of broken English promises,

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.110
Williams understood his
meaning and took his part.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.930
When the colonists objected

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.020
that the Indians couldn't own land

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.950
because they were nomadic,
Williams described

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.540
their regular seasonal hunting practices,

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.810
arguing that these
practices were sufficient

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.670
to establish property claims,

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.890
a legal argument that
strikingly anticipates

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.580
very recent litigation over
aboriginal land in Australia.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.870
Linguist that he was, he
reports having at this period,

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.277
quote, "a constant zealous desire

00:22:28.277 --> 00:22:30.920
"to dive into the Natives' language,"

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.120
and he learned several of the languages

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.860
by actually living with the Indians

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.647
for long periods of time.

00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:39.047
"God was pleased," he says,
"to give me a painful,

00:22:39.047 --> 00:22:42.557
"patient spirit to lodge with
them in their smoky holes

00:22:42.557 --> 00:22:44.577
"to gain their tongues, et cetera."

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.610
When Williams arrived as a refugee then,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.040
his dealings with the Indians
had long prepared the way

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.380
for a fruitful relationship.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.290
Chiefs Massasoit and
Canonicus welcomed him

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.630
like an old friend
because he had befriended

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.230
them before he needed them,

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.810
and had given them lots
of gifts for many years.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.150
He was already known as
a good public debater

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.527
in the Native languages,
and therefore, quote,

00:23:07.527 --> 00:23:10.890
"held with them as a sachem," end quote.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.530
One of the key provisions of
the charter of Rhode Island

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.387
was, quote, "it shall not be lawful

00:23:16.387 --> 00:23:18.857
"to or for the rest of the colonies

00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:22.320
"to invade or molest the
Native Indians," end quote,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.150
a provision that Williams
particularly sought from the king,

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.930
and when granted, applauded,

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.267
noting that hostility
to the Indians, quote,

00:23:29.267 --> 00:23:31.997
"hath hither to been
practiced to our continual

00:23:31.997 --> 00:23:35.140
"and great grievance and
disturbance," end quote.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.060
Throughout his life, Williams
continued these friendships.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.810
As he wrote to the governor
of Massachusetts Bay

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.960
explaining why he refused
to return to Massachusetts,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.960
quote, "I feel safer down here
among the Christian savages

00:23:48.997 --> 00:23:53.357
"along Narraganset Bay than I
do among the savage Christians

00:23:53.357 --> 00:23:55.170
"of Massachusetts Bay."

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:57.820
And that didn't mean that
they had been converted,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.470
he never tried to convert the Indians,

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:02.420
he just meant that their
behavior exemplified

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.810
the Christian spirit more truly

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.590
than the behavior of the
people in Massachusetts.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:11.230
He's very fond of noting
examples of Indian decency

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.890
and honesty, and contrasting this behavior

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.970
with that of the other
neighbors in Massachusetts

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:18.923
and Connecticut.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.520
Williams's experience
of finding integrity,

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.070
dignity, and goodness outside
the parameters of orthodoxy

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.100
surely shaped his evolving
views of conscience,

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.910
but there was already something
antinomian about Williams,

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.590
something that led him
to those friendships

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.310
in the first place; a respectful curiosity

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.570
about the varieties of humanity

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:46.370
that's the paradigm of something
that played a good role

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.670
in the history of the American colonies

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.900
as a nation of strangers and immigrants.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.800
Williams immediately provided
for religious liberty

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.110
in the new colony.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.607
The majority would make
policy, but, quote,

00:24:58.607 --> 00:25:01.380
"only in civil things," end quote.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.580
Broad liberty of conscience
was officially guaranteed.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.830
Rhode Island rapidly became a haven

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.660
for people who were in
trouble in other places.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.390
Other settlements were
founded; Baptists, Quakers,

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.580
and other dissidents joined
the Puritan dissenters.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:21.580
In 1658 15 Portuguese-Jewish
families arrived in Newport.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.690
Although the Touro Synagogue,

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.500
America's oldest
surviving Jewish synagogue

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.820
and its first Sephardic synagogue,

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.870
was not dedicated until 1763,

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.970
Jews enjoyed the same religious
liberty granted to others,

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.070
a fact that's rather astonishing

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.680
when we note that Jews in Britain

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.260
gained full civil rights only in 1858.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.200
In 1643 Williams set sail for England

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.690
to secure a formal charter
for the new colony.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.320
During the voyage he wrote his book

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.030
about the Indian languages.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.260
While in England he wrote and published

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.620
The Bloody Tenant of Persecution.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.340
A democratic charter was obtained,

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.080
and the colony proclaimed
liberty of conscience.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.360
In 1652 Rhode Island passed
the first law in North America

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.710
making slavery illegal.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.630
By this time Williams had been won over

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.640
by the Baptists' arguments
in favor of adult baptism.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.730
He was re-baptized in
1639, and from that time on

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.230
he referred to himself simply as a seeker.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:24.370
Meanwhile John Cotton's angry
reply to The Bloody Tenant,

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:28.650
published in 1647, led Williams
to produce another work

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.210
about 100 pages longer than the first one,

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.510
refuting all of Cotton's arguments.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.620
Published in 1652 in London during another

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.360
of Williams's visits to England,

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.750
it bears the unwieldy title,

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.490
The Bloody Tenant Yet More Bloody:

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:46.070
By Mr. Cotton's Endeavor to Wash it White

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.610
in the Blood of the Lambe

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.210
of Whose Precious Blood Split
in the Blood of His Servants,

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.800
and of the Blood of Millions
Split in Former and Later Wars

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.470
for Conscience Sake, That Most
Bloody Tenant of Persecution

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.450
for Cause of Conscience,
Upon a Second Trial,

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.899
is Found Now More Apparently
and More Notoriously Guilty.

00:27:05.899 --> 00:27:08.170
(audience laughing)

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.590
You see why philosophers really
can't cope with this man,

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.583
he's a very, very prolix writer.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.910
The civil wars and the
restoration made it necessary

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.910
to renegotiate the charter.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.230
Williams again went to England
and found in Charles II

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.460
a ready ally for his experiment
in religious liberty.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.490
Williams notes that the
Barbados already permitted

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.750
religious liberty by omission and policy

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.710
rather than by explicit royal guarantee.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:40.067
Quote, "but our grant is
crowned with the king's

00:27:40.067 --> 00:27:42.647
"extraordinary favor to this colony

00:27:42.647 --> 00:27:45.047
"in which His Majesty declared himself

00:27:45.047 --> 00:27:46.557
"that he would experiment

00:27:46.557 --> 00:27:48.487
"whether civil government could consist

00:27:48.487 --> 00:27:50.770
"with such liberty of conscience."

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.430
With amusement he describes
the shocked reaction

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.040
of the king's ministers when they read

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.800
the unorthodox document.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.617
Quote, "but fearing the lion's roaring

00:27:59.617 --> 00:28:02.247
"they couched against
their wills in obedience

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:05.050
"to His Majesty's pleasure," end quote.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.470
The charter was shocking indeed,

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.260
not only in its odd provision
regarding the Indians,

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.200
but above all in its clause
regarding religious liberty,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.400
which goes like this; no
person within the said colony

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.300
at any time hereafter shall
be anywise molested, punished,

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.610
disquieted, or called in question

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.920
for any differences in opinion
in matters of religion,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.030
and he do not actually
disturb the civil peace

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:33.960
of said colony, but that all
and every person and persons

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.040
may from time to time, and
at all times hereafter,

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.660
freely and fully have and enjoy

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.540
his and their own
judgements and consciences

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.303
in matters of religious concernments

00:28:44.303 --> 00:28:47.550
throughout the tract of
land hereafter mentioned,

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.060
they behaving themselves
peaceably and quietly,

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.000
and not using this liberty
to lie sententiousness

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.690
or profaneness, nor to the civil injury

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.010
or outward disturbance of others.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:02.080
Any law, statute, or
clause therein contained,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.410
or to be contained, usage
or custom of this realm

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:10.443
to the contrary hereof in
anywise, notwithstanding.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.000
Okay, what does this clause protect?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.910
Belief in the expression of opinion

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:18.600
in religious matters
clearly, but Williams,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.290
throughout his philosophical writings,

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.170
was very careful to insist
that acts of worship

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.220
should also enjoy protection.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.580
Indeed in his writings we
rarely encounter the word belief

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.090
without the word worship or practice.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.220
In the passage I just read
at the beginning of the talk,

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.600
taken from the introduction
to The Bloody Tenant,

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.910
consciences and worships
are all permitted.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.220
Elsewhere he uses phrases such as

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.360
for either professing doctrine
or practicing worship,

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.310
doctrine or practice,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.700
It's a bit unfortunate that
the charter is less precise,

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.270
but we can understand the
latitude of its protection

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.750
from the other direction as stopping

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.050
where civil disturbance

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:01.270
and violation of the
rights of others begins.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.310
Williams was no John Steward Mill;

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.240
he thought that the
business of civil government

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.440
included not only
protection of individuals

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.530
from harm to their rights by others,

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:13.000
but also the maintenance of
public order and morality.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.460
Thus, like virtually
everyone at this time,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.770
he favored laws against adultery

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.010
and other so-called moral offenses,

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.890
not, however, on religious grounds.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.190
His conception of public
morality, as we'll see later,

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.540
keeps it quite distinct

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.913
from religious norms and justifications.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.620
The final provision in the
clause is especially interesting.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.077
The charter guarantees
liberty of religious belief

00:30:38.077 --> 00:30:41.910
and practice even when a law or custom

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.530
already on the books forbids it.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.440
In other words, if the law says

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.390
you have to swear an oath before God

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:52.670
to hold public office, this law
is nullified by the charter.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.140
Moreover, it appears that
the charter nullifies

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.070
the applicability of laws to individuals

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:02.120
whenever such laws threaten
their religious liberty.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.190
If a law says that people
have to testify in court

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.910
on a Saturday and your
religion forbids this,

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.990
then that law is
non-applicable in your case.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:15.300
In other words it would appear
that Williams is forging

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.360
the legal concept of accommodation,

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.130
which soon became very widely
accepted in the colonies.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.980
Laws of general applicability have force

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.660
only up to the point where they
threaten religious liberty,

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.483
just so long as public order
and safety are not at stake.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.220
This was not mere talk; Williams
was notoriously skeptical

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.910
about Sunday as the
chosen day for no work,

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.970
he had considerable sympathy
with the theological arguments

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.950
of the Seventh Day Baptists.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.950
More generally he saw the burden

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.340
that comes with imposing a
majority practice on everyone;

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:54.163
Rhode Island had no Sunday
law during his lifetime.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.020
Section three, this conscience
is found in all mankind,

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.110
Williams's defense of religious liberty.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.130
Behind this impressive
political achievement

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.360
is a body of thought
as rich on these issues

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.610
as that of Locke, and
considerably more perceptive,

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:14.000
concerning the psychology of
both persecutor and victim.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.810
At its heart is an idea or
image on which Williams focused,

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.550
with deep emotion and obsessional zeal,

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.040
the idea of the preciousness and dignity

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.630
of the individual human conscience.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.370
Williams defines
conscience as wholly light,

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.247
and as, quote, "a
persuasion fixed in the mind

00:32:31.247 --> 00:32:34.267
"and heart of a man which
enforceth him to judge

00:32:34.267 --> 00:32:37.277
"and to do so and so with respect to God,

00:32:37.277 --> 00:32:39.240
"his worship, et cetera."

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.453
It is, he says, quote,
"indeed the man," end quote.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.210
Williams has his own very
intense religious beliefs,

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.840
and these beliefs entail
that most people around him

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.490
are in error; error,
however, does not mean

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.880
that they do not have the
precious faculty of conscience.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.457
This conscience, he writes,
"is found in all mankind;

00:33:01.457 --> 00:33:05.587
"in Jews, Turks, Papists,
Protestants, Pagans,

00:33:05.587 --> 00:33:07.110
"et cetera," end quote.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.090
And even though one thing that's precious

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.570
about the conscience is
its ability ultimately

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.400
to find the truth, that's
not what Williams emphasizes,

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.580
what he reveres as the committed search,

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.220
the sincere quest for meaning.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.647
Quote, "I commend that
man, whether Jew, or Turk,

00:33:23.647 --> 00:33:27.217
"or Papist, or whoever,
that steers no otherwise

00:33:27.217 --> 00:33:28.877
"than his conscience dares;

00:33:28.877 --> 00:33:30.677
"for neighbor, you shall find it rare

00:33:30.677 --> 00:33:33.130
"to meet with men of
conscience," end quote.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.210
One can't help thinking
of Williams's respect

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:39.130
for his Indian friends when
one reads passages like this.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.950
Furthermore, since he says
that men of conscience are rare

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.360
but the conscience itself is in everyone,

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.690
he clearly holds that the
precious faculty of conscience

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:51.580
exists even in less virtuous people,

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.430
and that all deserve basic human respect.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.390
So everyone has inside him or herself

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.130
something infinitely precious,

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.760
something that demands
respect from us all,

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.290
and something in regard to which
we are all basically equal.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.180
Williams now argues that
this precious something

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:14.620
needs space to unfold itself,
to pursue its own way.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.210
To respect human beings is
therefore to accord them

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.770
that sort of space, and to accord it

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:22.540
to each and every one of them.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.357
He expresses indignation
that someone, quote,

00:34:25.357 --> 00:34:28.287
"that speaks so tenderly for his own

00:34:28.287 --> 00:34:32.107
"hath yet so little
respect, mercy, or pity

00:34:32.107 --> 00:34:35.187
"to the like-conscientious
persuasions of other men.

00:34:35.187 --> 00:34:38.607
"Are the thousands of millions
of millions of consciences

00:34:38.607 --> 00:34:43.607
"at home and abroad fuel only
for a prison, for a whip,

00:34:43.767 --> 00:34:45.877
"for a stake, for a gallows?

00:34:45.877 --> 00:34:48.077
"Are no consciences to breathe the air

00:34:48.077 --> 00:34:51.950
"but such as suit and
sample his?" end quote.

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:53.900
These images are revealing;

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.070
they tell us that Williams
thinks of consciences

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:59.420
as delicate, vulnerable living things,

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.570
things that need to breathe the air

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.400
and not to be imprisoned.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.570
There are so many of them in
prison all over the world,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:10.270
but all alike should have breathing space.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.430
Williams has the very keen
sensitivity to any damage

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.940
to this precious thing,
comparing persecution repeatedly

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.920
to spiritual and soul rape.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.190
And it is soul rape, he says,
when any person is limited

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.620
with respect to either belief or practice,

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.060
so long as he is not harming others

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.120
or violating other civil
laws duly constituted.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.327
Quote, "I acknowledge
that to molest any person,

00:35:35.327 --> 00:35:38.297
"Jew or gentile, for
either professing doctrine

00:35:38.297 --> 00:35:41.687
"or practicing worship,
merely religious or spiritual,

00:35:41.687 --> 00:35:43.247
"it is to persecute him.

00:35:43.247 --> 00:35:46.237
"And such a person, whatever
his doctrine or practice

00:35:46.237 --> 00:35:50.487
"be true or false, suffereth
persecution for conscience.

00:35:50.487 --> 00:35:53.730
"This persecution is
therefore a terrible error."

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.770
Williams explicitly says
that it is a worse thing

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.850
than being a heretic, indeed, he goes on,

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.807
persecution is a doctrine, quote,

00:36:01.807 --> 00:36:06.237
"which no uncleanness, no
adultery, incest, sodomy,

00:36:06.237 --> 00:36:08.617
"or bestiality can equal.

00:36:08.617 --> 00:36:12.477
"This ravishing enforcing,
explicitly or implicitly,

00:36:12.477 --> 00:36:16.227
"the very souls and
consciences of all the nations

00:36:16.227 --> 00:36:18.327
"and inhabitants of the world," end quote.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.880
Williams doesn't believe that the offenses

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.130
to which he compares
persecution are trivial;

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.860
indeed, he's rather inclined

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.240
to favor the death penalty for adultery,

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.390
so we can see how strong his
objection to persecution is,

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:33.930
if it's worse than these things.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.500
Most rulers in all ages, he concludes

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.020
after very copious historical surveys,

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.600
have practiced violence
to the souls of men.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.530
Conscience then is not
invulnerable to worldly conditions;

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.410
it can be in prison that is prevented

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:52.260
from carrying out its search in action,

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.220
and it can even be raped,
that is damaged or defiled.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.230
One of Williams's reasons
for abhorring persecution

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.740
is instrumental; if you force someone

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.260
it hardens their
opposition, thus preventing

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.350
their voluntary conversion,
hence their salvation.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:11.560
He makes this point repeatedly
in that homonym argument

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.500
with John Cotton, and it was
a common Protestant argument

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.360
in the period, one that
Locke later makes central

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.150
to his own case for toleration.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:22.810
But Williams makes much
less of this argument

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:26.250
than does Locke, and one can't
really read Williams's text

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.680
and doubt that Williams also
thinks damage to conscience

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.110
an intrinsic wrong, a desecration
of what is most precious

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.180
about a human life.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:39.190
Moreover, he insists repeatedly
that this precious something

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:44.190
is worthy of equal respect,
and is equally in us all,

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:48.650
therefore, it's a heinous wrong
to give it freedom for some

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:51.010
and to deny the same freedom to others.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.840
Again and again he hammers home

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.270
the charge of partiality and unfairness;

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.660
magistrates, he says, give liberty

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.920
with a partial hand
and an unequal balance.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.237
How, quote, "will this appear to be equal

00:38:04.237 --> 00:38:07.940
"in the very eye of common
peace and righteousness?"

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.530
His own marginal
summaries of his argument,

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.320
particularly in the later book,

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.900
keep recurring to this
theme saying things like

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.050
unchristian partiality, gross partiality

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:21.420
to private interests, or gross partiality,

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.230
the bloody doctrine of persecution.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.820
Williams as a keen nose for
special pleading and unfairness,

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.820
and he sees it everywhere restrictions

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.580
on religious liberty are found.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.430
He suggests that the
error of the persecutor

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:37.390
is a kind of anxiety-ridden greed,

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:40.570
which is hypocritically
disguised as virtue.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.150
Each person, anxious and insecure,

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.080
aims to carve out special
protections and privileges

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.600
for himself by attacking in others

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.330
what he most values in his own life.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.250
In his letter to the
governors of Massachusetts

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.940
and Connecticut, which I read earlier,

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.860
he indicts them for a hypocritical

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.670
and unfair set of principles,

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:02.660
for worshiping, in effect,
only the great God's self.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.780
If persecution is the worst of errors,

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.940
liberty of conscience is, as
Williams repeatedly states,

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.500
a most precious and invaluable jewel.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.530
The proponent of liberty, he goes on,

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:15.790
does not indulge in special pleading,

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.650
even though he believes that he's right

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:19.620
he doesn't puff himself up,

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.040
for he knows how difficult his quest is.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.140
He remembers God's mercy to him

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.520
and he has mercy on those whom
he believes to be in error.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.420
He also has an even-handed,

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.780
fair-minded spirit of love
and civility to all men,

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.313
a civility that includes
respect for their freedom.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.840
In one remarkable passage Williams writes

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.627
that persecution is not only, quote,

00:39:43.627 --> 00:39:47.247
"to take the being of
Christianity out of the world,

00:39:47.247 --> 00:39:50.087
"but to take away all civility

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:53.687
"and the world out of the world,

00:39:53.687 --> 00:39:57.880
"and to lay all upon heaps
of confusion," end quote.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.630
What does he mean by
saying that persecution

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.750
takes the world out of the world?

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.850
I think he's expressing the view

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:08.070
that the spirit of love and gentleness

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:10.250
combined with a spirit of fair play

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.910
are at the heart of our
worldly lives with one another.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.430
Take these things away and
you despoil the world itself,

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.763
you make it nothing but
a heap of confusion.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.530
Williams is an emotional writer,

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.230
his sense of his own religion

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.920
is deeply subjective and passionate;

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.830
nonetheless it's not
implausible to compare

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:33.080
his core ideas to those that will animate

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.170
the philosophy of Comte a century later.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:39.250
I should add that both
owe debt to the stoics,

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:42.371
which has gotta be a
topic for another time.

00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:45.680
At the heart at the thought
of both men are two ideas;

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.870
the duty to respect humanity as an end

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:51.020
wherever we find it,
and the duty to be fair,

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.750
not to make an exception
for one's own case.

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.430
Comte's categorical
imperative asks each person

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.790
to test the principle
of his or her conduct

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.340
by asking whether it could,
without contradiction,

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.160
be made a universal law
for all human beings.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.720
This test will show us whether
we've been selfishly partial

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.380
to our own case.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.740
Williams's critique of the
leaders of Massachusetts

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.500
and Connecticut is that their
ideas can't pass Comte's test;

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.000
they love freedom, but
only for themselves.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.100
They could not will
persecution as a universal law,

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.910
and their selfishness prevents them

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.980
from willing freedom of conscience,

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.843
which could pass the Comtean
test, as a universal law.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.220
Comte's second test is of
course the formula of humanity

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.350
asking us to test our principle

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:39.410
by seeing whether it
treats humanity as an end,

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:42.150
we are to ask whether we're
really showing respect

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.630
to the dignity of human beings

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:46.380
or whether we're just
using them as objects

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.040
in the pursuit of our own selfish ends.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.300
This complaint too is a constant theme

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.690
in Williams's writing; the
conscience is precious,

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.980
but people use other people's consciences

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.270
to serve their own
anxious and greedy ends.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.140
Comte's third way of testing principles

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.430
invokes the idea of autonomy,

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.110
we're to ask ourselves whether
we can view our principle

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.960
as a law that we could give to ourselves.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.050
There's no precise echo of
this part of Comte in Williams,

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:16.240
but his insistence on
the deeply personal quest

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.810
of the individual conscience,

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.290
and the priceless value
of freedom in this quest,

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:24.130
is in great sympathy with
Comte's way of thinking.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.530
For both, the source of moral principles

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:30.090
and of all moral worth is
ultimately in our own freedom,

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.100
and that freedom must be respected;

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.750
for both, doing the right thing

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.940
because of obedience to a
law imposed from outside

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.500
has no moral worth at all.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.720
Finally, Comte speaks of good principles

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.700
as constituting a realm of ends,

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.920
a virtual society of free beings

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.680
who each respect one another as equals.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.810
I believe that this idea is very much

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.120
what Williams is after when he says

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.890
that persecution takes the
world out of the world,

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.480
it destroys the basis of human fellowship

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.173
in respect, freedom, and civility.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.790
Williams then lies at the beginning

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.350
of a distinctive tradition of thought

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:11.090
about religious fairness that
resonates to the present day,

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.440
in John Rawls's distinguished work

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.260
on liberty and equal respect.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.550
Compared to both Comte and Rawls

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.760
Williams has an extra measure
of psychological insight

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.670
helping us see why
persecution is so attractive,

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:27.230
and what emotional
attitudes might be required

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.073
to resist it.

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:33.710
Section four, a model of
church and civil power.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.410
If Williams had offered only
an account of conscience

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.150
and its fair impartial treatment,

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.400
he would already have
made a large contribution

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.070
to our understanding of religious liberty.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:45.380
He accomplished, however, much more,

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.340
developing an elaborate account
of the proper jurisdictions

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.260
of religious and civil authority

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.510
that anticipates Locke's
more famous account

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.010
in every major point,

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:57.610
and that still offers helpful guidance.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.250
In this part of his work
Williams is replying

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:03.490
to a so-called model of church and state

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:05.600
proposed by John Cotton.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.290
Truth says to Peace, oh,
what book do you have there?

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.560
Peace produces Cotton's large book

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.770
and reads from it at great length

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:16.200
the claim that the church
must hold high authority

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.680
in the civil realm, and should be superior

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.430
to all civil magistrates if
peace is to be preserved.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:23.910
The 200 pages that follow

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:27.100
contain Williams's alternative model.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.710
According to Williams there
are two separate sets of ends

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:35.020
and activities in human life,
separate though related.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.600
Corresponding to these are
two utterly different sorts

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.450
of jurisdiction, two sorts of authority.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.900
Civil or a state authority concerns

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.400
the bodies and goods of subjects,

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.490
exactly the characterization
that Locke later gives.

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:53.160
Haven't been able to prove
whether Locke knew this work,

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.120
Quentin Skinner and
other Locke scholars are,

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.750
Locke never cites what he's read,

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.000
but the similarities are so great,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.940
and he was living in the same house

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.660
where Williams did his early work,

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.240
so it seems highly likely
that Locke is lifting

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.140
some of this from Williams.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.290
Civil authority must protect
people's entitlements

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.270
to property and bodily security,

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:17.030
and it may properly use force to do so.

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:18.730
The civil law applies to all

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:21.110
including members of the clergy.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.820
The foundation of civil
authority lies in the people,

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.640
and it is the people who
are entitled democratically

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.140
to choose civil magistrates.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:32.000
The other sphere of human
life is that of the soul

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.280
and its safety.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.970
Law and force have absolutely
no place in this sphere,

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.500
which must be governed by persuasion only.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.890
Churches and their officers have this fear

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:44.620
as their jurisdiction,
but with the proviso

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.320
that their only proper
means of addressing the soul

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.060
is persuasion.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.830
The two sorts of authority,
civil and spiritual,

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:54.190
can coexist peaceably together.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:56.910
Peace is in jeopardy only to the extent

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:58.950
that churches overstep their boundaries

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.570
and start making civil law,

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:02.820
or interfering with people's property,

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.263
livelihood, and liberty.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.450
Williams now tells us
that there is, of course,

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:08.870
a way in which the civil state

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.750
needs to make laws respecting religion;

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.460
namely it has to make laws protecting it,

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.247
saying for example,
quote, "that no persons,

00:46:17.247 --> 00:46:20.467
"Papists, Jews, Turks, or Indians

00:46:20.467 --> 00:46:22.407
"be disturbed at their worship,

00:46:22.407 --> 00:46:24.797
"a thing which the very Indians abhor

00:46:24.797 --> 00:46:27.380
"to practice toward any."

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.440
Such protective laws
are not only permitted,

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.777
they're extremely
important, and he calls them

00:46:31.777 --> 00:46:35.680
"the Magna Carta of the
highest liberties," end quote.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.480
But there is, he continues,
another type of law

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.640
respecting religion that's very different

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.980
from these protective laws; the
sort of law that establishes

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.070
or forbids acts of worship, says who can

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.570
or cannot be a minister, and so on.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:51.957
To say that these should
be civil laws, quote,

00:46:51.957 --> 00:46:55.147
"is as far from reason as the
that the commandments of Paul

00:46:55.147 --> 00:46:58.143
"were civil and earthly
constitutions," end quote.

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.010
John Cotton makes two claims
that Williams must answer

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.930
if he is to defend his
radical position well.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:08.700
First Cotton makes a claim
about peace and stability;

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.670
people simply can't live
at peace with one another

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.790
unless some religious
orthodoxy is established.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:17.410
In response, Williams invokes both reason

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:19.630
and experience on his side;

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.390
people with false
religious views, he says,

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.350
may be perfectly decent
and peaceable citizens.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.200
We can see this all the time,

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.850
people do live together peacefully

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:32.150
so long as they respect one
another's conscience space.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:34.500
Once again life with the Indians

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.700
provides a handy illustration.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.810
What really breaks the
peace is persecution;

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:42.797
quote, "such persons
only break the kingdom's

00:47:42.797 --> 00:47:46.547
"or city's peace who cry
out for prisons and swords

00:47:46.547 --> 00:47:48.307
"against such who cross their judgment

00:47:48.307 --> 00:47:50.017
"or practice in religion."

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.040
The other argument of Cotton's
on which Williams focuses

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.510
is an argument about competence.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.650
Cotton claims that being a good citizen

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:01.710
and being a good civil
magistrate are inseparable

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:03.880
from having the correct religion;

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.070
we simply don't want our public
life to be run by sinners

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:09.150
because they're making
very important decisions,

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:10.840
and if they're sinners they will do so

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.800
sinfully and badly.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.980
Here Williams makes one
of his most interesting,

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.490
and for the time, very novel, arguments.

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.720
God, he says, has created different sorts

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.603
of goodness in the world.

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:26.270
There are diverse sorts of goodness

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:28.730
corresponding to the
different sorts of things

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:30.210
that God has created.

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.920
He illustrates this point at great length

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.720
talking about the goodness of artifacts,

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.240
the goodness of plants, the
goodness of animals, and so on.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.410
But one of the ways God
created diversity in the world

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:45.790
was to create a type of, quote,
"civil or moral goodness,"

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.890
end quote, that is, quote,
"commendable and beautiful,"

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.120
end quote, in its own
right and that is distinct

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.840
from spiritual goodness.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.950
It can be there in its
full form and be beautiful

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:59.570
even if the person is in religious error.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.717
Even, quote, "though Godliness,

00:49:01.717 --> 00:49:05.490
"which is infinitely more
beautiful, be wonting," end quote.

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:08.290
What's needed to be a good
subject in a civil state

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.180
is the moral sort of goodness,

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.450
and it is that sort as well that we need

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.530
in our civil magistrates.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:16.410
Later returning to this point,

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:19.520
he insists that the foundation
of the magistrate's authority

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.667
quote, "is not religious,
Christian, et cetera,

00:49:22.667 --> 00:49:26.430
"but natural, humane,
and civil," end quote.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.480
For many activities in human life

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.260
a worldly foundation is sufficient.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.667
Quote, "a Christian
captain, Christian merchant,

00:49:34.667 --> 00:49:39.577
"physician, lawyer, pilot, father, master,

00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:43.197
"and so consequently
magistrate, et cetera,

00:49:43.197 --> 00:49:46.887
"is no more a captain,
merchant, physician,

00:49:46.887 --> 00:49:51.467
"lawyer, pilot, father,
master, magistrate, et cetera,

00:49:51.467 --> 00:49:53.977
"than a captain, merchant, et cetera

00:49:53.977 --> 00:49:57.000
"of any other conscience
or religion," end quote.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.010
Particularly surprising, I think,

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.100
is his causal mention of father

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.570
as one of those roles whose
duties can be faithfully

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.300
and completely fulfilled independently

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.460
of spiritual enlightenment.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.910
In short, for Williams the civil state

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:14.670
has a moral foundation,
but a moral foundation

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:19.670
need not be, and for reasons
of fairness to all must not be,

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.180
a religious foundation.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.170
The necessary moral virtues,

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:28.100
honesty is one to which Williams
devotes special attention,

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.170
can be agreed on in practice by people

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.050
from many different doctrines.

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:34.250
To be sure, he adds, a person's religion

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.690
will connect these moral
virtues to religious ends,

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:40.490
but so far as the moral
sphere itself goes,

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:43.620
orthodox and dissenter,
religious and non-religious,

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.510
can all agree.

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:48.830
It's not fanciful to
see here an adumbration

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:51.510
of John Rawls's idea of civil society

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.980
as involving a set of what Rawls calls

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:57.490
freestanding moral
principles concerning which

00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:00.030
people from different
comprehensive doctrines

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:04.350
can join in what Rawls calls
an overlapping consensus.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:06.270
Like Williams, Rawls stresses

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:09.090
that political society
has a moral foundation,

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:12.170
but he holds that this is a module

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.670
that can be linked to
different religious doctrines,

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:18.410
or non-religious doctrines, in
a variety of different ways.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.750
Although religious people
will certainly feel

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:23.260
that their religion provides
the moral principles

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.910
with their highest ends
or deepest sources,

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.200
here again he agrees with Williams,

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.580
they can nonetheless agree
about the moral terrain

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:34.220
in a way that is, for practical
purposes, freestanding,

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.330
that is, not requiring the acceptance

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:40.540
of any particular religious
orthodoxy for its justification.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:44.300
So we don't have exactly
a wall of separation

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.480
between people's religions and
their political principles,

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.900
recall that Williams used
that phrase only once

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.610
and in a polemical context in a letter,

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.830
not at all in his thousand
pages of major writing,

00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:59.440
we do have separation of jurisdictions

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.090
between church and state.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.570
But where people are concerned
they will rightly see

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:06.510
the morality of public life as one part

00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:08.610
of their own comprehensive doctrine,

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:11.260
a part, nonetheless, that
they can share with others

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.410
without converting them
to what they take to be

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:15.160
the true religion.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.650
This idea is, I think,
a much more helpful idea

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:21.550
to think with than the
bare idea of separation,

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:23.070
which might suggest that the state

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:26.040
doesn't have anything to do
with the deep ethical matters

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.160
that are central to the religions.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.880
The state needs to be
built on moral principles,

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.720
and it would be weird or tyrannical

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.840
to ask religious people to accept the idea

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.140
that moral principles are utterly separate

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.650
from their own religious principles.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:42.230
The idea of an overlapping consensus,

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.040
or to put it Williams's way,

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.680
the idea of a moral and natural goodness

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.290
that we can share while differing

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:51.780
on ultimate religious ends,
is an idea that helps us think

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.500
about our common life together much better

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:58.070
than the unclear and
misleading idea of separation.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:01.550
We must respect one another's
freedom and equality,

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.150
the deep sources of conscience

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:05.580
that lead us through
the wilderness of life.

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.700
We will only do this if we
keep religious orthodoxy

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.490
out of our common political life,

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.400
but we can and must base that common life

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.970
on ethical principles that for many

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:20.670
also have a religious meaning
and a religious justification.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.040
All we need to do when we join with others

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.700
in a common political and moral life

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.440
is to acknowledge that
someone might actually have

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.210
those ethical virtues in
the way that is relevant

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:34.210
for political life, while
not sharing our own view

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:36.100
of life's ultimate meaning.

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.230
If we once grant that, then
Williams's other argument

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:41.970
concerning fairness and impartiality

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:43.420
will lead us to want a state

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.510
that has no religious orthodoxy,

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.403
that is just in that sense
separate from religion.

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.780
Concluding section, Truth and Peace;

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.233
their meetings seldom and short.

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.900
Looking back from our own time

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.900
to the time before the founding,

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.530
we often associate the constitutional idea

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:05.860
of freedom of conscience

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:08.460
and the related idea of non-establishment

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.320
more with enlightenment,
rationalism, and deism

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.040
than with their 17th century precursors.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.050
But Williams's version of doctrines

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.130
that later became part
of the enlightenment

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:20.320
is distinctive in a number of ways,

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.730
ways that continue to
exert a deep influence

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:24.730
on America's thought and life,

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:27.810
and that I think are
valuable for us today.

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:32.080
First of all, Williams
speaks as a religious person;

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.660
skepticism about religion
or denigration of religion

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.280
is no part of his brief
for religious liberty,

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:41.490
as it is for Jefferson, who
often said things about religion

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:43.600
that seemed dismissive or scoffing.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.900
Many Americans who have
a hard time identifying

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.800
with Jefferson's rather
smug disdain for religiosity

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.860
can perhaps find their own
concerns well represented

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.360
in Williams's spiritual quest.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.900
His arguments show that one may be

00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:59.920
a deeply committed religious person

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.150
while yet believing that fairness

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:04.240
and the worth of the individual conscience

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.100
require a wide and
equal religious liberty,

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.950
and a ban on religious establishment.

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:12.510
Truth and Peace loved one another,

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:14.660
although their meetings,
as he ruefully says

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:18.810
at the end of his second
book, are seldom and short.

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:22.500
Second, Williams's romantic
and deeply emotional picture

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.750
of the conscience as a lonely
and vulnerable traveler

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:28.200
in life's great wilderness is the source

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.710
of a distinctively American
set of religious attitudes

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:36.440
that are attractive starting
points for religious thought.

00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.640
America's tradition is rather different

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.960
from many European traditions,
much more skeptical

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:45.060
of any kind of public
orthodoxy or homogeneity.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.770
Williams's idea of conscience

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:49.110
explains the roots of this tradition

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.460
and shows why it is compelling.

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.920
If we see things Williams's way
we will be strongly inclined

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:58.740
to a delicate accommodation,
even under law,

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:02.240
of eccentric religious
needs in all citizens,

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.340
as well as to scrupulous fairness

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:08.740
and constant self-criticism
in our pursuit of civil peace.

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.980
Truth and Peace don't meet often,

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.210
so often they come into each other

00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:16.740
they meet up lovingly only to be parted

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.430
by the persecutor's sword,

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:21.470
by hypocrisy and and selfish partiality.

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.030
But they have a surprise ally;

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.020
at the end of The Bloody Tenant

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.977
a third character makes her appearance.

00:56:28.977 --> 00:56:32.400
"But lo," says Peace, "who's here?"

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.487
Truth replies, "Our sister Patience,

00:56:35.487 --> 00:56:40.280
"whose desired company is
as needful as delightful."

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.850
Patience utters not a single word,

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:45.610
but she's clearly there.

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.600
The year before in his
book on Indian languages

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.820
Williams has written eloquently

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.640
of the patience of the Indians,

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:57.050
who can sit silently for ages
waiting for what they want.

00:56:57.050 --> 00:57:00.627
Quote, "every man hath
his pipe of their tobacco,

00:57:00.627 --> 00:57:02.717
"and a deep silence they make,

00:57:02.717 --> 00:57:06.000
"and attention give to him that speaketh."

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.490
To his impatient world Williams
commended that example.

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:13.150
Now at the close of his great dialogue

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:16.180
Patience is represented
as, in effect, an Indian;

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.780
silent after the prolixity of her sisters

00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.510
waiting for a time that
may be very long in coming,

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:27.530
a time of equal respect
for people who differ.

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:30.950
In that silence, at the
close of so much speech,

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:33.820
rests Williams's hope for the future.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.186
Thanks.

00:57:35.186 --> 00:57:38.353
(audience applauding)

00:57:41.798 --> 00:57:45.131
(light, peaceful music)
