00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.310
If you think back to
the diagonalization of Turing machines.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.530
You'll notice that we hardly
refer to the properties of Turing

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.070
machines at all.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.970
In fact, except at the end,
we might as well have been talking

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.970
about a different model of computation,
say, the doomaflitchy.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.590
Perhaps, unlike Turing machines,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.400
doomaflitchies halt on every
input,these models exist.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.900
A model that allowed one step for

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.360
each input symbol would
satisfy this requirement.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.800
How do we resolve the paradox then?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.670
Can't we just build the dumaflache
that takes the description of

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.610
a dumaflache as input and
then runs it on itself?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.000
It has to halt so
we can reject if it accepts, and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.660
accept if it rejects,
achieving the needed inversion.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.440
What's the problem?

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.440
Take a minute to think about it.
