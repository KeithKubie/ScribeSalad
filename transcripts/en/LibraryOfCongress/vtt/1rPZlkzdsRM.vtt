00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:18.300
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.320
&gt;&gt; Jeanne Drewes: Coming to this,
another Preservation Week here

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.620
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.040
It started in 2009.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.300
Preservation Week is a national
effort to help inform people

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.740
about preservation, and the Library

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.710
of Congress was one of
the founding members.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.140
This is our Topics in
Preservation, the 84th,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.770
and I want to just mention the 85th
one that will be happening in May,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.670 position:56%
on May 22nd, about broken cylinders.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.660
But today's talk is not
about anything that's broken.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.410
Instead, it gives me great pleasure
to finally have Tom Clareson here

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.710
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.730 position:56%
I've actually been trying to get Tom
here to speak on one of his many,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.290
many different projects
for a number of years,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.020 position:56%
and this year it finally worked out.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.800 position:56%
So I'm extremely pleased about that.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.880
Tom's the connector.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.430
He connects cultural institutions
in such interesting ways.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.320
And one of those connections is
what you'll hear about today.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.050
I've known Tom for 25 years?

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.730
Is that possible?

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.230
I don't have gray hair for nothing.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.160
And yet Tom doesn't age.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.520
So there you go.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.660
Tom works for LYRASIS.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.490
He's the senior consultant
both for digital

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.450
and preservation services there.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.300 position:56%
I knew Tom when he started working
at Amigos a number of, 25 years ago.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.680
In 2014 Tom was the
recipient of the George Cunha

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.910
and Susan Swartzburg
Award, and that's an award

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.720
that recognizes outstanding
leadership in collaboration.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.910
And it was the perfect award for
Tom to get because he collaborates

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.240
across all cultural heritage
institutions from museums

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.210 position:56%
to archives to historical
societies and, of course, libraries.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.390
So today we're talking, he's
talking about open arms,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.510
and I think that that really speaks

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.480
to what he's been doing
for a very long time.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.010
I was really pleased to
hear his, a similar talk

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.540
about this same topic at ALA.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.260
And at that time, I sort of twisted
his arm to come and speak here

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.560
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.080
So I couldn't be more
pleased to have him,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.190
and we have how many people viewing
from, we have dozens and dozens

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.130
of people on the webinar.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.780
So I want to welcome
all of you as well.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.580
So without further ado, Tom.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.310
[ Applause ]

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.400
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Well, thank you,
Jeanne, and thanks to the Library

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.540
of Congress for allowing
me to come in and talk

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.360
about both the continuation and the
expansion of a couple of programs

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.750
that I know some of you
may be familiar with.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.970
But also about the expansion of
disaster preparedness and recovery

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.040
into a new field where many of
us in the library, archives,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.890
and museum world have not
had a chance to work before.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.510
So let's see here.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.090
[ Silence ]

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.060 position:56%
What I'd like to talk with you about
today is taking a look at expansion

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.420
of disaster preparedness and
recovery across further boundaries

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.070
that we have within our field.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.870
Oftentimes we talk about
the silos that we have

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.850
between libraries,
archives, and museums.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.700
And as Jeanne has said, I've been
trying to bring that collaboration

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.310
about between those
groups for quite a while.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.110
And I've had an opportunity
more recently to work

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.830
with even further groups.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.990
So I'm going to give you a little
bit of background on some programs

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.940
that have been around
for a couple of years,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.720
but they are actually
expanding quite a bit,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.340
and then go into discussion
of a brand new program.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.100
So new that this is the first
time we've shown the logo

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.460
for the program.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.790
So new that the website is
not coming up until Monday.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.450
So it is really something
that we're being able to talk

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.960
about a little bit
of breaking news for.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.240
So many of you may be familiar
with the Alliance for Response.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.180
This is a group that has been
working for a number of years

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.820
to bring the emergency
management and response community,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.820
those who are always first on the
scene, together with our community,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.130
together with the cultural
heritage community

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.930
so that we can actually learn how
to speak each other's language.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.390
This has been something that
has been going on for close

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.530
to 15 years now and just
continues and continues to expand.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.720
So it started out with the idea
of building cooperative networks,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.870
the idea of having
people get a chance

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.760
to talk before the disaster
happens and introduce each other,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.880
be introduced to each other
before they have to meet outside

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.120
of a burning or flooding building.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.760
One of the more interesting things,
and I'll talk about this event

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.820
in just a few minutes, was that
I had an opportunity to work

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.520
with folks in the Mississippi
Gulf Coast last year,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.480
around April of last year, actually
I think it might have this same

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.210
week, and we did our session
for the Alliance for Response.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.420
And the next morning the
speakers who did not leave

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.520
that night actually had to find
different ways to the airport

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.780
because there was flooding along
the roads, there had been trees

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.240
that had been blown
down and knocked down.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.810
So we actually saw people who were
utilizing things that they talked

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.660
about and learned about
at the Alliance

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.990 position:56%
for Response meeting the very next
day to make sure that they were safe

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.030
and their collections were safe.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.330
The goals.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.240
There are a number of
goals of the Alliance

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.870
for Response that are out there.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.990 position:56%
But the ones that we sort of held as
closely to as possible for a number

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.190
of years is this idea of
relationship building.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.070
It might be trading
business cards at first.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.500
It might be even knowing where the
closest emergency management county

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.940
office is or which is the closest
fire station to your building,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.210
and to start off with that.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.770
To educate cultural heritage

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.890
and emergency management
professionals

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.370
and sort of vice versa.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.250
You know, I always take a
look at some of the things

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.960
with the incident command system
and many of the other pieces

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.680
that the emergency
management world uses.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.310
And oftentimes I figure we've
got an 18-page book of acronyms

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.110
that I've got to memorize before
I'm able to work with these folks.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.980
The same thing's happening
with them.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.890
They probably are not as familiar
with some of the care that needs

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.540 position:56%
to happen to our types of materials,
when they're normally looking

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.580
at caring for businesses or
caring for houses and maybe not

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.120
as familiar with collections.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.680
So that communication
is very important.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.570
And then sustainability.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.020
These ideas of strong, ongoing
networks that are continuing

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.280
on to allow people to be educated,
to allow people to continue

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.590
to work together for
as long as possible.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.870
So a wide variety of goals.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:54.760
We started out in 2003, the winter
of, November/December of 2003,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.230
with just a couple of locations,
Boston, Dallas, and I was able

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.130
to work with the Cincinnati Art
Museum to host one of the Alliance

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.360
for Response conferences there.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.040
A number of years later we
have 28 of these organizations.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.650
And they can be in a
city or a municipal area.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.650
They can also be in
a county or a region.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.920
Most recently, along with the
Mississippi Gulf Coast Alliance

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.160
for Response, we have
started to work with Albany

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.090
and what's called the
Capital Region up in New York.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.370
So they are really
all over the place.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.380
You'll see there's a few
states missing in the middle

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.400
of the country there
where we would definitely

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.290
like to get more organizations
started.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.530
But this is something that
has been growing for years

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.600
and been very active for years.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:52.040
Now, the Alliance for Response was
an organization that was started

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.520
by Heritage Preservation.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.810
And Heritage Preservation for a
number of years was an organization

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.570
that provided advocacy for
preservation, conservation,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.980
did a lot of educational programs.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:12.540
When that organization finally
shut down in 2015, in May of 2015,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.420
one of the most wonderful
things that I have seen

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.530
in my professional life happened,
which was that the Foundation

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.770
for the American Institute for
Conservation was actually able

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.960
to come in and be able to
support many of the programs

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.030
that had been started by
Heritage Preservation.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.230
They've been able to support
them, they've been able

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.360
to streamline them, and in
many cases even expand them.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.950 position:56%
So it was a case where the baton was
passed and the pace was picked up,

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:45.730
and it has been a very good
continuation of a lot of projects.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.530
There are a couple of things
that you can do to find out more

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.300
about what are the activities that
are going on all over the country

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.310
with Alliance for Response.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.250 position:56%
You can see that we have the website
here, and that certainly has a lot

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.580
of sort of feature stories
about trends that are going

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.100
on around the country as
far as disaster preparedness

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.690
and recovery are concerned.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.820
But the other thing is, the thing
that I like the most is the fact

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.280
that we have this opportunity
to sort of delve in

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.690
and see what each network is doing.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.120
And it's actually a great crib
sheet, it's a great CliffNotes

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.680
because you can say, well, we
sort of had the same events going

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.680
on with our alliance for a while.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.540
What are they doing in San Diego?

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.590
What are they doing in
other parts of the country?

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.690
So it's a way to sort of refresh
our curriculum for what's happening

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.210
with the Alliance for
Response activities.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.390
So there have been
plenty of successes.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.370
I didn't want to have five
or six slides on this.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.010
I tried to boil it down to one
slide, but we have had some

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.240
of the groups that have been around
for quite a long time like Atlanta,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.310
establishing a listserve that
includes emergency responders.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.880
And I've been parts of
alliances where we've had one

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.540 position:56%
or two emergency responders on them.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.530
But this is one where there is
great give and take that work

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.050
with the emergency
responders quite a bit.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.680
Now, I'm not sure how they're
handling the parts of the road

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.130
that are falling apart
down in Atlanta,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.690
but I know that that is something
that is certainly causing havoc

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.410
for the arts and culture community.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.930
So that may be something that
they're going to have to deal with.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:22.900
Boston, which has been around since
2003, got a hazard mitigation grant

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.860
that was awarded by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.220
but also Massachusetts
Emergency Management Agency,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.100
to provide training at
the community level.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.410
So they were actually doing
quite a bit of training

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.680
on incident command
system and other areas.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.440
Galveston and Houston
that have worked together

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.930
for a long time had a disaster
planning webinar to try to get

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.600
as many people in their offices
working on disaster plans

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.380
and has also held some incident
command system training.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.130
And then New York is
one of the places

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.090
where this model has
actually worked the best.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.310
And unfortunately it was
because of a bad situation.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.600
They worked with the Office of
Emergency Management of New York

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.490
in conference calls to get updates

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.810 position:56%
on what the city was doing during
Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.260
And then the Alliance
for Response got a grant

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.300
from the New York Community Trust
to train heritage responders;

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.960
to develop a website
and identification

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.080
and inventory information; to
provide social media feeds;

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.740
and document, map, and try to
figure out where the damage

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.840
to the culture community was.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.050
So it was really interesting
to see all of the activities

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.490
that this group has done.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.430
Currently, another
group that is active,

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.390
quite active every year is the
Denver Alliance for Response

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.930
because of the wildfires that
are happening in Colorado.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:52.030 position:56%
So they have folks from the forestry
areas, emergency management,

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.650
and the cultural heritage
institutions working together.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:59.280
So many, many successes for the
Alliance for Response program.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.450
I also wanted to talk, and there
are a number of people who are

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.990
in the room that are part of this,

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.960
about the National
Heritage Responders program.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.760
And this is a program that has
come from the American Institute

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.630
for Conservation as well.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:19.870
And it actually is one where there
are a couple of components to it.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.570
One of the major components is
being on the end of that phone line

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:29.550
that we just saw in bold face and
having people who can be online

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:33.880 position:56%
or on the phone to talk you
through a disaster that might happen

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.160
at your individual institution.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.820
Is there part of your collection

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.350
that may have been
damaged in some way?

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.030
Is there a concern because your
building is not providing the

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:48.340
envelope it could or should
to protect the collections?

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.850
So we have that level of
discussion that can happen.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.690
And I know that Jeanne Drewes has
done a number of tours of duty

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.430
on the phone during that,
and Andrew Robb as well.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.800 position:56%
Many of you in this room have helped

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.610
on the National Heritage
Responders side of things.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:14.510
This group has been active,
again, for close to ten years.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:19.260
It started as a result
of the Hurricane Katrina

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.320
and Hurricane Rita in 2005.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.890
People felt that there was
a need to have a network

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.050
of responders around the country.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.600
And so in 2007, and again
in 2011, there was training

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.640
that was made available,
very advanced training,

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.810
actually on-site training,
going through complete aspects

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:46.240
of a mock disaster in an
organization and figuring out all

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.860 position:56%
of the activities that could be used

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.740
for a variety of format
of materials.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.360
But also the other thing that was
really quite interesting for me

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.220 position:56%
as one of the trainees was the level
of documentation that they asked us

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.960
to put together in this training.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.620
So between those two
trainings, between the 2007

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.580
and 2011 training sessions, the
first of which was sponsored

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:12.700
by IMLS, they actually have
trained over 100 people.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.700 position:56%
I think it's about 107 folks who
are trained at this point to be able

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.580
to respond to these
types of disasters.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.250
Like I said, this can be done over
the phone, but the other thing is

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.810
that the group can be deployed.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:32.260
Small groups or small teams of
people can be deployed to a number

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.430
of locations around the country.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:39.460
So when we have a region-wide
disaster, when we have situations

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.460
like the floods that occurred in
North Dakota and seemed to happen

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.170
on an almost annual basis
there, the earthquake in Haiti,

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.600
a number of situations
like Superstorm Sandy

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.240
and other hurricanes, there is
the ability to get people on site

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.950
and get people who
know, know conservation

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.010
and who have been trained in how
to deal with this type of activity,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.810
who have been trained to document,

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.700
who have been trained
how to communicate.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.220
So this is a really
important collaborative team

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.920
that I hope we don't
have the opportunities

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.680
to use much, but I
know that we will.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:21.310
So it's an important
backing team that is there.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.330
But what I'm really here to talk
about, in addition to talking

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.620 position:56%
with you about the safety net that's
out there through the Alliance

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.050
for Response and National
Heritage Responders,

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.260
is what's happening
in the arts community.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.890
There have been a variety of
situations that we've had to think

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.330
about and talk about
in the arts community.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.870
This is actually on campus
at the University of Iowa,

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.870
some of the flooding
that they have had.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.850
Again, a state that has very
regular schedules, unfortunately,

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.920
of flooding where they have to
deal with this type of situation.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.610
And this was the performing arts
center there getting damaged.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.100
One of the things that has been,
I think, the most disheartening

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.670
but also one of the biggest call
to arms was the Ghost Ship fire

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:13.920
that happened in December of
2016 where an arts collective

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.360
in the Oakland, California, area
burned and there were 36 people

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.150
who passed away in that fire.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.050
And one of the things
that we're looking at is,

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.700
we look at this all the time is,
the human safety, the human aspect

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:33.690
of trying to make sure, before
anything else, that the staff,

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.610
the patrons, the guests,
the audience is safe.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.700
So we need to think about floods,
we need to think about fire,

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.820 position:56%
but we also need to think about
things that are as seemingly mundane

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.120
as digital disasters as well.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.650
And with the activities that
we do in the library world,

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.570
we certainly have digital
collections that can be damaged.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.290
But one of the things that we have
learned when we've been working

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:00.290
with the performing arts
community is the level of concern

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:04.830
about the ticket lists,
the seating lists,

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.850
information about productions,
etc., that are online and the fact

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.550
that we need to make sure
that those are saved as well.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.490
So we're looking at a
wide variety of disasters.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.590 position:56%
And one of the things that the folks

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.870
in the emergency management
community talk

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.450
about all the time
is all hazards types

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.890
of disaster preparedness
and recovery.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.640
And we want this to be all
hazards not just thinking

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.020
about natural hazards,
man-made hazards,

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.890 position:56%
but also mechanical hazards as well.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.960
These digital disasters can be
really a difficult situation

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.430
for an organization, too.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.240
So we're trying to cover
all of these areas.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:50.900
So we had an opportunity to talk
in the fall of 2015 with a group

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.460
of the leaders on a
regional and national basis

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.510
in the performing arts world.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.780
And the Mellon Foundation
brought a number of organizations

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.660
that were leaders in
the preservation

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.040
and conservation regional community
together with their counterparts

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.890
in the performing arts community.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.150
And one of the things that
we heard was that there were,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.170
in a lot of cases there
were collections,

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.870
but there were also a lot of
other things that we had to think

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:22.080
about when we were thinking about
working with and responding along

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.140
with the performing
arts organizations.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.820 position:56%
So after a disaster, think about the
kind of things that might happen.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.960
Think about -- and this was a
situation that definitely happened

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.680
in 2001 when Tropical Storm
Allison sat over Houston

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.940
and dumped 21 inches of rain over
three days, and part of it was

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.810
on a theater complex there --

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.110
what will happen to
the building and venue?

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.110
Could it be collapsed walls?

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.830
What will happen to the sets?

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.520
What will happen to the
costumes, which may be something

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.760 position:56%
that is stored for a long time by
the organization or may be something

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.460
that is traveling along
with the presenting group?

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.240
The records, the business records,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.070
the tickets records,
are important as well.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:07.130
The concern that we heard from the
performing arts community, though,

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.350 position:56%
the biggest thing that they asked us
to look at was the loss of business,

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.170
the fact that if they had a
disaster, if they had a fire,

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.930
the doors were going to be shut and
that performance could not go on.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.690
And recovering from lost revenue.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:27.620
So what was an area of interest
that they were wanting to see

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.650
if it could be provided was,
continuity of operations

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.100
and continuity of business
assistance and training

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.760
and disaster preparedness
assistance and training as well.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:45.990
In 2016, in the beginning of
2016, my organization, LYRASIS,

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.560
received a six-month, Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation planning grant.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.820
And there were five preservation
and conservation organizations

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.400
and four performing
arts organizations

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.500
that worked together on this grant.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.080
We reviewed existing
surveys, existing research

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.800
that had been done on this topic.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.680
And one of the things that we
found, which was a concern was,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.870
there wasn't a lot
that was out there.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.530
There were not some of
longitudinal surveys

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.180
that some states have been doing.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.080
There were not the kind
of studies that had come

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.930
through the IMLS Connecting
to Collections program

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.800
or the National Endowment for the
Humanities Field Services programs

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.850
that are out there, that
are taking the temperature

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:29.660
of what disaster planning has been
going on for years in the field.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.910
So there were not as many of those.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.360
But there were new surveys.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.300
There's an annual survey done
by one of the leader groups

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.920
in the field called the National
Performance Network, or NPN,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.190
and they had been doing a couple of
different surveys really every year

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.550 position:56%
to take a look at what their members
around the country were seeing

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:51.160
as far as the need for disaster
preparedness and planning.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.100
And we looked at that research, we
also did some of our own research.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:00.520
We went to New Orleans and talked
with a group at NPN's headquarters.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.550
In Red Bank, New Jersey, we
were at the Count Basie Theatre

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.480
between two performances that
I wish I'd been able to go to.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.430
But I was able to, to lead
the focus group there.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.450
The New Jersey State Council on
the Arts, which is really a leader

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.930
as far as one of the
statewide organizations that is

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.480
out there focusing on the arts,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.590
was able to provide a
situation for us to talk there.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:27.700
In Austin, Texas, I walked into
the middle of a construction zone

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.680
where the Dance/USA
Conference was being held.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:36.670
And we talked over jackhammers and
a lot of other construction noise

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:40.840
and debris about the kind of things
that we needed to look at as far

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.650
as working with the dance
community and other parts

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.080
of the performing arts community.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.290
And then we were able to actually
get a virtual focus group as well.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:54.270 position:56%
Another thing that we did was looked
at the disaster preparedness tools

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.930
that are out and available for both
the cultural heritage community

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:02.890
and for the performing arts
community and do some comparisons.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.190
What did they cover?

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.060
Where were they missing things?

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.580
Where were the blanks
that they were having?

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:14.790
What we found, through the survey
research that we looked at,

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.250
was that a majority of performing
arts organizations did not have

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:23.380
disaster plans, and even fewer had
continuity of operations plans.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.750
Planning really is not an
institutional priority.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.420
They have to get the show
going on for the next period.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.840
They have to think about other
shows that are coming up.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.650
They need to think about
actually a lot of day-to-day work,

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.350
and they need to, you know,
their collections, in some cases,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.120
their collections can be the
performers who are coming together

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.670
as a troupe to prevent,
present something.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:51.010
And so the planning might not be as
much of an institutional priority.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.370
They don't have the time
or expertise to do this,

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.120
and they may have small staffs.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.970
We talked, especially the Dance/USA
Conference, I talked with a number

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.930
of organizations with a staff size
of one or one and a half people.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.970
So that was difficult
to think about.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:09.110
One of the things that I was
very pleased about, though,

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.600
that I couldn't believe it the
first time I heard it at one

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.140
of the focus groups, and I had to
ask at every one after that was,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.430
what's happening with
your electronic records.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:21.620
And many of the organizations
were saying that they are stored,

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.430
as well as being backed up on
site, they're stored off site.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.020
They're stored in the cloud.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.110
They were thinking of some
levels of digital preservation

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.370 position:56%
or digital disaster planning so that
they were not completely crippled

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.230
by a situation where their
records might be taken

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.730
out by a storm or other problems.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:45.940
So just very quickly, taking a
quick look at the NPN information,

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.040
the majority of the partners
didn't have an emergency plan,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.830
and it wasn't an institutional
priority.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.470 position:56%
Some groups were unaware of the need
for a plan, didn't have the time

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.370 position:56%
to do it, didn't have the expertise,

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.760
or said that they couldn't
afford to develop a plan.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.480
That became a really important
part of the grant project

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.450 position:56%
that we are working on now to try
to make some level of infrastructure

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.870
for planning available
to these organizations

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.880
without a huge charge,
without a cost to them.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.410
And in some cases, without monetary
cost to them, but also looking

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.300
at trying to take the stress

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.460
of the personnel cost a little
bit off of them as well.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.120
We worked with organizations
that were both producing

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.150
and presenting organizations.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.550
And the difference here is that the
producing organizations may be the

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.930
group that creates and
stages some of the work,

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:45.950
where the presenting organizations
may be theaters that bring in works

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.110
that are produced by others,
works that are created by others.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.340
But we also found that there are
a lot of organizations that serve

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.140
in both of these types
of activities.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:59.390
We work with organizations
with and without facilities.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:05.210
And I think one of the things that
really gave me the biggest shock

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:09.110
when I was talking with one of the
focus groups was an organization

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:13.920
that said they regularly perform
at six different institutions,

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.060
six different buildings a year.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.130
And they said, we don't know
anything about those institutions.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.960
We don't know their disaster plans,
if they have a disaster plan,

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.810 position:56%
we had to walk around and figure out
where the entries and exits were.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.380
We had to walk around to figure out
where the fire extinguishers were

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.180
or if there's even a fire
suppression system at all.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.830
They're walking into these
situations and, you know,

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.830
it's a concern because they
don't know even the first level

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.400
of safety activities
related to these.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.640
So the organizations

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.920
without facilities really
made their voices known

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.220
to us as needing some help.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.880
Can you help us put together a
checklist on what we should hope

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.870
and expect that our host
organizations will provide us

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.200
in the future?

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.370
Their definition of a
disaster, a little bit different

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.420
than we might have at the Library
of Congress, National Archives,

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.450
or the Smithsonian Museums.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:11.990
It's, in some cases, yes,
a disruption of business.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.500
It's something that all
of us are concerned about.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.350
But a forced performance
cancellation.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.510
Is this a situation where you
had a performance on the books,

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.950
it's been on the books
for nine months or a year,

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.790
and because of this disaster
you've had to cancel it.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:30.530
And then what can the
financial repercussions be?

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.850
When we talked to the few
organizations that came

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:39.480
to the focus groups that did have
disaster plans, what they said was

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.620
that the plans that they had were
focused on just a couple things,

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.430
human safety, getting people out,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.960
evacuating folks, and
communications.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.500
Communications on what the staff,
what the next artist who was doing

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.190
and should do because
the building was damaged.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.550
Few had the actual
continuity of operations

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.230
and continuity of business plans.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:02.240
It was mainly some of the quick
communications that could happen.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.230
What they said they needed
was information on resources

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:10.830 position:56%
and best practices for both planning
for and recovery from disasters.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:15.000
Few have had any type of
disaster training, and that is one

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.660
of the things that's really
important within this program

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.510
that we're developing to make
sure these organizations get.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.760
So they were interested in
preparedness and recovery training,

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.220
both being able to put the
plans together and then,

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.140
after the incident does
happen, what can they do.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.900
Working with existing networks

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.140
in performing arts
and cultural heritage.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.310
So working with some of the
28 groups that were out there

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.090
from the Alliance for Response.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.760
Working with organizations
like Culture Aid in New York,

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.980
which is more with the performing
and visual arts type of background.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.570
And then another thing that,
again, was interesting to me,

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.780
and this was the part that I really
appreciated the most, I think,

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.990
out of any of the focus
groups that we did.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.370
At the Count Basie Theatre, we
had people coming up and saying,

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.400
all right, our performing
arts organization is going

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.390
to have next year its
75th anniversary.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:13.820
And what we have with our programs,
with our performance histories,

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.550
our photographs, our business
records, is that they are --

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.840
one organization said
they're in tubs under the bed

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.260
of the various different
board of directors members,

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.960
spread all over town
or all over the county.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.440
Or they might be in
the basement as well.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.550
And so we said, you
know, what can we do?

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:35.790
How can we think about this idea of
archiving organizational history,

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:41.350
production records, history,
programs, photographs, etc.?

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:46.640
So what has come of this is, we had
our planning grant June through,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.710
January through June of
2016 and then took some time

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.520
to put together an
implementation grant

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.440
that was awarded last December.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.180
This is called the Performing
Arts Readiness Project,

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.270
and it started in January of 2017.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:03.280
It's a three-year project funded
by the Andrew Mellon Foundation.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.030
And one of the best things
that we did right off the bat

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:11.030
with this grant was that we
were able to even the sides up,

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.710
even the discussion up, and bring
the Performing Arts Alliance,

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.580
or PAA, into the project.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.180
And the Performing Arts
Alliance is actually a group,

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.590
an alliance of associations
and groups that already deal

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.130
with performing arts disciplines.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:31.450
And so this was a group that had a
very wide reach, a national reach,

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.090
an across-the-field reach.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.630
So you'll see a wide variety
of organizations here.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.940 position:56%
And I wanted to talk about each of
them just in case you can't read all

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.550
of them, give you a minor
background on all of them.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.860
Of course, my organization,
LYRASIS, there is a project,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.600
a program called Arts Ready
that comes out of South Arts,

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.850
which is one of the regional
performing arts group.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:31:00.390 position:56%
And so Arts Ready is actually a
disaster planning tool that has been

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.670
around for a number of years and
that these organizations have used

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.880
and become members of
to do disaster planning.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:13.220
The Conservation Center in
Philadelphia is another member.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:17.820
The Midwest Art Conservation
Center in Minneapolis.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.170
We have the National Performance
Network based in New Orleans

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.370
but members around the country.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:28.600
Each state that is represented on
our webinar and many of the states

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.490
that you work closely
with has an arts council.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:35.580
And the New Jersey State Council
on the Arts actually was brought

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:39.140
to my attention because they were
the first performing arts group

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:43.100
to join with and work with and
be on the steering committee

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.670
of an alliance for response.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.620
When the New Jersey
Alliance for Response, NJCAR,

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:52.160
the New Jersey Cultural Alliance
for Response, started three

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.500
or four years ago, they actually
had a performing arts organization

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.220
at the table, and it was the
State Council on the Arts.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.480
So we asked one of their
lead people to be a member

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.510
of our partner group as well.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:08.060
Northeast Document Conservation
Center, or NEDCC, is another group.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.810
We are funded, as I said,
by the Mellon Foundation.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:14.310
We work with WESTPAS,
the Western States

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:17.340
and Territories Preservation
Advisory [sic] Service,

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.900
which is more of a virtual
preservation service than a bricks

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.910
and mortar regional group.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.690
They do a lot of training,
education,

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.470
and response in the
western part of the U.S.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.060
And then the Performing
Arts Alliance.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.450
So we have a really wide
variety and an excellent variety

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.420
of groups to work with here.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.670
So this is a huge grant.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.050
We wanted to try to
do as many things

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.840
as we possibly could
to help this community.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.270
We may have gone a
little bit overboard,

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:52.140
but I think we're finding strengths
within all of the organizations

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.680
that we're working with in
order to be able to do this.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:00.880
As I said before, really
important aspect to bracket this,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.360
working with producing and
presenting organizations,

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.840
not just one or the other.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.670
Working with organizations
with and without facilities.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.750
But we're doing a lot of
outreach, community engagement,

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.120
sort of getting people to think

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.880
about the need for
disaster planning.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.610
We're providing information
resources, the good things that are

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.420
out there already and the
things like those checklists

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.940
that people might be talking
about if they are doing activities

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:30.180
in buildings that they
are not usually housed in.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.010 position:56%
Training and conference programming.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.310
Templates and tools.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:36.090
And this is going to be one of
the bigger aspects of what comes

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:39.440
out of this program, and I'll talk
about that in just a few minutes.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.280
One of my favorites, and
actually I want you all to think

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.810
about is this something that
should happen in the district,

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.320
is a circuit rider project.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.820
And then we're actually going to
be able to give grants, sub-grants,

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.880
for disaster networks and
for disaster planning.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.570
So I'm going to talk and provide
just a few details on each of these

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.890
so you can see the
breadth of the program.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.080
The outreach and community
engagement.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.980
We're doing conference
presentations all over the country.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.570
The first time I took a look at
the list of conference that are

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:14.570 position:56%
out there for the performing arts
community I wasn't familiar with any

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:15.920
of the organizations,
and I said, oh,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.430
I have to get educated
on this really quickly.

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:22.980
There are about 30 conferences
that are out there, probably more,

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.870
that happen -- this is on a
regional and national basis,

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:31.820
not just the state basis, and so
we're looking at where can we meet

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.580
and work with some of these
associations at their conferences.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.660
And especially working with
some of the regional groups

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.110
like South Arts and
NPN has been good.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.670
Meeting with key stakeholders.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:45.140
Just opportunities
to talk with a number

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.520
of performing arts
groups in key cities.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.180
I was attending a conference by
the Pennsylvania Governor's Office

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:57.230
of Homeland Security
on large event security

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:01.150
and large event disaster
planning and had an opportunity,

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:05.020
just a week before that was
put together, to start working

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.790
with the Greater Pittsburgh Arts
Council, who pulled together some

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.570
of their key players and brought
them together the day before

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.400
so we could talk about how
this program could work well

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.700
in Pittsburgh.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.720
So it was interesting to see
that type of planning going on,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.810
and we hope to continue
that in as many cities

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.520
and counties as possible.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.940
Trusted information resources.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.560
As I mentioned, links to existing
resources and creating things

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.620
that are new for the field.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:34.550
And I will sort of do a
little bit of promotion here.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.050
We have a website coming in
early May, hopefully next week,

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:42.400
that is going to talk a little
bit more about our program,

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.180
provide links to a wide variety of
things that are already out there,

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.920
but is also going to give
you both some background

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.210 position:56%
on what happened during our planning
project and a future forecast

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.600
of the kind of activities that
we'll be doing during the rest

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.090
of the project.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.500
We have a variety of workshops.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.280
In May or June we're going to
start offering on a monthly basis,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.760
and in some cases bimonthly
basis, an introduction

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.750
to emergency preparedness webinar.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.070
What are some of the key things

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.520
that performing arts
organizations would need to know?

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.440
What are some of the key resources?

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.740
So that's starting soon.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.850
And then we're going to branch
out into a series of two-hour

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:25.150
or four-hour in-depth webinars
and some in-person classes.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:29.510 position:56%
And actually the steering committee,
our group, our partner group,

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.220
has said we would much rather
get out there and do as many

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.600
of these in-person
classes as we possibly can.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.740
We like to do the webinars,
but it has been so good

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.960
through the focus groups and
through some of presentations

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.450
that we've done already to see the
level of interest that is out there

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:48.220
that we would like to do as many
of these in person as possible.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.680
So we're going to look
at some of the topics

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.230
that you might think of
in disaster planning.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.980
Risk assessment and mitigation.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:58.600
What is the possibility of
this risk causing damage

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.680
to this performing
arts organization?

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.420 position:56%
Basics of business continuity plans,

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.600
disaster response,
mutual support networks.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.570
How can some of the performing
arts groups take advantage

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.280
of the networks that
are already out there?

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.040
Venue safety and security.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.940
This is the hot topic.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.760
And we can't get this
class ready fast enough.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.140 position:56%
And, in fact, we're actually
working with a number of conferences

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.960
where they said, even if you
come here and do 45 or 50 minutes

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.430
on venue safety and
security, we want you to come

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.640
to our 2017 conferences and put
together a program fast for us.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.170
What they're concerned
about is active shooters.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:40.350
What they're concerned about is
situations that might cause concern

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.660
for the audience and the
performers while they are on stage

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.720
or while they are doing
some type of activity.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.490
So that venue safety and
security is very important.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.000
Health and human safety.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.240
And then community
recovery assistance.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.970
Actually, when I was first
starting to talk about this,

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.050
I was saying safe havens.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.570
The idea that we would have
safe havens for people.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.990 position:56%
And they said, oh, maybe it would be
a little bit better to talk about it

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:08.050
in different terminology and
sort of a wider perspective.

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.920
What we're looking at, and this
is something that also drew my eye

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.580
to New Jersey, and this is,

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.970
they have a model there
that is really amazing.

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:20.660
Both the libraries, and many of you
might have heard of a conference,

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.390
it was called Ports in the
Storm where they talked

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:27.420
about the libraries being areas
where people could gather,

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.110 position:56%
where FEMA staff could gather,
where there were FEMA meetings held.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.760
That was really important.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.620
And we were at a statewide
meeting in New Jersey talking

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.290
about how great this program was,
and all of the folks who were there

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.450
from the performing
arts organizations said,

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.210
we've been doing the
same things, too.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:45.910
We have been having FEMA
meetings in our lobbies.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:50.850
We have been letting people come in
and use every single electric plug

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.970
in our whole facility
because we've had our,

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.970
oftentimes they have gotten
their power restored quickly,

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.430
to charge their cell phones.

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.240
We use this as meeting spots.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.770
We use these as spots to talk
about what needs to be done as far

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.980
as community planning,
community meetings with FEMA.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.310 position:56%
So building these community recovery
assistance networks is going

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:14.680
to be important as well.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.800
And then the last topic here
is one that we learned of

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.020
and probably would not
have thought of at all

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.620
if we hadn't had those focus groups

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.530
with the archiving
and records retention.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:28.120
I had an opportunity to work in New
Jersey end of November beginning

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.440
of December of last year with
the State Council on the Arts,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.590
and we had full-day in-person
classes and actually,

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.110
using a performing arts term,

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.540
as least one of them
was standing room only.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:46.100
And we were able to talk with about
60 or 70 different organizations

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.320
about basics in disaster planning,
and it was very well received.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.730
A lot of continuing
conversation for that.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:57.140
And again, the need for the classes
to address traveling organizations

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.570
without a facility
is important as well.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:09.250
We want to look at some of
the disaster planning tools

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.320
that we surveyed when we were
doing our research and think

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.900
about what can be done with
those tools as we go forward.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.910
So many of you might be
familiar with the PReP tool,

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.630
the pocket response plan.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:22.630
Two sides of a sheet of paper,

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.710
and it gives you some
contact information

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.540
and then initial steps to take.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.990
And it can include floor plans

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.240
and include other information
about your building.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.450
Can that be utilized
for the performing arts?

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:36.220
We're still working on that.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.410 position:56%
It is something where I don't think
it's going to be like the PReP plan,

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:42.900
that WESTPAS and so many other
groups have actually done

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.560
so well in training people on.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.860
We need to actually sort of morph
this and see if it can be used

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.950
for the performing arts community.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:54.280
ArtsReady, the tool for
performing arts preparedness.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.200
That is a tool that has been
around for a bit of time.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.360
South Arts, who is the parent
organization for ArtsReady,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.810
wants to make some
changes in the project.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:09.100
The other project that many
of you might be familiar

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:13.210
with is the Northeast Document
Conservation Center's dPlan tool,

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.190
which is sort of a
fill-in-the-blanks type

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.660
of disaster planning
tool that's out there.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:23.210 position:56%
And dPlan has been around for now
probably 12, maybe 15 years as well,

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.080
and it is ready for
some enhancements.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.780 position:56%
So we're looking at the idea of, can
there be enhancements made to both

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.780
of these so they both can be
applicable to both types of,

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.980 position:56%
parts of the arts and culture field.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.140
And is there any possibility,
and we're seeing

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:42.850
that we think there may be some,
for the tools to work together

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:47.550
and provide some, some accelerated
and enhanced help to the community.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:52.540 position:56%
And the last thing that we're trying
to do, and it really is an idea

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.810
that has come from the
insurance industry,

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:56.920
is something called a
loss of income calculator.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.230
If you have this many seats

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.990
and a disaster cancels
this many performances,

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.090
what kind of loss of
income do you have?

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:08.350
Is this a need, going to
show a need for insurance?

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.750
Is it going to show a need
for disaster planning?

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:16.120
For the idea of a plan b or back-up
site to hold your performance?

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.340
So those are some things
we're thinking of for tools.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.770
And then I mentioned the
Circuit Rider program.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.050
This is going to be a person
who is going to be able

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:25.800
to provide local training.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.470
They're going to go around to 25
to 30 organizations in their area

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.970
and help them develop disaster
plans that are tailored

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.160
to that individual organization.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.530
If there is a disaster in the
area, they're going to be able

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:42.340
to provide assistance
when those happen.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.810
And so we've got two organizations
that are starting actually

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.690
in July with these projects.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.810
The first one is in northeast Ohio

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:54.220
and the Cleveland area,
ICA Art Conservation.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:59.900
And it used to be the Intermuseum
Conversation Association

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.500
but has now changed their name.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.750
ICA Art Conservation is
going to be the host group

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.440
for one of the circuit riders.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.270
And in New Jersey the State
Council for the Arts is going

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:13.660
to be a host group for a
circuit rider who's going

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:14.960
to cover the whole state.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.260
So that's going to be
somebody who's going

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.180
to put a lot of mileage
on their car.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.840
So we've got those two locations.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.450
These are based on some
very successful operations

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.240
that are going on in Massachusetts.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.940
If you haven't heard about this, my
friend and colleague Rachel Onuf,

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.420
who is in Massachusetts, has put
together a circuit riding program

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:41.020 position:56%
to look at preservation and archival
practices for city governments,

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:45.500
town governments, townships,
and other organizations as well.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.370
So she does sort of circuit
riding around the commonwealth

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.430
to help them develop those plans.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:56.090
And as of next month, in fact, I
think as of early as next week,

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:58.310
she's going to be doing
this in Vermont as well.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:02.660
And she is going to be able to show
us the blueprint of what she does

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.530
and give us some training
on what's happening there.

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:10.480
So this bottom point that I would
like you to be especially cognizant

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.230
about is, there's an opportunity
for four Circuit Rider programs

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:19.060
from July of 2018 to June of 2019.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.420 position:56%
And I'm hoping that those of you who
are on the webinar and those of you

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.400
who are in the room, if you
feel that there might be a need

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:29.610 position:56%
because of the density of
performing arts groups in your city,

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.470
in your region, that it might
be something that you could look

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.840
at for the Circuit Rider program.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.870
So I'll talk about that in
just a few minutes as well.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:44.410
And then the last area, but one
that is quite important as well,

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.910
is that we are going to
be providing sub-grants.

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:51.150 position:56%
We're going to be providing grants
from the original grant that we got.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.910
So we're going to be looking

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:55.950
at enhancing existing
disaster networks.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.770
We have 10 to 12 grants that
we're going to give out on a level

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:04.220
of $7,500 each to groups
like CultureAID,

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.290
to groups like the
Alliance for Response,

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:10.940
to make sure that their
programming is able to be inclusive

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.060
of the performing arts, to make
sure that their membership,

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:19.490
their communications, is able to be
inclusive of the performing arts.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.550
So we're really pleased
about doing that.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.940
And at the meeting that Jeanne was
talking about at ALA Midwinter,

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:29.780
it was kind of amazing because we
had six or seven cities or areas

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.600
that said we want to
do one of those grants.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.870
And boy, get your guidelines
out right now.

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:37.680
The guidelines, unfortunately, will
not be out until July or August,

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.700
but we are hoping to actually
go through the whole process

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.530
and be able to award those in
December of this year or January

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:49.900
of next year to some of these
existing disaster networks.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.400
We're developing two
new disaster networks.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.550
In some cases, they can take
the models that are out there,

00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:00.180
like the Alliance for Response or
other groups, and they will be able

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:06.680
to utilize funding, $15,000
each for two organizations,

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.840
to start the whole
infrastructure of planning,

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.790
to put together what we call
the initial forum that Alliance

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:18.410
for Response groups have where they
really have a full day conference

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:21.620
on emergency preparedness
and cultural heritage

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.160
in a city or county or region.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.170
And so there are a number of groups
who are looking at this as well.

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:32.960
We've had inquiries from New
Orleans and the New Orleans area

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.190
and inquiries from
some of the cities

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.290
in northern New Mexico
potentially getting together

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:40.880
to do some activities this way.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.870
And then finally, we have
individual institution disaster

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.240
planning assistance.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.190
That is being able to provide
consulting and expertise

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.690
to help these institutions
build their own plans.

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:54.340
When they said we don't
have the expertise on staff,

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.050
when they said we don't
have the time or the staff,

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:00.090
can we bring in people from
the field to assist them

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:01.880
in developing these plans?

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.850
Can we provide them some training?

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.480
Can we get them to training
that is beyond our program

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.210
but might be bringing in things
like active shooter training

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:13.870
or other types of activities
that they need to know about,

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:17.310
and can we help them
get some of the tools,

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.220
and this is the actual
equipment-type tools

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.910
or it can be some of planning
tools that are out there,

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:27.030
and help them utilize those for
their organizations as well.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:33.900
So we're going to have up to 40 of
those grants around $7,250 each.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.890
And so, again, we are looking
forward to getting the guidelines

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:41.470
for these programs out
there as soon as possible.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.390
So where can libraries help?

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.820
Where can you all help?

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.350
These are the areas where I'd
really like you to be thinking

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.460
as you go away from
this presentation.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:58.100
Can you identify performing arts
organizations in your community

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.980
that need assistance, could utilize
some of the information that is

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.120
out there, could utilize the
education topics that we talked

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.440
about and use some of
the planning grants?

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:12.460
Can you identify cities, states,
or regions that have that density

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:17.600
of performing arts organizations
that some, some cities have

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.200
where I've worked in New jersey,
worked in Pennsylvania, in Ohio,

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.670
where we have two very well
known performing arts communities

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.350
within just blocks of each other.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.210
Two, four, six of them.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:32.200
Is there another area
with that kind of density

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.520 position:56%
for the round two Circuit Rider
programs, and can your organization,

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:38.140
could the Library of Congress,

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.050
could another organization
that's represented here today,

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.920
think about co-hosting
one of these types

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.380
of groups in the future as well?

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.140
Workshop and conference
presentations.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:52.160
I know that some of you teach
about and talk about conservation

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.130
and preservation and disaster
preparedness all the time.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:58.490
We would be very interested in
working with you if you feel

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:00.730
that you have information
that would be of help

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.860
to the performing arts community,
that could become part of some

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.550
of the workshops that
we've been talking about.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:09.600
Consider expanding the
disaster networks in your area.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.530
Or are there metropolitan areas
that need a disaster network?

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.880
And then collaborating
with performing arts groups

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:20.240
on those community recovery efforts
during emergencies and disasters.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.830
Get introduced to them now, do
the business card trading now,

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:28.420
go to their theater now to find out
how you and they can work together

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.290
as community shelters, as those
havens for people to work with

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.460
and meet at during disasters.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:40.010
And promoting the program in your
community starting now as well.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:46.320
So that is actually the
extent of my presentation.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.360
I did think of one thing as I
was preparing to talk about this.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.520
Some of you might ask why is
an organization that has worked

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.970
for years and years in its many
forms, SOLINET, PALINET, NELINET

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:03.220
and other networks that got
together in 2009 to form LYRASIS,

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.180
why is this organization that's
worked with libraries and archives,

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:08.740
and more recently with
museums, starting to work

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.040
with the performing arts?

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.340
You know, how did that come about?

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:17.950 position:56%
And really, what we're looking at
is trying to do whole community type

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.950
of disaster preparedness
and recovery.

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:25.270
The idea of working with all of
the arts and cultural organizations

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:30.290 position:56%
within a community to help them set
up networks but to help them recover

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:35.030
and help them continue to be open
for the members of the community

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:38.980
that are out there who might need
to do research at a library archive

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:42.540
or a museum or who might
need to actually take a break

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.030
from the recovery that
they're going through,

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:46.380
if their house has been
damaged, and see what's going

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.310
on with the performing arts.

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:53.870
We want to make sure that we're
trying to cover as much of the arts

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:57.530
and culture provider
community with some basic level

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:01.370
of disaster preparedness and
recovery information as possible.

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:05.030
So that's where our organization
that has a long history starting

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:08.000
out as SOLINET, publishing,
being on site,

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.840 position:56%
and working with other organizations
in disaster preparedness has decided

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:16.260
to move forward with these
wonderful, nine other partners

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.290
that we're working with
to mount this program.

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:22.490
So we are in the very
early days of this program.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:25.610
We are still sort of chugging
along getting a lot of the parts

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:26.950
of the program started up.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:30.600
I think that especially by
this fall you'll be hearing

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.680
about the grants coming out, you'll
be hearing about some of the things

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.550
that the circuit riders are doing

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.730
with the turn of the
calendar in 2018.

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:41.400
You'll hear more about what
enhancements are happening

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.350
with the disaster preparedness
and recovery tools.

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:50.900
And so please keep a
watch out on this program.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.760
And one of the things that
I thought was great was,

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.790
we had a terrible time kicking
around names for this program.

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.120
And some of the acronyms
just didn't work out.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.940 position:56%
We were trying to figure out, you
know, what we could call the program

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.850
and the performing arts readiness.

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:07.860 position:56%
Having the performing arts community
be ready for a disaster is good.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.950
But it also presents
a nice play on words.

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:17.270 position:56%
What we are doing with the workshops
and allowing people to develop plans

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:21.110
and have some level of grants
and support for their plans is,

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:24.200
we are Performing Arts Readiness.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.660
So with that, I wanted to see
if there are any questions

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.490 position:56%
or any other feedback that you
might have about the program so far.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:33.290
Thank you.

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:44.070
[ Applause ]

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.370
Jeanne.

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeanne Drewes: So, Tom, you maybe
said this and I didn't catch it.

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:50.670
What is the length of
time for this program?

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:51.970
Is it --

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:53.270
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: It's three years.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.570
&gt;&gt; Jeanne Drewes: It's three years.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:55.870
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Yes.

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:59.490
It's a three-year grant from the
Mellon Foundation that we have.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:03.830
So we are actually, with some of
the individual institution grants,

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:07.410
we're hoping to offer two rounds
of those, two rounds of 20.

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:08.960
With the network grants,

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.050 position:56%
we'll probably offer the new
network grants at the very beginning

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:15.960
because there needs to be
some buildup for those.

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.880
But we may offer two
rounds of five or six

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.410
of the enhanced network
grants as well.

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:28.650
Other questions?

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.020
Yes, Mary.

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.370
&gt;&gt; You said something about maybe
you guys got a little bit too eager

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:35.670
in developing these programs.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.100
And so what did you mean by that?

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:41.040
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: You know,
we saw so many avenues

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.470
where we wanted to
provide assistance.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:46.820
And I think that we
were trying to look

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:51.290
at how many different components
we can provide to people.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:55.440
And we put this together
in our grant proposal,

00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:01.140
and we actually have a great sort
of timeline and plan for rolling

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.790
out these aspects of things.

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:06.960
But it has been very
interesting for the preservation

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.730
and conservation organizations
that are involved.

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.770
And in some ways I
think we felt like, oh,

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:15.450
we've been doing emergency
preparedness

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:18.150
and disaster response
for years and years.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.830
This should be something
where we can, you know,

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:28.470 position:56%
fit this emergency preparedness,
disaster plan box, with another type

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:31.190
of organization, with
another level of organization.

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:34.150 position:56%
And I've got to tell you, within
the first couple of days of starting

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:37.050
to meet with folks from the
performing arts organizations,

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:39.950
they were, like, yeah
we have collections,

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:42.220
but we're not as interested
in those collections

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:44.570
as we are interested in the people.

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:46.630
We're interested in
the performances.

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:49.700
We're interested in the
idea of the show must go on.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:56.450
And so we had to really learn
a lot of the, the interests

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:59.570
and the driving needs of this area.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:02.460
We had to learn their
language as well,

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.610
learn the organizations
that were out there.

00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:06.450
So it was quite a learning curve.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:09.170
And that has, it's
been relatively steep,

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:12.590
but I think that it has been really
eye opening for all of the folks

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:14.020
from the preservation

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.160
and conservation centers
who are out there.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.850
And the other thing that is
great for me that I really love,

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:24.680
and I like, I look for this in
all the challenges that I take on,

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.400
and we look for this
in a lot of challenges

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.500
that my organization takes on.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:33.930
This is not something where
its 75 percent coming from the,

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:37.800
the preservation and
conservation community and 25

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.370
from the performing arts community.

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:43.720
On a daily basis it's, we
might be providing 51 percent

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.720
of the knowledge, and
then you have 49,

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.760 position:56%
and then it flip-flops the next day.

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:53.200
And so it is much more of a
two-way street than I think any

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.400
of the organizations expected when
we first started out the program.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:02.010
So it's a, it really is
open arms, and we're having

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:07.000
to open our arms very wide to make
sure we work with as many aspects

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.510
of the community as
possible and can provide

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:12.040
as much programmatic
support as possible as well.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:16.830
So it's, I think the learning curve
is something that has sort of been,

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.700
you know, eyes bigger
than your stomach type

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:21.120
of situation that we've had.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.530
But I think it is going well,
the research is going on well.

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:25.830
Andrew [assumed spelling].

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:28.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a question
about, you know, you were talking

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.190 position:56%
about some of these organizations
have really small numbers of people.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:33.490
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Yes.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.240
&gt;&gt; And I'm curious a
little bit about, like,

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.200
what you found the range
of the sizes of, you know,

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:43.110
if it was typically less
than three, typically less

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:45.910
than four, and people are ten.

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.650
You know, what sort of,
what that sweet spot was.

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:49.950
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Right.

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:51.540
&gt;&gt; also in relation to that,
I can see another issue

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:52.870
where there may just be,

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:56.040
particularly with the smaller
institutions, a real problem

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.140
with continuity of staff.

00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.440
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Yes.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.740
&gt;&gt; That particularly for
the, like you've described

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:04.820
as the non the non-producing --

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.120
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Right.

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.420
&gt;&gt; -- performers --

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.720
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Right.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.020
&gt;&gt; Where it may turn
over very quickly.

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.320
And I can see that being
a particular challenge

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.650
where there isn't that
continuity that you might have

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:16.560
in a collecting institution
just because you don't,

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.590
if you have a building and it kind
of stays there, and even if --

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:19.890
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Right.

00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:21.190
&gt;&gt; -- people move, the
stuff doesn't move.

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:22.490
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Right.

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:23.790
&gt;&gt; In this case you have a real,

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:26.400
if you have that real
loss of continuity.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.740
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: And we do
see quite a bit of difference

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.930
between the organizations that
do and don't have a facility.

00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:34.800
Some of the traveling organizations

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:38.270
that might not have a facility
do have a much smaller staff

00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:39.570
and infrastructure of people.

00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:43.410
And so they have especially
said, you know, we need to think

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:46.300
about how we can deal
with these situations.

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.620
And we need to think about when
we're going into another facility,

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:50.590
how to deal with these situations.

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.500
In some cases we are
working with some

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.800
of the performing arts
centers that are out there.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.560
And when I was doing my classes
in New Jersey one of the things

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:04.500
that I was most pleased was that,
sort of the sweet spot in working

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.200 position:56%
with many of these organizations is,

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:09.670
if they have an operations
manager, we're golden.

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:12.270
If they have an operations
manager who knows the building,

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:16.280
who knows a lot of the businesses,
who knows a lot of the technology

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.370
and things, that is very helpful.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.860
So it is a really wide
range, though.

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:24.600
We're working with organizations
that may have 15 to 20 people

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:28.900 position:56%
on staff, and we really need to look
at what can happen from everything

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:33.230
to building and community
disasters with them

00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:39.840
to these non-facility organizations
that may have two or three people,

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.240
may have one and a half people
like some of those that came

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.140
to a couple of our focus group.

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:48.530
And what we're suggesting with them
is to try to work collaboratively

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:51.920
with other performing arts groups,
to try to work collaboratively,

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:55.120
even with other cultural heritage
groups who might be able to help.

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.300
Because that's the same thing we
do with some of the smaller museums

00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.970
and historical societies.

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:03.910
When I go out and I'm working
with a number of states,

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:07.720
when they are that small, it's
going to be difficult in some cases

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.710
for them to even get to the
building and get into the building.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.180
And if there's heavy damage,
certainly it's not going

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.410
to be something that
one person can do.

00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:17.520
So that's important as well.

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:22.070
So those are one of, sort of a main
area or dividing line that I see

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.170
for different levels of service
that we need to have out there.

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:27.470
Yes.

00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:30.390
&gt;&gt; So with the workshops
and the individual systems,

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:33.390
are you also reaching out
to the emergency managers

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:36.480
that are associated with the cities
those cultural organizations are --

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.780
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: We are.

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:39.640
&gt;&gt; -- performing arts organizations
are in and connecting them

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:40.940
as part of the workshop, or?

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.240
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Yes.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:46.840
Yes. And one of the
best locations, I think,

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:52.340 position:56%
because they've had almost ten
years of doing this for the Alliance

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.790
for Response, has been Pittsburgh.

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:55.630
They've had a very active Alliance

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:57.860
for Response group
for years and years.

00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.770
And they are making ties already

01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:03.440
with the performing
arts organizations

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.080
who themselves have been
networking a little bit.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.510
And they have people from
Allegheny County and their region,

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:14.500 position:56%
Region 13 Emergency Preparedness and
Recovery area, that have been part

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.240
of Alliance for Response.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.280 position:56%
And they're saying now that Alliance
for Response may be expanding a bit

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.320
in the Pittsburgh area to include
performing arts organizations.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.900
Yes, they certainly want to be
there to work with organizations

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:31.400
that may have more people
than books inside their walls,

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.290
that may have more people than
artworks inside their walls.

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:36.330
So we're definitely
trying to do that.

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:40.480
I think, and I'm going to be really
candid here, that the Alliance

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.430 position:56%
for Response groups around the
country always need to be recruiting

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:48.380 position:56%
and working with emergency managers.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:52.570
You know, I would love to see what
I saw in Mississippi when we worked

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:54.160
with the Gulf Coast program

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.780
and there were more emergency
response folks in the room

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.380
than there were cultural
heritage folks

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.200 position:56%
in the room at that kickoff meeting.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.440 position:56%
If that could happen at meetings all

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.140
over the country, I'd
be really happy.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:10.660
So that still remains a key thing
for us to do while we're expanding

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.530
and enhancing these
community networks.

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:15.990
Jeanne, did you have?

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:18.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeanne Drewes: I was going to
ask you about mutual aid agreements.

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:21.700
Is that what you're developing
for these small institutions

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:24.380
where you want them to work
together because you've really got

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:28.360
to have something formal?

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.660
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Yes.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.960
&gt;&gt; For that agreement
that they need to --

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.260
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Yeah.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.180
We're working toward that,
I can put it that way.

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:39.860
You know, I would say areas like
San Diego that has had an Alliance

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.250
for Response group
for years and years

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:45.960
where they put together a
really good mutual aid compact.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.920
Those are some of the
models that are out there.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.570
Seattle and other cities as well.

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:54.820
We are trying, in organizations
and cities like New Orleans,

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:58.710
before they've even started
working on Alliance for Response,

01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:00.530
there were five or six
organizations there

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:02.890
that had been working
together on disaster planning.

01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:04.540
And they have been
trying to figure out how

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:07.490
to put together a mutual
aid network there.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:11.530
So I think that is going to
be one of the formal steps.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:15.460
It may not be during this first
three-year grant that we are able

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.760
to get that far, but
I hope it will be

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:22.400
because that definitely is an end
goal that we have for the program.

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:28.680
Other questions or anything from
the webinar participants at all?

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.980
&gt;&gt; Jeanne Drewes: One question,

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.710
which is to confirm whether
LYRASIS is already connected

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:35.750
to the Heritage Emergency
National Task Force.

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:37.050
&gt;&gt; Tom Clareson: Yes.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:38.490
We have, I'm a member.

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:44.220
And then there are other people
who are hoping to get training

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.550
and one person who has
been attending some

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:47.850
of the meetings as well.

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:52.340
So, yeah. We work with Heritage
Emergency National Task Force,

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.560
and certainly as part of
the board of the Foundation

01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.170
for the American Institute for
Conservation, I work to make sure

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:04.280
that our members, if we
have disaster concerns,

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.540
are plugged into being
able to work within HR.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:12.960
Any other questions?

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:19.030
If not, I would say, watch
this space, watch email to find

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:21.690
out about potential
grants, watch for some

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:23.900
of the community work
that's going on out there,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.580
and thank you very much
for both your attention

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.880
and your questions today.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.680
I really appreciate it.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.020
