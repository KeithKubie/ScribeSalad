&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.870
Hello I'm Ron Charles,
I'm the editor

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.020 position:56%
of the Washington Post Book Section,
I'm so glad you're here today

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.510
for the National Book Festival.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.410
First a word of thanks
to our co-chairman

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.370
of the festival David
Rubenstein and many other sponsors

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.000
who made this event possible.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.890
If you'd like to add your
support there is a note

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.830
about how you can donate
in your program.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.350
We will have time for questions
after we're done talking

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.270
and I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.630
to the mic you will become part

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.200
of the library's permanent
collection on video tape.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.070
So if you're in like a
witness relocation program

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.740
or something, just
stay in your chair.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.320
Today I have the great
honor of talking to one

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.510
of Americas literary
giants Joyce Carol Oates.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.890 position:56%
She began publishing in 1964 and
she's published more than 40 novels,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.210
along with dozens of
collections of short stories

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.070
and poetry and nonfiction.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.820
If I listed all the awards

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.470
and honors she has received we
would never have time to talk,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.750
but let me just give you a
sense of the breath of her work.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.350
Her short stories have won The
Rea Award, The PEN Malamud Award,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.650
The World Fantasy Award, The Bram
Stoker Awards, O Henry Awards.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.380
One of her novels was a Nobel,
was a National Book Award.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.100
She's been a frequent finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.400
The bookies keep telling
us she's going

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.640
to win the Nobel Prize some year.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.390
She won the Lifetime
Achievement Award

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.890
from the National Book
Critics Circle,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.470
along with a National
Humanities Medal in addition

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.990 position:56%
to all the wonderful books like them
and Blonde and I'll Take You There

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.660
and The Falls, she's taught and
encouraged generations of students

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.330
at Princeton University
and elsewhere.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.910
Some of these people you know,
like Jonathan Safran Foer

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.780
and Walter Curran and some
of them you don't know

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.890
like prisoners at San
Quentin Prison.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.260
Her latest books are a memoir
called, The Lost Landscape,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.620
A Writer Coming of Age and a novel
called A Man Without a Shadow.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.870
About a relationship between a
scientist and a famous amnesiac.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.940
It is so wonderful to
have you here today.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.810
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Thank
you, I'm very happy to be here.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank
you for doing this.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.360 position:56%
I should mention really that you're
most recent book came out this week,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.270
it's a collection of
your critical writings.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.870
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yes, yes.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's called
Soul at the White Heat,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.050
Inspiration Obsession
and the Writing Life.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.820
Now that title Soul at
the White Heat comes

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.560
from a Emily Dickinson poem.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.260
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yes
it's an Emily Dickinson poem,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.190
typically very passionate Emily
Dickinson poem that it's really

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.060
about the making of poetry.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.280 position:56%
You dare you see a soul at the white
heat, you know sort of come closer

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.950
and see the artist at
his or her creativity.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
what is that phrase mean

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.700
in your own life and your own work?

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.790
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well I think
it's something that sort of ran

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.690
through my mind, dare you
see a soul at the white heat,

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.360
first of all that seems to
suggest that we have souls,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.000
that we're spiritual beings, that
there's something almost impersonal

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.910
and transcendental about
us, that's not merely petty

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.250
and media, but something deeper.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.930
All those things that I think come
into play when we are imagining

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.810 position:56%
or we're immersing imagination we
sort of move away from the pettiness

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.040
and transience of life into
something more abiding and deeper,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.510
that has a kind of communal
feeling with other people.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In that
collection you mention that one

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.910
of the first short story
writers that really turned you

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.540
on to literature was
Ernest Hemingway?

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.840
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Oh yes.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Which
surprises me, I love your books,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.030
I don't think of you
like Ernest Hemingway.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.650
You seem very different.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.950
Very different.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.380
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well I
always teach Hemingway particularly

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.480
at the start of a writing workshop

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.200
and then the beginning
of a semester.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.420
A quintessential Hemingway
story like Indian Camp or Hills

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.440
like White Elephants it has
almost like a skeletal structure,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.470 position:56%
it's very pure and very clear, often
characters don't even have names.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.660
Maybe just a young
man or a young woman

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.230
and they have an intense dialogue
and their lives are changed.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.640
And maybe one or two pages,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.360
three pages long it's something
very beautifully wrought,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.380
almost a kind of calligraphy,
beautiful, beautiful writing

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.610
of selection and emphasis.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.310
Rather than a maximum of most
that has a lot of detail,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.100
this is a minimus art
that is very beautiful.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.070
So for a writer who is
more of a maximalist

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.910
who still have that
skeletal structure.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.020
I mean it may be three pages in
Hemingway but if you're a writer

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.480 position:56%
who wants to put more of the world
in and describe people and so forth,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.920
you basically still need that
structure and that trajectory

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.740
of peoples lives being changed.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You start
that way with a novel?

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.700
Do you have it that paired down?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.630
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: I always have
the ending, I have the beginning

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.510
and the trouble is the middle.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.540
[ Laughter ]

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.740
Yeah. I'd like to have a title,
a beginning and an ending.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.760 position:56%
The title, the title, the
beginning and the ending have a kind

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.740
of triangular architectural
relationship so it's

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.410
like a center of gravity
that's fixed.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.640
And you know what you're doing,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.500
as you go through the novel
you have a destination

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.330
and you know what you're doing.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your
publisher doesn't come along

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.930 position:56%
and say no Joyce we want this title,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.850
this title didn't pan well
with our test audience?

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.160
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well
that hasn't happened yet.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In one of those
essays you write the most serious

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.580
and productive artists are
haunted by their material.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.880
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yes.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Haunted, were
you just being hyperbolic

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.950
or do you mean haunted?

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.300
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well
you can't really write

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.420
or have much art that's
galvanized by emotion

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.430
if you haven't really
identified with it,

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.320
you know in some unconscious way.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.240
So people all have true stories,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.850
they have their own true
voice and a true stories.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.900
And some people come to these
true stories immediately

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.210
when they're young.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.570
Others have to sort
of work toward it.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.820
I mean there are very well
known and brilliant writers,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.330
I think like Tony Morrison
maybe published her first novel

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.930
when she was 40.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.260
Then there are some
writers who come along

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.880
and they get their true subjects
when they're 20 you know.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.020
I'm not sure why that's
so different,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.090
sometimes the life intervenes,
especially for women.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.880
They may get married, have children
and then the sort of latency

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.540
of what they have to say will
come out later when they're not

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.660
so distracted by real life.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Does
writing help exercise

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.850
that haunted feeling for you?

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.310
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: I don't
know if it exercises it,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:02.690
it kind of exercises it you know
and makes it, puts it in a context,

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.180
some of the most thrilling
writing that we can read is,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.030
it comes from the heart and I'm
not sure that it's cathartic,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.900
it sort of dramatizes
our human condition

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.480
of interacting with one another.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.590
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: You
know like a typical play

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.940
or Shakespearean tragedy, people
come together and they interact

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.340
and out of their relationship
was seen as created.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.290
And out of our relations with
people stories are created,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.620
real stories in our lives.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.450
People who meet and then they
have these relationships,

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.910
their whole lives may be bound
up together forever you know.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.450
It may have seemed like
an accidental meeting.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.910
So life is like a mimicry of a bar.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Speaking of
haunted, you are, you were,

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.910
you may still be the only woman

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.800
to receive the Horror Writers
Associations Bram Stoker Award?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.740
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
I'm not the only one.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're
not the only one any more,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.040
you were the first woman.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.340
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Oh was I?

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.940
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
The first woman?

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.450
Oh I didn't realize that.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And you've
edited HP Lovecraft's work.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.530
You've written some
fantastic stories yourself,

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.370
along with some terrific Gothic
novels I adored The Accursed.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.890
I just talked to Stephen
King he adored that too.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.090
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Oh that's so nice.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.690
What draws you to horror?

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.650
To the Gothic sensibility?

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.020
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well Gothic
sensibility is almost entirely a

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.760
literary sensibility.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
do you mean by that?

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.360
Explain that to us.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.660
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
There aren't really,

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.960
there were never really
any haunted houses so.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh no Joyce.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.690
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: If
you're writing a novel

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.300
about haunted houses , vampires,
werewolf's and so forth,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.320
you are not looking
back to an actual,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.150
you're where these things happen.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.700
You're looking back to literature.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.090
It's the most traditional of all
the forms is Gothic literature,

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.050
it pays homage to a predecessors.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.280
You're probably looking back to
Edgar Allan Poe or Lovecraft.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.180
And so or you might be
looking back to Emily Bronte,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.920
sort of a little bit of the
Gothic in the Bronte writings.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.520
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: So it's
a traditional literature that's

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.910
respectful of predecessors.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
this attracts you to it?

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yes I think if
we think of the image of the vampire

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:34.100
for instance, we are probably
talking in psychological terms

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:39.130
about a class structure in which
there are people at the bottom,

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.980
disenfranchising and powerless,
they may have been peasants

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.750
in Europe or [inaudible].

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.630
And up here you have the land
owner or you have the nobleman

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:58.510
and this could be quote Count
Dracula and so the vampire saga

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:04.790
or image or epic is
actually a social

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.110
and psychological commentary
on human life.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.690
So the vampire who's
Dracula is the nobleman,

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.550
he's sucking the blood
of the common people.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:22.380 position:56%
He's taking the life, he's taking
the young people, this is just a way

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.730
of talking about politics.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.980
But it's a Gothic troll.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.380
Then the werewolf we think

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.630
as probably a dramatization very
literal, you know like fur coming

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.660
out of the face and so forth.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:42.030
Of the, what Freud would call the
id in human beings, the unconscious

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.520
that comes out is rapacious
and can be quite evil

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.290
and destructive and
self destructive.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.520
So the werewolf as a
symbol is a dramatization

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.260
of something that's
psychological and quite normal.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would you admit that
there's a certain element of comedy

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.290
in some of your Gothic novels?

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.820
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yes my novels
are postmodernist novels cause I'm

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.570
writing at a time when I could not
write a Gothic novel because it's,

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.920 position:56%
in literary history if we're writing
about a vampire we can't be writing

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.410
about a vampire for the first time.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.950
You're in a whole tradition.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.550
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.240
So your vampire should be a little
different from the other vampires.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.910
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: But the first
vampire in Bram Stoker's Dracula,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:38.530
that first vampire was
partially like a bat,

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.450
you remember you've seen
Nosferatu that film.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.520
He's actually a human being

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.280
but partly also an animal
a bat, sucking blood.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:54.440
Then the vampire image as it
was sort of modified became more

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.080
and more a seductive image.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.160
Like there was nothing
seductive about Nosferatu.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.580
It was really pretty awful.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.130
But the idea of a seductive

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:10.920
and handsome Dracula this would
be Bela Lugosi in the movies,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.980
some people may have not thought
he was terribly attractive

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.010
but I'm partly Hungarian so.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:23.220
My expectations are a little
different from people.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.190
So that's kind of interesting
that the Nosferatu image starts

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.780
out as repellent and animal,

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.850
but then it gets modified
in more romantic.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.570
So then the Twilight novels
for young readers I believe,

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.950
the Twilight novels will
show a very handsome vampire.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.850
So that's interesting
that that evolved.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And you add
elements of comedy to that?

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.640
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: In my novel
The Accursed yes the vampire is

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.170
obviously a romantic figment
of womens imaginations,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.480
women are imaging this,
this person who is

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.230
so incredibly handsome,
I mean it seems silly.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes but funny.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.830
Yes.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.630
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yeah it's
funny, if you know any real men.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.140
[ Laughter ]

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.440
It's like.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Which
some of you do.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.510
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
I mean a real man,

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.750
an actual human man doesn't
look or act like this,

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.940
this is like a silly
image or an idealized man

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.580
but actually I'm getting
in trouble here.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.640
But my husbands not
actually here so.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:34.410
I mean that we, domestic realism is
probably the hardest genre in which

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.650
to write because you're dealing
with realism, real people, children

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.620
and marriage and so forth.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.780
It's a little harder to
write in that mode than it is

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.350
to write these romantic modes

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.150
where all the you know the negative
things are sort of airbrushed out,

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:54.550
everybody is handsome, their
relationships are operatic,

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:58.230
rather than what we get in daily
life which I won't go into.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.920
It's not operatic though.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Let's talk about
that tension with the reality

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.410
and fantasy, your two most recent
books except for the collection,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.360
your memoir and The Man
Without a Shadow both have to do

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.260
with fragility of memory would you?

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.410
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yes The
Man Without a Shadow is literally

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.840
about a man who has
lost part of his brain

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.750
and has been injured
with encephalitis.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.240 position:56%
Which causes swelling of the brain
and part of the brain can be damaged

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.730
and then your short
term memory is affected.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.790
But his long term memory
was not affected

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.310
so he's 37 when that happened.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.240
He has all the memory up
until when he's 37 and then

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.590
after that he has a
memory of only 70 seconds.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So it's sort of
the opposite of the memoirs problem

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.520
who can remember everything
more recently

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.600
but has more trouble
remembering distant events.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.110
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well no the
memoirs the human brain is equipped

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.790
to remember distant
things most accurately,

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:03.020
you can't really remember what
you had to eat last week much.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.700
You don't remember your
dreams of probably last night,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.220
most of us have forgotten.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.440
But you will remember
your first grade class.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.220
Some people can shut their
eyes and go around the room

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.430
and remember the sixth
grade classroom,

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.360
where everybody sat in the seat.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.940
And that's the what the brain
is, our brain is equipped

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.150
to remember things that
go way way way back.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:32.210
Our first, our parents, our
first friends, things that happen

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.710
when we were very young
and when we learn language.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: We have a
grip of language that's very strong.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: As you wrote
those autobiographical essays

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.360
that you collected in that
memoir, didn't you sometimes wonder

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.780
if your remembered
things accurately?

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.780
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well I
mention it often in my memoir.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.380
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
There's a kind of amnesia

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.150
between the ages I think of,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:16:00.510
well until a child is
five or six years old.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.010
There's a time in there where we
really don't remember anything.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.430
Some memoirs we pretend
to remember things

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.970
but it's not, it's
not really likely.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.420
We can both jar our memories
by looking at snapshots.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.760
The photographs are very.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Are we
creating memories or bolstering?

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.500
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Well in my novel The Man

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.770
Without a Shadow this
person has lost

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.880
as I said his memory
for forming new.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.270 position:56%
So the experiments with these people
which are being conducted mostly

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.470
with HM you've probably
read about them.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.680
These experiments are
very interesting.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.860
For instance you put, you put a
wristwatch, you give a watch to one

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:47.890
of these amnesiac patients and you
ask him oh where did you get that?

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:53.010
Now he won't remember, he doesn't
really know how that got there,

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:58.130
but he will say, oh
I've always had this.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.790
Or he'll say somebody gave
it to me for my birthday,

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.700
in other words we make
up, we make up reasons,

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:10.960
we don't really have the memory
but we make up a plausible answer.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.770 position:56%
When people are interviewed, often
people have no idea how they answer.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:21.970
So we make up plausible
reasonable sane sounding answers.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.130 position:56%
Unless we want to be really wild and
crazy and like running for president

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.510
and make up all kinds of.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:33.700
[ Laughter ]

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.080
But we sort of most of us make
up plausible answers and then

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.190
after we've made them
up we remember those

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.490
and so the next time
we give those answers.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like tell me about
the inspiration for your book.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.420
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Yeah some things

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.520
like that the inspiration
people often don't know how

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.820
to answer these.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So they
just make something up.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well why did
you follow, why did you fall in love

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.100
with that particular
person and get married?

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.770
Well you know in a way you
don't know how to answer

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:05.740
that so you say well the
first time I saw him or her,

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.090
so you kind of make
a little narrative.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:13.020 position:56%
But then the next time you're asked
you have the narratives right there.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Seems
plausible even believable.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.300
Isn't that what the memoirist does?

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.010
Is project a kind of
reasonable narrative

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.700
over the disordered
events of his life?

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.000
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
That completely depends

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.550
on a narrator and on the memoirist.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.670
Some people will go back and
assiduously and do a research.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.300 position:56%
Some people just kind of make it up.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.900
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: There
are wonderful memoirist

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.210
like Frank McCourt and
Mary Karr and some others,

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.560
they're really wonderful.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.500
But I notice they have
a lot of dialogue

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.410
and remembering you know
with quotation marks.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.960
I'm not sure how realistic that is.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.830
But obviously they are
remembering an emotional atmosphere

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.350 position:56%
and the putting in what's plausible.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.390
Now this is just one example the
kind of research you do for a book

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.690
and a lot of your books seem

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.820
to require this kind of
specialized research.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.120
Is that the case?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.090
You do research for
novels for fiction?

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.390
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Well it depends

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.630 position:56%
on pretty much on what the novel is.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.830
The Man Without a Shadow,
I certainly did research

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:20.820
and my husband is a neuroscientist
so in his study at home our shelves

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.380
of these books on neuroscience
and memory, the science of memory.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.260
Which is really interesting
to read about.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:34.750
And on HM, Suzanne Corkin's book
on HM, the Permanent Present Tense,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.420
a person who living
in the present tense.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.440
That was a book that I read, I knew
Suzanne Corkin, though not well.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.500
But she is a distinguished
neuroscientist at MIT who died

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.410
about a year ago or even less.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.020
So I've read that book,

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.030
but basically when you're
writing a novel you're sort

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:58.430
of populating a mythical world
with people who are acting

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.970
out a story that's plausible
in terms of yourself,

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.980
you know like would I say this,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.060
would I do this, how
realistic is this?

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:13.310
So my writing tends to have a
psychological realistic parameter.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:20.260
I don't go outside the plausibility
of psychological realism.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.560
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But the characters

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.160
in your novels frequently
experience things more dramatic

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.910
than the events of your own life?

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.210
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Yes that's true.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Frequently?

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.810
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yes.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.110
Yes.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your
own life has been

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.710
from the outside it
looks relatively pleasant

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.080
and unviolated and successful.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.390
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well we all
suffer losses, you know the losses

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:43.670
that we suffer in our families
are, can be catastrophic,

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.890
they're not unusual
because we all suffer them.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: True.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.490
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: But one loss

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.690
in your life that's profound
may be quite enough you know.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.290
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: It's not,

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.740
you're not having experience
like Macbeth or Othello.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:05.710
It's not a dramatized, you're
not representative of an empire.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.310
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: But
it's only domestic life but

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.130
yet it can cut very deep.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.480
For a half century after the
pass to the Civil Rights Act,

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.950
we're still trying to create a
society where everybody's treated

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.360
with respect and equally.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.660
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
That's so true.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You've returned to
this theme in many of your novels

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.480
for a long time, what
draws you to that subject?

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.850
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Have
returned to that in my Tweets.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:33.420
Well it is sort of astonishing
that after the 1960's

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.480
and people actually died, they
actually sacrificed themselves for,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.170
you know the idea of Civil Rights

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.310
and everybody should
be treated equally.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:47.420
That still in 2016 we're still
sort of working this out.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:54.040
It's a little bit, maybe a little
dispiriting, however we persevere.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.980
It just seems very natural.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.300
If you are a woman writer, you
do have a natural proclivity

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.210 position:56%
to identify with women and girls so.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:11.060
Those stories are abiding and
are still being dramatized.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's a weird
tension I noticed in response

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.330
to literature, authors,
white authors are encouraged

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:20.020
to stop writing such monochromatic
books, to include people of color.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.970
And at the same time, they're
brought up, they're criticized

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.820
for presuming that they
can imagine the lives

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.560
of people not like themselves.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.380 position:56%
How does a author negotiate those
two seemingly contradictory demands?

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.020
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Well it's a good question.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.100
I know Jonathan Franzen
has been often criticized

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.630 position:56%
for writing only about white people.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:45.190
Especially white men, especially
people like himself I suppose.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.700
But he's and John Updike for the
most part wrote about himself

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.020
and James Joyce and some others.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.250
But the idea of writing about
yourself is a kind of safe thing

00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:01.040
to do and you shouldn't therefore
be at risk for making mistakes

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.310
because you know, what
your perspective is.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.910
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: But
then somebody will say oh

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.290
but you only wrote about white men,
you know John Updike only wrote

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:12.710
about these small number of people.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.610
And doesn't matter so much
that he did write beautifully

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.450
and Jonathan Franzen writes with
a certain degree of passion,

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.440
but if they try to write
about other people,

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.880
then of course they'd be
devastatingly criticized

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.260
for daring to go outside that.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:34.640
But I think it's just part of the
risks that you take being a artist.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.960
Most artists are transgressive and
they do bring a lot of criticism.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.130
A Stravinsky's Rite of Spring for
instance people were fist fighting,

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.840
fighting on screen
and in the audience

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.440
and the whole thing
had to be shut down.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.670
Now we hear The Rite of
Spring it's actually thrilling

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.230
and exciting music you
know it's really exciting

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.290
with those strange rhythms.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:00.550
But at that time it was offensive
to some ears and upsetting

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:04.510
so people got in fist
fights in the audience.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:12.740
But Stravinsky persevered
and so his music exists now,

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.420
people who are writing music that
was more comfortable to the ear,

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.410
audiences didn't fight,
those people maybe forgotten.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right, that's true.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.960
Do you think fiction has
some sort of social function,

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.930
some sort of social responsibility
to bring about a more just society

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.230
or does that sound awful to you?

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.920
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Oh
all artists are individuals

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.320
and I was prescribed for anybody.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.980
So I think what, I think the charge
of cultural appropriation comes

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:48.150
from people who need to have
their perspective given attention

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.770
and respect.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:56.200
So I wouldn't say that writers
should write about anything.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.610
We should write about what
you want to write about.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.280
First of all you can only write
about things you care about.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: And if John
Updike really really cared very very

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.150
much about his own family,
particularly his mother.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.340
He wrote often about his
own mother and his father,

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.950
but he wrote so lovingly
and beautifully.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:18.180
It would be really wrong and almost
wasteful of him to have tried

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:23.140
to write from a point of view
of you know Chinese American

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.300
or lesbian women or something.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.670
And kind of dealing with something
else, it's just not natural.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.600
So I don't think people should
be criticized for what they write

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.190
or what they don't write.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.890
I think that's something that
is very private in individual.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What about you?

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.300
Do you feel some social
impulsing or fiction,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:47.440
some sort of argument you're
making Upton Sinclair like?

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.370
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Well sometimes I do,

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.040
yeah I feel that when
I write a novel,

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.710
that I should from my own
self, not for anybody else,

00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:01.640 position:56%
I feel I should dramatize a group of
people rather than just individuals.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.680
And I almost never write a novel
that's only really very very

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.270
intensely personal.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.660
But always be about some
representative people

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.140
in a political and social context.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.810
So they might represent
more than just themselves.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We spoke a few weeks
ago you said, in the last decade

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:23.100
or so, I'm much more interested
in letting other people talk.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.400
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yes.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Whereas

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.000
when I started I was
writing in my own voice.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.300
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yes.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Tell me about
what you mean other people talk?

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.810
It all sounds, I mean
it's all your voice.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.420
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well if
you'll look at a typical novel

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.880
by Henry James, particularly
a later work

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.110
of Henry James is beautifully
written,

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.340
the language is all Henry James.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.750
It doesn't matter which novel
you read it will be Henry James's

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.570
narrative voice and that's
a very beautiful voice.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:54.550 position:56%
Then you look at James Joyce's
Ulysses and there's a certain rhythm

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.530
of Joyce and language that prevails
in everything he writes about.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.870
Each chapter is pretty different
and as you go through Ulysses

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.660
and the different hours of the
day, he takes you through a number

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.390
of voices that are, that
are different and it ends

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.730
with Molly Bloom which
is a very different kind

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.460
of sort of female voice.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, yes.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.370
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Possibly
based on maybe his own wife,

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.300
who is sort of a nonintellectual
person.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.040
So those are two ways of writing.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.210
Hemingway, [inaudible] is
always Hemingway's voice.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:33.030 position:56%
But Louise Erdrich would have novels

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.350
where each chapter is
a different person.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.900
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: And I'm
drawn to that kind of writing

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:44.210
where each person in a novel
gets kind of voice of his

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.440
or her own rather than
it all be my voice.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And you've developed
into that, it interest you more now

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.680
than it did when you started?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.980
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yeah,

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.280
well when I started I wouldn't
have been able to do that.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Interesting.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.290
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: For
instance in a play by Shakespeare

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.240
or Bic Burghley [assumed
spelling] or Chekhov

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:04.750
or you know really anyone
that's a dramatist voice,

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.840 position:56%
there are different voices on stage.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.110
Cleopatra does sound
different from Julius Caesar

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.800
and Marc Anthony sounds
different from somebody else.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.550
You know basically nobody would
expect them all to sound alike.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.510
But with a Henry James
novel or Faulkner,

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.220
most of Faulkner there's
one narrative voice you know

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.010
and it's quite a difference and if

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.360
when you're writing you're
sort of choosing that voice.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So when you
are constructing a novel,

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.200
you think of these different voices

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.740
as separate consciousnesses
as you write?

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.570
You're like a playwright
or an actress.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yeah, yeah the
novel I'm writing now each chapter

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.640
has a different character, there
are probably eight characters

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.540
and I go through them all.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.130 position:56%
And some of them are really fun to
write because they're kind of nasty.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:59.020
And I sort of discover
this person is so sarcastic

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.760
and really kind of funny.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Now wait
I have to stop you there.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.360
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
And that's not me.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You discover that?

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.960
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: As I get

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.760
into the character she's really
getting nastier all the time

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.660
but having fun.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.840
Yeah it's a little bit of a
discovery after a few weeks.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.180
Then another person is a nice
person you know and nice people we

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.130
like to have them around
but they're kind of boring.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.320
They're sort of boring in a
novel so you don't want to stay

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.890
with a nice person to long you
sort of move on to another person.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:31.390
And a person who doesn't know what
he's actually thinking or doing

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.170
on a person governed by the
unconscious is very exciting

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:38.030
to write because that person
doesn't know as much as you know

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.250
and he starts to discover.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.030
They're all really different.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.690
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So if you're
discovering as you work

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:48.950
through the novel, then you go
back and rewrite the early parts

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.450
of the novel knowing more
than you did when you started?

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.000
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well no I
write each chapter is pretty much

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.300
polished and I do a lot
revisions chapter by chapter.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Chapter
by chapter okay.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.540
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: For instance
in my next novel that comes

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.460
out in 2017, it's called.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.590
A Book of American Martyr's
and they're two families,

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:12.370
one is evangelical christian
family, they're very antiabortion

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:15.920
and they're involved in
antiabortion activism.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.240
But then the other
family is a secular family

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.290
and the father is a
abortion provider so.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.900 position:56%
It's basically two ways of looking
at America and there's a young woman

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:33.460
in the novel, a girl who becomes a
young woman who's actually a boxer

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.420
and she becomes, we see
here kind of training

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.720
and she has her first fight.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:44.440
And that sensibility of a girl
of 18 or so becoming a boxer,

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.280
so different from my
own life you know.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:53.200
For me to write about here was
so, so satisfying and so kind

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.200
of wonderful like I got to
know a different person.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.230
But they're other people in
a novel who are more educated

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.720
and they're maybe at
universities and more like myself,

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.570
I'm a university person so.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:11.090
There's a satisfaction in selecting
and enhancing a voice different

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.180
from your own that
has its own poetry.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.180
Or she's not that well educated but
she has her own sharp sensibility.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And you respect her?

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.060
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Absolutely.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What about those
evangelical antiabortionists?

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.140
I imagine they do not line with
your own particular attitudes.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.400
How do you keep from treating
them in a pejorative way?

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.700
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Oh but they're point

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.010
of view they are very idealistic.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How do
you in the novel keep them

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.840
from looking like buffoons?

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.960
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: I don't think
they are, I think they're acting

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.600
from their own idealism
which is some cases

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.030
extraordinarily courageous.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:51.600
It's different from others,
like a person who goes

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.820
out to assassinate someone
for a political or idealistic

00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.830 position:56%
or religious reasons and throws
away his own life, that is something

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:04.900
that we don't want to do
when we don't think it's,

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.190
it's not good to do, it's
illegal and so forth.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.850
From that point of view though
the person is basically a martyr.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:15.950
You know like that's what martyr's
did and that's what martyr's are.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.120
They threw away their
own lives for some ideal.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.170
And while I don't think I would
ever do anything like that,

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:28.050
I'm very fascinated by that kind
of strange perhaps tragic courage.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So the novel works

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.330
to the extent you can extend your
own sympathies to each character?

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.630
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: I
wouldn't' write about people

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.970
that I didn't like and respect.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: About 40 years ago,

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.090
40 years ago The Paris Review asked
you about the burdens of fame.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.390
And you said.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.780
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
40 years ago wow.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You said I'm not
really aware of being famous,

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:53.230
I enjoy a certain degree
of invisibility.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:54.530
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Yes that's true.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You do not now,
I mean you are truly famous now.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.000
Is it fun?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.300
Is it a burden?

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.970
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well when
I go home and my cats are there

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.510
and the cats are so unimpressed.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.070
[ Laughter ]

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.950
I think there are two kinds
of people, it doesn't matter

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:14.190
if you're famous or not, but
dog people and cat people.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.240
Now the dog people
are always famous,

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.130
you walk in the dog comes licking

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:24.390 position:56%
and you can be the most boring
person, the dog is just kissing you.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.330
On the other hand you
can be very famous

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:31.080
but the cats just they're
yawning you know they're washing,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.380
they have other things to do.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:38.530 position:56%
But they come, finally they come
over and purr a little bit you know.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:43.000
Kind of slowly and just
to humor you, they purr.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.240
So I think anybody who's a cat
person never really gets a swollen

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.770
head, but we're always
kind of humble.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice, very nice.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.960
You wrote a very funny piece
in The Post a couple years ago.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.260
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Yes that was fun.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:58.560
That was for you I think.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It was, it was.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.790
A woman stopped you
in the grocery store

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.520
and said are you some
kind of writer or what?

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.000
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yeah.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And you,
you said I shook my head no

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.270
as if I had not heard.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:12.750
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
At the moment I was just

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.160
in the grocery store you know

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.140
like the moment I really wasn't
ready to talk about anything.

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:22.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You, I mean we think
of you as a writer but you said

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:25.690
that when you're given a form to
fill out you always write teacher.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:26.990
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Teacher.

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:28.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What is it you've
enjoyed over career as a teacher?

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.460
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well
I always loved school,

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.300
when I was really little
like six years old

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:38.530
and first grade I absolutely loved
my teacher and I loved the world

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:41.970
of school with books and
seats and desks and all that.

00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:43.550
So I think I always wanted

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.940
to be a teacher before I
knew about being a writer.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.040
And I've always really admired
teachers especially the kind

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.240
of teachers who do really
exhausting teaching.

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.890 position:56%
Now I teach in a university and my
students are actually all wonderful.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:02.430
I have wonderful students,
it's a pleasure to teach them.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.050
So I'm thinking about teachers
who really have to work,

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:08.590
who have students struggling
with literacy.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.520
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Struggling with problems at home,

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.140
teachers who give so
much of their lives

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.030
and teaching everyday
like five days a week.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.830
And most university professors
may teach two or three days a week

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:22.750
or one day a week you know.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.140
So I'm very admiring of
that kind of teaching.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And you took on
voluntarily sort of adventure

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.510
in teaching, to go
teach in San Quentin.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.840
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: San
Quentin that was interesting.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What drew
you take on that adventure?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.300
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Well please don't think

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.360
that I was terribly naive but
I thought I would like to work

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.410
with women, incarcerated women.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:45.160
And so we went out there
to San Quentin and I found

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.720 position:56%
out they're no women in San Quentin.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I didn't know that.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.010
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: And my
husband who is a neuroscientist

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.760
since he was teaching with
introduction to biology.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:01.500
So I was a little bit surprised but
I so often mistaken about things

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.600
in life that I sort of pretend.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.970
You know oh of course.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:08.770
Of course I'm happy
to teach these men.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.820
And they were mostly
lifers and they've turned

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.810 position:56%
out to be really interesting people.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Really?

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:16.410
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
And very serious.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Serious students?

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.010
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Serious students.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.820
In California in the prison system
is something called the Prison

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.730
University Program.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:28.720
With capital letters, that is a
degree granting program probably

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.530
unique to the California
prison system.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.880
You won't find that
in all the states

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.480
and some states you won't find
even you know any courses.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.350
And so they, the prisoners who
get this degree it's equivalent

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:43.860
to a community college degree.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh nice.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.460
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
So all the prisoners

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.210
in the program are very
serious and hardworking.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:50.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They were literate?

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:52.170
They could read?

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:55.600
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: They were
in this program but we didn't see,

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.220
we didn't see everyone
in San Quentin.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No I'm
sure, you know as we heard,

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.730
the terrible statistics
about literacy but and how,

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:04.560
it must have been kind of
contrast from Princeton students

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.830
to these people who
have very rough lives.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.800
How did you find them as students?

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.140
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Well it's
a different kind of situation

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:16.140
for a person in San Quentin which
is a maximum security prison,

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.000
who's maybe, he's a lifer,
that like 30 years to life,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.210
it doesn't mean they're in for
life, it means that they might be

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.650
but they're all working for parole.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.830
They're working hard
for parole and they're,

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.380
none of them thought they were
innocent, they didn't pretend

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.160
or claim to be innocent,
they come to terms

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.280
with the fact they made mistakes.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.140
Some of them made mistakes
when they were like 17 or 18

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:43.770
and now they're 30, five or
40, my oldest student was 61.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:47.200
They have a long time to think
about the mistakes that they made

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.200
so they was serious students.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.920
Very different, I mean much older
than my Princeton students so.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.210
The comparison is very,
it's a difficult comparison

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:00.700
because the Princeton students are
very young and they've had lives

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.520
in which they've always
been in school.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
they've always done well.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.250
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
They've always done well.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.540
Yeah and the prisoners have
had probably tragic lives

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:13.300
and from broken homes and
discontinuous school and different.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What an
opportunity for both of you.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.060
Both groups, you and these men.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.360
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Yeah and then

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.940
when I edited Prison Noir a
few years later I used a story

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.900
by one of my former students.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: From the prison?

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.500
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
From that prison.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
great, that's great.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.100
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
Then I looked at stories

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.630
from all the many many
prisons in the United States

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:37.000
and Michigan is a very
good state for education.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.840
Many many of our applicants and
submissions came from Michigan.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.020
And there were many states
where there was nothing,

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.410
like there was no, no
courses in writing at all.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.250
New York State has some but you,

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.820
not surprisingly not as
much as other states.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's been such
a pleasure to talk to you,

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.450
would you take some questions
from the audience now?

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:58.750
Would you mind?

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.550
There are two microphones here.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.000
One, we have time for one question.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.030
Guess it will be sir.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:10.740
&gt;&gt; I thought I actually learned
something in one of your novels.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.860
About a man I thought I knew
something about, Woodrow Wilson.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.280
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Oh
yes quite a character.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.760
&gt;&gt; Quite a character and I
wondered how much license did you

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.180
give yourself?

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.660
Did you give yourself
fictional license?

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.180
Did you merely embellish?

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:33.120
This is the man, how much of you,

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.620
your visceral reaction
to Woodrow Wilson?

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.990
And to what he represented
then in how he acted?

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:41.290
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates:
That's a good question,

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:45.090
this is what my novel The Accursed
in which Woodrow Wilson at the time

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.090
in 1906 was President
of Princeton University.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:51.210
Well I did a lot research
and I read his letters.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.320
And his, some of his letters I
take and sort of change the words

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.900
around a little bit but
those are his words.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.370
You know he was, I don't want
to completely criticize him

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:03.460
because he was a man of his time.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.760
So he was a sexist, he was a male
chauvinist, he was anti Semite

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.060
and he was a racist okay.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:15.960
That's just the way they were
but he was also a reformist,

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.530
he was intelligent, he
reformed Princeton University.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.600
He did a lot of things, I
mean it's shocking today

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.300
that somebody who's a racist
also did some good things but at

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:30.170
that time it wasn't, it more
or less the way people were.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:34.290
So a lot of things that are funny
that he says he actually said.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.890
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:39.190
&gt;&gt; Joyce Carol Oates: Thank you.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Been such a pleasure
to have you here, thank you so much

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:41.990
