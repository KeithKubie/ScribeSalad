00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.380
 
the work of Stella archeology really

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390
the work of Stella archeology really
 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.580
the work of Stella archeology really
goes to the heart of the we are Stardust

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590
goes to the heart of the we are Stardust
 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.780
goes to the heart of the we are Stardust
when we are children of the stars

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
when we are children of the stars
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.209
when we are children of the stars
statement you've probably heard it all

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
statement you've probably heard it all
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.060
statement you've probably heard it all
but what does it actually mean we are

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
but what does it actually mean we are
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.179
but what does it actually mean we are
mostly made all humans and all life

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
mostly made all humans and all life
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.779
mostly made all humans and all life
forms that we know of made mostly of

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
forms that we know of made mostly of
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.599
forms that we know of made mostly of
carbon and a bunch of other elements but

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
carbon and a bunch of other elements but
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.419
carbon and a bunch of other elements but
in much lesser quantities where does

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
in much lesser quantities where does
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790
in much lesser quantities where does
this carbon come from well you could say

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
this carbon come from well you could say
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.850
this carbon come from well you could say
it comes from the earth and yes that is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
it comes from the earth and yes that is
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.660
it comes from the earth and yes that is
true but how did it get into the earth

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
true but how did it get into the earth
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.660
true but how did it get into the earth
right and so that is where astronomy

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
right and so that is where astronomy
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.229
right and so that is where astronomy
comes in because there are multiple

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239
comes in because there are multiple
 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.720
comes in because there are multiple
so-called nucleosynthesis processes that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
so-called nucleosynthesis processes that
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.340
so-called nucleosynthesis processes that
create elements heavy elements they fuse

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
create elements heavy elements they fuse
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.979
create elements heavy elements they fuse
lighter ones into heavier ones starting

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
lighter ones into heavier ones starting
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.430
lighter ones into heavier ones starting
with hydrogen four hydrogen atoms come

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
with hydrogen four hydrogen atoms come
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.310
with hydrogen four hydrogen atoms come
together and fuse into a helium atom and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
together and fuse into a helium atom and
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.039
together and fuse into a helium atom and
if you throw helium three helium atoms

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
if you throw helium three helium atoms
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.240
if you throw helium three helium atoms
together you get a carbon nucleus and

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250
together you get a carbon nucleus and
 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.679
together you get a carbon nucleus and
this is how carbon is created and we are

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689
this is how carbon is created and we are
 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.770
this is how carbon is created and we are
establishing how much carbon was created

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
establishing how much carbon was created
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.050
establishing how much carbon was created
at various times in the universe and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
at various times in the universe and
 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.510
at various times in the universe and
through which processes and through

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
through which processes and through
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.660
through which processes and through
which in which types of stars and in

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
which in which types of stars and in
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.230
which in which types of stars and in
what evolutionary phases of the star

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
what evolutionary phases of the star
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.710
what evolutionary phases of the star
system happens and so this is how we can

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
system happens and so this is how we can
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.190
system happens and so this is how we can
piece together the chemical evolution of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
piece together the chemical evolution of
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.020
piece together the chemical evolution of
the universe that was really the the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
the universe that was really the the
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.710
the universe that was really the the
basis for any biological evolution to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
basis for any biological evolution to
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.069
basis for any biological evolution to
take place on earth and I find it really

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
take place on earth and I find it really
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.580
take place on earth and I find it really
exciting to to go back and really look

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
exciting to to go back and really look
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.330
exciting to to go back and really look
at the at the constituents of life

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340
at the at the constituents of life
 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.039
at the at the constituents of life
separately and we have studied not just

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
separately and we have studied not just
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.679
separately and we have studied not just
carbon but also nitrogen and phosphorus

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
carbon but also nitrogen and phosphorus
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.370
carbon but also nitrogen and phosphorus
and sulfur and oxygen and iron and all

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
and sulfur and oxygen and iron and all
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.490
and sulfur and oxygen and iron and all
the different elements through our work

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
the different elements through our work
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.800
the different elements through our work
and stellar archaeology and actually if

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
and stellar archaeology and actually if
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.670
and stellar archaeology and actually if
you come to think about it the body is

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
you come to think about it the body is
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.550
you come to think about it the body is
not just made of carbon but also a lot

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
not just made of carbon but also a lot
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.460
not just made of carbon but also a lot
of water and there is hydrogen and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
of water and there is hydrogen and
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.700
of water and there is hydrogen and
oxygen in the water and well we know

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710
oxygen in the water and well we know
 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.820
oxygen in the water and well we know
oxygen also comes from the stars you add

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830
oxygen also comes from the stars you add
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.620
oxygen also comes from the stars you add
another helium nucleus to a carbon

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630
another helium nucleus to a carbon
 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.410
another helium nucleus to a carbon
nucleus and you get an oxygen nucleus

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420
nucleus and you get an oxygen nucleus
 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.200
nucleus and you get an oxygen nucleus
but the water the the hydrogen that's

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210
but the water the the hydrogen that's
 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.050
but the water the the hydrogen that's
just protons they were all formed in the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060
just protons they were all formed in the
 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.440
just protons they were all formed in the
Big Bang so we actually carry about 10%

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
Big Bang so we actually carry about 10%
 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.800
Big Bang so we actually carry about 10%
of our body weight in in us that that is

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
of our body weight in in us that that is
 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.580
of our body weight in in us that that is
Big Bang material the protons were all

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590
Big Bang material the protons were all
 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.110
Big Bang material the protons were all
recycled numerous times throughout the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
recycled numerous times throughout the
 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.380
recycled numerous times throughout the
stars but the actual protons were made

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
stars but the actual protons were made
 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.170
stars but the actual protons were made
in the hot Big Bang when all the support

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180
in the hot Big Bang when all the support
 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.790
in the hot Big Bang when all the support
ohmic particles actually came together

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800
ohmic particles actually came together
 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.699
ohmic particles actually came together
and foreign protons and neutrons and so

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709
and foreign protons and neutrons and so
 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.370
and foreign protons and neutrons and so
that we are we are not just children of

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
that we are we are not just children of
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.680
that we are we are not just children of
the stars actually we are also children

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690
the stars actually we are also children
 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.900
the stars actually we are also children
off of the Big Bang and I think it's

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
off of the Big Bang and I think it's
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.880
off of the Big Bang and I think it's
really nice once in a while to to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890
really nice once in a while to to
 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.670
really nice once in a while to to
reflect on that and and really realize

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
reflect on that and and really realize
 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.400
reflect on that and and really realize
how much we are actually connected to

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410
how much we are actually connected to
 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.340
how much we are actually connected to
the cosmos
