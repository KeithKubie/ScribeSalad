half a page of text so there's the root

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289
half a page of text so there's the root
 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.549

they also have their own sensitivities
about risk and that's what happened

about risk and that's what happened

in developing these scenarios that that

in developing these scenarios that that
 

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.329
in developing these scenarios that that
ultimately resulted in the code but at

ultimately resulted in the code but at
the end of the day I had to discuss this

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800
the end of the day I had to discuss this
 

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.490
the end of the day I had to discuss this
with my general counsel and she had to

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500
with my general counsel and she had to
 

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.069
with my general counsel and she had to
bless the code and in some instances you

00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079
bless the code and in some instances you
 

00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:51.530

can get a blessing and with some

are first of all I don't like to think
 

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.460
are first of all I don't like to think
about these questions in terms of is

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:49.470
about these questions in terms of is
 

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.350
about these questions in terms of is
this a fair use or is it not a fair use

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360
this a fair use or is it not a fair use
 

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.030
this a fair use or is it not a fair use
it's a bigger question that the question

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.040
it's a bigger question that the question
 

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.250
it's a bigger question that the question
is my institution wants to do a

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260
is my institution wants to do a

particular activity is it a safe thing
to do or a risky thing to do how safe is

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:00.330
to do or a risky thing to do how safe is
 

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.210
to do or a risky thing to do how safe is
it how risky is it because ultimately

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220
it how risky is it because ultimately
 

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.830
it how risky is it because ultimately
what you're going to decide is either to

what you're going to decide is either to
 

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.380
what you're going to decide is either to
do the activity not do the activity or

change your plans a little bit to make
 

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.890
change your plans a little bit to make
the activity a little bit safer fair use

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900
the activity a little bit safer fair use
 

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.570
the activity a little bit safer fair use
is part of that analysis but it's

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580

in that situation are pretty low so it's

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:26.790
in that situation are pretty low so it's
 

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.030
in that situation are pretty low so it's
a very large cost to a plaintiff to

a very large cost to a plaintiff to

a very large cost to a plaintiff to
proceed with a lawsuit as well so you

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:30.810
proceed with a lawsuit as well so you
 

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.080
proceed with a lawsuit as well so you
have to factor that in there's a sort of

have to factor that in there's a sort of
 

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.850
have to factor that in there's a sort of

a climate of fear I think that people
 

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.800
a climate of fear I think that people
have that copyright owners are just you

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:36.810

and that's that's generally not the case

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600
and that's that's generally not the case
 

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.930
and that's that's generally not the case
there there are some who are obviously

there there are some who are obviously

more aggressive than others then you

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:48.180
more aggressive than others then you
 

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.050
more aggressive than others then you
have to think about what is the cost of

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:50.060
have to think about what is the cost of
 

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.850
have to think about what is the cost of
if if a lawsuit were to be commenced and

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860
if if a lawsuit were to be commenced and
 

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.800
if if a lawsuit were to be commenced and
you were to lose what would the cost be

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:54.810
you were to lose what would the cost be
 

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.820
you were to lose what would the cost be
to the institution certainly the cost of

00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:58.830
to the institution certainly the cost of
 

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.940
to the institution certainly the cost of
defending it is large and probably you

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:01.950
defending it is large and probably you
 

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.350
defending it is large and probably you
would have outside counsel rather than

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360
would have outside counsel rather than
 

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.420
would have outside counsel rather than
in-house counsel of the University if

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:05.430

your work in a university handling the
 

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.490
your work in a university handling the

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:10.500
litigation that would be a large expense
 

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.170
litigation that would be a large expense
and that's certainly not something to

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:12.180
and that's certainly not something to
 

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.340
and that's certainly not something to
take lightly against that cost you then

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:16.350
take lightly against that cost you then
 

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.750
take lightly against that cost you then
have to think about well what are the

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760
have to think about well what are the
 

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.050

$1,500 certainly less than the cost of
 

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.729
$1,500 certainly less than the cost of
luring it for two hours so

sometimes be a very attractive
 

00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:27.389
sometimes be a very attractive
compromise also you have to think about

00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:27.399
compromise also you have to think about
 

00:28:27.399 --> 00:28:31.149
compromise also you have to think about
are there other ways to to accomplish

00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159

transformative use so when you think
about oh well the use we're going to

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:12.850
about oh well the use we're going to
 

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.490
about oh well the use we're going to
make here is not transformative because

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:14.500
make here is not transformative because

so back when we started to look at

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:35.170
so back when we started to look at
 

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.349
so back when we started to look at
copyright issues ten years ago we

00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359
copyright issues ten years ago we
 

00:37:38.359 --> 00:37:41.260
copyright issues ten years ago we
realized that given the scale of what we

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:41.270
realized that given the scale of what we
 

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.450
realized that given the scale of what we
were trying to accomplish of building

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:43.460
were trying to accomplish of building
 

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.760
were trying to accomplish of building
this ever-expanding library that would

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:45.770
this ever-expanding library that would
 

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:49.470
this ever-expanding library that would
meet educational needs and given the

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480
meet educational needs and given the
 

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.820
meet educational needs and given the
what I call the kind of traditions

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:51.830
what I call the kind of traditions
 

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.370
what I call the kind of traditions
around images the traditions of

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:54.380
around images the traditions of
 

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.980
around images the traditions of
permissions around images we realized

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:56.990
permissions around images we realized
 

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:58.300
permissions around images we realized
that there was no way we were going to

00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:58.310
that there was no way we were going to
 

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:59.710
that there was no way we were going to
be able to obtain permissions in every

00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720
be able to obtain permissions in every
 

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.190
be able to obtain permissions in every
instance so for starters as was referred

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.020
instance so for starters as was referred
to earlier there are many many orphan

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:05.030
to earlier there are many many orphan
 

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.150
to earlier there are many many orphan
works in the image context particularly

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160
works in the image context particularly
 

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.460
works in the image context particularly
with respect to photographic works and

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:09.470
with respect to photographic works and
 

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.140
with respect to photographic works and
non-western art objects and I could go

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.150
non-western art objects and I could go
 

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.240
non-western art objects and I could go
on and on where you just you can't

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:13.250
on and on where you just you can't
 

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:16.140
on and on where you just you can't
reasonably identify the copyright owner

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.150
reasonably identify the copyright owner
 

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:19.329
reasonably identify the copyright owner
but perhaps more importantly what we

00:38:19.329 --> 00:38:19.339
but perhaps more importantly what we
 

00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:21.040
but perhaps more importantly what we
understood after looking at this

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:21.050
understood after looking at this
 

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:22.990
understood after looking at this
question and frankly after undertaking

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000
question and frankly after undertaking
 

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.599
question and frankly after undertaking
an initial permissions effort was that

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:25.609
an initial permissions effort was that
 

00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:29.710
an initial permissions effort was that
there just aren't those traditions of a

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720
there just aren't those traditions of a
 

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.500
there just aren't those traditions of a
sort of easy or efficient permissions

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:32.510
sort of easy or efficient permissions
 

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.570
sort of easy or efficient permissions
mechanisms in this context so you write

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:34.580
mechanisms in this context so you write
 

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.280
mechanisms in this context so you write
letters of permission you frequently

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.290
letters of permission you frequently
 

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.050
letters of permission you frequently
don't hear back and if you hear back

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:38.060
don't hear back and if you hear back
 

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.589
don't hear back and if you hear back
it's inevitably a conversation about

00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599
it's inevitably a conversation about
 

00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:43.690
it's inevitably a conversation about
image quality and attributions and data

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:43.700
image quality and attributions and data
 

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.540
image quality and attributions and data
quality and while those are all fine and

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:46.550
quality and while those are all fine and
 

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.480
quality and while those are all fine and
productive and useful topics the point

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:49.490
productive and useful topics the point
 

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.070
productive and useful topics the point
is there's no way to sort of do this at

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:51.080
is there's no way to sort of do this at
 

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.630
is there's no way to sort of do this at
any kind of scale that would sort of

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640
any kind of scale that would sort of
 

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.990
any kind of scale that would sort of
fulfill our broader educational mission

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000
fulfill our broader educational mission
 

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.530
fulfill our broader educational mission
so we at that point started to really

00:38:59.530 --> 00:38:59.540
so we at that point started to really
 

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:03.359
so we at that point started to really
look at very seriously look at fair use

00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:03.369
look at very seriously look at fair use
 

00:39:03.369 --> 00:39:05.740
look at very seriously look at fair use
and as the only way that we could

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:05.750
and as the only way that we could
 

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:06.950
and as the only way that we could
achieve our

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960
achieve our
 

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.870
achieve our
occasional mission and it is because

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880
occasional mission and it is because
 

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.120
occasional mission and it is because
that's the sort of basis for my gray

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:11.130
that's the sort of basis for my gray
 

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:13.880
that's the sort of basis for my gray
hairs today but back from 10 years ago

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:13.890
hairs today but back from 10 years ago
 

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:16.400
hairs today but back from 10 years ago
and we started this analysis because the

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:16.410
and we started this analysis because the
 

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.920
and we started this analysis because the
laws obviously at that point was so you

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:18.930
laws obviously at that point was so you
 

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:19.940
laws obviously at that point was so you
know it was sort of all over the place

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:19.950
know it was sort of all over the place
 

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:24.050
know it was sort of all over the place
on these questions in developing a fair

on these questions in developing a fair
use strategy so one of the first things

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160
use strategy so one of the first things
 

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.250
use strategy so one of the first things
we did was to better understand fairies

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260
we did was to better understand fairies
 

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.290
we did was to better understand fairies
jurisprudence and we got the superb

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300
jurisprudence and we got the superb
 

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.170
jurisprudence and we got the superb
assistance of bob clara de he is we are

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180
assistance of bob clara de he is we are
 

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.150
assistance of bob clara de he is we are
one of his clients but the next thing

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160
one of his clients but the next thing
 

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.690
one of his clients but the next thing
that we did was to develop what I call

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.700
that we did was to develop what I call
 

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.240
that we did was to develop what I call
an environmental scan and when you're

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:41.250
an environmental scan and when you're
 

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.280
an environmental scan and when you're
thinking about developing a fair use

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:43.290
thinking about developing a fair use
 

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.460
thinking about developing a fair use
strategy particularly you know so much

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:46.470
strategy particularly you know so much
 

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.630
strategy particularly you know so much
of us today are engaged in large-scale

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640
of us today are engaged in large-scale
 

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.890
of us today are engaged in large-scale
digitization or distribution efforts and

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:53.900
digitization or distribution efforts and
 

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.880
digitization or distribution efforts and
particularly when you are when you're

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:55.890
particularly when you are when you're
 

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.829
particularly when you are when you're
involved in one of those projects I

00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839
involved in one of those projects I
 

00:39:57.839 --> 00:40:00.050
involved in one of those projects I
think one of the initial steps that you

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060
think one of the initial steps that you
 

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.030
think one of the initial steps that you
can take is to undertake this

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040
can take is to undertake this
 

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.910
can take is to undertake this
environmental scan so what we did was to

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920
environmental scan so what we did was to
 

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.400
environmental scan so what we did was to
look and see what other users were doing

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:07.410
look and see what other users were doing
 

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:09.800
look and see what other users were doing
in our context what are other

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:09.810
in our context what are other
 

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.450
in our context what are other
educational users doing are they

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460
educational users doing are they
 

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.609
educational users doing are they
obtaining permissions are they not if

00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619
obtaining permissions are they not if
 

00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:15.500
obtaining permissions are they not if
they are why are they doing that and we

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:15.510
they are why are they doing that and we
 

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:18.470
they are why are they doing that and we
also tried to understand what the

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480
also tried to understand what the
 

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.349
also tried to understand what the
universe was of rights holders and what

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359
universe was of rights holders and what
 

00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:23.420
universe was of rights holders and what
were their concerns and so one of the

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:23.430
were their concerns and so one of the
 

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:25.849
were their concerns and so one of the
things that we uncovered in undertaking

00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859
things that we uncovered in undertaking
 

00:40:25.859 --> 00:40:29.780
things that we uncovered in undertaking
this analysis was that first there was

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:29.790
this analysis was that first there was
 

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.720
this analysis was that first there was
this century long tradition of relying

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:32.730
this century long tradition of relying
 

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.960
this century long tradition of relying
on fair use in our context and I have to

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:35.970
on fair use in our context and I have to
 

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.400
on fair use in our context and I have to
just back up and say I wish at the time

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:37.410
just back up and say I wish at the time
 

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:40.430
just back up and say I wish at the time
we'd had one of these fair use

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440
we'd had one of these fair use
 

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.829
we'd had one of these fair use
statements that Brandon and Peter and

00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839
statements that Brandon and Peter and
 

00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:45.470
statements that Brandon and Peter and
Patricia have been involved in as we

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480
Patricia have been involved in as we
 

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.060
Patricia have been involved in as we
were undertaking this environmental scan

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:47.070
were undertaking this environmental scan
 

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.430
were undertaking this environmental scan
because frequently these fair use

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440
because frequently these fair use
 

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.349
because frequently these fair use
statements can give you a piece of this

00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359
statements can give you a piece of this
 

00:40:51.359 --> 00:40:53.120
statements can give you a piece of this
environment they can sort of let you

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:53.130
environment they can sort of let you
 

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.859
environment they can sort of let you
know about what the sort of community

00:40:54.859 --> 00:40:54.869
know about what the sort of community
 

00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:56.570
know about what the sort of community
practices are and that can be

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:56.580
practices are and that can be
 

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.120
practices are and that can be
tremendously helpful as your sort of

starting this this sort of first point
 

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:04.750
starting this this sort of first point
of understanding the landscape and so as

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760
of understanding the landscape and so as
 

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.510
of understanding the landscape and so as
Brandon so graciously noted earlier I

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520
Brandon so graciously noted earlier I
 

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.760
Brandon so graciously noted earlier I
was involved in the development of a

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:10.770
was involved in the development of a
 

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.520
was involved in the development of a
visual resources association fair use

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:13.530
visual resources association fair use
 

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.260
visual resources association fair use
statement for the use of images for

statement for the use of images for
 

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.810
statement for the use of images for
teaching research and study and Bob was

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:17.820
teaching research and study and Bob was
 

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.940
teaching research and study and Bob was
on our advisory panel for that

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:19.950
on our advisory panel for that
 

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:23.390
on our advisory panel for that
and as was Virginia Rutledge who's

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400
and as was Virginia Rutledge who's
 

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.870
and as was Virginia Rutledge who's
somewhere in the back of this room the

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880
somewhere in the back of this room the
 

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.880
somewhere in the back of this room the
point of that was though really in part

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:28.890
point of that was though really in part
 

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:31.700
point of that was though really in part
to document community practices and so

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:31.710
to document community practices and so
 

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.610
to document community practices and so
when we were doing this for art store we

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:34.620
when we were doing this for art store we
 

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.710
when we were doing this for art store we
were able to point to these same

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720
were able to point to these same
 

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.740
were able to point to these same
community practices so there was a

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:38.750
community practices so there was a
 

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.850
community practices so there was a
century long tradition of rolling on

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:40.860
century long tradition of rolling on
 

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.300
century long tradition of rolling on
fair use there were long traditions of

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:44.310
fair use there were long traditions of
 

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.280
fair use there were long traditions of
rights holders not challenging this

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:46.290
rights holders not challenging this
 

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.890
rights holders not challenging this
practice and not seeking permit not

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900
practice and not seeking permit not
 

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.720
practice and not seeking permit not
seeking not trying to require that users

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:50.730
seeking not trying to require that users
 

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.850
seeking not trying to require that users
obtain permissions and so we were able

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:52.860
obtain permissions and so we were able
 

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:57.020
obtain permissions and so we were able
to document all of that I think it's

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:57.030
to document all of that I think it's
 

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.790
to document all of that I think it's
really important to note though that

00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800
really important to note though that
 

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.640
really important to note though that
even if there are not those same

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:01.650
even if there are not those same
 

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:04.640
even if there are not those same
traditions so even if there is a sort of

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:04.650
traditions so even if there is a sort of
 

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:09.530
traditions so even if there is a sort of
active licensing effort under being

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540
active licensing effort under being
 

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.750
active licensing effort under being
undertaken by the community it's okay

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760
undertaken by the community it's okay
 

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.610
undertaken by the community it's okay
still to rely on fair use you don't have

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:13.620
still to rely on fair use you don't have
 

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.530
still to rely on fair use you don't have
to point to those types of practices and

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:15.540
to point to those types of practices and
 

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.870
to point to those types of practices and
you don't have to point to sort of what

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880
you don't have to point to sort of what
 

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.700
you don't have to point to sort of what
others are doing so that's the

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:19.710
others are doing so that's the
 

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:22.250
others are doing so that's the
parenthetical I have on that first point

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260
parenthetical I have on that first point
 

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.490
parenthetical I have on that first point
that even if others are relying on fair

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500
that even if others are relying on fair
 

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.160
that even if others are relying on fair
uses in certain ways and you're not you

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:28.170
uses in certain ways and you're not you
 

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:31.400
uses in certain ways and you're not you
may still very well be able to rely on

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:31.410
may still very well be able to rely on
 

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:40.250
may still very well be able to rely on
fair use this leads me to the second

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:40.260
fair use this leads me to the second
 

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.640
fair use this leads me to the second
point about developing a fair use

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:43.650
point about developing a fair use
 

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:45.770
point about developing a fair use
strategy and that is I found it

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:45.780
strategy and that is I found it
 

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.900
strategy and that is I found it
tremendously helpful when we were first

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:47.910
tremendously helpful when we were first
 

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:51.680
tremendously helpful when we were first
undertaking this effort to develop a

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:51.690
undertaking this effort to develop a
 

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.890
undertaking this effort to develop a
fair use or copyright statement that was

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:54.900
fair use or copyright statement that was
 

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.830
fair use or copyright statement that was
then posted on our website and the point

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:57.840
then posted on our website and the point
 

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.760
then posted on our website and the point
of this statement is really to lay out

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:01.770
of this statement is really to lay out
 

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:03.680
of this statement is really to lay out
the equities of what you're trying to do

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:03.690
the equities of what you're trying to do
 

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:07.190
the equities of what you're trying to do
so it's to put your fair use argument in

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200
so it's to put your fair use argument in
 

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.470
so it's to put your fair use argument in
that kind of broader context or

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480
that kind of broader context or
 

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.540
that kind of broader context or
framework it's to say here's the

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:11.550
framework it's to say here's the
 

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.370
framework it's to say here's the
background for why we're doing it it

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380
background for why we're doing it it
 

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.340
background for why we're doing it it
sets the tone it says here is what we're

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:16.350
sets the tone it says here is what we're
 

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.130
sets the tone it says here is what we're
trying to accomplish and in part you're

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.140
trying to accomplish and in part you're
 

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.320
trying to accomplish and in part you're
trying to do that for the for the

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:21.330
trying to do that for the for the
 

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:23.450
trying to do that for the for the
community that you serve and part you're

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460
community that you serve and part you're
 

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.070
community that you serve and part you're
trying to do it to get ahead of the

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:25.080
trying to do it to get ahead of the
 

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.410
trying to do it to get ahead of the
potential copyright plaintiff because if

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420
potential copyright plaintiff because if
 

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:31.430
potential copyright plaintiff because if
they come to you as may be the case this

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440
they come to you as may be the case this
 

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.740
they come to you as may be the case this
made this document may help frame that

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:33.750
made this document may help frame that
 

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.570
made this document may help frame that
frame the set of arguments that you have

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:35.580
frame the set of arguments that you have
 

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.330
frame the set of arguments that you have
and it may also help you demonstrate

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:38.340
and it may also help you demonstrate
 

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:43.160
and it may also help you demonstrate
good faith and here we talked earlier

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:43.170
good faith and here we talked earlier
 

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:47.360
good faith and here we talked earlier
about the for fair use elements I want

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:47.370
about the for fair use elements I want
 

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.390
about the for fair use elements I want
to argue today that they're now 5 and I

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400
to argue today that they're now 5 and I
 

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.840
to argue today that they're now 5 and I
think good faith as bob was alluding to

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:53.850
think good faith as bob was alluding to
 

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.330
think good faith as bob was alluding to
earlier is really an important element

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:56.340
earlier is really an important element
 

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.670
earlier is really an important element
at this point so the optics as he said

00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680
at this point so the optics as he said
 

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:04.300
at this point so the optics as he said
matter and we're now seeing in a lot of

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:04.310
matter and we're now seeing in a lot of
 

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:07.040
matter and we're now seeing in a lot of
the recent cases you know certainly in

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.050

developing your fair use strategy one of

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:23.490
developing your fair use strategy one of
 

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:25.220
developing your fair use strategy one of
the things we've done it at art store

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:25.230
the things we've done it at art store
 

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.190
the things we've done it at art store
and one of the things that was pointed

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200
and one of the things that was pointed
 

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.780
and one of the things that was pointed
out in the ARL and other statements is

out in the ARL and other statements is
 

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:33.500
out in the ARL and other statements is
we employed a number of mechanisms to

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:33.510
we employed a number of mechanisms to
 

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.080
we employed a number of mechanisms to
help demonstrate our good faith so we

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:36.090
help demonstrate our good faith so we
 

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.840
help demonstrate our good faith so we
use terms and conditions of use our

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:38.850
use terms and conditions of use our
 

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.130

terms and conditions of use don't
 

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.650
terms and conditions of use don't
preclude fair use but we used terms and

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660
preclude fair use but we used terms and
 

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.010
preclude fair use but we used terms and
conditions of use we have digital rights

it's really important you don't have to

think of these kinds of protections is

think of these kinds of protections is
 

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.200
think of these kinds of protections is
really being sort of reasonable

the fourth thing I would say about any

the fourth thing I would say about any
fair use policy it

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:47.320
fair use policy it
 

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.460
fair use policy it
is to note that as was suggested earlier

limits of fair use is its geographical

limits of fair use is its geographical
 

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.760
limits of fair use is its geographical

in this room fair use exists in the US

some efforts to push this forward in

some efforts to push this forward in
 

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.140
some efforts to push this forward in
other countries but as it stands right

other countries but as it stands right
 

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:14.640
other countries but as it stands right

the open web the question of which law
 

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.150
the open web the question of which law
applies is really an unsettled and kind

of murky one much to my horror when I

was looking at this so for art store

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240
was looking at this so for art store
 

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.420
was looking at this so for art store
this is meant that when we distribute

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:36.430
this is meant that when we distribute
 

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:40.670
this is meant that when we distribute
the library abroad in some instances we

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680
the library abroad in some instances we
 

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.990
the library abroad in some instances we
have a smaller library that we

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000
have a smaller library that we
 

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.580
have a smaller library that we
distribute abroad we pull some images

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:44.590
distribute abroad we pull some images
 

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:46.800
distribute abroad we pull some images
we're relying on those images for fair

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:46.810
we're relying on those images for fair
 

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:48.330
we're relying on those images for fair
use in the u.s. we don't necessarily do

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:48.340
use in the u.s. we don't necessarily do
 

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.660
use in the u.s. we don't necessarily do
that abroad we also in some instances

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:51.670
that abroad we also in some instances
 

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:54.830
that abroad we also in some instances
obtain permissions from copyright owners

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:54.840
obtain permissions from copyright owners
 

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.720
obtain permissions from copyright owners
where and one of the reasons we do that

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:57.730
where and one of the reasons we do that
 

00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:59.400
where and one of the reasons we do that
is because we want to be able to serve

00:46:59.400 --> 00:46:59.410
is because we want to be able to serve
 

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:03.240
is because we want to be able to serve
educational users abroad so my point

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:03.250
educational users abroad so my point
 

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:05.910
educational users abroad so my point
here is that you can have a nuanced

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920
here is that you can have a nuanced
 

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.460
here is that you can have a nuanced
approach to copyright and you're in your

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:08.470
approach to copyright and you're in your
 

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:10.260
approach to copyright and you're in your
policy it doesn't have to be sort of all

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:10.270
policy it doesn't have to be sort of all
 

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:12.420
policy it doesn't have to be sort of all
or nothing approach and in fact the law

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:12.430
or nothing approach and in fact the law
 

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.250
or nothing approach and in fact the law
is very clear that if you would go and

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:14.260
is very clear that if you would go and
 

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.170
is very clear that if you would go and
you try to obtain permissions from a

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:16.180
you try to obtain permissions from a
 

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.210
you try to obtain permissions from a
copyright owner and for whatever reason

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:18.220
copyright owner and for whatever reason
 

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.470
copyright owner and for whatever reason
those negotiations fail you may still be

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480
those negotiations fail you may still be
 

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.480
those negotiations fail you may still be
able to rely on fair use with respect to

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:24.490
able to rely on fair use with respect to
 

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:25.350
able to rely on fair use with respect to
the work with that particular

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:25.360
the work with that particular
 

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.870
the work with that particular
copyrighted work so when it's it's a

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880
copyrighted work so when it's it's a
 

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.720
copyrighted work so when it's it's a
nuanced approach to copyright and that's

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:30.730
nuanced approach to copyright and that's
 

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:36.210
nuanced approach to copyright and that's
and that's perfectly fine the next point

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:36.220
and that's perfectly fine the next point
 

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.840
and that's perfectly fine the next point
I'd want to make is you may have the

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:39.850
I'd want to make is you may have the
 

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.280
I'd want to make is you may have the
best fair use policy available and have

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:44.290
best fair use policy available and have
 

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.530
best fair use policy available and have
taken all sorts of protections and still

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:46.540
taken all sorts of protections and still
 

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.350
taken all sorts of protections and still
find yourself in a defensive posture so

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:49.360
find yourself in a defensive posture so
 

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.550
find yourself in a defensive posture so
not to say that we've done everything

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:50.560
not to say that we've done everything
 

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.590
not to say that we've done everything
right at art store but we make available

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:52.600
right at art store but we make available
 

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.650
right at art store but we make available
this library for limited purposes these

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:55.660
this library for limited purposes these
 

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.600
this library for limited purposes these
limited educational purposes I think of

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:57.610
limited educational purposes I think of
 

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:59.190
limited educational purposes I think of
them as being rooted in the First

00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200
them as being rooted in the First
 

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.049
them as being rooted in the First
Amendment we have

00:48:00.049 --> 00:48:00.059
Amendment we have
 

00:48:00.059 --> 00:48:01.459
Amendment we have
all sorts of protections in place and

00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:01.469
all sorts of protections in place and
 

00:48:01.469 --> 00:48:03.709
all sorts of protections in place and
yet we've had a handful of copyright

00:48:03.709 --> 00:48:03.719
yet we've had a handful of copyright
 

00:48:03.719 --> 00:48:05.449
yet we've had a handful of copyright
owners approaches with takedown notices

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:05.459

00:48:05.459 --> 00:48:07.910
owners approaches with takedown notices
and so a couple of points here on that

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920
and so a couple of points here on that
 

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:13.219
and so a couple of points here on that
um one of them I would say is that it

00:48:13.219 --> 00:48:13.229
um one of them I would say is that it
 

00:48:13.229 --> 00:48:16.670
um one of them I would say is that it
sounds kind of basic and simple but be

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680
sounds kind of basic and simple but be
 

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.920
sounds kind of basic and simple but be

stake in the ground and say hey this is
 

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.120
stake in the ground and say hey this is
really important and we believe this is

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:55.130
really important and we believe this is
 

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.280
really important and we believe this is
fair use and we're going to robustly

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:57.290
fair use and we're going to robustly
 

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.630
fair use and we're going to robustly
assert fair use under these

00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640
assert fair use under these
 

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:03.520
assert fair use under these
circumstances one other point I want

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:03.530
circumstances one other point I want
 

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:05.230
circumstances one other point I want
about making about mannat make about

about making about mannat make about

about making about mannat make about
managing your risks is in the sort of

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:07.340
managing your risks is in the sort of
 

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.330
managing your risks is in the sort of
mass digitization or distribution effort

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:10.340
mass digitization or distribution effort
 

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.100
mass digitization or distribution effort
so how many people in this room are

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:12.110
so how many people in this room are
 

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.350
so how many people in this room are
engaged in those kinds of large-scale

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:14.360
engaged in those kinds of large-scale
 

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.800
engaged in those kinds of large-scale
distribution efforts okay now how many

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:17.810
distribution efforts okay now how many
 

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:19.390
distribution efforts okay now how many
people really are engaged in then just

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400
people really are engaged in then just
 

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:24.190
people really are engaged in then just
no I'm kidding so what I would say is

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:24.200
no I'm kidding so what I would say is
 

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.490
no I'm kidding so what I would say is
a couple of things one way of looking at

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:27.500
a couple of things one way of looking at
 

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:30.400
a couple of things one way of looking at
the copyright due diligence question you

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:30.410
the copyright due diligence question you
 

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:31.900
the copyright due diligence question you
know this has not really been discussed

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:31.910
know this has not really been discussed
 

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:33.790
know this has not really been discussed
I think enough and it's come up in the

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:33.800
I think enough and it's come up in the
 

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.790
I think enough and it's come up in the
orphan works context but I think we need

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800
orphan works context but I think we need
 

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.230
orphan works context but I think we need
to spend as a community more time

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240
to spend as a community more time
 

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.960
to spend as a community more time
thinking about this because one of the

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:40.970
thinking about this because one of the
 

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.430
thinking about this because one of the
ways we've handled this and it's not to

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.440
ways we've handled this and it's not to
 

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.990
ways we've handled this and it's not to
say it's necessarily the right way but

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000
say it's necessarily the right way but
 

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.329
say it's necessarily the right way but
is to sort of put your content into

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:46.339
is to sort of put your content into
 

00:52:46.339 --> 00:52:48.310
is to sort of put your content into
different buckets based on the risk

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:48.320
different buckets based on the risk
 

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.500
different buckets based on the risk
management analysis and to say okay we

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:50.510
management analysis and to say okay we
 

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.960
management analysis and to say okay we
think this set of content is the

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:52.970
think this set of content is the
 

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.030
think this set of content is the
riskiest this is less risky this is the

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040
riskiest this is less risky this is the
 

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.829
riskiest this is less risky this is the
least risky and you spend your time

00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839
least risky and you spend your time
 

00:52:56.839 --> 00:52:58.599
least risky and you spend your time
perhaps focused most on the bucket

00:52:58.599 --> 00:52:58.609
perhaps focused most on the bucket
 

00:52:58.609 --> 00:53:01.780
perhaps focused most on the bucket
that's the riskiest that being said I

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:01.790
that's the riskiest that being said I
 

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:03.160
that's the riskiest that being said I
think we really need to think about

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:03.170
think we really need to think about
 

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:05.890
think we really need to think about
advocating and art well articulating and

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:05.900
advocating and art well articulating and
 

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.800
advocating and art well articulating and
advocating for clearer due diligence

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:08.810
advocating for clearer due diligence
 

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.710
advocating for clearer due diligence
standards that take into account the

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720
standards that take into account the
 

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.640
standards that take into account the
tremendous societal benefits of

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:14.650
tremendous societal benefits of
 

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:17.500
tremendous societal benefits of
large-scale digitization and that

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:17.510
large-scale digitization and that
 

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.020
large-scale digitization and that
recognize that there may still be ways

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:20.030
recognize that there may still be ways
 

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:23.380
recognize that there may still be ways
to recognize and sort of respect

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:23.390
to recognize and sort of respect
 

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:26.380
to recognize and sort of respect
copyright owners interests without sort

of undertaking an item by item due

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:28.310
of undertaking an item by item due
 

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:29.770
of undertaking an item by item due
diligence analysis it's just not

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:29.780
diligence analysis it's just not
 

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.559
diligence analysis it's just not
possible in these larger scale efforts

00:53:31.559 --> 00:53:31.569
possible in these larger scale efforts
 

00:53:31.569 --> 00:53:34.510
possible in these larger scale efforts
and that brings me to my last point

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520
and that brings me to my last point
 

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:39.069
and that brings me to my last point
which is I want to urge us all to take

00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079
which is I want to urge us all to take
 

00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:42.370
which is I want to urge us all to take
collective action working with entities

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:42.380
collective action working with entities
 

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.980
collective action working with entities
or individuals that are in similar

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:44.990
or individuals that are in similar
 

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:47.290
or individuals that are in similar
positions and here I think it's

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:47.300
positions and here I think it's
 

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.849
positions and here I think it's
important to take a look at all the

00:53:48.849 --> 00:53:48.859
important to take a look at all the
 

00:53:48.859 --> 00:53:51.370
important to take a look at all the
tools that are available to us certainly

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:51.380
tools that are available to us certainly
 

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:53.500
tools that are available to us certainly
the fair use statements are a really

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:53.510
the fair use statements are a really
 

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:56.109
the fair use statements are a really
important tool in that effort but I

00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119
important tool in that effort but I
 

00:53:56.119 --> 00:53:58.630
important tool in that effort but I
think we should be looking at a range of

00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640
think we should be looking at a range of
 

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.690
think we should be looking at a range of
other of other actions and so I would

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:01.700
other of other actions and so I would
 

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.150
other of other actions and so I would
agree entirely with trees point about

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160
agree entirely with trees point about
 

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.980
agree entirely with trees point about
you know trying to push for greater

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:05.990
you know trying to push for greater
 

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:08.170
you know trying to push for greater
legislation I think given where Congress

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:08.180
legislation I think given where Congress
 

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.210
legislation I think given where Congress
is these days I think that's writ large

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:10.220
is these days I think that's writ large
 

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:13.180
is these days I think that's writ large
I think that's probably unlikely but I

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:13.190
I think that's probably unlikely but I
 

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:14.260
I think that's probably unlikely but I
think we need to be thinking about

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:14.270
think we need to be thinking about
 

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:17.109
think we need to be thinking about
things we can do as a community and so

00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119
things we can do as a community and so
 

00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:20.950
things we can do as a community and so
one option might be to think about you

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960
one option might be to think about you
 

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.390
one option might be to think about you
know I was very impressed with the

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400
know I was very impressed with the
 

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.550
know I was very impressed with the
documentary filmmakers statement and

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:24.560
documentary filmmakers statement and
 

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.809
documentary filmmakers statement and
their ability to obtain insurance

00:54:25.809 --> 00:54:25.819
their ability to obtain insurance
 

00:54:25.819 --> 00:54:28.839
their ability to obtain insurance
afterwards and so one thing I thought it

00:54:28.839 --> 00:54:28.849
afterwards and so one thing I thought it
 

00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:31.270
afterwards and so one thing I thought it
would be interesting is if we had some

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280
would be interesting is if we had some
 

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.329
would be interesting is if we had some
collective financial support a sort of

00:54:34.329 --> 00:54:34.339
collective financial support a sort of
 

00:54:34.339 --> 00:54:37.270
collective financial support a sort of

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280
fund for fair use litigation that
 

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.970
fund for fair use litigation that
to us either in directly or indirectly

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:38.980
to us either in directly or indirectly
 

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.040
to us either in directly or indirectly
because one of the biggest challenges

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:42.050
because one of the biggest challenges
 

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:44.770
because one of the biggest challenges
facing all of us as Bob mentioned

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:44.780
facing all of us as Bob mentioned
 

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.960
facing all of us as Bob mentioned
earlier is the sort of cost of

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:46.970
earlier is the sort of cost of
 

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.850
earlier is the sort of cost of
litigation and therefore the cost of

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:48.860
litigation and therefore the cost of
 

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:51.310
litigation and therefore the cost of
being able to sort of robustly assert

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:51.320
being able to sort of robustly assert
 

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.190
being able to sort of robustly assert
fair use in ways you'd otherwise like to

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200
fair use in ways you'd otherwise like to
 

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.420
fair use in ways you'd otherwise like to
the other point i would make and it's

00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:55.430
the other point i would make and it's
 

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:59.560
the other point i would make and it's
more conciliatory is to say that i think

00:54:59.560 --> 00:54:59.570
more conciliatory is to say that i think
 

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:01.900
more conciliatory is to say that i think
we should be prepared as an educational

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:01.910
we should be prepared as an educational
 

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:04.390
we should be prepared as an educational
community to work with rights holders

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400
community to work with rights holders
 

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.330
community to work with rights holders
who want to meet us midway so i've

00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:07.340
who want to meet us midway so i've
 

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.460
who want to meet us midway so i've
always been very impressed with places

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:09.470
always been very impressed with places
 

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:13.210
always been very impressed with places
like the Warhol estate or individuals

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:13.220
like the Warhol estate or individuals
 

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.310
like the Warhol estate or individuals
asserting Creative Commons licenses or

with museum efforts to make their

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:17.720
with museum efforts to make their
 

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.510
with museum efforts to make their
content more broadly accessible whether

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520
content more broadly accessible whether
 

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.450
content more broadly accessible whether
it's for scholarly publishing or for you

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:22.460
it's for scholarly publishing or for you
 

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.790
it's for scholarly publishing or for you
know releasing public domain works so

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:24.800
know releasing public domain works so
 

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.310
know releasing public domain works so
there's a space there for us to work

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:27.320
there's a space there for us to work
 

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.170
there's a space there for us to work
with rights holders in meaningful ways

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:29.180
with rights holders in meaningful ways
 

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.710
with rights holders in meaningful ways
and I think being able to do so allows

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720
and I think being able to do so allows
 

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.310
and I think being able to do so allows
us to then more robustly assert fair use

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:36.320
us to then more robustly assert fair use
 

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.860
us to then more robustly assert fair use
in other circumstances so with that I'm

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:38.870
in other circumstances so with that I'm
 

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:48.610
in other circumstances so with that I'm
going to turn great thank you thank you

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:48.620

what are the chances and whether the
university may be willing to assume this

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.010
university may be willing to assume this
 

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:41.270
university may be willing to assume this

the university attorneys and again we're
 

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.970
the university attorneys and again we're
grossly generalizing here do you think

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980
grossly generalizing here do you think
 

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.360
grossly generalizing here do you think
that they are more conservative or do

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:56.370

you think they see the issues
 

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.330
you think they see the issues
differently I think they see the issues

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:02.340
differently I think they see the issues
 

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:06.920
differently I think they see the issues
differently and our conservative you

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:06.930
differently and our conservative you
 

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:09.200
differently and our conservative you
know because I me nuts are all of the

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:09.210
know because I me nuts are all of the
 

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:11.630
know because I me nuts are all of the
above you know but our role isn't really

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640
above you know but our role isn't really
 

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.420
above you know but our role isn't really
to be free wheeling I mean that's not

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:14.430

and so yeah I think we are conservative
 

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.350

under the law I think it was a lot
 

01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:18.680
under the law I think it was a lot
harder when we started ten years ago and

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:18.690
harder when we started ten years ago and
 

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:22.250
harder when we started ten years ago and

in fact one of the first conversations
we had and this was not even with an

01:04:41.609 --> 01:04:46.250
years if the hotel de profited
handsomely from me so I think part of it

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260
handsomely from me so I think part of it
 

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.010
handsomely from me so I think part of it
is the sort of a willingness of
