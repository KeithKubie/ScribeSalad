00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's say that the
position of some particle

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.794
as a function of time is
given by this expression

00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:07.460
right over here.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.220
Negative d to the
negative t power

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.230
plus c to the fourth
over c squared

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.320
plus 1, where c and d are
constants and both of them

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.577
are greater than one.

00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:20.660
So what I want to do over
the course of this video

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.420
is see what can we infer
based on this expression,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.567
this function definition,
that we have here.

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:28.650
And the first thing that
I want you to think about

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.970
is, what is the
initial position?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.600
If I were to express the
initial position, in terms

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500
of c's and d's, and
try to simplify it.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.220
So I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.630
and try to find an expression
for the initial position.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.850
Well, the initial
position is the position

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.930
we're at when our
time is equal to 0.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.390
So we essentially just
want to find p of 0.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.850
And p of 0 is going to
be equal to negative d

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.932
to the negative 0.

00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:04.140
So I'll just write that down.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:14.370
Negative 0 plus c to the
fourth over c squared plus 1.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.060
Well, d to the
negative 0, that's

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.510
the same thing as d
to the 0, and since we

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.490
know that d is non-zero,
we know this is defined.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.190
Anything non-zero to the
0-th power is going to be 1.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.300
And the zero is
actually under debate,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.160
what 0 to the 0-th power is.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.660
But we can safely say
that this right over here

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.760
is going to be equal to 1.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.940
And so the numerator
here simplifies 2.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.400
This is equal to-- and
I'll switch the order.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.930
c to the fourth minus 1
over c squared plus 1.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.730
And now this might jump out at
you as a difference of squares.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.240
We could write this
as c squared, squared,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.370
minus 1 squared over
c squared plus 1.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.470
And that's the same
thing as c squared

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.870
plus 1 times c squared minus 1.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.169
All of that over
c squared plus 1.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.280
And we have a c squared
plus 1 in the numerator

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.160
and that denominator
so we can simplify.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.720
And so our initial position is
going to be c squared minus 1.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.790
So that actually simplified
out quite nicely.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.397
Now the next question I'm
going to ask you is-- OK,

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:26.730
we know that the initial
position that time equals zero,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.240
the particle is going to
be at c squared minus 1.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.310
But what happens after that?

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.410
Does the position
keep increasing?

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.170
Does the position
keep decreasing?

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.820
Or does the position maybe
increase and then decrease,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.010
or decrease and then increase
as in keep swapping around?

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.160
So I encourage you to pause
the video now and think

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.670
about what happens
to the position.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.460
Does it keep increasing?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.460
Does it keep decreasing?

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.630
Or does it do something else?

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.710
Well, let's answer
that question of what's

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.350
happening to the position
after our initial position.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.590
We really just have to focus
on this term right over here.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.460
This d to the negative t.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.010
This is the only part
that really t is driving.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.050
All these other things
are staying the same

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.850
as we go through time.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.460
So what happens to d to
the negative t power,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.570
to this part of this first
term, as t goes from 0 onwards.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.180
And to think about
that, let's plot.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.090
Let's plot what the function d
to the negative t looks like.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.180
d to the negative
t would look like--

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.910
and we know that d
is greater than 1.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.390
So when t is equal to 0-- So
this is t right over here.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.500
And over here we're going
to plot on this axis.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.370
We're going to plot
d to the negative t.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.170
When t is equal to 0 this
is going to be equal to 1.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.950
We've already seen that.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.470
Now what happens as t increases?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.600
Say t increases to 1.

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:57.880
Well, now this is going to
be d to the negative 1, which

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.304
is the same thing as 1 over d.

00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:00.970
And we don't know the
exact value for d,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.090
but we know, since d is
greater than 1, 1 over

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.760
d is going to be less than 1.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.300
So let's say this is 1
over d right over here.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.160
1 over d.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.010
So it's going to be
something like that.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.460
And then when t is
at 2 we're going

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.290
to be at 1 over d
squared, which is going

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.820
to be something like
right over there.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.170
And you see at least this term
what it's doing as t increases.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.890
As t increases, d
to the negative t

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.135
is strictly decreasing.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.240
And once again we know that
because d is greater than 1.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.980
So this term right over
here is strictly decreasing.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.570
So this is decreasing.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.790
That part of it.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.800
But we're not adding it.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.480
We're subtracting it.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.020
We're subtracting
from the beginning.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.620
At first this starts off at 1.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.810
We subtract 1.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.720
And then we start subtracting
smaller and smaller things

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.130
than 1.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.030
So if this is decreasing,
but we're subtracting it,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.840
we're subtracting smaller
and smaller things,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.250
this whole thing,
the negative of it,

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.725
is going to be increasing.

00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:12.580
Another way to think about it.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.200
If you wanted to plot
negative d to the negative t,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.300
it would look like this.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.880
It would just be the negative
of this right over here.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.693
So it would look
something like-- I'll

00:05:24.693 --> 00:05:28.980
do that yellow color-- this.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.580
So this whole term
right over here,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.530
negative d to the negative
t, is constantly increasing.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.050
And we know that all of these
other things, well, these

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.450
are just going to be fixed.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.580
So this entire
expression is constantly

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.630
increasing starting
at t equals 0.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.190
And then t going into larger
and larger positive values.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.710
Now the last thing
I want to ask you

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.080
is, what is the
maximum value here?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.722
What is a value that this
will never be able to get to?

00:05:59.722 --> 00:06:01.680
It might try to get close
to it, but it's never

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.350
going to quite get there.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.300
Well, we already know
that it's increasing,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.342
but let's just think about what
happens as t becomes really,

00:06:09.342 --> 00:06:10.550
really, really large numbers.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.700
Really you could think about
it as t approaches infinity.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.640
Well, once again let's look at
this d to the negative t term.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.940
You see the d to the negative
t, as t gets larger and larger,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.770
is getting smaller and smaller.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:29.450
This term right over
here is approaching 0

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.920
as t goes to infinity.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.440
Well, if this is approaching 0
that means we're subtracting 0.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.886
So this whole yellow thing, the
negative d to the negative t,

00:06:41.886 --> 00:06:43.260
is increasing but
it's increasing

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.937
at a smaller and slower rate.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:46.770
So this is the negative
d to the negative t.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.769
This is right over here.

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:49.410
You see it increases
but it never quite

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.430
gets to the horizontal
axis right over here.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.970
And so if we think about it
as t approaches infinity,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.090
this whole thing just becomes
0 and our entire position

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.230
is approaching but
never quite gets

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:09.446
to c to the fourth
over c squared plus 1.

00:07:09.446 --> 00:07:11.570
So one way to think about
it, it's approaching this

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.840
but it never quite gets to a
position of c to the fourth

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.800
over c squared plus 1.
