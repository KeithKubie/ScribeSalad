00:00:00.726 --> 00:00:02.799
- [Voiceover] Let g of x, let g of x equal

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:05.094
x squared minus five.

00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:07.776
If f of g of x is equal to the square root

00:00:07.776 --> 00:00:09.422
of x squared plus four,

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:12.815
which of the following describes f of x?

00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:14.502
All right, this is interesting.

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:16.736
So, one way I could think
about doing this is,

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:19.035
well let's just try
each of these f of xes.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.265
If this is, if this was f of x,

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:27.265
then f of g of x is going to be equal to,

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:29.904
well, everywhere you see an x,

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.606
you would replace with g of x.

00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:36.446
So, it would be equal to
the square root of g of x,

00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:41.446
g of x plus one, and g of
x is x squared minus five.

00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:46.485
So it would be the square
root of x squared minus five.

00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:52.032
That's g of x, that's g
of x right over there,

00:00:52.212 --> 00:00:55.200
plus one, plus one.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.527
And this would be the square
root of x squared minus four,

00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:01.274
x squared minus four.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:02.635
Well, that's not what they have here.

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:03.753
They have x squared plus four.

00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:05.766
So this isn't going to be right.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.023
We could try this one.

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:10.701
f of, I'll do this in green just for fun.

00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:14.358
f of g of x is going to be equal to,

00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:18.320
it's going to be the square root of,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.920
well everywhere you see an
x, replace it with a g of x.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.920
The square root of g of x plus one,

00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:27.828
square root of g of x plus one,

00:01:27.828 --> 00:01:30.134
well, that's gonna be
equal to the square root,

00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:34.076
g of x is x squared minus one.

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:38.647
So, g of x is x squared, oh
wait, let me be careful here.

00:01:38.647 --> 00:01:41.796
This is going to be g of x plus nine,

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:44.539
g of x plus nine,

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.591
g of x plus nine, very important detail.

00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:49.191
We have a nine here, it's
gonna be a nine here.

00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.745
And this is going to be
equal to the square root

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:56.745
of g of x, is x squared minus
five, x square minus five.

00:01:57.318 --> 00:01:59.858
And then you're gonna add nine.

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:01.454
You're gonna add nine.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.590
Well, what does that give us?

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.217
This gives us the square root

00:02:04.217 --> 00:02:06.845
of x squared minus five plus nine.

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:08.958
That's gonna be plus four.

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.660
Which is exactly what
you have right over here.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.809
So, if f of x is equal to the
square root of x plus nine,

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:18.080
then f of g of x is going to be this.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.080
So, that's our choice, right over there.
