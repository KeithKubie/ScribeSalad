Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:04          All right, people. This is the Big Bananas, bonkers Rubin Report, end of the year clip show recapping some of my favorite moments at 2018 before we hit the clips though, I want to take a quick moment to thank all of you guys who listen, watch, share, and support the show. You guys are the engine that have kept us totally independent for over two years now and trust me, we're just getting started. 2018 was by far our biggest year, yet as the intellectual dark web went mainstream. I toured over 80 cities all over the world that Jordan Peterson. I also returned to stand up comedy, check the link down below for upcoming dates and we continued to have the conversations that I believe can restore some sanity to the universe. I've actually never felt better about the direction we're headed and with your help, we'll continue to grow.

Speaker 2:          00:48          So here's my one sentence. Sell job. Help us remain totally independent and fan funded by going to Dave rubin.com/donate. All right, that's it. Now more importantly, thank you and enjoy some of my favorite moments with some of my favorite people from 2018 but you were on with Kathy Newman on it's Canada channel for UK, UK Channel Four, sorry, four. Yup. And there there is, I mean everyone that's watching this has probably seen this already have, you should go watch it yet if you haven't, you should go watch it. But, but in effect, basically she tried to make an argument that you have heard a good Julian Times before, but why does your right to free speech supersede a trans person's right to feel okay with themselves are saying even the way she phrased the question was a little confused and conflated, but well the thing, but the reaction to it w w your, your answer was great, but it was the reaction the regular people watching at home.

Speaker 2:          01:43          Then we're going, this is nonsense. This is just abject. No. The only thing that's really made it viral is the fact that she recognized it in the moment and what she was saying [inaudible] where you could see the light go on briefly and she just went, wait, what did I just say? Yeah, and there was no escape. It was, yeah, it was pretty. It was pretty grand. Yeah. Well the funny thing about her argument is that it's Pr was predicated on the idea that somehow people have a right to be comfortable. It's like that's just not a right you have in life all the things you can say that you don't have a right to in life. Being comfortable is number one, which you made that point. Yeah, you can offend me right now. So the thing is is if you, if you're right to be comfortable trumps my right to talk, then I don't get to talk ever because I'm going to say things.

Speaker 2:          02:25          If I'm actually talking, I'm going to say things. If they're, if they're profound things, if they're contentious, things are truthful things, I'm going to say things that if they don't disturb you are going to disturb you. And if they don't disturb you, there's someone that's going to be disturbed about them. So what's the answer to that? Everyone can be comfortable in the silence, but that doesn't also doesn't work because then we can't exchange ideas were not comfortable in the silence. We're isolated and Dan didn't the silence. So it's a completely incoherent perspective. I will say the last time I was on your program, the only time I was on before I remember you asking me what I thought of the left and I quipped

Speaker 3:          03:00          uh, what left? I haven't seen him in. Who knows how long. Yeah. That turns out not to have been right. They, they exist. I mean, yes, I hadn't seen them. But one of the funny things about my trajectory is that having been, you know, the experience was very much like being ejected from the left. Yeah. And I got ejected from the left and a lot of people on the right embraced me, which was weird. And then even weirder was the discovery of all the other people who had been ejected from the left. And so the point is, this is sort of a cryptic left, you're talking to the right. Exactly. Well and so, so the point is the discovery that there are a lot of people who you might, if you just looked them up online you would come to the wrong conclusion about where their sympathies lay that that's interesting.

Speaker 3:          03:39          And I think the conversation between those of us who have been, you know, catapulted out and those of us who have landed on the right is going to involve the recognition that in fact we are all suffering from a kind of political PTSD and that in fact many people who are on the right are there because they've been traumatized by really low quality, dangerous leftist thinking. Um, but that that does not make their right of center position natural. I'm not saying there are no natural positions over there, but many people who are there are there because they have run from things that they've heard on the left. And once we give up on the idea that anybody on the map today has the answer with respect to the policies that we are supposed to embrace once we say actually everybody's policies are a failure. If we were to enact uh, the libertarian program, it would fail for game theoretic reasons.

Speaker 3:          04:33          If we were to enact the socialist program, it would fail for game theoretic reason. Same thing, right? So the point is, okay, fresh sheet of paper with respect to policy. Now there's a lot for us to talk about starting from values and there are a lot of people who if you ask them to list their values apart from policy would fall out on the left. So, um, wow. Is it an interesting moment that that conversation may be about to get started and to be in a position to actually influence it, I must say is a pretty exciting one of the things that I found out that was sort of amazing about your history, you, you briefly mentioned your right before we started, you were a Marxist

Speaker 4:          05:10          time in your life. Most people will find this hard to believe, but it is true, but it's not that unusual. Uh, most of the leading conservative thinkers of our time time, uh, did not start off as conservator. You've got a couple like a Bill Buckley and the George will, but I'm in Milton Friedman was, it was, it was a liberal and a Keynesian, uh, high Eq was a socialist. Ronald Reagan was so far left at one point, the FBI was following him, you know, uh, so, uh, the, there's a huge movement, uh, from the left to the right as people get older. Yeah. I'm, I'm well aware, as I mentioned to you earlier, as a former progressive, I understand that that movement in the modern sense. Do you remember sort of what you were thinking, what appealed to you at that time about Marxism? Yes. I mean, there was no alternative being discussed.

Speaker 4:          06:03          Um, my first job was as a Western Union Messenger and a, I would come home on some nights. I would take the fifth avenue bus, which cost all of 15 cents in those days. But I figured I'd splurge now and then, and I would drive. It would go all the way up, Fifth Avenue, pass all these lord and Taylor and all these fancy places. And then we were across 57th street pass, Carnegie Hall and down Riverside Drive. And that was the sort of the Gold Coast area. And then yes, I came across this long viaduct and that turned into 130 fifth street. Suddenly there were the tenements and I went, why is this? I mean, it's so, so it's so different and, and nothing in the schools or most of the books, uh, seem to deal with that and walks, dealt with that. Uh, so it's, it's, it's like winning an election when there's only one person running. So then what was your wake up to? What was wrong with that line of thinking a fact?

Speaker 3:          07:02          I'm not one of those who thinks things are worse now than they've ever been. I mean, this is a country where we've, we fought over a big issue for a long time. The revolutionary war of course. And then of course, we had the war of 1812. We had the civil war, World War One, World War II, Vietnam, Korean War, nine 11 people hated Ronald Reagan. Thought he was a warmonger. Uh, George Bush. Uh, what was it? Bush lie, people died. Uh, there's tension in this country. There always has been a, for a very long period of time. We get along better now than ever before. We've, I said, man, I don't think you can understate the fact that we elected and reelected a black president in the 50s. The polls show that the percentage of white Americans who will be willing to vote for a black person, no matter how well I call it for qualified, was in the single digits. Uh, and now I think only three or 4% of Republicans and Democrats say that under no circumstances would they vote for a black person, for president. In fact, if greater prejudice against the Mormon, uh, and again, warning for a woman than it is voting for a black person now. So, uh, America is a very different place than it used to be. And for the left to act like it's not insults the men and women who worked hard to get us to where we are right now. It's actually really

Speaker 5:          08:12          true to say that Obama was basically as honest as a politician can be and still be a politician. I mean, I think you have, I'm sure he lied about things, right? Yeah. But there's no story on Obama being just this depraved person behind closed doors who get, who's a, who's a con artist, who gets away with everything that he can get away with a WHO's trailing along list of key business and interpersonal casualties. Who will tell you if you put them on camera or you can't get them privately? He's the worst person they've ever met. Right? That's his president now. Right. It's just that it's a completely different personality. Um, and uh, I think that, I think so whatever happens, let's say good that let, let's say we're living in a universe where having a, a uniquely narcissistic, selfish, shallow personality in this position of power works out.

Speaker 5:          09:14          Well, let's just say that I mean a lot. So let's just take your wrecking ball theory. He's kind of swung through here. He's disrupted everything. You know? I do view him, as I said, I've said before as a kind of evil Chauncey Gardner character. I don't view him as this sort of mastery. I think Scott Adams is completely out to lunch on this. I don't think he's this genius manipulator. I mean, he's got, he's got some talents obviously, but I think it's much less calculated bolus calculator. I don't think him contradicting himself. Two sentences later, right when he says, you know this amazing letter, you'd all like to read this letter and then he says two sentences later, I haven't read the letter. That's not calculated. He's just not, doesn't have the car. He can't take the cognitive overhead to even figure out what you know, what was logically implied by the last thing you said?

Speaker 5:          09:58          Right? So He's, the truth is he's not, he lies all the time, but worse than line. And this is the great distinction that philosopher Harry Frankfurt made in his book on Bullshit. Worse than line is that he's bullshitting all the time. And the difference between line and bullshitting is it. If I'm going to lie to you, I'm paying attention to what I know. Right. I know what is true. I know you know what is true and I'm trying to insert ally into the space provided in a way that you won't notice. Right? Like I'm having to keep track of reality in order to lie to you successfully. I understand your logical expectations. I understand that. If I tell you that, you know, I was an hour late here because the traffic was so bad. I can't say in the next sentence. Oh, I left an hour late from my house.

Speaker 5:          10:49          Right. So like so, um, uh, so the bullshit or isn't doing any of that, that bullshit or is just talking right and therefore has renounced the reality testing he has to do to lie successfully and he's just, he has the burden is not on him to make any sense at all in the end. And um, that to an amazing degree, not entirely. I think he does actually lie strategically sometimes, but to an amazing degree. And this is what I think is so harmful about his presidency. Whatever happens with North Korea or anything else that we might care about to an amazing degree. He has revealed that half of our society will accept somebody who is just bullshitting all the time about things. Great and small. I mean, it doesn't matter how important or how inconsequential porn stars, you know, what, you know, what just happened with the g seven, you know what was said behind closed doors, what he's going to say to, to a you some maniac with, with nukes. Um, there's just a, we've

Speaker 6:          11:53          completely forsaken any expectation of a reality based conversation and many people seem to revel in it. Many people seem to think this is just, this is just good fun. This is like, this is, you know, the answer. It's a bit of the wrecking ball theory. Gone to some nihilistic extreme where it's just, let's just, you know, let's just burn it all out. Having gone through the looking glass, having gone through the direct, you know, to borrow a phrase from the far left, but the lived experience of actually being at the center of a mob at the center of riots and then watching as the world, the mainstream media and others tried to do a public relations spin on it and tell a totally different story to live that and to watch the institution that you love to become totally disloyal to you and to watch many people whom you respected, um, hide.

Speaker 7:          12:49          Yeah,

Speaker 6:          12:50          you can't unsee that. It's valuable. And the fact that we're sitting here talking together and that many of us in, you know, the intellectual dark web and, and this and this bigger group are, are speaking and saying actually the culture of fear that is society wide is real. And so I'll say the first time I met my students after the November, 2016 election after Trump was elected, evergreen is a very left place. Olympia is a very left place. Pretty much everyone on campus had that glazed eyes. Slack Jawed look that people in most progressive enclaves will be familiar with from that time, from those few days, right. Myself included, even though, you know, I was no Hillary fan, but I didn't see that outcome coming and I certainly didn't vote for Trump. I, um,

Speaker 6:          13:39          we got to class and my co faculty whom I admire greatly, uh, just proceeded with her lecture on horse evolution and I'm looking around the classroom going, no one here cares about horses. There is not the day. Um, so she ended up at early and we had lab a couple of hours later and before she let them go, I said, hold on, if anyone wants to stay, this is no longer class, but if anyone wants to stay, I would be happy to lead a conversation about what just happened, what just happened to our country. And about 40 of our 50 students stayed and skip their lunch hour. And we went right to anatomy lab that afternoon from, from this conversation. And what I said to them was, do not for a minute believe that racists and sexist elected Trump. Think about how many times you have had to censor yourself on this campus when you had an opinion that was even slightly different from the accepted dogma.

Speaker 6:          14:34          And that conversation not only brought life to the room, but afterwards I had several students come up to me, some of them in tears telling me stories about, one of them had lost a job on campus for speaking and opinion that was not accepted. One of them had an, another story of another friend who lost a job. Others talked about their self censorship and um, that and all of these people, again, we're far left, not that it should matter, but these weren't even people who are conservatives or who held conservative views. So that, that is the larger culture of fear that is hardly restricted to evergreen. But as society wide that we're, that we're speaking about and the people are responding to because in you at Google, at Starbucks and in cubicles in campuses but far be on campuses across the country and across the weird country is at least this is a problem.

Speaker 2:          15:29          Shapiro, will you bake Ruben a wedding cake? Huh? Okay. So, I mean, my answer is I'm married already, right. But an anniversary, it's my anniversary last week and anniversary cake would have been nice. Right. So I, so the answer is no, and the reason I won't is because it's a religious Jew. I, yeah. I do not participate in activities that I believe are sinful. But again, we live in a free country and Dave knows this. He doesn't have to care what I think about sin and, and as long as I'm not bothering Dave, I don't see why it's a problem. Yeah. So it will, I will. I did. Does Dave have a husband? Yeah. I mean like, okay. And Are we friends? Yeah. And Are we going to go out to dinner sometime in the near future? Yeah, but, but there's a difference between me just being friends with Dave and me actively participating in an event that I feel is religiously sinful.

Speaker 2:          16:16          And I think that is how most religious Christians in most religious Jews feel. And while that's awkward, yeah, we're still friends in spite of it, which is why we're friends. If your friends in spite of it, then there'll be a bad thing. We'll look when I, when I did your interview show, which by the way, I mean, yeah, you Jack, the idea of an enter your show front of me. It's all right. It's true. But nobody had done it before me. But what you said that to me in, and I truly mean this, like if you think what I'm doing is sinful, like I, I know it sounds Glib, but I don't care. I, and this is my view is you don't have to can right. Free Country, right? Like that's the thing and it's like, look, look, there is, of course someone's going to go, well wait a minute.

Speaker 2:          16:52          If you really think his marriage is simpler saying of course they'll, they'll may be a place that in the nature of our friendship maybe that we can't quite get to, that I would be able to get to with someone that didn't think for sure. That is very possible. And, and it, and it goes both ways, right? Like, I then look at you and I go, well [inaudible] you don't want me teaching your kid about the nature of family perhaps, right? I mean like, like there are some believers, but you're probably a pretty good dad. Like you know what I mean? Like what, why is it that we're able to do this? And most people can't do this. That's what I'm curious to go home at night and we can have our own lives. I mean that's, that's a real, and I think part of friendship by the way is that like we go home at night and we just have our own lives.

Speaker 2:          17:30          Yeah. I'm not married to you. Right? Like that's like my wife and I have to agree on these issues. You and I don't have to agree on these issues in order for us to share our common space together. And that's really the important thing. Your wife and you have to agree on these, on all of these issues or just the, the, the sort of, the more foundational and the foundational ones. But I do think that you know how you raise your kids religiously and with regard things like sexual morality does actually have to be at the root of, of how you teach your kids. Yeah. So if you have deep, if you have deep divisions with your spouse on these issues, I think that, and you're looking to build a family anyway. Yeah. Then I think that these are issues where building on a bad foundation is a bad move.

Speaker 2:          18:04          So let me, okay, so if you wouldn't bake me a cake, that's okay. And now because it's 50, 50, I can't bake you a cake, which I, David's measurable chef and he would've done it coaching the whole wow man. Yeah. No, I feel bad. You would have done it for you. You got me this clothes. Putting that aside, you can't have any of it's kosher cake now. Um, if we were having an anniversary party, would you come? If I was inviting all the crew that we all know and we were just an anniversary party, we're just having a party and a, and I'll even throw in some kosher food for you to make sure you don't have to bring your own. Honestly, I'd have to think about it. I'd have to think about it in the same way. So That's interesting to me. Yeah, that's a different thing.

Speaker 2:          18:35          Well, not really, because again, it's if you're a religious person, and again, take it from the religious perspective, from the religious perspective, the question is, are you glorifying something that you think is sinful? Yeah. So is it a party for something that you think was originally sinful? Can you participate in that? So from a religious point of view, that's an actual serious moral question. Yeah. When I go out to dinner with you, the answer is yes, right? Because that's not actually like, let's celebrate something that I feel that you're doing is sinful. But I'd have to, I'd have to think about that one. I'm, and I'm being in a perfectly straight forward as possible. I want you to. So it's the, see that's so interesting to me cause it's like if I threw a regular party, just we were just going a party at my house and all the guys [inaudible] like I bake you a cake that had nothing to do with the gay wedding. Right. And that would go to a party with you. That has nothing to do with gay marriage, which will make me a regular cake. Could I just have a Thursday? Sure. I'd give you my baking socks. I'll just buy you one [inaudible] Shapiro cake and then I'm going to write it. Then once I get it here, I can just have a broader base of crap. I mean, it's not gonna be good, but it's, but it'll be there.

Speaker 8:          19:33          Silicon Valley at this point has a bit of a conformity problem. It has a bit of a way in which people are, you know, too, too much, all thinking the same way. It's just like the, there was, you know, the, the apple, I saw this, this meme on the Internet the other day, where was sort of the silicon valley in 1997, Colin think different than Silicon Valley, 2018 colon think the same. It's like you want to ask the question, why is it, why is it so, so way? I think these things are, are, you know, they're, they're somewhat over determined. So I would say a part of it is, um, is that, uh, it's probably the most educated part of the country in terms of how much time people spent in college. And I think one of the downsides of too much education is that you get the most brainwashed.

Speaker 8:          20:17          And so it's, it's, it's the most educated can also mean that it is, it is the, it is the most brainwashed. This is probably also true of the founders, but certainly of, um, of many of the rank and file people who are, um, you know, if you're sort of like a really good engineer or, um, you know, really good at some specific thing, um, your education typically does not involve you thinking that much about, about politics. And so, uh, it's not necessarily from deep ideological conviction. It's often more as a fashion statement than as a question of, of power. So, uh, and so one of the things that's always a little bit hard to score is that even if you took a survey and silicon valley, it's, it's, it comes out as, you know, quite far to the left, you know, weirdly, um, uniform weird sort of group think.

Speaker 8:          21:02          It's a super hard to know where the people really believe this, whether they're with, they're just going along. And so I, I think it's pretty liberal, but, um, but of course not as liberal as it looks. And that's, that's in a way worse because it means people are too scared to, to articulate things. I think diversity's a good thing. I think, especially in a diversity of ideas is, is, is, is to be valued, but you don't have real diversity when you just have a group of people who look different and, uh, and think alike. And so it's, it's, it has to meet, it has to be more than just, uh, you know, than just, um, having the extras from the space cantina scene or something like that. Right. And, uh, and that's, and so that's always, that's always, so it's always like an internal critique, the diversity methods that it's not about diversity at all. It's about, it's about a conformity.

Speaker 9:          21:51          But the point is we're going to have to live with each other as a nation and we're going to have to love each other. And there are a lot of people with this mimetic complex in their mind. This is why I went and I talked to Kanye. I thought what Kanye was gonna do was de Trump a Phi Magda with people who wanted their towns in Ohio and western Pennsylvania to start working again. People who, uh, you know, we're drinking themselves silly feeling that they were part of the American dream. And got sidelined, we are going to have to find common cause and it's just not that hard. You know, it's just not that hard to have a friend who's Hugh is different than yours is not that hard to have a friend. You and I have serious political differences at this point. It just doesn't cause me to want to silence you.

Speaker 9:          22:43          And so my claim is is that even though they're aligned and even though they know they're lie, you've got to experiment with love and forgiveness to the best of your ability. And I can't tell you that I never lashed out. I think I lashed out a little bit at Rebecca Lewis because she was lying. She said it will never not be funny that the entire intellectual dark web is only located on Youtube. Oh really? So the 12 rules of life isn't a book that exists and the waking up podcast isn't something that has no video. Even if it exists on Youtube, people listen to it off of youtube is that it's not true that we don't have any events. Of course Rebecca Lewis is lying. She knows. She's like data and society is lie. These people all know that there are a lie, but they think that they're lying for some beautiful reason to keep our country together, to make sure that we're not in the hands of a tyrant, to make sure that every child has a shot at a beautiful tomorrow.

Speaker 9:          23:42          And I'm sorry that they're this confused, but have some compassion because they don't have the compassion. When we hear about empathy, okay, the onus is on us. They don't have this great empathy. They like, I, I still care about trans people that I can't care about white people. Okay, that gives me a headache. You're either empathic and you care about people in general. Yeah. Or your, it's selective empathy and you really have a lot of hate in your soul. So I set it Goddamn example that that's my basic take, which is you've got to love the people who are allying thinking that they're advancing the world's cause and you have to love them out of their cult. And if we're not willing to take that on, then I don't know what we're doing. But I can't always make this this high bar that I'm setting for myself.

Speaker 9:          24:30          I will fail. I would lash out at somebody but have a forgiveness narrative. There is in general, no redemptive redemption narrative on the left. That's why it's not even a religion. People say it's a cult. It's religion without a redemption narrative. There's nothing. If what you're really excited about the sticking it to the man, whoever the man is, you're not fundamentally a good person. You're a person who's working through your own personal anger and so my claim is is that love the people who are lying against you and figure out what an incredible power, incredibly powerful weapon that is. Because at the end of the day, after you knock them senseless to the pavement, you better offer them a hand up and say, look, it wasn't personal. It's just you were, you were threatening our system and you know, I felt like I couldn't communicate to you while you were still in the call. That's where I am.

Speaker 10:         25:22          Well, there is a fear that if you acknowledge that there are differences between individuals or groups that you're saying that one group is inferior. So there's been a co they, the idea that we have to be the same to be equal has been a very prevalent and strong idea. I don't know who came where the idea comes from, but it's, it's, um, it's dangerous because if you, um, if you argue that no true or quality can be achieved, unless we're all the same, then no, then we can't have a quality. However, if you argue that no, we are all morally equal and that we deserve equal opportunity and, uh, the equal, um, uh, w we deserve equal opportunities to live a happy, flourishing life. However, there are differences between us. Yeah. Then you can preserve that, um, ethical principle. So it's very problematic for people who think that there can be no equality between men and women unless we are proven to be the same identical, um, because the evidence doesn't support this. The idea that we're

Speaker 11:         26:44          the same. Well, look, I've had so many years doing this, Dave, and I can't explain how I still love it. I love the interplay. You should love what you do. Know why you learn something every day, every day you learn. So I can't be close minded like I'm a liberal politically, certainly in social issues, but I'm not close minded enough to think that you can't have an opposing view. I like the argument. I liked the discussion, but in interviewing, I never, I mean my ego at the door, I try not to use the word I to irrelevant and I tried to get into what any other, you know, Edward Bennett Williams, the great lawyer told me once, I said, what is the role of the criminal defense lawyer? He said to get one person on the jury to walk in your client's shoes. If you can get one person to walk in your client's shoes, got a hung jury.

Speaker 11:         27:53          All he has to do is say, I would've done that. I've been in spaces at Columbia for example, or conversations where my being black. It was obvious to me that there is an assumption of, of moral worthiness or have a kind of heightened moral knowledge that I would have as a black person that a white person wouldn't have. And you know, I think, I think I'm not the first to make this analogy of course, but the real religious analogy and the analogy to original sin is pretty apt. Um, because it, I mean the, the way this has a lot to do with black history also because the way I, the way I see it, they're kind of two ways to study history. There's the conventional way, which is, you know, you study World War One, you study the causes and consequences read different takes on, on, on the significance.

Speaker 11:         28:48          And once you've studied all you need to know, you move onto the next topic. But then there's a religious way of studying history, which is, I mean, it's not enough to know the facts. We have to go somewhere on Sunday, every, you know, every single week and learn, talk about the same stories over and over again. So this is, you know, it's, it's the difference between how an atheist learns about the life of Jesus and how a Christian learns about the life of Jesus Jesus and relearn it every week for the rest of their life. In my view, how we're looking at the history of race relations in this country, the history of racism, we are more and more putting it in the religious category of history of where, you know, I can read a piece about the history of lynching in the New York Times almost once every two or three months.

Speaker 11:         29:37          Right. And lemon lynching is a decades old crime at this point. And Abi, I mean, Jesus, Great. Obviously it was a heinous staying on on this country's legacy, you know, but then the number of deaths that that is is the highest amount quoted in New York Times with regard to how many black people were lynched in this country is around 4,000 right? Every single year. Twice that many black people die of homicide. And I, you just don't even hear about that. In the New York Times. There are 20,000 engineers, engineers making between two and $400,000 working right now just on Google search, just on that one feature of Google 20,000 this is the most technologically advanced and powerful organization in the history of the world. It's technology and capabilities so far outstrip those to the Pentagon for example, where the Chinese military or the Russian, the Russians or any other group, this is the most powerful technological entity in the world, which has a choke hold on all human information in English.

Speaker 11:         30:39          So that is all sort of all you need to know. I don't care if Jesus is in charge of the country, that's too much power for any entity to have. And it's a, it's a threat to the nation state actually, and it's a threat to all of us. So yeah, I think whatever it takes is what we need to do. Like now, you know, I'm in his lightened meant guy. But the thing is, is that we're not, when I look backwards in time, you know what, what, what people like Harrison pinker attribute to the enlightenment are, you see as the enlightenment being the latest flowering of a process that was indescribably older than that is exactly right. And then in the end, in the historical sense, certainly grounded in the religious traditions, but, and then from my perspective, grounded in something that's biological, that's far deeper than that, like, like our true proclivity towards admiration for competence and reciprocity.
