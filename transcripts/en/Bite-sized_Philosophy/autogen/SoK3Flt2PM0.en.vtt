and so what they do is put you in a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
and so what they do is put you in a
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.340
and so what they do is put you in a
state of radical uncertainty and never

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
state of radical uncertainty and never
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.010

effective if they don't show you what's
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.900
effective if they don't show you what's

making those horrible noises off screen
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819
making those horrible noises off screen

it's not that at all it's the voluntary
confrontation with the things that make

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660
confrontation with the things that make
 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.990
confrontation with the things that make
up life's Horrors but what's interesting

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000
up life's Horrors but what's interesting
 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.090
up life's Horrors but what's interesting
about it is that there's there's an idea

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100
about it is that there's there's an idea
 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.370
about it is that there's there's an idea
there that lurks under the surface

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380
there that lurks under the surface
 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.760
there that lurks under the surface
archetype and that is there's a lot more

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770
archetype and that is there's a lot more
 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.160
archetype and that is there's a lot more
to you than meets the eye

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170
to you than meets the eye
 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.449
to you than meets the eye
but it won't be released unless it has

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459
but it won't be released unless it has
 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.699
but it won't be released unless it has
to and so you don't even figure out what

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709
to and so you don't even figure out what
 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.190
to and so you don't even figure out what
it is until you put yourself in peril

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
it is until you put yourself in peril
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.350
it is until you put yourself in peril
now part of that you might think like

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360
now part of that you might think like
 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.810
now part of that you might think like
imagine that you're you're an introvert

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820
imagine that you're you're an introvert
 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.460
imagine that you're you're an introvert
you're socially awkward you're highly

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470
you're socially awkward you're highly
 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.930
you're socially awkward you're highly
neurotic so you feel a lot of anxiety

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940
neurotic so you feel a lot of anxiety
 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.400
neurotic so you feel a lot of anxiety
and depression you don't like going to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410
and depression you don't like going to
 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.290
and depression you don't like going to
parties that's because the horrible

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300
parties that's because the horrible
 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.940
parties that's because the horrible
tyrant lives at parties and always

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950
tyrant lives at parties and always
 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.890
tyrant lives at parties and always
glaring at you and judging you and

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900
glaring at you and judging you and
 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.810
glaring at you and judging you and
telling you how useless and insufficient

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820
telling you how useless and insufficient
 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.240
telling you how useless and insufficient
you are and so you go there you don't

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250
you are and so you go there you don't
 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.220
you are and so you go there you don't
even look at people because you know

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230
even look at people because you know
 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.720
even look at people because you know
that if you did look at them you just

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730
that if you did look at them you just
 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.820
that if you did look at them you just
see the face of the judgmental tyrant

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830
see the face of the judgmental tyrant
 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.320
see the face of the judgmental tyrant
which by the way you wouldn't if you

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330
which by the way you wouldn't if you
 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.030
which by the way you wouldn't if you
actually looked at them but you won't

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040
actually looked at them but you won't
 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.220
actually looked at them but you won't
because you avoid and so you're going to

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230
because you avoid and so you're going to
 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.210
because you avoid and so you're going to
go there and you're going to put

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
go there and you're going to put
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.010
go there and you're going to put
yourself in this terrible situation and

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020
yourself in this terrible situation and
 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.360
yourself in this terrible situation and
if you're lucky and you're a bit away

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370
if you're lucky and you're a bit away
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.490
if you're lucky and you're a bit away
then you're going to incorporate all

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500
then you're going to incorporate all
 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.390
then you're going to incorporate all
sorts of information

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400
sorts of information
 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.520
sorts of information
from the external world that will help

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530
from the external world that will help
 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.830
from the external world that will help
you develop your social skills that make

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
you develop your social skills that make
 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.990
you develop your social skills that make
you more sophisticated and even if that

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
you more sophisticated and even if that
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.100
you more sophisticated and even if that
doesn't happen you're gonna learn that

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110
doesn't happen you're gonna learn that
 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.529
doesn't happen you're gonna learn that
you can tolerate your own fear and you

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539
you can tolerate your own fear and you
 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.920
you can tolerate your own fear and you
might say well what's better to not be

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930
might say well what's better to not be
 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.020
might say well what's better to not be
afraid or to know that you can handle

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030
afraid or to know that you can handle
 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.629
afraid or to know that you can handle
being afraid and obviously to not be

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639
being afraid and obviously to not be
 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.969
being afraid and obviously to not be
afraid but give that up because that

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979
afraid but give that up because that
 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.270
afraid but give that up because that
ain't happening so the the next best

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280
ain't happening so the the next best
 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.010
ain't happening so the the next best
thing and the realistic thing is to know

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020
thing and the realistic thing is to know
 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.629
thing and the realistic thing is to know
that you're the master of your own fear

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639
that you're the master of your own fear
 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.600
that you're the master of your own fear
and so a lot of what we're going to talk

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610
and so a lot of what we're going to talk
 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.219
and so a lot of what we're going to talk
about in relationship to classical

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229
about in relationship to classical
 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.990
about in relationship to classical
theories of personality is exactly that

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000
theories of personality is exactly that
 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.560
theories of personality is exactly that
it's not that the world isn't terrible

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570
it's not that the world isn't terrible
 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.540
it's not that the world isn't terrible
it's that the world is terrible but

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550
it's that the world is terrible but
 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.189
it's that the world is terrible but
you're a lot stronger than you think and

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199
you're a lot stronger than you think and
 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.350
you're a lot stronger than you think and
the way you focus so part of that is the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360
the way you focus so part of that is the
 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.290
the way you focus so part of that is the
strength that you gather is partly the

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300
strength that you gather is partly the
 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.310
strength that you gather is partly the
information that you gather when you go

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320
information that you gather when you go
 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.870
information that you gather when you go
somewhere that you're not good at you

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880
somewhere that you're not good at you
 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.400
somewhere that you're not good at you
know so you're establishing new skills

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410
know so you're establishing new skills
 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.960
know so you're establishing new skills
like you have at university but there's

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970
like you have at university but there's
 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.760
like you have at university but there's
another part that's interesting that's

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770
another part that's interesting that's
 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.680
another part that's interesting that's
related to the little video that I

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690
related to the little video that I
 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.689
related to the little video that I
showed you at the beginning DNA turns

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699
showed you at the beginning DNA turns
 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.300
showed you at the beginning DNA turns
out to be a very complex structure and

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310
out to be a very complex structure and
 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.290
out to be a very complex structure and
so if I put you in situation a then DNA

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300
so if I put you in situation a then DNA
 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.969
so if I put you in situation a then DNA
codes certain kinds of proteins that

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979
codes certain kinds of proteins that
 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.830
codes certain kinds of proteins that
help make up the way that your mind is

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840
help make up the way that your mind is
 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.930
help make up the way that your mind is
and the way it works but if I take you

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940
and the way it works but if I take you
 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.180
and the way it works but if I take you
and I put you in another situation

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190
and I put you in another situation
 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.770
and I put you in another situation
completely different genes turn on and

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780
completely different genes turn on and
 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.170
completely different genes turn on and
so what that means is that you have a

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
so what that means is that you have a
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.040
so what that means is that you have a
biological repository of potential use

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050
biological repository of potential use
 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.480
biological repository of potential use
lying dormant highest resolution level

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490
lying dormant highest resolution level
 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.879
lying dormant highest resolution level
of your molecular structure and that if

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889
of your molecular structure and that if
 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.710
of your molecular structure and that if
you push yourself in all sorts of

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720
you push yourself in all sorts of
 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.420
you push yourself in all sorts of
different directions and you find

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430
different directions and you find
 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.800
different directions and you find
different things to pursue and test

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810
different things to pursue and test
 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.240
different things to pursue and test
yourself against then you're going to

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250
yourself against then you're going to
 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.010
yourself against then you're going to
turn on parts of yourself that aren't

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020
turn on parts of yourself that aren't
 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.260
turn on parts of yourself that aren't
currently on and god only knows what

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270
currently on and god only knows what
 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.339
currently on and god only knows what
you'd be like if you turned yourself

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349
you'd be like if you turned yourself
 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.850
you'd be like if you turned yourself
completely on maybe I could use a better

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860
completely on maybe I could use a better
 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:22.390
completely on maybe I could use a better
metaphor

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400
 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.439
I'll tell you a little bit more about

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449
I'll tell you a little bit more about
 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.089
I'll tell you a little bit more about
the shamanic routines because they're

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099
the shamanic routines because they're
 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.540
the shamanic routines because they're
more you know if there is a initiation

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550
more you know if there is a initiation
 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.249
more you know if there is a initiation
archetype which I kind of just described

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259
archetype which I kind of just described
 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.200
archetype which I kind of just described
teaches you can do this for yourself

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210
teaches you can do this for yourself
 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.719
teaches you can do this for yourself
there you have and this is a good way to

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729
there you have and this is a good way to
 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.300
there you have and this is a good way to
live it meets the alternative anyone

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310
live it meets the alternative anyone
 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.610
live it meets the alternative anyone
soul which is like the definition of a

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620
soul which is like the definition of a
 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.619
soul which is like the definition of a
good way to live so madam you're trying

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:42.629
good way to live so madam you're trying
 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:44.089
good way to live so madam you're trying
to pursue something she's got a goal

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099
to pursue something she's got a goal
 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:45.350
to pursue something she's got a goal
that's a good thing you got to have a

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360
that's a good thing you got to have a
 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.760
that's a good thing you got to have a
goal and you don't want to hold on to

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770
goal and you don't want to hold on to
 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.080
goal and you don't want to hold on to
that too tightly because you might be

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090
that too tightly because you might be
 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.450
that too tightly because you might be
wrong it's gotta be willing to let that

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460
wrong it's gotta be willing to let that
 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.189

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199
go and have a different goal but you
 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.110
go and have a different goal but you
need a goal and then you know while

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120
need a goal and then you know while
 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.279
need a goal and then you know while
you're pursuing the goal you're gonna

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289
you're pursuing the goal you're gonna
 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.080
you're pursuing the goal you're gonna
find out that there's some obstacles in

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090
find out that there's some obstacles in
 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.689
find out that there's some obstacles in
your path obviously and maybe some of

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699
your path obviously and maybe some of
 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.189
your path obviously and maybe some of
those obstacles are of a frightening

those obstacles are of a frightening
 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.570
those obstacles are of a frightening
type well maybe they're even of a

type well maybe they're even of a
 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.309
type well maybe they're even of a
disgusting type you might say I don't

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319
disgusting type you might say I don't
 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.200
disgusting type you might say I don't
want to turn into that kind of person so

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210
want to turn into that kind of person so
 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.390

those of you who are sort of socialist

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400
those of you who are sort of socialist

utopian left-wingers might think that

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:10.289
utopian left-wingers might think that

wouldn't I would recommend that you get

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860
wouldn't I would recommend that you get
 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.129
wouldn't I would recommend that you get
over it as rapidly as possible so

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139
over it as rapidly as possible so
 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:17.959
over it as rapidly as possible so
anyways you might think there's no way

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:17.969
anyways you might think there's no way
 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:19.670
anyways you might think there's no way
I'm going to act that way so you sort of

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680
I'm going to act that way so you sort of
 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.179
I'm going to act that way so you sort of
put it off limits say or maybe you're

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:23.189
put it off limits say or maybe you're
 

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:24.980
put it off limits say or maybe you're
afraid to do what you need to do next

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990
afraid to do what you need to do next
 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.659
afraid to do what you need to do next
well here's a rule don't avoid doing

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:29.669
well here's a rule don't avoid doing
 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:31.700
well here's a rule don't avoid doing
things because they make you feel

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710
things because they make you feel
 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.860
things because they make you feel
negative emotion if you have to do those

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870
negative emotion if you have to do those
 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.749
negative emotion if you have to do those
things in order to pursue your goals in

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759
things in order to pursue your goals in
 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.909
things in order to pursue your goals in
fact you should do exactly the opposite

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919
fact you should do exactly the opposite
 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.589
fact you should do exactly the opposite
so let's say you're pursuing a goal and

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599
so let's say you're pursuing a goal and
 

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:41.089
so let's say you're pursuing a goal and
you find that you're afraid about

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:41.099
you find that you're afraid about
 

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:42.920
you find that you're afraid about
something and so you're avoiding it the

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930
something and so you're avoiding it the
 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.649
something and so you're avoiding it the
first thing you should think is aha look

00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:45.659
first thing you should think is aha look
 

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:47.510
first thing you should think is aha look
I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520
I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding
 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.610
I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding
it dragon treasure exactly there and

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:52.620
it dragon treasure exactly there and
 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.769
it dragon treasure exactly there and
that's exactly right it's precisely

00:07:54.769 --> 00:07:54.779
that's exactly right it's precisely
 

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:57.559
that's exactly right it's precisely
right if you're if you're afraid of the

00:07:57.559 --> 00:07:57.569
right if you're if you're afraid of the
 

00:07:57.569 --> 00:07:58.790
right if you're if you're afraid of the
thing then what that means is that

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800
thing then what that means is that
 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.379
thing then what that means is that
you're not developed enough to handle it

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:00.389
you're not developed enough to handle it
 

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:02.540
you're not developed enough to handle it
and you need to be so you should think

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.550
and you need to be so you should think
 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.040
and you need to be so you should think
about that as a discovery like a

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.050
about that as a discovery like a
 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.899
about that as a discovery like a
positive discovery you found out where

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:05.909
positive discovery you found out where
 

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:08.570
positive discovery you found out where
you have a weakness and you're now able

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580
you have a weakness and you're now able
 

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.670
you have a weakness and you're now able
to address it so you know if you're an

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680
to address it so you know if you're an
 

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.899
to address it so you know if you're an
introvert and you think it's Friday

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:11.909
introvert and you think it's Friday
 

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:13.490

night I could go to this party but you

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500
night I could go to this party but you
 

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.659
night I could go to this party but you
know I really don't want to then you

00:08:14.659 --> 00:08:14.669
know I really don't want to then you
 

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:17.899
know I really don't want to then you
think oh that means I should go and

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:17.909
think oh that means I should go and
 

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:19.490

that's exactly right

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500
that's exactly right
 

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:25.110
that's exactly right
because

decide how you're going to act it out
