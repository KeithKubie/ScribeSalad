00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.120
I think one of the things that you know

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.480
going back to my Heal the Bay days

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.700
whenever you had a problem like this

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.340
that the key thing always was that the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.259
environmental community would talk to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.560
the affected industry and then figure

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.420
out what the right path was and then

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.920
you'd go forward and talk to the state

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.600
and say this is what hey the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.820
environmental community and the affected

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.320
industry whether it's the restaurants or

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.939
it's the the fishermen we agree this is

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.230
something that we need to do we

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.530
recommend A, B and C so on what are you

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.579
going to do to actually make this a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.680
reality and I think that's the sort of

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.489
that dialogue needs to be restarted.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.620
I wrote an article recently about a style

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.200
of restaurant from Nayarít that sells

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.280
grilled snook as sort of their specialty

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.520
Pescado Zarandeado

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.359
and one of the proprietors the sort has

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.600
served me you know sea bass done the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.920
same way as the snook, saying that it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.700
was getting sort of harder and harder to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.210
catch. And though you know I've done

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.820
whatever seven meals in this thing and I

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.159
almost written the piece I started to freak out

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.090
a little because I didn't want to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.660
encourage people to eat a fish that was

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.660
endangered so I did some reading about

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.520
it and some and some research about it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.360
and found out that actually, mostly

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.840
because of sport fishing and because

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.900
snook is such a treasured

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.780
you know sport fish that you're not

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.280
allowed to catch it commercially in

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.939
Florida and that in the Gulf it's not

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.620
doing so well but that along the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.299
Pacific coast it's one of the most

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.939
abundant species and it was coming from

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.049
the Pacific so I felt you know

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.950
encouraged by the IUCN that I could

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.860
write about it when I wrote about

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.860
Yucatecan place a couple weeks ago they

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.360
served empanadas stuffed with cazón and

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.800
I'd always thought of cazón as shark

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800
and you're not supposed to eat

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.239
shark and I was flipping out about it a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.790
little bit then you know what happens

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.620
when you do that you do if you don't

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.540
have my brother to call you you do some

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.460
research and you find out that cazón

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.010
I mean obviously is shark but it's more

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.040
commonly known as dogfish and it's by far

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.040
far far the most abundant shark species and

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.440
is in no danger of disappearing, again

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.040
in the area where it's being caught for

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.840
this restaurant.  So I think it's

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.560
necessary to do for me to do to do my

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.209
homework good for people doing my

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.010
particular job to do the homework
