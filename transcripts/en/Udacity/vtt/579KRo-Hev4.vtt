00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.650
And a conversion factor is just a number
that relates amount of one thing

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.680
to the amount of another thing, and it's
always equal to our favorite number 1.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.610
And we've already seen how
to use a conversion factor

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.240
to go from number of
cartons to number of eggs.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.980
And the conversion factor we used was 12
eggs divided by 1 carton, but cartons

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.540
and eggs aren't the only thing that we
can convert using a conversion factor.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.560
We can convert between units of
distance, or volume, or even money.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.640
If we have the correct
conversion factor, for example,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.590
let's look at yards to feet.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.960
There are three feet in every
yard which means 3 feet = 1 yard,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.170
in the same way that 12 eggs
was equal to one carton.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.730
But that's not quite
our conversion factor.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.150
The conversion factor is 3
feet divided by 1 yard and

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.550
this is equal to 1 since these
quantities are identical.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.480
So let's practice using one
of these conversion factors.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.630
Let's say that you
need 4 yards of ribbon.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.700
I don't know, maybe you're having
a birthday party or something.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.560
But the store you're in
sells ribbon by the foot.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.590
How many feet of ribbon should us for
ask for?

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.400
