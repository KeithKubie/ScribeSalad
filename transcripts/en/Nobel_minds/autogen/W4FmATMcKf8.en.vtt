by more noble endo some years before and
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.900
by more noble endo some years before and
but now it was possible to make them in

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910
but now it was possible to make them in
 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.920
but now it was possible to make them in
high yield and now a lot of study of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930
high yield and now a lot of study of
 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.710

to probably break through in the next
 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.560
to probably break through in the next
few years it's tricky because there's a

lot of has been a lot of investment in
 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.840
lot of has been a lot of investment in
other technologies before that but I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850
other technologies before that but I
 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.910

think in the next five years will see a

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920
think in the next five years will see a
 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.220

been made and people are looking at that
 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.160
been made and people are looking at that
very carefully as well and that looks

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170
very carefully as well and that looks
 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.080
very carefully as well and that looks
interesting because you could probably

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090
