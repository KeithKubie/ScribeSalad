populations went up growth you know

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
populations went up growth you know
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300
populations went up growth you know
economic activity went up if there was a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310

went went down and there really wasn't
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.420
went went down and there really wasn't
you know there was a little bit of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
you know there was a little bit of
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.609
you know there was a little bit of
progress but yields per acre went up a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
progress but yields per acre went up a
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.830
progress but yields per acre went up a
little bit but it was really slow and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
little bit but it was really slow and
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.560
little bit but it was really slow and
then something happened with

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
then something happened with
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.490
then something happened with
industrialization and and output per

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
industrialization and and output per
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.770
industrialization and and output per
capita started going up and real

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
capita started going up and real
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.730
capita started going up and real
progress started happening we've reached

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
progress started happening we've reached
 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.880
progress started happening we've reached
a point and that has been a profound

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
a point and that has been a profound
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.130
a point and that has been a profound
change in the world you know so much of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
change in the world you know so much of
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.300
change in the world you know so much of
the world that we know would or so much

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
the world that we know would or so much
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770
the world that we know would or so much
of the world in our heads that we know

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
of the world in our heads that we know
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630

would be recognizable to a Shakespeare

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
would be recognizable to a Shakespeare
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.609
would be recognizable to a Shakespeare
or a Thomas Jefferson but so much of the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
or a Thomas Jefferson but so much of the
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530
or a Thomas Jefferson but so much of the
world that we live in and walk in and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
world that we live in and walk in and
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.180
world that we live in and walk in and
bicycle in and I

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190
bicycle in and I
 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.350
bicycle in and I
I mean a bicycle would be

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360
I mean a bicycle would be
 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.850
I mean a bicycle would be

because you couldn't have made the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820
because you couldn't have made the
 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.120
because you couldn't have made the
wheels so so you know that way so much

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
wheels so so you know that way so much
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.520
wheels so so you know that way so much
of our physical world has changed that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530
of our physical world has changed that
 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.660
of our physical world has changed that
that's got to be you know force number

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670
that's got to be you know force number
 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.090
that's got to be you know force number
or force number one at the same time I

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100
or force number one at the same time I
 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.320
or force number one at the same time I
think we've reached this very scary

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330
think we've reached this very scary
 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.640
think we've reached this very scary
point of questions of the limits of that

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650
point of questions of the limits of that
 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.830
point of questions of the limits of that
I mean it's clear that the biosphere

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840
I mean it's clear that the biosphere
 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.390
I mean it's clear that the biosphere
can't take a lot more and we may you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400
can't take a lot more and we may you
 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.070
can't take a lot more and we may you
know we may have plenty of fossil fuel

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080
know we may have plenty of fossil fuel
 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.660
know we may have plenty of fossil fuel
left i'm not going to get into the peak

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670
left i'm not going to get into the peak
 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.430
left i'm not going to get into the peak
oil argument i don't know the answer to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440
oil argument i don't know the answer to
 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.280
oil argument i don't know the answer to
that but we can't afford to burden and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290
that but we can't afford to burden and
 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.460
that but we can't afford to burden and
and so we've reached i think a point

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470
and so we've reached i think a point
 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.510
and so we've reached i think a point
where we have got to change something if

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520
where we have got to change something if
 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.110
where we have got to change something if
we're going to continue that other arc
