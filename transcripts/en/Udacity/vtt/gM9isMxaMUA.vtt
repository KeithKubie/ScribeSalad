00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.702
Let's use our new-found knowledge of imaginary numbers to deal with a situation

00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:09.322
we were interested in initially, when we have a parabola that doesn't touch the

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:13.940
x axis. Here I'm showing you the graph of y minus 16 equals the quantity x minus

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.388
3 squared. If we set Y equal to 0 and therefore try to find the x intercepts, we

00:00:18.388 --> 00:00:22.701
know we won't get any real solutions. However, we also have new equipment to

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:27.218
help deal with this situation. Maybe imaginary numbers will help us out. Let's

00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:31.529
see what we can do using the number i. I'd like you to solve this equation then

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.324
either by completing the square or by using the quadratic formula.
