00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
When it comes to design and decoration,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160
it feels extremely tricky and dangerous

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.340
to accuse anyone of having bad taste,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.960
or to pride oneself on having good taste.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.100
The official story is that anything goes

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.620
and no one knows what is good or bad anyway.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.580
But that seems too easy, and lacking in ambition.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.320
Progress can in fact be made on this important issue

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.080
if we try to understand what psychological mechanisms govern the business of taste in the first place.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.020
Why do we have the taste that we have?

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.220
Why are we attracted or repelled by certain sorts of styles?

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.020
The best way to interpret this is via a theory of compensation.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.300
We're all a bit unbalanced inside,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.600
and get attracted to styles in the world

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.140
that promise to compensate us for the things that we're lacking within.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.200
so for example, people who feel chaotic, undisciplined, and cluttered inside,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.840
are liable to be very drawn to interiors that are serene, pure, and poised.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.040
Equally, people who are very exposed to

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.840
and oppressed by the brutal tempo of modern life,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.720
with its excessive brutality, precision, and technological war

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.440
are likely to be drawn to styles that speak of the rustic, the natural, and the cozily shabby.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.500
Now that might be an explanation for taste, but what about bad taste?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.280
What singles out instances of bad taste is excess in some direction or another.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.700
Bad taste is a massive overcompensation,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.100
which has been generated by a sharp shortfall in some area or another;

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.980
it's a response to a psychological or physical trauma.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.580
So for example, the Russians and the Saudis have, over the years,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.740
developed a reputation for spectacularly bad, as in gaudy, over-the-top taste,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.340
a pumped up version of Versailles in Riyadh or Moscow.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.100
This isn't, in a sense, surprising; a century of extreme deprivation under communism,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.320
and an eternity of eking out a living in the barren deserts of Saudi Arabia

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.460
have created, understandably, desperate desires for compensation,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.500
which have evidently, rather, overshot their mark.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.480
Or, think of sentimental bad taste, the kind where there are gnomes in the front gardens

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.540
and gaudy, and sickly sweet trinkets inside.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.200
This is a style frequently favored by the less well-off in society

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.920
people whose woking lives are humiliating back-breaking and the very

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.920
opposite of welcoming tender.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.280
it should be no wonder that these unfortunates might therefore be in the mood

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.880
for something counterbalancingly sweet at home

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.020
in every instance of bad taste, we're looking at the overeager embracing of a good quality

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.380
like sweetness, freedom, fun or prosperity that was once in a very short supply

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.480
bad taste often sickens people but once one understands its origins

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.640
it starts to seem unduly harsh to judge like this

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.620
we can all understand that if a person is starving, they might eagerly eat things which

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.900
in less desperate situations they'd obviously reject and that in their desperation their

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.580
manners might take a back seat

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.320
it's not at all pretty but we never blame them because we know why they're stuffing themselves with such haste

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.220
We should apply similar tact when confronted with unfortunate taste in design

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.640
What's bad in bad taste isn't the person but the prior trauma which

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.780
they're seeking to compensate for, through their dÃ©co.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.380
There is no point in mocking or offering lectures about art history

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.680
the problem isn't a lack of information. It's a trauma created by a badly broken and unbalanced world

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.920
the solution to bad taste is therefore, political

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.480
good taste comes about when people feel appreciated. When there is enough to go around

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.980
and when there's an economy 
which doesn't routinely humiliate in a base its workers

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.860
to make good taste more widespread what matters above all are efforts to diminish

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.600
the desperate lives in which lapses of taste invariably have their origins.
