The OMS program has a thriving
presence on Google+.

00:00:03.293 --> 00:00:07.830
Amazingly, the Google+ community
is entirely student run.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.750
We gather resources, share tips, and
ask questions of our fellow students.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.860
Enormous credit goes to Nate Payne for
setting up the community and

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.600
the moderators of the community for
helping to run it.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.120
To access it, go to the link
in the instructor notes below.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.470
The first time you visit, you'll be
prompted with this ask to join link.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.660
Click that to join the community.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.980
After you join you'll find
lots of useful resources here.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.070
The box in the top right
has common resources that

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.070
every OMS student will need.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.170
Scrolling down you'll find posts,
links, questions, and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.960
suggestions from your fellow students.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.370
&gt;&gt; There are similar communities on
LinkedIn, Facebook and other sites.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.750
And you can find links to those in
the instructor notes below as well.
