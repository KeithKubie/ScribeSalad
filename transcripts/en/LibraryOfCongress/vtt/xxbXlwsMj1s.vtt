00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.720
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Celeste Lawson,
Recording Studio director

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.440
at NLS in Washington, DC.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.050
In this video, I will
cover narration techniques.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.090 position:56%
The following remarks, while
directed to fellow studio directors,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.710
may be of some interest to anyone
involved in the field of narration.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.100
The goal of narration is to
translate the written word in a way

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.570
that is as consistent as possible
with the intent of the author.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.230
The narrator should
skillfully convey the sense

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.740
of the text to the listener.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.530
The art of narration can be
taught only to the extent

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.120
of giving guidelines and techniques
to one who has a talent for it.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.450
If talent is present,
it can be enhanced,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.410
but if talent is not
present, it cannot be taught.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.270
The process of becoming a
skilled narrator is a long one.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.570
They say it takes three years
and the process involves practice

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.050
and practice and more practice.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.580
There is little else in our lives

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.980
that require these particular
muscles to be flexed.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.790
Aside from reading aloud
to our kids, who don't care

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.100
if we have word burgers or
swallow in mid-sentence, we do not,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.780
as a rule, spend much
time reading aloud--

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.470
certainly not for extended
periods of time.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.150
Even very good actors of stage
and film may find it difficult

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.450
to sustain their energy in
telling a story in a small room

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.730
with nothing but a microphone.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.130
So, what makes a good narrator?

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.790
Important attributes of the
voice, with respect to narration,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.910
are quality, strength, and stamina.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.210
Clarity and control are
necessary components.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.360
A fabulous voice is
nice, but it is not

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.420
as desirable as an
interesting voice.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.720
Being limited

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.430
to one pleasant-sounding vocal
quality can become tiresome

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.430
to the listener.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.380
Knowledge of how to
effectively generate, modulate,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.020
and manipulate the
voice are as important

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.060
as the vocal quality itself.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.080
A huge plus is freedom
from characteristics

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.300
which might become
distracting with repetition

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.400
like a tic on intake of breath.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.760
Relentless repetition of any vocal
quality can become distracting,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.650 position:56%
such as always ending sentences with
a downward or an upward inflection

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.320
or a lip smack before the
beginning of every sentence.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.680
Like a dripping faucet, the
listener starts to be attuned only

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.490
to the distraction and
loses track of the story.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.210
Vocal strength is necessary so that
the recording level doesn't have

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.800
to be pumped up so much that every
extraneous sound is captured.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.470
And the narrator's stamina must be
sufficient for the voice to sustain

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.200
for the duration of a recording
session with no audible tiring

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.690
and with no audible degradation
in narration effectiveness.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.650
However, the single most
important requirement

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.270
for a narrator is a great ear.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.010
That is what helps the
narrator reproduce the rhythms

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.670
of foreign accents and
languages, discerns the subtleties

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.050
of the mother tongue, and keeps
dialogue natural and believable.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.690
Listening to the voices in
life- of friends, strangers,

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.540
people on TV- all add to
the narrator's tool box.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.390
Listening to other narrators
and choosing what to emulate

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.230
and what to avoid is invaluable.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.540
And, the really difficult one,
listening to one's own narration

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.680
for at least a half an hour
without the print copy.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.120
Ask your narrators to
judge how they would feel

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.580
if someone started
talking to them like that.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.260
Is it stiff and stilted?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.030
Bizarrely eccentric?

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.490
Or energetic and committed?

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.580
Are the transitions from narrative
to dialogue and back clear?

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.800
Are the different characters clear?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.330
What about the changes in scene,
mood, subject, time frame, etc.?

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.240
The audition process for
finding narrators to work

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.640
in your studio should
be at least two-fold.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.690
Applicants should submit
demo recordings of fiction

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.690
and non-fiction, usually
about five minutes long each.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.280
This gives them an opportunity
to practice the material

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.400
and show themselves off
to their best advantage.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.560
Then, call them into your
studio for a cold read,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.480
to see how they handle material
that they have never seen before

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.760
and that may not be
completely suited to them.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.740
Give them a good 15 minutes
to look over the material.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.060
Don't rush them, make sure they
are ready to go, and let them know

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.760
that if they are not happy with
the way they did something,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.000
they can stop and re-do it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.350
You will then have
samples of their narration

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.220
under various circumstances

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.650
and can assess how they
approach telling a story.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.760
How does a narrator
prepare to read a book?

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.560
I would suggest that you
encourage your narrators

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.620
to read the entire book before
going into the booth to record.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.020
Get it into their brain.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.480
As they read it, they should jot

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.000
down any words they are
uncertain of how to pronounce.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.090
An innate love of and curiosity

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.260 position:56%
about language will serve a narrator
well in this part of the job.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.120
They should write down anything--
street names, foreign phrases,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.720
slang, restaurants-- all
are grist for the mill.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.670
And they should check
out the book's index.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.660
Then they should start researching,
using dictionaries, encyclopedias,

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.160
gazetteers, but above all,
these days, the internet.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.540
The internet makes it
possible to contact authors

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.760
about how they want their sci-fi
characters' names pronounced.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.770
Narrators can go on Forvo
and hear foreign names,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.510
places and phrases
pronounced by native speakers.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.920
They can go on YouTube and hear
author interviews wherein they say

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.460
their own names, presumably
correctly.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.830
Then, the big important step: All
the pronunciations must be written

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.110
out phonetically with copies
for the monitor and reviewer.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.760
We often misremember when we
are in the heat of the moment

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.490
and we need another set
of eyes and ears to ensure

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.270
that we are saying the terms
the way we intended to say them.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.430
How does one keep narration
alive and avoid being boring?

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.220
Don't become a generic
voice without a person.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.940
It is well-intentioned to say,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.970
"I don't want to intrude upon the
text," or "I don't want to get

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.170
between the author and the
listener," but it blands

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.020
out the narration to the
point that it is unlistenable.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.650
Simply stringing words together
with clarity will not cut it.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.610
The narrator must bring his or
her own life experience, opinions,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:49.200
anger, sarcasm, passion, and humor,
especially humor into the booth.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.150
Making no decision about
how to approach a book makes

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.930 position:56%
for a flat, uninvolved, deadly read.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.160
The narrator must bring as
much vitality and interest

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.620
in the topic as the author.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.870
And there will be the
occasional book they hate,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.770 position:56%
written by an author they detest, on
a subject which bores them to death.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.230
In the unfortunate case of such
a mismatch, it is incumbent

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.970
on the narrator to fake
sincerity and fascination.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.120
It has been said that a good
book requires a good narrator

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.920
and a bad book requires
a great narrator.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.390
The narrator needs to have
faith in their audience-

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.330
that they understand English,
that they have read a book before,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.430
and that they have listened
to a recorded book before.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.360
And unless it is a children's
book, that they are not children.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.330
So the delivery does not have
to be very slow and painstaking

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.110
in order not confuse them.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.610
Every comma or quotation mark
does not need to be honored

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.370
with a pause you could
drive a truck through.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.800
The sentence, "Steven Soderbergh
next directed Oceans 11,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.620
starring George Clooney, Brad
Pitt, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.410
Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Elliot
Gould, and Don Cheadle" read

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:14.370
as "Steven Soderbergh next directed
Oceans 11, starring George Clooney,

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:21.830
Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, Julia
Roberts, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.940
Elliot Gould, and Don
Cheadle" kinda makes you want

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.270
to smack the narrator.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:33.630
Every double letter combination-
Andrews sisters, black kilts,

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:38.320
summer rain, doesn't have to
be artificially separated.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.720
The Andrewsisters wore blackilts
to celebrate the summerain.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.170
In real life we elide them.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.540
Listeners are no strangers
to conversational speech.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.840
They hear it every day.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.790
They use it every day.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.520 position:56%
We all know how human speech sounds.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.760
Narrators are story tellers,
not diction teachers.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.870
But does telling the story
mean that the narrator needs

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.050
to be a vocal contortionist?

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.330
Does all the male dialogue that
a female narrator voices need

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.100
to be boomed in her
absolute lowest register,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.220
and do all the women voiced
by a male narrator need

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.150
to be pitched up in a falsetto?

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.060
Does the narrator need to have
a distinct and distinctive voice

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.130
for every schmo who
enters the story?

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.030 position:56%
Distinguishing characters is
important and necessary for clarity,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.240
but can be done with attitude
and without overdoing it

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.360
or taxing the narrator's voice so
that the listener becomes involved

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.990
with the quirky vocal choice and
loses the thread of the story.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.610
Recording a book would seem to be
a pretty straightforward endeavor,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.660
but a number of complications
can and do get in the way.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:54.530 position:56%
Finally though, it all comes down to
one basic premise- Tell Me a Story.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.580
Tell the one the author wrote.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.270
The way the author wrote it.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.580
