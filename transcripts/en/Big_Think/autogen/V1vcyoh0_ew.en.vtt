have has language it's a question that's
 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.470
have has language it's a question that's
been asked many times but to think about

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480
been asked many times but to think about
 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.299
been asked many times but to think about
it I'd like you to imagine a dog and

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
it I'd like you to imagine a dog and
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.390
it I'd like you to imagine a dog and
he's a very thoughtful dog and he can

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
he's a very thoughtful dog and he can
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.260
he's a very thoughtful dog and he can
hear humans barking he can hear that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
hear humans barking he can hear that
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.970
hear humans barking he can hear that
amongst the funny noises humans make

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
amongst the funny noises humans make
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.359
amongst the funny noises humans make
there are a number of signals with fixed

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
there are a number of signals with fixed
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.580
there are a number of signals with fixed
meanings like a walkies sit heel and he

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
meanings like a walkies sit heel and he
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.709
meanings like a walkies sit heel and he
ponders as to whether the rest of the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
ponders as to whether the rest of the
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.500
ponders as to whether the rest of the
noise they make is just barking or

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510
noise they make is just barking or
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.010
noise they make is just barking or
whether it constitutes a language and I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
whether it constitutes a language and I
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.470
whether it constitutes a language and I
fix from that idea I mean obviously it's

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
fix from that idea I mean obviously it's
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.869
fix from that idea I mean obviously it's
a silly fable but it's not completely

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
a silly fable but it's not completely
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.170
a silly fable but it's not completely
silly in that precisely because we do

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
silly in that precisely because we do
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.260
silly in that precisely because we do
not understand the noises that dogs make

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
not understand the noises that dogs make
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.830
not understand the noises that dogs make
except for a few individual signals such

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
except for a few individual signals such
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810
except for a few individual signals such
as you know let me out of here or take

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
as you know let me out of here or take
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.740
as you know let me out of here or take
me for a walk or there's an intruder we

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
me for a walk or there's an intruder we
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.880

therefore say it's not a language

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
therefore say it's not a language
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.299
therefore say it's not a language
because it consists only of a a

signals that don't change and the rest
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.960

is just dog barking dogs could in this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
is just dog barking dogs could in this
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.490
is just dog barking dogs could in this
fable have exactly the same

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

fable have exactly the same
understanding of human language the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049
understanding of human language the
 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.600
understanding of human language the
problem is that we can't translate

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
problem is that we can't translate
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.810
problem is that we can't translate
between dog and human if we could then

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
between dog and human if we could then
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.450
between dog and human if we could then
we might know whether dogs have a

we might know whether dogs have a
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.230
we might know whether dogs have a
language or not

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
language or not

all right the condition for the

all right the condition for the
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.740
all right the condition for the
existence of a language of what we think

existence of a language of what we think

existence of a language of what we think
of as a language is its translate

ability so the boundary between our

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
ability so the boundary between our
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.600
ability so the boundary between our
species and others is indeed an

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
species and others is indeed an
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.969
species and others is indeed an
unbridgeable gulf until we learn to

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
unbridgeable gulf until we learn to
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.609

translate them if we could translate any

of them we would then have a much more

of them we would then have a much more
intelligent interesting view as to what

makes human language different from but

there's no earthly reason I mean given

that language as I've said at the

that language as I've said at the
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.120
that language as I've said at the
beginning is a form of human behavior

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
beginning is a form of human behavior
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.319
beginning is a form of human behavior
why a dog or a cow should have a human

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
why a dog or a cow should have a human
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.090
why a dog or a cow should have a human
form of behavior they're not humans

so that it's the species different you
