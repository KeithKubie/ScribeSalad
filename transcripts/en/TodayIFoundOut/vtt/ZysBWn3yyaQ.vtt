00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.200
The first Muslim person in space was Royal
Saudi Air Force pilot Sultan bin Salman bin

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.400
Abdulaziz Al Saud in 1985 aboard the United
States shuttle Discovery.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.090
He was followed up by the first Muslimah in
space, Anousheh Ansari, who, upon immigrating

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.619
to America from Iran in her teens subsequently
got a degree in electrical engineering and

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.210
computer science and then, not long after,
cashed in her life-savings to co-found Telecom

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.480
Technologies Inc.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.160
The result of all this was Ansari eventually
amassing a personal fortune of about $750

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.900
million, becoming one of the wealthiest women
in the world.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.800
Using some of this self-made fortune, in 2006
she paid an undisclosed sum- speculated to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.850
be about $20 million- to buy an 8 day stay
aboard the International Space Station, where

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.799
she helped out with various experiments during
her stay and in her spare time became the

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.190
first person to publish a blog post from space.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.220
(You can read more about her remarkable story
in her book My Dream of Stars: From Daughter

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.640
of Iran to Space Pioneer.)

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.000
However, as far as we can find, the issue
of how these two, from a practical standpoint,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.920
should adhere to certain facets of their religion
while slipping the surly bonds of Earth never

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.940
came up, at least not publicly.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.250
This all changed in 2007 when Malaysian-born
Muslim astronaut and orthopaedic surgeon Dr.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.070
Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor mused about how exactly
he’d pray towards Mecca while orbiting the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:46.190
Earth at about 17,136 mph (27,577 km/hr),
as well as what the proper protocol was for

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.460
him given part of his stay in space would
fall on Ramadan.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.840
To answer Shukor’s question and set out
general guidelines for future Islamic space

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.560
travelers, Malaysian National Space Agency
and the Department of Islamic Development

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.100
invited 150 Muslim scholars and academics
to a two day conference to determine exactly

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.170
how a devout Muslim should practise their
faith in space.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.900
For anyone unfamiliar, the Quran stipulates
that a Muslim must utter a short prayer (known

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.200
as the Salat) five times a day- once before
dawn, once at midday, once in the late afternoon,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.930
once in the evening and once after sundown.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.770
In addition, Muslims are asked to “Turn
then thy face towards the Sacred Mosque: wherever

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.290
ye are, turn your faces towards it…”

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.290
(The Quran, Al-Baqarah, 2:149)

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.170
cubeIn regards to the first stipulation, the
question arose- how exactly does said individual

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.450
define when the morning even is when a manned
craft orbiting the planet will do so approximately

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.100
16 times in a 24 hour period?

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.750
Is the morning when the sun rises according
to the individual’s perspective from the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.840
window of the spaceship?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.620
So in that case, if one was to follow the
word of the Quran literally, a Muslim astronaut

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.810
would technically have to pray 80 times per
24 hours, or once every 18 minutes.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.620
This would obviously be impractical given
how full astronauts’ schedules typically

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.620
are.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.040
Likewise, it would be exceptionally difficult
for said individual to continually face Mecca

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.850
as the Earth rapidly spins below the astronaut.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.660
Lucky for Shukor and future Muslim space travelers,
all of these issues, along with countless

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.540
others, now have answers thanks to the aforementioned
meeting of Islamic scholars who drafted what

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.010
they called A Guideline of Performing Ibadah
at the International Space Station.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.640
For example, Muslims in space, rather than
praying based on sunrise/sunset schedules

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.370
from their perspective, are instructed to
pray according to the day cycle of the last

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.060
place on Earth they were located, which for
Shukor was at the launch site in Baikonur

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.099
in Kazakhstan.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.849
In the event prayer would interrupt an astronaut’s
duties, the guideline explains that a Muslim

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.720
astronaut can forgo or shorten their prayers
and say longer ones when they have the time.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.090
As for Shukor, he rang in on this very note,
stating, “I am Islamic, but my main priority

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.100
is more of conducting experiments.”

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.319
As for deciding where Mecca is and continually
facing it during the duration of the prayer,

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.040
a Muslim astronaut is simply asked to use
their best judgement with said religious scholars

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.019
agreeing that as long as an earnest attempt
is made by an astronaut to face Mecca as prayer

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.250
begins there should be no religious issue.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.250
The specific guideline in determining the
direction state,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.310
Qibla direction is based on what is possible,
prioritizing as below:

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.489
i.The Ka’aba
ii.The projection of Ka’aba

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.130
iii.The Earth
iv.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.130
Wherever

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.889
Yes, if one cannot otherwise even determine
the direction of the Earth itself, then facing

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.040
“wherever” is acceptable.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.480
As Dr. Khaleel Mohammed of San Diego State
University explained,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.819
In space, the ritual prayer might be offset
for more of a prayer that is allowed when

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:38.370
on jihad … for the lack of gravity and directional
accuracy makes it legitimate to do as one

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.370
sees fit.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.539
God does not take a person to task for that
which is beyond his/her ability to work with.

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.199
Other issues addressed include what a space-faring
Muslim should do in-lieu of standing, bowing,

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.081
prostrating, and repeating while praying-
a difficult thing to pull off while in a state

00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:55.249
of perpetual free-fall around the Earth.

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.059
The solution is to prioritize as follows:

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.059
a.

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:01.870
If upright standing is not possible, then
any standing posture,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.870
b.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.870
Sitting.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.310
Bowing is by bringing down the chin closer
to the knee or the prostrating place,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.310
c.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.469
Lying down on the right side with body facing
the direction of Qibla,

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:12.469
d.

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.469
Lying flat
e.

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:17.879
Using the eye lid as an indicator of the changing
of postures in prayer,

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:18.879
f.

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.210
Imagining the sequence of prayer.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.839
Again, this all just seems to be looking for
a best effort here.

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.550
And if no effort can produce the desired results,
then simply imagining doing it is fine.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.779
This is largely because, to quote Dr. Kamal
Abdali:

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.479
Prayer is not supposed to be a gymnastic exercise.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.750
One is supposed to concentrate on the prayer
rather the exact orientation.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.279
The pamphlet drafted by the Islamic scholars
also outlines what to do if one’s trip in

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:47.539
space coincides with Ramadan (which Shukor’s
partially did), where it is required to fast

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:52.389
from sunrise to sunset- the guide says this
is largely up to the individual and they can

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.539
choose to fast as usual using the same timescale
as they pray to or, if necessary given the

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.939
duties at hand, forgo the fast and make up
for it when they arrive back on Earth.

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:06.919
It’s also interesting to note that the document
explicitly states that “travelling to space

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.279
is encouraged” by Islam, as is the obligation
of Muslims to “maintain sustainability of

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.309
the space environment” and observe peace
with all “other beings” one encounters

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:21.259
in space- meaning the official policy of Islam,
according to the 150 Islamic scholars who

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.909
came up with the guide, requires Muslim astronauts
to maintain peaceful relations with aliens,

00:06:25.909 --> 00:07:43.759
if any are ever encountered.
