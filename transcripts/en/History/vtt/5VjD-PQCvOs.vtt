00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.200
NARRATOR: Despite the
growing popularity of trucks

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.400
in the early 1900s, buyers
were caught in a quagmire

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.970
as infrastructure lagged.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.100
We like to joke that,
at that time, you know,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.830
there were two kinds
of roads-- either

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.670
bad roads or no roads at all.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.000
It was not uncommon for
vehicles to get stuck,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.870
even in good weather.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.070
And then, of course,
in wet weather,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.370
it was like driving
through quicksand.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.170
NARRATOR: Autos were stuck in
the world of two-wheel drive,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.470
with rear wheels pushing
them forward as front wheels

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.200
were left clear to steer.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.200
But then a pair of blacksmiths
from Clintonville, Wisconsin,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.870
had an unfortunate episode
at their part-time job.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.170
Otto Zachow and William
Besserdich sold REO cars.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.600
And they were driving a
REO car, and it got stuck.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
The only way they
could get it unstuck

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.200
is William drove it backwards.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.030
And that gave him
an inspiration--

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.700
powering all four wheels.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.800
NARRATOR: It's an idea that
would become a defining feature

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.030
of trucks forever--

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.830
if they could pull it off.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.200
It's like to trucks in one.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.130
You have the regular
drive going out the rear.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.730
But then you have to have
a transfer case that also

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.230
sends power to a front axle.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.800
And that front
axle has to steer.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.830
Zachow and Besserdich are
credited with coming up with

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.270
a universal ball joint that
would allow the front wheels

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.170
to steer and simultaneously
receive power from the drive

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.970
shaft, which was
the breakthrough

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.900
that made four-wheel drive
technology practical.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.370
NARRATOR: Zachow and
Besserdich's double wide joint,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.600
patented in 1908,
became the centerpiece

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.200
of their groundbreaking
new passenger

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.600
car, dubbed the Battleship.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.770
The Battleship became the
flagship of the blacksmiths'

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.170
new car business,
the aptly named Four

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.300
Wheel Drive Company, or FWD.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.770
And eventually,
FWD caught the eye

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.800
of a very powerful customer.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.970
The Army ordered a
fleet of military trucks

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.870
with FWD technology.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:03.170
It would get a trial
by fire in 1917.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.300
FWD produced more than
24,000 trucks for World War I.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.470
Four-wheel drive was
absolutely indispensable

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.070
to the success of vehicles
during World War I,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.700
because the conditions
there were just terrible.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.030
The rain was constant.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.430
The mud was everywhere.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.800
And of course, it's
literally a battlefield

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.230
that you're having to drive
across, in some cases.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.670
So it was a great advantage
to have that during the war.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.700
NARRATOR: FWD returned from
Europe as a conquering hero.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.570
The world war had given
this company a big victory

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.830
in the truck wars.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.700
And with such
innovative founders,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.830
they might have
established a dynasty.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.500
But there was one problem.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.770
Zachow and Besserdich
both sold out

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.670
their interests soon
after the Four Wheel

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.130
Drive Company was established.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.830
Otto Zachow returned
to his machine shop

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.000
for the rest of his life.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.900
NARRATOR: Although the Four
Wheel Drive Company still

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.100
exists today under
the name FWD Seagrave,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.570
they aren't a household
name for one simple reason.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.530
The brand was built really
around a single technology,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.130
and that has never proven a
long term way to build a brand.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.700
Everybody could adopt
that technology.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.300
So what's left to
hang your hat on?

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.530
NARRATOR: But one look at
the modern truck landscape,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.170
and the impact of that one
simple idea is undeniable.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.430
The legacy of the Four Wheel
Drive Company is immense.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.200
I can't imagine-- and I bet
you can't either-- a world

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.570
without four wheel drive.
