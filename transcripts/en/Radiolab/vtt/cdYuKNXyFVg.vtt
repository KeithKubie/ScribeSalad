1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.220
You are listening to radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.450
N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.870
So if we said where we are, I'm on tape yet. Uh,

4
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.710
starting us off today, our producers, Lynn Levy and Sean Cole,

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.050
very pretty day to be on an abandoned island where victims of contagious disease

6
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:30.950
were quarantined. And one in particular who, uh,

7
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.590
lived here, died here.

8
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.580
Never believing that she was in fact sick and dangerous.

9
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.520
<v 1>No.</v>

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.760
<v 0>So this is the story that she begins where it, well, it's actually,</v>

11
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:46.050
it starts in 1906 and it doesn't start on the island. It starts in Oyster Bay.

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.790
Ooh, nice neighbor. Very nice.

13
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.410
And there was this one rich family on vacation there and their daughter gets

14
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:55.980
sick. She gets sick first. This is Judy Levitt.

15
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.040
I am a professor Emerita at the University of Wisconsin and she wrote a book

16
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:03.680
about this story. So basically the girl,

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.740
the daughter has a fever than her sister comes down with it.

18
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.340
And then her mom and Umaid about six out of 11 in the family get sick.

19
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.260
And with this disease. The fever is just the first part of it.

20
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.290
Both diarrhea or constipation are reported.

21
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.000
So it can go either way, I guess. What is it? Typhoid

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.500
and they couldn't figure out what had caused the disease.

23
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.090
So they called in this sanitary engineer named George Soper with the public

24
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.850
health department. He was the go to guy for outbreaks like this.

25
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.070
Back then the department of public health was thinking,

26
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:41.071
you know when you get sick because of something dirty near you in the well or in

27
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.810
the pipes. Yeah. So he looks into all of that,

28
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.940
did a whole a test on the house and the water and everything.

29
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.090
Couldn't find anything.

30
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:53.350
And so he starts talking to the family and he started quizzing them all and they

31
00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:57.850
remember eventually summer he builds up this whole picture of,

32
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.510
of several outbreaks going back year 1900 Mamaroneck on New York family had a

33
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:08.500
house for the sun. 1902 dark harbor Maine for seven cases,

34
00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:13.090
sands point New York, Autumn 1906 or 1907 in New York City.

35
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.910
All these cases. And they all had one thing in common.

36
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.620
What each of these families had employed.

37
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.390
The same cook is,

38
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.270
which is funny because when you cook food,

39
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.410
you kill the bacteria in the food. Yeah. She couldn't be the cook then,

40
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.520
but this cook, her most famous dish was peach. Melba,

41
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.880
which is ice cream and fresh peaches. Fresh. Yes.

42
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.770
Raw fruit as a perfect medium and the cook's name

43
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.990
<v 2>was Mary Mallon. Mary man.</v>

44
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.220
<v 0>Wait a second. Shannon Cole. Typhoid, typhoid Mary. So we're talking about, oh,</v>

45
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:56.830
so we know this story. No, you don't know this story. What do you mean?

46
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.210
Everybody thinks they know this story.

47
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.970
I thought I knew this and then when I looked into it I realized I didn't know

48
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.850
the first thing about it and when you look into the details,

49
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.090
they tell us some very difficult things about who we were and who we still are.

50
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:11.710
In a lot of ways. It's all in the details.

51
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:16.280
All of the juice and problem like an like the, it's like the PQQ. Yeah,

52
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.580
just like the peaches. You still dealing with it. I'm Robert Krulwich. Go ahead.

53
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.140
Go ahead Chad. I have them. Rod, this is radio lab. In this hour,

54
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.470
a series of stories that all hew to that delicious story archetype we call

55
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.250
patient euro.

56
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.080
The first clock we'll try to trace ideas and trends and massive social traumas

57
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:46.411
like pandemics back to that one person or one critter or the other way you call

58
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:49.840
it. It's called the bug for if you didn't have this thing,

59
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.050
but for this thing you wouldn't have the rest of this.

60
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.350
I like the button for the button

61
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.583
<v 1>four.</v>

62
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.560
<v 0>Meanwhile, back to the peaches. So George Soper is like,</v>

63
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.420
I've got to find this woman. And when he finds her,

64
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.570
she's in New York City working for another family.

65
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.320
The laundry's had recently been taken to the Presbyterian hospital with typhoid

66
00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:13.860
fever.

67
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.460
This is Roman article's super road called the curious case of typhoid Mary and

68
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:20.430
the only child of the family, a lovely daughter, was dying of it.

69
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.860
So he goes to the house, walks into the kitchen, sees this woman,

70
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.940
five foot six blonde hair, blue eyes, had a good figure.

71
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.000
It might've been called athletic had she not been a little too heavy.

72
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:37.920
Irish immigrant, 36 years old, not particularly clean. And he says, Mary Mallon,

73
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:42.320
I think you are causing disease in people and I want, uh,

74
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.240
samples of your urine, feces and blood.

75
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.970
Good afternoon. And she says, what are you accusing me of being sick,

76
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.480
playing the role of Mary is Columbia Public Health Professor David Rosner.

77
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:57.820
How dare you, I'm not a sick person. What does she do?

78
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.490
She traces them out of the building with that fork in her hand.

79
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.780
A serving fork. A surfing for it. Yeah. I felt rather lucky to escape.

80
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.630
But did she have typhoid? Um, I mean, did she outwardly have typhoid? Well,

81
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:18.400
that's the thing. She never had any symptoms. She felt perfectly healthy.

82
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.460
She was actually the first documented case in North America of a healthy

83
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:25.000
carrier,

84
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.680
which is to say someone who has the disease and is contagious but never actually

85
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.480
feels the symptoms, the symptoms. So in one weird way,

86
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.190
sobers thrilled,

87
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.970
like he's only read about this and then here she is in front of him.

88
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.330
But think of how all of this must have sounded. The Mary. I mean,

89
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.690
some guy from outer space comes into your kitchen and says,

90
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.860
you're diseased and you're hurting people. I mean, she must've thought watt.

91
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:55.390
I feel fine. I'm living a moral life. I'm not a vagrant. I'm employed.

92
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.150
I'm a good solid citizen though you would be crazy to what's your,

93
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.970
even today you'd probably grab your knife. Yeah. You grab your knife.

94
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.930
What does he have any evidence of that? She is spreading the disease. Not yet.

95
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:06.970
That's why he needs her

96
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.330
<v 3>poop. Ah,</v>

97
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.150
<v 0>so he goes back and finds her at a rooming house. She kicks him out,</v>

98
00:06:12.151 --> 00:06:14.760
swears at him. She apparently head quite a temper.

99
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.840
And then the health department, uh, sends in this female doctor

100
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.040
<v 3>by the name of s Josephine Baker.</v>

101
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.430
Maybe she could ask for blood feces and urine a little more gently.

102
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.490
I don't know how you ask for that gently,

103
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.580
but she tries and when it doesn't work,

104
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.620
she comes back a little bit later with cops and they come to the house and Mary

105
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.990
Mallon, when she realized is what's happening, disappears. May mean disappears,

106
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.060
completely vanishes.

107
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.750
They end up searching the entire place and they can't find it.

108
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.531
Finally,

109
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:54.880
I think they're about to leave when one of them spots her skirt that coming

110
00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:59.450
outside of a door, it's a little piece of Calico high.

111
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.940
It kind of stuck in a doorway. I opened the door and there she is,

112
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.690
and so they drag her out and she comes out kicking and screaming and screaming.

113
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.320
Chicky takes all of them to drag her out protesting.

114
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.150
They get her in the ambulance at Josephine Baker sits on her according to her,

115
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.210
sits on her and Baker later said something like,

116
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.080
it was like being in a cage with an angry man lion.

117
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.670
<v 0>So they take her down to the hospital.</v>

118
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.750
<v 3>They tested her feces and urine and they found that yes,</v>

119
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:37.751
she was in fact a carrier of live typhoid bacilli

120
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.623
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

121
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.510
<v 4>so weird island man. I spent a while on him.</v>

122
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.940
<v 3>So they isolate her and they ultimately move her.</v>

123
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.300
<v 4>Okay. Look for Manhattan too. North brother island.</v>

124
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.640
Let's have a bit of a haunted drive. Yeah, and there she is.

125
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.820
Thanks man. Yeah,

126
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.650
we went there to just to get our heads around what she must have thought.

127
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.720
Let me think. What was the island like and everything is completely overgrown.

128
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.580
It was really creepy. Creepy because it was in such dissolution. Yeah.

129
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.140
Yes. Be careful where you step and one end. There are all of these medical,

130
00:08:22.141 --> 00:08:23.640
former medical buildings,

131
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.540
including a giant hospital where they isolated tuberculosis patients.

132
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.440
So big brick, stately building. And then on the other side of the island,

133
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.960
there's smaller wooden buildings that are crushed.

134
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.180
This may maybe where her cottages,

135
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.740
where her cottage would be if it was still standing,

136
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.540
but it's not standing anymore. Well, it was one room, one room.

137
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.420
Uh, I had a kitchen. It had a, I guess asleep sleeping

138
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.690
<v 3>area and a sitting area. It probably wasn't,</v>

139
00:08:54.691 --> 00:08:59.040
so if you didn't have to stay there, you know,

140
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:03.120
any places that you're not free to leave of becomes like a prison.

141
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.533
<v 1>Okay.</v>

142
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.590
<v 3>So we're marching around and then Lynn says to me, hey,</v>

143
00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:11.950
look at the view and holy Moly,

144
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.930
<v 4>take a look. It's right there. That's when it really hit me.</v>

145
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.000
If this is where her cabin was,

146
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.890
then one window of it looked exactly on the Manhattan.

147
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.770
She could have seen where she used to live.

148
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.360
You can see the traffic on the streets.

149
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

150
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.320
<v 3>This was like the most horrible seaside vacation almost the whole time they had</v>

151
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:42.880
her incarcerated. They took feces three times a week, which is, you know,

152
00:09:42.881 --> 00:09:45.910
it's not pleasant to have to do that. Um,

153
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.000
and sometimes she was negative and sometimes she was positive. Wait, what?

154
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.410
<v 0>So that's, that's another thing that they were figuring out at the time.</v>

155
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.330
So she was probably an intermittent carrier. What does that mean?

156
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.460
The disease is always in her,

157
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.000
but sometimes she excretes it and sometimes she doesn't. Oh,

158
00:10:07.001 --> 00:10:09.240
that must have been confusing for her. When I first came here,

159
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:13.110
I was so nervous and almost prostrated with grief and trouble.

160
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.090
My eyes began to twitch. This is from a letter that Mary wrote from the island.

161
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.620
I have in fact been a peep show for everybody. But if you keep reading it,

162
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:24.240
and in fact it's addressed to a lawyer,

163
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:28.560
it's clear that she was fighting this and she had been sending her own feces

164
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:33.561
samples herself to a private lab in Manhattan and each one of those was

165
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:37.590
negative. Really? The tuberculosis men would say there she is

166
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.110
<v 4>the kidnapped woman. Yeah, that is poison ivy.</v>

167
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.830
<v 0>She sees the city and loses still.</v>

168
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.890
There are all these questions as to whether any of this is legal.

169
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.150
I mean even George Soper,

170
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:55.140
the guy who hunted her down said it was contrary to the constitution of the

171
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:57.540
United States to hold her under the circumstance.

172
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.150
And how long was she on the silent? For three years. Wow.

173
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.770
And then what changed was a new health commissioner took over.

174
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.540
<v 3>And so he says it's just not right that we keep a healthy woman locked up like</v>

175
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:11.540
this. She was not dangerous to anybody. If she didn't cook,

176
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.560
<v 0>he lets her go. He lets you go back to Manhattan. But he makes her promise.</v>

177
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.670
She did promise. She signed an affidavit saying she'll never cook again.

178
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.300
And she was released. They gave,

179
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:27.540
they've set her up with a job as a laundress and they rent. Here you go Mary.

180
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.230
And then, uh, you know, they kept track of her for awhile.

181
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.080
Uh, and then at a certain point they kinda stopped keeping track over

182
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.560
<v 3>[inaudible] time. So how many years will go by?</v>

183
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.170
Five. Five. What happens next?

184
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.780
There's an outbreak of typhoid where we're at a maternity hospital.

185
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:53.980
You're kidding. Josephine Baker,

186
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.210
<v 0>who sat on her in the ambulance before she says that she goes and pays a visit</v>

187
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.960
and walks into the kitchen and she says the first person that she encountered

188
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.760
was typhoid Mary Mallon

189
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:07.610
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

190
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.870
<v 0>George Soper did some leg work on where Mary had been.</v>

191
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.370
And it turned out she had worked at a restaurant, two hotels and in,

192
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.460
and a sanitorium as well as the hospital. Wow.

193
00:12:19.461 --> 00:12:21.740
And at least according to his account,

194
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.970
two of the people that she made sick during those couple of years were children

195
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:28.580
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

196
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.980
<v 0>She was now a woman who could not claim innocence.</v>

197
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.670
She was known willfully and deliberately to have taken desperate chances with

198
00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:37.820
human life. She had abused her privilege. She had broken her parole.

199
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.710
So then they put her back on north brother island back in her bungalow. Um,

200
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.710
and there she sits.

201
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.880
She was a dangerous character and must be treated accordingly. Absolutely.

202
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.610
She's booked broker problem line. Totally B.

203
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.770
She made a deal and she didn't keep the deal.

204
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:59.090
But the thing is is that at the time she was sent back to the island,

205
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.590
there were hundreds of other healthy carriers identified all over New York and

206
00:13:03.591 --> 00:13:07.700
some of them were cooks. What? Most really? Mostly men by the way.

207
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.700
And they were cooking while they were barred from cooking,

208
00:13:10.701 --> 00:13:13.040
but not all of them always listened. Huh.

209
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.900
And yet Mary was the only one who they isolated in this way.

210
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:18.763
Why?

211
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.733
<v 4>Why only her?</v>

212
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I think it was more about making people feel safe than actually making them

213
00:13:28.681 --> 00:13:33.240
safe. Oh, look out for this stare. Saul crumbled.

214
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.030
She was what we needed at the time

215
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.220
were in the hospital where the tuberculosis patients were quarantined.

216
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.880
This was towards the end of linen. My visit to the island.

217
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.830
Yeah. These must be the words. Definitely. Yeah.

218
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.653
So when was she here?

219
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.010
This is where they brought her after she had a stroke

220
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.380
and this is where she was for the last six years of her life.

221
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.820
Did she die in here? Yeah.

222
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:16.803
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

255
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.400
<v 10>hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today it's patient zero.</v>

256
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.570
I've tried subject, yeah, and this next story, oh, it's so huge.

257
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.020
It's the ultimate patient zero story. Really many of us have lived through this.

258
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.240
It was, it's as recent in event.

259
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.120
It's such a recent event that it still hurts and it still bleeds. Yeah,

260
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.370
and in it somewhere is a literally the,

261
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.970
the patient that is called zero. So this is, yeah.

262
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.800
A lot of people are going to help us tell the story,

263
00:16:55.801 --> 00:17:00.450
but starting us off is science writer, radio lab, regular Carl Zimmer.

264
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.910
So in 1981

265
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.200
doctors for the first time describe mysterious,

266
00:17:07.201 --> 00:17:11.160
newly discovered disease syndrome, which affects mostly homosexual men.

267
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.070
The young men in Los Angeles are dying.

268
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.280
The number of cases has been growing faster and faster.

269
00:17:17.281 --> 00:17:21.270
So far more than 80 Americans have died. 258 people have died.

270
00:17:21.271 --> 00:17:23.850
625 people have died. Of course,

271
00:17:23.851 --> 00:17:28.851
this is the part we all know how from the first few cases in La aids became one

272
00:17:28.861 --> 00:17:31.220
of the deadliest pandemics the world has ever seen.

273
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.600
It more dangerous than the plague of the Middle Age ages.

274
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.350
The back of the beginning there was a story that I have not been able to shake

275
00:17:37.351 --> 00:17:40.920
for the last 30 years and it's a story and I want to reimagine right now

276
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.520
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

277
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.960
<v 10>right after news of this syndrome started to break that science writer,</v>

278
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:50.640
David [inaudible], who along with Carl will be one of our guides.

279
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.790
Epidemiologists were trying to figure out where did it come from and they were

280
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.010
thinking like, well, maybe it's a sexually transmitted disease.

281
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:03.720
So the CDC launches a study of a group of about 30 patients,

282
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.760
gay men in New York, Los Angeles,

283
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.810
and San Francisco to see who had had sexual contact with whom.

284
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.410
How do you get the SF? Just a series of interviews with people. Yeah,

285
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.420
please name all the people that you, that you've slept with.

286
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:20.870
The CDC eventually releases the results of this survey in the form of a diagram

287
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.110
like a network drawing with circles representing patients in lines representing

288
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.350
sexual contact in each patient. Each little circle was numbered,

289
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.190
New York seven Los Angeles 12 so you didn't know who was who,

290
00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:34.740
but you could tell immediately when you look at this thing,

291
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.330
that of all the 30 or so circles, there was one circle that was special.

292
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.360
It had lines coming out in every direction,

293
00:18:42.361 --> 00:18:46.980
seven or eight emanating from him like the hub of a wheel except all the spokes

294
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:50.340
on this wheel connected to other wheels which then shot out and connected to

295
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:54.630
other wheels fanning outward at the center of it all was that one little circle

296
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.420
numbered

297
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.730
<v 12>zero number zero</v>

298
00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.181
<v 10>as far as we know,</v>

299
00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:03.380
that was the first time that you ever get the term patient zero.

300
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.790
<v 13>Patient zero was on my app, a central victim and victimizer.</v>

301
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.250
<v 10>This is from a 60 minutes special. In 1988 that year,</v>

302
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.030
a reporter named Randy Schultz had written a book called and the band played on

303
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.300
that for the first time revealed the identity of patient zero.

304
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:23.070
<v 13>He was a French Canadian or very handsome Caroline Stewart named gates.</v>

305
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.640
Don Duga. Gates do [inaudible] zero

306
00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.220
<v 10>a few minutes later in the report, Shults comes on to this.</v>

307
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:33.030
<v 13>Describe a guy who has got unlimited sexual stamina,</v>

308
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:33.890
this

309
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.640
<v 12>sexual athletes who would fly from one hotspot to the next because of this job</v>

310
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.800
having sex with literally thousands of men and as he knew he was dying,

311
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.910
at least according to Randy Shields, he became somewhat sinister and malicious.

312
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.050
He would sleep with a male partner at a bathhouse in San Francisco or somewhere

313
00:19:51.051 --> 00:19:54.980
else, and then when the light came up, according to Randy Shields, he would say,

314
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.050
I've got gay cancer

315
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.350
<v 13>now. You're going to get it to your doctor. I talked to him. Yeah.</v>

316
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.870
<v 10>This is Dr Selma drips. She was part of that CDC. Yes.</v>

317
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.210
<v 13>I told him that he was getting other people sick with it and he said,</v>

318
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.110
my right to do whatever I want by civil rights.

319
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.550
I do as I pleased. I've got it. Why shouldn't they have it? They said,

320
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:19.740
you can kill yourself if you want the did you cut? No.

321
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:23.670
Right to take somebody else along with you and you said, screw you,

322
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:24.504
and walked out.

323
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.020
<v 12>Really a chilling moment.</v>

324
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:30.130
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

325
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.110
<v 10>and pretty much from that moment on Gayton Douga he just took on this,</v>

326
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:38.710
this aura as as single handedly causing a, a,

327
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.710
an epidemic in the United States. Now, I don't know about you,

328
00:20:41.711 --> 00:20:44.880
but I first bumped into this story in the movie version of an,

329
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.720
the band played on my friend, we're talking about thousands of men was faces,

330
00:20:49.721 --> 00:20:52.600
I cannot even remember. And you want names. That's an actor playing,

331
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.770
kicking the gun, the movie. Now,

332
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.460
when I first saw that aids had already infected two and a half million people,

333
00:20:57.461 --> 00:21:02.461
and to think that it could all go back to this one guy just seemed

334
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.220
<v 0>unreal. It was a, it was a very, a potent story. There's no doubt</v>

335
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.333
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

336
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.520
<v 0>and, and he gave HIV to a lot of people. There's no question about that.</v>

337
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.030
But what we do know is that he was not patient zero.

338
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.470
<v 15>He was not patients here. No, he was not the beginning point.</v>

339
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.360
He was not even close. Huh?

340
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.730
So here's the question that got me started in the story. The, okay,

341
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:29.950
so the gay steward, that was the movie stuck in my head.

342
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:31.390
But what's the real movie?

343
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.020
What movie can we make about the beginning of the AIDS epidemic?

344
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.860
Because when you've got something so vast that according to some mass estimates

345
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:41.800
will have killed 60 million people by the end of the decade.

346
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.000
What you need a beginning.

347
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:48.270
You need some way of explaining how this disaster happened and how it might

348
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:49.594
happen again.

349
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:58.020
<v 0>And how exactly do we know that Gayton Dugo wasn't patient's hero? Well,</v>

350
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.080
um, there are a couple of reasons we know it. So, um,

351
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.510
so one thing that people started to do, scientists was to, um,

352
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.720
they went and started going back and looking at people who had died or who died

353
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.050
mysteriously aids like things in the past might,

354
00:22:13.051 --> 00:22:16.710
some of them have been early cases and they started finding a lot.

355
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.580
Robert Rayford had aged 12 years before it was recognized in this country.

356
00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:24.480
In 1959, a sailor in Britain died of pneumocystis pneumonia.

357
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.470
And so for awhile you had all these new patients, Zeros. In 1961,

358
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.020
a nurse in Chicago died of Kaposi Sarcoma.

359
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.370
But the real definitive blow to this.

360
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.890
So patient zero nonsense came by. Actually looking at the virus itself

361
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.210
<v 15>in 1984, same year that gate into God died.</v>

362
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.180
Scientists isolate the virus HIV,

363
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.200
which is really just a little string of genetic code that gets into your body

364
00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:51.740
and into your cells and uses your cells to make copies of itself.

365
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.800
But here's the thing, when it replicates within a single patient,

366
00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.190
it copies itself. Um, in precisely,

367
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.713
it mutates

368
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.183
<v 10>quickly.</v>

369
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:07.560
It changes a lot as the virus duplicates itself inside a person,

370
00:23:07.561 --> 00:23:11.490
the dukes often have little copying errors and that middle mutations,

371
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.600
it turns out those errors, they happen at a predictable rate.

372
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.650
You can kind of almost predict how many you're going to see a year or five

373
00:23:19.651 --> 00:23:23.040
years. And so the amount of changes that you see out there,

374
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.250
the diversity really of the viruses in the aids population,

375
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.920
well that becomes really good information.

376
00:23:28.921 --> 00:23:33.150
And so a group of scientists began to look at the amount of diversity among HIV

377
00:23:33.151 --> 00:23:35.310
patients in the u s and other parts of the world.

378
00:23:35.311 --> 00:23:39.120
And the more diversity the longer the virus has been around. Right? Right.

379
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.010
And they could use that kind of like a clock.

380
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.770
If you have a virus here and a virus there,

381
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.950
you could measure how different they are and you would know

382
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.620
<v 15>that it would take a certain amount of time for them to get that different.</v>

383
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.060
And to make a long story short,

384
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:55.090
the picture they get is that aids entered the United States around 1966

385
00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.450
<v 12>at a time when Gaten two guy was still a virgin adolescent.</v>

386
00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.390
<v 15>From there, scientists were able to trace the virus back to Haiti</v>

387
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.390
<v 12>and from Haiti back to Africa.</v>

388
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.520
<v 0>It's been there the longest. It's had the longest time to become diverse,</v>

389
00:24:12.521 --> 00:24:16.570
to mutate, to evolve. So if you want to really, if you want to get to the,

390
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.310
to the real patients, your as it were,

391
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:21.210
the most interesting stuff come actually comes from Africa.

392
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.280
So one way to try to figure out its origins there is to go looking for the

393
00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:27.114
virus.

394
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.260
<v 12>Yup.</v>

395
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:32.260
And that takes us back to Zr 59 and DRC 60 can we talk about damn sure what

396
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.630
these are the two earliest known HIV positive human specimens.

397
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.240
<v 15>And this is where, for me at least,</v>

398
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.050
the story gets way bigger than I imagined from the first sample.

399
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:49.490
Zr 59 came to light in the late nineties somehow scientists unearthed a very old

400
00:24:49.691 --> 00:24:54.070
tube of blood from a hospital in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

401
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.220
and when they tested it,

402
00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.570
<v 12>it had HIV.</v>

403
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.720
This had been taken from a band to man in 1959 1959 right?

404
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.750
Yeah. Nobody knows his name. Nobody even knows I think what he died of,

405
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.660
and that was the only one for a number of years.

406
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.950
<v 0>That was our one glimpse into the kind of deep history of HIV. Yeah.</v>

407
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.230
<v 15>But then along comes that Guy Michael Warby.</v>

408
00:25:15.231 --> 00:25:19.280
He's an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and a few years ago

409
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.520
Michael went back to Kinshasa and found a second HIV sample.

410
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:26.930
He actually found the virus lurking in a tiny bit of human tissue that was

411
00:25:26.931 --> 00:25:28.670
preserved in paraffin wax.

412
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.210
<v 0>It's kind of like a Hans Solo in a, in the star wars movie,</v>

413
00:25:33.211 --> 00:25:36.750
when he's kind of frozen in that carbonite or whatever that stuff is

414
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.290
<v 15>in this new sample,</v>

415
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.460
it was from the same town can show asa is the first and also more importantly

416
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:43.840
from the same time

417
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.800
<v 0>1960 and with the two of them then you can kind of go back in time.</v>

418
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.340
<v 15>That's so yes, like we described before,</v>

419
00:25:50.341 --> 00:25:52.680
you can measure the differences between the samples,

420
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:56.940
calculate how long it would take for those samples to get that different.

421
00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:02.280
And in the end you can use these two samples to wind the clock all the way back

422
00:26:02.281 --> 00:26:06.930
to the virus. It started at all and it turned out

423
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:12.090
<v 12>the most recent common ancestor of those two specimens goes back to about 1908</v>

424
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.370
<v 15>1908 that is when it started in human beings.</v>

425
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:22.490
What 1908 77 well roughly give or take a margin of error early 19 hundreds wow.

426
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.970
So around 1908 give or take

427
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.590
<v 12>something happened. That's right.</v>

428
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:33.620
That moment is the spillover spill over spillovers the term the scientists use

429
00:26:34.261 --> 00:26:39.261
to describe the moment when a virus in one species passes into another species.

430
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:40.860
Yeah.

431
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.580
<v 0>Know new diseases in humans tend to pop up from</v>

432
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.473
<v 15>animals.</v>

433
00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:50.060
<v 16>So people said, okay, flu comes from birds. Where does HIV come from to get it?</v>

434
00:26:50.061 --> 00:26:52.310
Then answer, you have to look beyond human beings.

435
00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.580
You have to look at other viruses that are like HIV.

436
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.210
<v 15>So the search was on the inability to find a similar disease and research</v>

437
00:26:59.211 --> 00:27:02.570
animal. Turns out right about the time that the HIV virus was discovered.

438
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.210
Scientists at the New England primate research center,

439
00:27:05.211 --> 00:27:08.870
some researchers found a virus like it in the CAC monkey monkey. In fact,

440
00:27:08.871 --> 00:27:10.520
it was so similar that they called it

441
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.340
<v 16>Sib Simeon. Immuno</v>

442
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.360
<v 10>efficiency virus. Yes. And that's where the origin quest started.</v>

443
00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.650
This is Beatrice Hahn.

444
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.000
I'm a professor of medicine and microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania.

445
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.790
And so after they found it, macaques, what happened? Um,

446
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.860
it took a couple of years,

447
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.700
but eventually she says they found Siv instill another primate species to Sooty

448
00:27:31.701 --> 00:27:32.420
mangabey.

449
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.320
And then in a few more African green monkeys mandrill pretty soon it was all

450
00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:37.154
over the place.

451
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.270
Now I think 40 different species of African monkeys known to have their own

452
00:27:41.271 --> 00:27:43.280
version of Siv. So then the question was,

453
00:27:43.281 --> 00:27:47.690
which one of these monkeys or primates pass it to us? Then unexpectedly,

454
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:52.460
a researcher named Martine Martine Peters at the center in gumball decided to

455
00:27:52.461 --> 00:27:56.420
test her chimps who? Orphan chimpanzees and Bingo.

456
00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.800
<v 15>She found a very, very close match,</v>

457
00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.450
a virus that was the closest relative of HIV one. So everybody said, well,

458
00:28:04.451 --> 00:28:08.290
you know, it was a CIM. It was a gym. Okay, yeah. It came from chimp. Yes.

459
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.670
But then the question was which chimps or rather where,

460
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.540
where exactly.

461
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.870
<v 10>So Beatrice Hahn and her colleagues started looking at chimps that came from</v>

462
00:28:19.871 --> 00:28:22.840
different parts of western Central Africa.

463
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.410
Now getting blood samples from chimps in the wild is pretty much,

464
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.360
it just isn't feasible, you know,

465
00:28:28.361 --> 00:28:31.060
because in the wild they hide the moment they see us.

466
00:28:31.061 --> 00:28:35.440
So you get stuck with fecal samples, poop? Oh yes.

467
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.020
There's lots of DNA in there in viruses.

468
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.220
So they would just go to where the chimpanzees would sleep at night and they

469
00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:43.900
would just, you know, collect some poop,

470
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:48.190
bring it back to the lab and Beatrice would analyze all the viruses over 90

471
00:28:48.191 --> 00:28:51.550
different wild communities from every part of central Africa,

472
00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:53.950
over 7,000 different fecal samples.

473
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:57.850
And slowly they were able to piece together which communities were infected and

474
00:28:57.851 --> 00:29:02.350
which ones had the closest HIV one. That's when it hit us for the first time.

475
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.920
<v 15>What exactly hit you? The geographic origin of these chimps?</v>

476
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.040
In 2006 her and her colleagues published that the human aids virus comes from a

477
00:29:12.201 --> 00:29:13.160
group of chimps,

478
00:29:13.161 --> 00:29:17.930
a very specific group that live in a very specific place.

479
00:29:17.931 --> 00:29:22.931
This little corner of southeastern camera between the boom bar river,

480
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.880
Goco river, and the Sangha River.

481
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.380
These chimps were essentially penned in between these three rivers scenario.

482
00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:34.540
Probably only have a hundred square miles. Not much more than that. Wow.

483
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.950
So when we're looking at what humans have,

484
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.640
and we're looking at what all of those chimps in Africa have,

485
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:45.520
the most perfect match is this little territory up there in Cameron.

486
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.570
Yeah. There is no other virus that is any closer. So that's that.

487
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:55.180
So can you reconstruct the spillover and the WHO that it spilled over into?

488
00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.630
As you know, as best as you can understand,

489
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:03.631
it can hypothesize and the best hypothesis is the cut hunter hypothesis.

490
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.650
The cut hunter cut hunter. That's right. A hunter who gets cut.

491
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.780
And what can we say about this guy? I mean, is he, what do we know about,

492
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.560
if we had to guess, if we had to guess that

493
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.260
<v 12>human was probably a band too, man.</v>

494
00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:18.480
<v 18>Okay.</v>

495
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.660
<v 12>Living very near the forest or in the forest and southeastern camp. Yeah,</v>

496
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.063
<v 18>he was hunting.</v>

497
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.760
<v 12>Maybe he had a bow and arrow. Maybe he had a spear</v>

498
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.790
<v 18>and uh,</v>

499
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.083
<v 19>kills the tumor.</v>

500
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.050
<v 12>Bingo. Here's a big pile of me and he starts to butcher.</v>

501
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.670
He's cutting open the chest cavity. He's pulling out organs and

502
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:49.590
he cuts himself and he gets blood to blood contact chimpanzee blood against his

503
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:50.914
blood.

504
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:57.690
What happens is that the virus in the chimpanzee blood found itself in an

505
00:30:58.031 --> 00:31:01.600
environment that was unexpected, that was alien to it,

506
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.900
but was not too much different from the biochemical environment.

507
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:08.800
It had been in chimpanzee blood.

508
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:14.480
<v 15>It could function and that's the moment. That's the moment it begins.</v>

509
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.800
That human is patient zero, but why then?

510
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:24.560
Why 1908 I mean presumably people who have been hunting ships for a really long

511
00:31:24.561 --> 00:31:28.130
time, why wouldn't this guy be patient 7 million?

512
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.620
<v 12>That's another of the big questions.</v>

513
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.290
People certainly in central Africa have been eating. Yeah,

514
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.690
<v 15>monkeys for thousands of years. I mean,</v>

515
00:31:35.691 --> 00:31:37.700
David says there's really no way to know,

516
00:31:37.701 --> 00:31:41.520
but this could've just been the right virus. Maybe this particular virus. Yeah,

517
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:45.470
<v 12>evolved in a way that made it more transmissible in humans</v>

518
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.580
<v 15>or maybe it just got lucky to come along at precisely the right time.</v>

519
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.780
What you're looking at, this is Carl again,

520
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.870
is a time when this part of Africa was being heavily colonized.

521
00:31:58.841 --> 00:32:01.270
The French and the Belgians were building trains systems.

522
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.710
The populations were on the move Kinshasa, which was then Leopoldville.

523
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.930
It was exploding. It was huge.

524
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:11.920
The cities were attracting people from the boonies in those days.

525
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.270
Just so by 1908,

526
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.710
all the virus has to do is get from that tiny village where the cut hunter lived

527
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.930
to one of the new cities that happens almost certainly by river.

528
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.290
<v 20>Mm.</v>

529
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.440
<v 12>I was stirred by the work of Beatrice on and Mike Warby to see what this</v>

530
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.220
scenario looked like on the ground.

531
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:37.650
So I went to southeastern Cameron and I chartered a little boat about a 30 foot

532
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:40.130
wooden boat with an outboard, any

533
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.540
<v 10>trace, the path of the virus.</v>

534
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.990
We went down the end Goco river and we stopped at a few villages.

535
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.060
There are a couple of little villages there,

536
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:49.970
one of which has a market where you can buy um,

537
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.580
monkey meat and crocodile meat.

538
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:56.510
And he says it wasn't hard to imagine how it all might've went down.

539
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.120
Perhaps the cut hunter gave the virus to a woman who then passed it on to a

540
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.930
fisherman fellow that I called the voyager, who then got in a boat his David did

541
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.400
<v 18>and carried it down the river. Tsonga River, which is the,</v>

542
00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:11.810
the in Goco is a tributary of the Sanga.

543
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.500
Tsonga becomes a bigger river 200 meters wide,

544
00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:19.120
which then flows to the Congo river, the big river, and into the city.

545
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:24.270
And I imagine him sliding into Brazzaville

546
00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:31.320
around 1920 the first HIV positive man to arrive in an urban center where

547
00:33:35.141 --> 00:33:37.450
there's a much greater density of humans,

548
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.910
where there prostitutes a greater fluidity of social and sexual interactions.

549
00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:51.360
And that seems to have been the place from which the disease went globally.

550
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.580
<v 10>So that's how it happened.</v>

551
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:08.510
<v 21>[inaudible]</v>

552
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.670
<v 10>we can take it back even farther actually. What do you mean</v>

553
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:12.180
<v 21>[inaudible]</v>

554
00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.580
<v 10>for our kids? If you want to make a movie about this start of it.</v>

555
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.640
Well this is not the start because we got it from chimps. Right? Right.

556
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:25.100
So you could ask her who was chimps zero, what do we know about chimps? Zero,

557
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.960
right? Yeah. I mean everything comes from somewhere. And again,

558
00:34:29.961 --> 00:34:31.880
by molecular work scientists,

559
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:35.540
have they been able to determine that the chimp virus is actually,

560
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.060
it actually comes from two monkey viruses,

561
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.540
two different monkeys from two completely different species.

562
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:46.630
What would they have encountered each other somewhere or had a fight with a,

563
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.640
they probably encountered each other in the stomach of a chimp.

564
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.960
Meaning what? Well, from the perspective of a chimpanzee monkeys,

565
00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.740
they look tasty. This is Nathan Wolfe,

566
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.220
professor in human biology at Stanford University and he says,

567
00:35:04.221 --> 00:35:09.221
to fully understand this part of the patient to a rather chimp zero narrative,

568
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.890
you have to grasp how it is that chimps hunt.

569
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.220
And this is something he witnessed in the Kabali national forest in,

570
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.920
in southwestern Uganda.

571
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.073
<v 4>Can</v>

572
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.280
you describe to US watching three male chimps converge on a tree?

573
00:35:26.941 --> 00:35:29.550
Fourth column, this monkeys, which are those race? No, black and white.

574
00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:34.770
And one individual managed to grab to juvenile.

575
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.620
And then the three individuals all up [inaudible]

576
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.650
<v 23>began to eat. The monkey was still alive.</v>

577
00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:47.070
The chimpanzee was going after in Oregon. You know, the, that obviously was a,

578
00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:51.620
a tasty morsel that, that he was going after and, and the monkey was, uh,

579
00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.280
was screaming bloody murder. It is quite disturbing to watch,

580
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:59.580
he says, but the one of the things that struck me at that moment,

581
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:01.360
<v 1>oh,</v>

582
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.360
<v 23>was the depth of contact between the blood and body fluids of this monkey and</v>

583
00:36:06.641 --> 00:36:07.570
the chimpanzee.

584
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:13.630
<v 10>The chimps are literally covered in blood and blood on their face and in their</v>

585
00:36:13.631 --> 00:36:16.330
eyes. And from the viruses perspective,

586
00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.590
this is spillover heaven. Okay.

587
00:36:21.591 --> 00:36:25.010
So the following is the closest that we can get to a zero point in this entire

588
00:36:25.011 --> 00:36:29.120
narrative. We don't know where it happened and we don't know exactly the time.

589
00:36:29.121 --> 00:36:32.150
Say some hundreds of thousands of years ago from the molecular clock.

590
00:36:32.151 --> 00:36:34.520
We know it was less than a million years. That's all we know.

591
00:36:34.521 --> 00:36:39.230
But whenever it was chimp's zero was hunting and it comes upon a monkey called a

592
00:36:39.231 --> 00:36:42.120
red cap. Mangabey the the redcap Mangabey. This is, uh,

593
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.600
a larger primate and these are treated dwelling. Little,

594
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.840
little guys treat dwelling a little bit of red for on their heads. Yes. Chips,

595
00:36:47.841 --> 00:36:50.090
zero spots. One of these monkeys eats it.

596
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.550
And in the process key catches a red cap. Mangabey version of the AIDS virus.

597
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.660
Next sometime after that first kill weeks,

598
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.360
months, we don't know, maybe it was the same day.

599
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:11.700
Chimp zero comes across another monkey and this monkey, it was called a spot.

600
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.270
Knows Gwen it. Yes, it's got a spot on it snows, I assume. There you go.

601
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:15.870
Very small.

602
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:19.680
One of the tiniest monkeys of all of the old world monkeys and chips.

603
00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:21.000
Zero eats that monkey

604
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:26.610
<v 23>and gets a spot nose Guinen version of the AIDS virus for the HIV virus inside.</v>

605
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.390
So you've got the red cap man could be,

606
00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.590
and you've got the spot knows Gwen ens who've got a Quentin and a Mangabey,

607
00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.800
two completely different

608
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:37.240
<v 10>kinds of Siv viruses inside the same chimp. Now,</v>

609
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.820
under normal circumstances, according to Nathan,

610
00:37:39.821 --> 00:37:42.190
both of these Siv viruses would go

611
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.910
<v 23>nowhere because one, one of these viruses makes the jump.</v>

612
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.690
They go from a place they've adapted to and that they know to a completely

613
00:37:49.691 --> 00:37:53.590
foreign landscape, uh, like a human being dropped off on Mars.

614
00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.790
Maybe without a spacesuit.

615
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.120
I mean they basically are entering a completely alien habitat.

616
00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.920
The cells don't look the same.

617
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.550
The environment is different and the chimps immune system would normally kill

618
00:38:03.551 --> 00:38:07.150
them. But then once in a blue moon, something crazy happens.

619
00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:08.820
These two

620
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.730
<v 10>viruses will end up inside the same cell,</v>

621
00:38:11.731 --> 00:38:14.340
in the same chimp at the same time.

622
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:18.900
Literally there is a single cell simultaneously infected with both viruses to

623
00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:21.450
suppose on one side of the cell you've got the mangabey virus,

624
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.480
<v 8>mommy, mommy, Mama, Mama,</v>

625
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.650
<v 10>and on the other side of the same cell, you've got the spot nose Gwen and virus.</v>

626
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.070
And what happens is, uh, literally inside the cell you have

627
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.903
<v 23>an enzyme,</v>

628
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.240
it's called the preliminary enzyme that's copying genetic information to the

629
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:46.780
virus. This is what viruses do.

630
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.810
They hijack these enzymes to make copies of themselves.

631
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:52.303
<v 8>No,</v>

632
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.970
<v 23>here's the problem. These, these enzymes,</v>

633
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.660
they're not necessarily that sticky and while they're in the process of copying

634
00:38:58.661 --> 00:39:02.680
one virus, every once in awhile they'll accidentally fall off,

635
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.133
make copy,

636
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:09.540
and go back and latch on to the second virus and just keep on copying.

637
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.270
And so what it ends up spitting out is a hybrid

638
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.353
<v 8>like that.</v>

639
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.740
<v 23>No, this new mosaic probably won't go anywhere because</v>

640
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.100
99.9999999999% of the [inaudible]

641
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.080
<v 15>time when these hybrids happens, a dead end,</v>

642
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.660
the chimps immune system is pretty sophisticated.

643
00:39:30.661 --> 00:39:34.830
It has evolved defenses against these viruses and it will destroy them,

644
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.010
but again, once in a blue moon,

645
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.630
<v 23>so this is a blue moon after blue moon after a blue moon to really get this.</v>

646
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:45.380
Finally you get one particular mosaic virus,

647
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.873
<v 8>no</v>

648
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.160
<v 23>clean, the mangabey and the and that through sheer random luck</v>

649
00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.890
<v 8>works for me.</v>

650
00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.240
<v 23>It landed on the exact right combination of genes that allowed it to evade the</v>

651
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.710
chimp's immune system. I mean,

652
00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:06.460
one of the amazing things to think about is how many,

653
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:11.350
how many hopeful monsters you had to have in order to get that one that actually

654
00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:14.950
survived probably trillions, but then boom,

655
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.720
<v 24>suddenly in a flash from these two viruses that can barely survive in the chimp,</v>

656
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.930
you get a new virus a little bit mangabey little bit.

657
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.930
Quintin cannot only survive and the chimp, but can thrive.

658
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.600
In fact for this baby virus,

659
00:40:30.601 --> 00:40:35.310
the chimp is the perfect host and that was the virus that ended up spreading,

660
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.830
jumping over into humans

661
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:44.550
and it's been this massive and incredibly dramatic sort of tear in the fabric of

662
00:40:44.591 --> 00:40:45.424
humanity.

663
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.383
<v 1>Ah,</v>

664
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:58.490
<v 12>let me add another parentheses.</v>

665
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:03.180
There are essentially 12 major groups of the HIV virus.

666
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:08.710
<v 15>What David means is it 12 different kinds of HIV viruses have spilled over 12</v>

667
00:41:09.441 --> 00:41:09.850
different

668
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.130
<v 12>times. Eight of them came from monkeys,</v>

669
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:16.510
three of them came from chimps and one came from gorillas. Wow.

670
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:21.520
And of those 12 only one of them is responsible for the global pandemic.

671
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.520
How there 12 kinds 12 times that we know about,

672
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.600
it's probably happened dozens and dozens more times that we don't know about.

673
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.800
So the spillover is not a highly improbable event.

674
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:34.280
These sorts of viruses,

675
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.670
<v 23>they're constantly paying at us, they're pinging at us and pinging it at us.</v>

676
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.000
We see it happening all the time. You see it happening all the time.

677
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.140
Nathan has set up a series of monitoring stations in places like central Africa

678
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:48.710
and he and his colleagues have been tracking what he calls the viral chatter.

679
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.230
In the people who hunt these primates,

680
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:54.590
we collected specimens from the animals that they were hunting.

681
00:41:54.591 --> 00:41:57.860
They compare that to blood samples from the hunters themselves. And guess what?

682
00:41:57.861 --> 00:42:01.700
We found a whole range of new retroviruses that we're moving over into these

683
00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:02.930
hunters. For example,

684
00:42:02.931 --> 00:42:05.720
he's been tracking something called the Simian foamy virus,

685
00:42:05.721 --> 00:42:09.260
which is first in the same family as HIV and he has seen it hot from an

686
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:13.460
individual gorilla to an individual human who killed that gorilla. Yeah.

687
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:17.060
These are almost certainly what we call primary transmission events. Oh,

688
00:42:17.061 --> 00:42:20.870
so you really are looking at the potential beginning of something. Yes.

689
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.710
You want a patient zero and really clear patient zero a,

690
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:27.740
it's some of these individuals that have been affected with these viruses.

691
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.670
And the real question is how do we stop patients Zeros?

692
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.490
How do, how do we avoid patient, the patient one and patient two. Exactly.

693
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.900
So Nathan is developing a series of tools like digital surveillance. I mean,

694
00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:42.890
some of these places

695
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:47.750
I work in some places in Democratic Republic of Congo,

696
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.580
you basically have to fly in to get there. No roads, often, no electricity.

697
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:53.590
<v 8>Okay.</v>

698
00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.990
<v 23>But many of these places, they still have cell phone towers.</v>

699
00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.950
So Nathan has begun to track cell phone call patterns in these communities.

700
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.870
So if he sees a blip of many calls to a medical center within a short period of

701
00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:05.830
time, okay, boom.

702
00:43:05.831 --> 00:43:10.750
Now we've got to investigate that and we continue to find viruses that are

703
00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:15.780
completely novel and we're looking to determine if these are,

704
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.190
if these are the next HIV cause.

705
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.400
Thinking about he says HIV landed in humans in 1908 but we didn't know about it

706
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:28.930
until 1981 we had decades of time when this was a virus before it spread

707
00:43:28.931 --> 00:43:31.180
globally. What if we'd been looking for it?

708
00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:33.993
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

709
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.823
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

710
00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:43.560
<v 10>a lot of people to thank for this segment,</v>

711
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:47.820
thanks to Nathan Wolf for being Nathan and he has an awesome new book called the

712
00:43:47.821 --> 00:43:49.230
viral storm. Also,

713
00:43:49.231 --> 00:43:53.640
thank you to Carl Zimmer whose book on viruses is called a planet of viruses and

714
00:43:53.641 --> 00:43:55.830
thank you also to him and to Michael Warby.

715
00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:01.320
Their interview was recorded on a podcast from meet the scientist, which you can

716
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.290
find@microbeworld.org and thanks to David Coleman,

717
00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:06.840
who's got a book called spillover coming out very soon,

718
00:44:06.841 --> 00:44:10.140
which is all about diseases crossing over from animals to us and also to

719
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.490
Beatrice Hahn at the University of Pennsylvania and to Katie Slocombe from the

720
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.920
University of York for letting us use her recordings of chimpanzees.

721
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:18.370
<v 1>No.</v>

722
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:21.670
<v 10>Hey, this is Soren wheeler, senior editor and producer at Radiolab, uh,</v>

723
00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.990
with a quick update. Um,

724
00:44:22.991 --> 00:44:27.991
so David Commons books spillover is spin out for a couple of years now and as we

725
00:44:28.301 --> 00:44:32.130
all know, we are actually now at this moment facing the tragic

726
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:37.130
<v 12>consequences of another spillover this time it's the Ebola virus and we found</v>

727
00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:42.420
ourselves wondering just how far it's going to spill. Okay. All right.

728
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:45.450
Okay. And Jane. So Robert and I called up David Coleman again.

729
00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:47.850
He had actually just reprinted with updates,

730
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.000
the chapter about a bullet from his book. Yeah. Ebola,

731
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.150
the natural and human history of a deadly virus. First of all,

732
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.690
how old is this disease? Anyone have any idea?

733
00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.140
Well as a human disease. As far as we know,

734
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.200
it dates to 1976 there was this outbreak of a strange disease at the young Buku

735
00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:11.850
mission in northern Zaire. 318 cases,

736
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.280
280 people die and then there was another one in Sudan at about the same time.

737
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:21.840
This time 151 people die and then it just disappears.

738
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:26.870
Hiding in the forest without a trace until 1994 1994 thousands of miles away in

739
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:30.840
Gabon, another outbreak. Yes. That's what, that's the history.

740
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:34.800
Since 1976 it disappears for for two or three years at a time.

741
00:45:34.801 --> 00:45:38.760
Sometimes it disappears for a decade and then it spills over and causes a human

742
00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:39.660
outbreak. Well, if,

743
00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:44.010
if something is in the closet and there's going to jump out at you,

744
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:47.390
then the natural question to ask is, where's the closet? Like,

745
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.800
where is it hiding? Uh, well, the,

746
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.440
the main suspects are bats.

747
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:57.560
We don't know that for sure because nobody has ever isolated live Ebola virus

748
00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.000
from an African Bat. Have they tried,

749
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:02.540
have they looked in lots and lots of Baghdad? They've looked into lots.

750
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.070
They've looked in all kinds of animals. They've looked in insects,

751
00:46:05.071 --> 00:46:07.680
they've looked in snakes, they've looked in forest antelopes,

752
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.630
they've looked in monkeys. They looked in plants.

753
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.910
Literally hundreds of different species. They looked in,

754
00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.850
found zero traces of live Ebola virus,

755
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.840
so we really don't know where it's coming from or where it might come from next.

756
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.310
No, no.

757
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.800
Can I just ask you just to describe the Bolo virus? It's a,

758
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.720
it's apparently viruses are generally teeny. Is this a teeny, teeny, teeny one?

759
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.770
Yes. Yeah. It's a teeny virus. It belongs to a family.

760
00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:38.950
They call the Filo viruses. Filo has in thread, it's a,

761
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.250
it's a spaghetti shaped virus.

762
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.390
It's genome is carried on just one strand of the,

763
00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.140
the genetic material R, n a.

764
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.560
And while those genes have let the virus live happily for hundreds of thousands,

765
00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:56.280
even millions of years in baths or whatever animal it lives in,

766
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.520
when it gets into humans, Ebola Burns too hot.

767
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:04.110
It makes so many copies of itself so quickly that it just destroys the body and

768
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:06.660
the person is usually dead within a few weeks,

769
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.730
which David says is actually bad for the virus because Ebola can only pass

770
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:15.540
through direct contact with bodily fluids. And because it kills so quickly,

771
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:19.440
it doesn't have a lot of opportunities to get into the next person.

772
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.030
So the scientists have a term for that too.

773
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.450
They call at least they used to call us a dead end host.

774
00:47:24.451 --> 00:47:27.510
How's that for a phrase where the dead end host of Ebola.

775
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:32.470
And that means that when Ebola gets into us, it has no great future.

776
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.580
It's either going to burn out and come to an end or we're going to stop it. Uh,

777
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:41.200
but right now we don't seem like a dead end host. I, I'm wondering like,

778
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:42.034
you know, if we've,

779
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:47.050
if since we've started noticing in 1976 so a burst here at burst there,

780
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:51.460
why, why now?

781
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.160
This wise is the big question for Ebola.

782
00:47:54.161 --> 00:47:58.810
2014 this time we've got a very different situation. It's gotten out of control.

783
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.940
Why has it gotten out of control? Well,

784
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.080
partly because we recognized it late.

785
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:10.410
It began back in December of 2013 with a two year old boy in southeastern

786
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:14.800
Guinea. At least he's the first known case at this point. He died.

787
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:19.030
His mother died about a week later, his sister died. His grandmother died.

788
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.320
Other people in the village died.

789
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:24.310
This went on from early December until the middle of March.

790
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.660
By then had spread from these small villages into larger cities. In Part,

791
00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:32.950
David says, because, well, previous outbreaks had been in very remote places.

792
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:36.490
It now found itself in a more densely populated area.

793
00:48:36.491 --> 00:48:41.491
The capital cities in these small West African countries are not very many miles

794
00:48:42.251 --> 00:48:44.410
away from the villages of the countryside.

795
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:48.700
And then the virus got into these poor neighborhoods like west point, uh,

796
00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:53.230
where people were living together in crowded slum like neighborhoods.

797
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:58.450
And, uh, and when their loved ones got sick, the people took care of them.

798
00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:02.230
And when their loved ones died, people cleaned the bodies and,

799
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.450
and touched the bodies and said goodbye to them.

800
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:07.150
So the infection spread and of course those,

801
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:11.590
those dense poor neighborhoods in the capital cities are not that far from the

802
00:49:11.591 --> 00:49:12.700
international airports.

803
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:18.030
So suddenly you've got the opportunity for the almost the first time for Ebola

804
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:20.920
to get on an airplane. So if you,

805
00:49:20.921 --> 00:49:25.660
if is have people changed the way they think about Ebola because I mean as,

806
00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:29.610
is there a mood shift there? There's a little bit of a mood shift, but the,

807
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.940
the experts, the scientists,

808
00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:35.470
public health officials are still saying this is not that kind of virus.

809
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:38.800
It's still is as far as we know,

810
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:43.690
a virus that is only transmissible by direct contact with bodily fluids.

811
00:49:43.691 --> 00:49:47.590
It should be easy to stop, easy to contain. But according to David,

812
00:49:47.591 --> 00:49:51.340
the thing that some scientists are worried about is that as Ebola gets into more

813
00:49:51.341 --> 00:49:55.300
and more people and makes more and more copies of itself, it's changing. Yes.

814
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.930
Every time it replicates, there is a chance of a mistake.

815
00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.140
There's a chance that the genes for the next virus will come out just a little

816
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.970
bit different. It'll mutate.

817
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.020
Most mutations are either insignificant or they do damage,

818
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:13.050
but occasionally there can be a mutation that might possibly help the virus.

819
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.240
Can we track these things? Like can we,

820
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.170
can we take a person who's got sick of Ebola and Sudan?

821
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.820
I compare it to a person who's sick,

822
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.570
have a bullet in the Congo and compare that to a person who's sick of it.

823
00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:29.510
Bullet and Niger and wherever. Can we do that and see whether it's changing?

824
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.450
Yes, and it has been done.

825
00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:37.360
Steven Guyer and his colleagues published a paper in science in early September,

826
00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.010
which involved doing exactly that.

827
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.860
And one of the things they found says David is that since this virus has been in

828
00:50:42.861 --> 00:50:44.120
us during this outbreak,

829
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.430
it's been changing twice as fast as it has previously when it's living in his

830
00:50:48.431 --> 00:50:50.150
animal hiding place. Yeah.

831
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.990
So it has had more opportunities to replicate in more different people.

832
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:55.640
It hasn't just been in 300 people,

833
00:50:55.641 --> 00:50:59.640
it's been in 9,000 people now that is that the key word is that the more

834
00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:04.680
opportunities you have to have a good mutation from your point of view,

835
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.750
that this is suddenly,

836
00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:10.710
this disease has gotten an enormous number of opportunities.

837
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:14.130
And that is the operative word. Yeah. Are there boundaries around that?

838
00:51:14.131 --> 00:51:19.050
I mean like do we have any sense of how big a leap it would be for this to

839
00:51:19.051 --> 00:51:21.600
suddenly be transmissible in the air? Yeah,

840
00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:25.190
we know that for this to spread through the air, uh,

841
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.780
they're very special machinery. You know, grappling hooks,

842
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:34.990
proteins on the outside of a virus that help it catch hold of particular cells

843
00:51:35.061 --> 00:51:35.990
and enter them.

844
00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.940
And Ebola doesn't have the right grappling hooks to lay hold of cells in the

845
00:51:40.941 --> 00:51:45.140
respiratory tract and get in them and then come bursting out of them and be

846
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:45.840
carried out.

847
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:50.840
Word on your breath to get to that point would require a number of mutations,

848
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.440
each of which is infant's decimally unlikely.

849
00:51:54.441 --> 00:51:57.860
And when you is that applying mutation that it would be startling like Oh,

850
00:51:57.861 --> 00:52:01.810
what to, oh, what, what was, yeah. Some people have been saying that, uh,

851
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:06.470
it would be like mutations that allowed a giraffe to fly,

852
00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:11.120
but there are other scenarios that are a little more probable. Uh, for instance,

853
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.900
it might, uh,

854
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:16.900
mutate and adapt in such a way that it kills fewer people or kills them more

855
00:52:17.721 --> 00:52:21.800
slowly and leaves people infectious for a longer period of time.

856
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:24.730
Maybe people are walking around, uh,

857
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:29.660
for three or four weeks with an occasional vomiting episode,

858
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:30.710
but they're not dying.

859
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:36.010
That would potentially give Ebola a greater opportunity to spread among more

860
00:52:36.231 --> 00:52:40.820
people. What has, this is not a fair question to ask you,

861
00:52:40.821 --> 00:52:42.980
but what should we be doing?

862
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:49.690
I think the most important thing we should be doing is not letting the public

863
00:52:49.761 --> 00:52:54.761
health versus civil civil liberties issues in the u s distract us from West

864
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.960
Africa as the case count gets. We've talked about this.

865
00:52:56.961 --> 00:52:58.250
As the case count gets higher,

866
00:52:58.251 --> 00:53:03.251
it has more opportunities to mutate and therefore more opportunities to adapt.

867
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:09.070
So we need to end this outbreak in west Africa before this virus learns too much

868
00:53:09.531 --> 00:53:10.364
about us.

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.820
Radiolab is supported by Fox searchlight pictures presenting Jackie from

890
00:54:43.821 --> 00:54:48.470
director Pablo the rain and starting Natalie Portman as the iconic first lady.

891
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.970
Then Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy in the days following the assassination of JFK,

892
00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:56.900
Natalie Portman delivers another Oscar caliber performance in a film that

893
00:54:56.901 --> 00:55:01.160
reimagines the events through the eyes of Jackie herself as she fights to cement

894
00:55:01.161 --> 00:55:04.460
her husband's historical legacy in select theaters. Now,

895
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:13.420
<v 15>hey, you want to know about my, one of my proudest moments of being a dad? Yeah.</v>

896
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:15.040
Happened this morning. Yeah.

897
00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:17.560
So you know how a meal is a little bit of an introvert, right?

898
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:20.290
When we sort of worried whether he socializes enough, well,

899
00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:23.490
we were taking him to daycare and uh, we're getting,

900
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.280
he's taking his shoes off and there's this little boy who's only there two days

901
00:55:27.281 --> 00:55:30.820
a week and he's not adjusting well. And every time his mother drops him off,

902
00:55:30.821 --> 00:55:35.210
she has to literally pry him off her and he's wailing and you know,

903
00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:38.290
so a meal sits down on this little seat to take a shoes off.

904
00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.940
The mother of this kid puts this little boy next to a meal and he is just

905
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.060
crying. He's distraught.

906
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:51.390
So then what happens is a meal turns to this little boy looks at him,

907
00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:55.270
sticks out his hand and says I five

908
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:04.620
<v 26>out of nowhere. And that is amazing. Yeah. Because it's like they're,</v>

909
00:56:04.621 --> 00:56:07.820
they're out in their own society, you know? Yeah.

910
00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:12.160
<v 15>Okay. So let's do the introductions. I'm, I'm Jad Robert. This is radio lab.</v>

911
00:56:12.161 --> 00:56:15.430
We're calling this show patient zero. Yeah. And for this next segment,

912
00:56:15.431 --> 00:56:17.680
no more patients. No more diseases. Exactly.

913
00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:22.330
Let's focus instead on invention on the people who bring new ideas into the

914
00:56:22.331 --> 00:56:24.400
world. Yeah. The behind the ideas.

915
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.970
<v 27>That doesn't quite sound right. You know what I mean? Yeah.</v>

916
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:29.050
And that guy you just heard,

917
00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:30.480
<v 28>hi, my name is John McClellan.</v>

918
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:32.970
I'm a contributing writer at the New York Times magazine.

919
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.310
<v 27>He's got his own high five story to tell though. It's not about his daughter.</v>

920
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.160
We have, I think we have kids around the same age. His or her first high five.

921
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.120
It's actually about the first high five ever.

922
00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.600
Ever. Yeah. See One morning, a few years ago,

923
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:51.190
2007 or 2008 John turned on his computer, opened up his email and found

924
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:55.670
<v 28>a press release about the, the true undisputed inventor at the high five coming,</v>

925
00:56:55.671 --> 00:56:59.330
you know, out final, who was the press release from national high five day,

926
00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.770
which is a kind of a joke holiday that was invented by a group of high school

927
00:57:03.771 --> 00:57:07.340
friends, I think. And they told the story, they told the story of Lamont sleep.

928
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:08.643
<v 1>So</v>

929
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.340
<v 28>with college basketball player, Murray State and Kentucky,</v>

930
00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.670
and the story in the press release with something like this sleets,

931
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:19.190
his father fought in Vietnam as part of the first battalion

932
00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:21.310
<v 29>fifth infantry, which was nicknamed the five.</v>

933
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:26.590
And they used to greet each other by holding up their hand and saying five as a

934
00:57:26.591 --> 00:57:29.560
kind of prideful. And when Lamont was younger,

935
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:32.410
they would all sort of hang out at the house in Kentucky and he couldn't keep

936
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.810
all their names straight. So when they'd walk in the door and go five,

937
00:57:34.811 --> 00:57:36.070
he would just sort of smack their hands.

938
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.560
<v 28>They go high five Oh, like hi, like hello five hello? Five. Yeah. Hi Comma,</v>

939
00:57:41.561 --> 00:57:43.240
five you know, he has small hands,

940
00:57:43.241 --> 00:57:45.880
he likes to put them up against the big hands of the five guys.

941
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.490
And it was years later that he started playing college basketball at Mary's

942
00:57:49.491 --> 00:57:51.460
state and started high fiving all his teammates.

943
00:57:51.461 --> 00:57:53.920
He didn't really never stopped high fiving, it was just something he did.

944
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:55.870
But when he went around playing away games,

945
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:57.790
other teams picked it up and it sort of spread out.

946
00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.820
So he was sort of both the inventor of the [inaudible] five and the kind of

947
00:58:01.821 --> 00:58:03.830
Johnny Appleseed to the high five at the same time.

948
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.550
<v 27>And within a few weeks of John Getting this press release,</v>

949
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:08.950
the story was everywhere went kind of viral.

950
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:12.480
<v 28>It wound up sort of all over the internet. There was some local newspapers who,</v>

951
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.650
you know, picked it up, you know,

952
00:58:13.651 --> 00:58:16.030
Murray state suddenly became very proud of the fact that they were the,

953
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:17.490
the home of the high five.

954
00:58:17.491 --> 00:58:20.460
It became sort of part of the institutional lore and the athletic department

955
00:58:20.461 --> 00:58:20.850
there.

956
00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:23.550
<v 27>And then you read this and you thought, what?</v>

957
00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.040
<v 28>Uh, I thought, uh, how sad.</v>

958
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:28.320
<v 1>Ah,</v>

959
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:32.190
<v 27>how sad. How Sad. Because I knew the story of Glen Burke.</v>

960
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.470
Turns out John had already been poking around into this question of who invented

961
00:58:37.471 --> 00:58:40.620
the high five and he had stumbled on this photograph. You know what,

962
00:58:40.621 --> 00:58:43.560
maybe I don't have it. A black and white picture. Oh yeah.

963
00:58:43.561 --> 00:58:46.680
Here we go to baseball players facing each other. Afros,

964
00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:51.360
huge smiles and their hands are in the air, right about to connect.

965
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:53.630
Which one of these is Glenn Burke's, a Burks Burkes,

966
00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.910
the guy in the warm up jacket, I think he's even got his hat on backwards.

967
00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:01.230
Glen Burke was a center fielder for the La Dodgers in the 70s. Big Guy.

968
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:04.860
He says he had 17 inch biceps. So I'll take his, I'll take his word for that.

969
00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:07.860
The other guy in the picture is dusty Baker. He's an outfielder.

970
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.640
But you can tell in the picture just from the way that Glen is sort of throwing

971
00:59:11.641 --> 00:59:14.640
his whole body forward that he's the one initiating the gesture. I mean,

972
00:59:14.641 --> 00:59:18.270
this is a guy who was, um, you know, the soul of the Dodgers clubhouse.

973
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:22.400
They just had that type of, I'm charisma. This is Luther Davis, Glenn sister.

974
00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:26.360
With Glenn. It was like, oh, he'd always be on a stage,

975
00:59:26.361 --> 00:59:28.100
often said he should have been a comedian. Yeah,

976
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:30.400
<v 28>he was always dancing around in the, in the club as he,</v>

977
00:59:30.401 --> 00:59:33.440
he used to do a Richard Pryor stand up routines

978
00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:37.060
<v 27>from memory. You just genuinely love people so much.</v>

979
00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:41.530
So she says that in the year that picture was taken, the Dodgers made him the,

980
00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:44.710
they're sort of public face of the team. He was their ambassador of goodwill.

981
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.800
He's the guy, they'd say that to all the press events, you know,

982
00:59:46.801 --> 00:59:50.560
like meet the youngsters and stuff. Here's the story about this picture.

983
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.140
What was the date? October 5th politically enough,

984
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.810
1977 to playoffs,

985
00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:59.600
Dodgers versus Phillies game four bases are loaded.

986
00:59:59.601 --> 01:00:02.000
Dusty Baker stepped up to the plate and

987
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:04.343
<v 21>[inaudible]</v>

988
01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.600
<v 29>grand slam crowd goes nuts.</v>

989
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:11.110
Baker does his victory lap and just disease around in 30 come into the plate.

990
01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:15.970
Bear comes racing out of the dugout and he's got his arm really high up in Baker

991
01:00:15.971 --> 01:00:19.300
season. Instinctively raises his arm and before you know it, Burke and Baker,

992
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:21.890
<v 28>smack hands,</v>

993
01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.460
<v 27>Bam. There, it was the sportscasters that you know,</v>

994
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:28.770
announcing the game said they had never seen that done in sports before.

995
01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.680
And from there on the Dodgers started high fiving and everyone else started

996
01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:33.780
high-fiving and the high five became a thing

997
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:44.790
and it all began with at one moment the platonic high five right there.

998
01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.240
Unfortunately that moment that was actually both the beginning and also almost

999
01:00:51.031 --> 01:00:53.790
the end of Burke's career. It's not that he wasn't good,

1000
01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:56.190
he was actually really good. Even in his rookie season,

1001
01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.510
<v 28>he was being talked about as the next Billy Mays by the Dodgers organization.</v>

1002
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.030
But uh, he was gay

1003
01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:08.520
and he tried to keep that a secret while he was playing a dusty baker actually

1004
01:01:08.521 --> 01:01:12.180
had kept trying to set him up with his wife's cousins and a Burke never won,

1005
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.110
you know, never liked any of them.

1006
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.390
And Baker's completely confused because he knew that, you know, these were,

1007
01:01:15.391 --> 01:01:16.890
these were really good looking women apparently.

1008
01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.510
So there were rumors circulating and the rumors reached the front office of,

1009
01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:22.130
of the La Dodgers. And,

1010
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:27.210
and one day Burke was called in by management and they offered him $75,000 to

1011
01:01:28.891 --> 01:01:32.550
get married. [inaudible] 75,000 to get married. Huh?

1012
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:34.980
What is this like the mob or something? Well, exactly. I mean, no,

1013
01:01:34.981 --> 01:01:38.310
they didn't regularly offer their players money to get to get married.

1014
01:01:38.311 --> 01:01:43.170
And Burke's response apparently was a, he said, I suppose you mean to a woman?

1015
01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.450
Shortly after that the Dodgers traded into the Oakland days for a player who

1016
01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.970
everyone acknowledged was completely inferior.

1017
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:54.380
<v 27>That was confusing for us. And I know it had to be confusing for him.</v>

1018
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:57.440
<v 28>It was shocking. And everyone, no one understood why he was traded.</v>

1019
01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.020
And you think it was because he was gay. Yeah.

1020
01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:04.680
<v 27>You know, baseball is all American sport. Yeah. But you know,</v>

1021
01:02:04.681 --> 01:02:09.420
at least he was still going to be able to play ball or at least he thought he

1022
01:02:09.421 --> 01:02:12.450
ends up in Oakland, doesn't get very much playing time.

1023
01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:15.540
And when he did get on the field, it wasn't very pleasant.

1024
01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:18.420
He used to get heckled a lot, you know, from people in the bleachers. And, uh,

1025
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:20.520
and even according to a couple of different people,

1026
01:02:20.521 --> 01:02:23.820
his coach Billy Martin would often introduce Glenn Burke this way.

1027
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:28.500
This is Glenn Burke, the Fagen Greeley. Yeah. And, uh,

1028
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:33.390
so Glenn Burke retires. Wow. And he was only like 26 or something, right? Yes.

1029
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:37.320
He was young within a year of his rookie season just walks away. God,

1030
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:41.230
that's like this aborted career. Exactly. From there, he ends up in a,

1031
01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.110
the Castro district in San Francisco,

1032
01:02:43.111 --> 01:02:46.320
which is the big gay neighborhood and things go okay for awhile.

1033
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.030
But then one day when he's crossing the street,

1034
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.960
three teenage girls and their mother's car come barreling down the road and um,

1035
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:57.050
they hit him and broke his leg in three places and that kind of ended

1036
01:02:58.201 --> 01:03:02.250
everything. When that happened, he started taking painkillers.

1037
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:06.900
One thing leads to another. He gets hooked on crack, can't hold a job,

1038
01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:09.330
he goes broke, ends up living on the street.

1039
01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:14.500
<v 28>And uh, in 1994, Burke, uh, is diagnosed with,</v>

1040
01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.930
with HIV or aids, I guess aids at that point.

1041
01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.780
<v 27>He ended up coming to live with me</v>

1042
01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:20.870
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1043
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:24.560
<v 27>lot of times he didn't sleep well at night and we would sit up and talk</v>

1044
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.370
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1045
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:31.020
<v 27>put on music and I dance and he move his arms around cause he was in the bed.</v>

1046
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.720
He was bed ridden.

1047
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:35.650
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1048
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:38.080
<v 27>and so you took care of him until he died? Yeah.</v>

1049
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.833
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1050
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:41.750
<v 27>Glenn Burke died in 1995</v>

1051
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:42.980
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1052
01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:47.710
<v 28>but what he's left with out at this point is he's left with the original high</v>

1053
01:03:47.711 --> 01:03:50.090
five right? That's his claim. Yes. Yes.

1054
01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.420
That defined him to some people at least at the, at the end. And He,

1055
01:03:53.421 --> 01:03:55.900
and he believed it. A reporter had asked him, you know,

1056
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:58.640
if it was true about the high five. And he said, yeah,

1057
01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:01.550
think about the feeling you get when you give someone the high five.

1058
01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:06.710
I had that feeling before. Everybody else did. Huh?

1059
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.890
So what did you do when you got this press release?

1060
01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.420
So I called national high five day because I wanted to talk to Lamont sleets

1061
01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:17.330
even though I was sad, it seemed like, okay,

1062
01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:22.160
here's another person's prideful accomplishment. Let's get his story. Hello,

1063
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:25.530
hello. Eventually. Hey, there we go. He gets this guy on the phone. Uh,

1064
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.750
my name is Greg [inaudible] Ledge.

1065
01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.100
Greg is one of the founders and he and John Get to talking and John asks him the

1066
01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:35.060
sensible first question is the Lamont Sleet story true? He figured it was,

1067
01:04:35.061 --> 01:04:36.880
but you know, he thought he should at least ask.

1068
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.330
You said a reporter and there was a pause and he said, no.

1069
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:45.170
Frankly we've been waiting for someone to ask. We thought no one would ever ask.

1070
01:04:45.171 --> 01:04:47.270
It's not true. It's just something that we had made up.

1071
01:04:47.271 --> 01:04:49.520
We've learned to see if the media would, would run with it.

1072
01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:50.510
They made the whole thing.

1073
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:53.240
They made the whole thing up and then they just went to go cast their

1074
01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.561
protagonists. So we sat down,

1075
01:04:54.561 --> 01:04:58.040
we picked a Murray state that's just kind of a great sounding school.

1076
01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.120
It pops up in the NCAA tournament every few years and they came across this guy,

1077
01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:05.900
Lamont sleet. Why him? They, well, it was pretty close to random.

1078
01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:09.710
They then told me they had received an email from Lamont's leads his wife.

1079
01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.460
Absolutely.

1080
01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:14.510
His wife emailed us and said some of the details that you have or are flat out

1081
01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:17.710
wrong, that implies that some of the things you've said are though,

1082
01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.290
but Lamont thinks he probably did invent the high five.

1083
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:24.840
<v 15>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What about Glenn? I was Kinda like, hmm.</v>

1084
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:28.630
Kinda a bit blown away, you know? Yeah.

1085
01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:29.071
<v 28>You know,</v>

1086
01:05:29.071 --> 01:05:33.750
here was this guy who is proud of this and these guys just kind of stripped it

1087
01:05:33.751 --> 01:05:34.520
away from him.

1088
01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:38.000
<v 15>Do you feel a little guilty? Did I mean like, okay, it's a high five.</v>

1089
01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:41.390
It's kind of a silly thing. On the other hand, this guy's life, the way he died.

1090
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:45.560
Do you feel like you robbed him? We do feel, we do feel,

1091
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.970
we wish that we had done things slightly differently and,

1092
01:05:47.971 --> 01:05:51.050
and putting together this sort of, uh, collegiate prank,

1093
01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.200
but we didn't really know of Glenn Burke at that time.

1094
01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:57.830
Greg says they hadn't heard of the Glenbrook story when they pulled this prank

1095
01:05:57.831 --> 01:06:00.950
and now that they know it, they really feel bad. Both Derek, in fact,

1096
01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.570
they're now organizing a charity event.

1097
01:06:02.571 --> 01:06:04.280
They're calling the national high five Athon,

1098
01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:05.390
which will raise money for charity,

1099
01:06:05.391 --> 01:06:09.620
including one chosen by Glen Burke's sister Luther. Very proud.

1100
01:06:09.621 --> 01:06:13.310
Anytime I see somebody do a high five it just really makes me happy.

1101
01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:16.880
And that seemed like a good end of the story, but a no,

1102
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.690
because then John told us that if you really honestly want to get to the bottom

1103
01:06:20.691 --> 01:06:23.480
of who invented the high five, I mean we didn't think we wanted to,

1104
01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:25.220
but now that we're in it, what the hell? Well,

1105
01:06:25.221 --> 01:06:27.800
you've got to go beyond Glen Burke Story.

1106
01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.280
<v 10>I've wanted you to believe that he was the hero.</v>

1107
01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:34.590
So maybe I should tell you a little bit about Derek Smith, right?

1108
01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:38.370
Even though Glenn Burke died believing that the high five was his legacy,

1109
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.490
that more or less

1110
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:43.080
<v 29>the same moment that he invented it, a guy named Derek Smith,</v>

1111
01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:45.420
a basketball player for the Louisville Cargill's,

1112
01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:50.370
was that practice and a guy named Wylie Brown went up to Derek Smith and was

1113
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:54.150
going to give them just a ordinary low five and Derek Smith looked him in the

1114
01:06:54.151 --> 01:06:56.280
eye. This is what Wylie Brown told me.

1115
01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:59.280
Derek Smith looked him in the eye and said, no up high

1116
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:02.300
<v 31>[inaudible]</v>

1117
01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.180
<v 29>that year's Louisville team, they were, they were known as the doctors of Dunk,</v>

1118
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:08.060
you know, they're high flying team. They played above the rim. And John Says,

1119
01:07:08.061 --> 01:07:13.010
when Louisville played in the 1980 NCAA finals, I haven't seen it,

1120
01:07:13.011 --> 01:07:16.640
but apparently the broadcast, you referred actually to the high five handshake,

1121
01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.280
<v 31>give him the high five man.</v>

1122
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.830
<v 29>He felt compelled to explain it to America. Wow.</v>

1123
01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.960
And it did at the moment the Derek Smith did it,

1124
01:07:24.961 --> 01:07:27.420
did an asteroid fall on his head or something? Well,

1125
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.710
<v 28>in 1996 I believe in,</v>

1126
01:07:29.711 --> 01:07:34.270
in the 90s he had an undiagnosed heart condition and he just died all of a

1127
01:07:34.271 --> 01:07:38.680
sudden on a, on a cruise ship. What? Yes. And um,

1128
01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.750
he said explicitly the Wiley Brown,

1129
01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:42.940
this is something I'm going to be remembered for. You know,

1130
01:07:42.941 --> 01:07:45.730
our kids and our grandkids are going to talk about this and in fact their kids

1131
01:07:45.731 --> 01:07:49.420
and grandkids do talk about it and they're probably very proud. Bye.

1132
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:53.400
<v 10>That was Kathy. Then we ran into this woman. You'll love fireworks.</v>

1133
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:54.540
This is Kathy Gregory.

1134
01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:59.541
She coached women's volleyball in the 1960s years before Glenn Burke and Derek

1135
01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:00.780
Smith. And she says with her girls,

1136
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.390
<v 29>one did it all the time.</v>

1137
01:08:02.391 --> 01:08:05.330
So I do believe that was volleyball that first started it.

1138
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:09.050
And interestingly she says they would high five more when a player screwed up.

1139
01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:09.771
Yes. No, no.

1140
01:08:09.771 --> 01:08:13.130
It isn't just about celebration cause really when do you need a high five?

1141
01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:16.010
Of course it's more when you're doubt. Yeah, it makes people

1142
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:20.480
<v 10>so happy. So women's volleyball, there you go. I know Obama, Malcolm d no snip</v>

1143
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.260
because then I produce you.

1144
01:08:23.261 --> 01:08:28.261
And then Levy also discovered that in the movie breathless in 1955 and exactly

1145
01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:31.480
one hour, 18 minutes into the filming,

1146
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:36.590
we'll see two Frenchmen do a very distinct route to sank ego right there.

1147
01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.830
Isn't this all like an indication to you that did it?

1148
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:50.500
It's maybe it's one of those things that probably was there that dawn man

1149
01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.540
because it like gives pleasure.

1150
01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:57.160
It's just like from an evolutionary point of view. I don't think so. I think,

1151
01:08:57.161 --> 01:09:00.130
I think this has the feeling of something that was born. I mean,

1152
01:09:00.131 --> 01:09:03.820
who in this room wants Glenbrook to be the original guy? Raise your hand. Yeah,

1153
01:09:03.850 --> 01:09:07.000
meet me here. It's the better story. So look at what's happening here.

1154
01:09:07.001 --> 01:09:10.750
Every time we look for the original of anything, be it a disease,

1155
01:09:10.751 --> 01:09:13.870
I contagion a gesture. We find more than one.

1156
01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:17.740
So what are you doing in his situation? What you do is you just choose. You say,

1157
01:09:17.741 --> 01:09:20.880
which one is the better story? Let's just go with the best high five.

1158
01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:24.010
Forget the first the best. And I think we can do that. Let's just call it

1159
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:30.110
Glen Dark. Glenn Burke invented the high five, high five.
