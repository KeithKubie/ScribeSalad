00:00:00.145 --> 00:00:02.737
- [Instructor] Let's say
that we have some number a

00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:06.487
and to that we are going
to add some number b

00:00:09.283 --> 00:00:12.533
and that sum is going to be equal to c.

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:17.743
Let's say that we're also told

00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:20.493
that both a and b are irrational.

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:23.240
Irrational.

00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:27.020
So based on the information
that I've given you,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.235
a and b are both irrational.

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:34.168
Is their sum, c, is that going
to be rational or irrational?

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:36.014
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:38.931
and try to answer that on your own.

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:42.019
I'm guessing that you might have struggled

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.377
with this a little bit
because the answer is

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.508
that we actually don't know.

00:00:46.508 --> 00:00:50.675
It depends on what irrational
numbers a and b actually are.

00:00:52.194 --> 00:00:54.240
What do I mean by that?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.260
Well, I can pick two irrational numbers

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.343
where their sum actually
is going to be rational.

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:03.704
What do I mean?

00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:06.121
Well what if a is equal to pi

00:01:08.288 --> 00:01:10.871
and b is equal to one minus pi?

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:18.324
Now both of these are irrational numbers.

00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:22.335
Pi is irrational and one minus
pi, whatever this value is,

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:24.368
this is irrational as well.

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:26.792
But if we add these two things together,

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:29.375
if we add pi plus one minus pi,

00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:34.149
one minus pi, well these are gonna add up

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.732
to be equal to one,

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:40.697
which is clearly going
to be a rational number.

00:01:40.697 --> 00:01:42.614
So we were able to find one scenario

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:44.781
in which we added two irrationals

00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:47.448
and the sum gives us a rational.

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:49.840
In general you could do this trick

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.910
with any irrational number.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.741
Instead of pi you could've had

00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:58.908
square root of two plus one
minus the square root of two.

00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:01.647
Both of these,

00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:03.721
what we have in this
orange color is irrational,

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.821
what we have in this
blue color is irrational,

00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.126
but the sum is going to be rational.

00:02:08.126 --> 00:02:09.885
And you could do this,
instead of having one minus,

00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:12.113
you could have this as 1/2 minus.

00:02:12.113 --> 00:02:14.311
You could have done it a bunch
of different combinations

00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:17.460
so that you could end up
with a sum that is rational.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.509
But you could also easily
add two irrational numbers

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.799
and still end up with
an irrational number.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.716
For example, if a is pi

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:29.354
and b is pi,

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:36.106
well then their sum is
going to be equal to two pi,

00:02:36.106 --> 00:02:38.922
which is still irrational.

00:02:38.922 --> 00:02:40.422
Or if you added pi

00:02:42.154 --> 00:02:44.487
plus the square root of two,

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.615
this is still going to be irrational.

00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:52.506
In fact, mathematically
I would just express this

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.656
as pi plus the square root of two.

00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:56.986
This is some number right over here,

00:02:56.986 --> 00:02:59.448
but this is still going to be irrational.

00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:01.967
So the big takeaway is
if you're taking the sums

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:03.938
of two irrational numbers

00:03:03.938 --> 00:03:05.505
and people don't tell you anything else,

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:06.655
they don't tell you which

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:08.396
specific irrational numbers they are,

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:09.986
you don't know whether their sum

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:13.153
is going to be rational or irrational.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.619
Now let's think about products.

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.775
Similar exercise, let's
say we have a times b

00:03:21.775 --> 00:03:25.158
is equal to c, ab is equal to c,

00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:27.158
a times b is equal to c.

00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:30.501
And once again, let's
say someone tells you

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.251
that both a and b are irrational.

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:37.034
Pause this video and think about

00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:40.674
whether c must be rational, irrational,

00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:41.900
or whether we just don't know.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.346
Try to figure out some examples

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:46.679
like we just did when we looked at sums.

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.534
Alright, so let's think about,

00:03:49.534 --> 00:03:51.466
let's see if we can construct examples

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:54.049
where c ends up being rational.

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:57.966
Well one thing, as you
can tell I like to use pi,

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:00.597
pi might be my favorite irrational number.

00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:02.264
If a was one over pi

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:05.146
and b is pi,

00:04:07.236 --> 00:04:09.644
well, what's their product going to be?

00:04:09.644 --> 00:04:13.093
Well, their product is going
to be one over pi times pi,

00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:17.213
that's just going to be pi
over pi, which is equal to one.

00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:21.691
Here we got a situation where
the product of two irrationals

00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:23.691
became, or is, rational.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:28.047
But what if I were to multiply,

00:04:29.424 --> 00:04:30.613
and in general you could this

00:04:30.613 --> 00:04:31.679
with a lot of irrational numbers,

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:34.802
one over square root of two
times the square of two,

00:04:34.802 --> 00:04:36.653
that would be one.

00:04:36.653 --> 00:04:39.486
What if instead I had pi times pi?

00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:46.672
Pi times pi, that you could
just write as pi squared,

00:04:47.652 --> 00:04:51.569
and pi squared is still
going to be irrational.

00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:55.467
This is irrational, irrational.

00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:58.287
It isn't even always the case

00:04:58.287 --> 00:05:01.904
that if you multiply the
same irrational number,

00:05:01.904 --> 00:05:03.344
if you square an irrational number

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:04.736
that it's always going to be irrational.

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:08.548
For example, if I have
square root of two times,

00:05:08.548 --> 00:05:10.240
I think you see where this is going,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.969
times the square root of two,

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.509
I'm taking the product of
two irrational numbers.

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.743
In fact, they're the
same irrational number,

00:05:16.743 --> 00:05:18.815
but the square root of two
times the square root of two,

00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:21.034
well, that's just going
to be equal to two,

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:23.951
which is clearly a rational number.

00:05:25.568 --> 00:05:27.692
So once again, when
you're taking the product

00:05:27.692 --> 00:05:30.121
of two irrational numbers,

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.442
you don't know whether the product

00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:35.844
is going to be rational or irrational

00:05:35.844 --> 00:05:39.729
unless someone tells you
the specific numbers.

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.514
Whether you're taking the product

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:43.546
or the sum of irrational numbers,

00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:47.182
in order to know whether
the resulting number

00:05:47.182 --> 00:05:50.376
is irrational or rational,
you need to know something

00:05:50.376 --> 00:05:54.543
about what you're taking
the sum or the product of.
