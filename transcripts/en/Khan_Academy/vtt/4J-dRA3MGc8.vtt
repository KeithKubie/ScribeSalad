00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:02.430
SPEAKER 1: I'm here with
Professor Laurence Baker who's

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.263
a professor here at
Stanford Medical School,

00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:06.070
and what are we
going to talk about?

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.110
LAURENCE BAKER: Well,
we pay physicians

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.570
a lot of different
ways in this country.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.500
And I thought it would be useful
to spend a minute thinking

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.958
about the different
ways that we do

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.585
that, the concepts,
organizations,

00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:15.210
different practices
that are out there.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.720
SPEAKER 1: So, literally,
how do physicians

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.050
receive their compensation?

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.490
LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.920
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.770
LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.103
So we can go through this in
a couple of different ways,

00:00:22.103 --> 00:00:24.680
but there are three ways that
we can start out talking about,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.277
three general ways
that we organize

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:27.360
the payment of physicians.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.160
And they turn out to
be fee for service--

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.320
SPEAKER 1: Fee for service.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.960
Let me write this.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.560
Fee for service.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.060
Keep going.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.792
I'll catch up.

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:36.250
LAURENCE BAKER: Yes, sometimes
we say FFS, Fee For Service.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.635
SPEAKER 1: FFS.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:37.134
OK.

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:38.320
Makes sense.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.090
LAURENCE BAKER: Second
one, we call capitation.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.817
And the third one,
of course, salary.

00:00:42.817 --> 00:00:44.650
SPEAKER 1: Too close
to decapitation for me,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.800
but maybe it's not related.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.460
But OK.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.310
And then salary.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.070
LAURENCE BAKER: And then salary.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.800
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.939
And so fee for service.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.730
That seems to be a
little bit common sense.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.687
Is that literally it?

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.020
LAURENCE BAKER: Fee for service.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.300
In a fee for service
system, a physician

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.894
gets paid a fee for every
service that they do.

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:01.560
It's kind of like
going to a restaurant.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.830
You order the drink.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.050
You order a salad, maybe
an entree, a dessert.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.940
The restaurant keeps a
list of all the things

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.100
that you ordered and,
at the end of the night,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.950
there's a price
associated with each one.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.200
And you add up the
price associated

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.533
with each of the things you got.

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.834
That makes your total bill.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:16.000
That's the fee for service--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.700
SPEAKER 1: I see.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.033
And so this is kind of what
a doctor in private practice

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:19.970
would face.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.870
LAURENCE BAKER: Well, doctors
can be paid fee for service

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.950
in a lot of different
arrangements.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.330
So they might be in private
practice paid this way.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.150
Some physician groups
are paid this way,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.180
and fee for service
concepts come up, even,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.430
in large organizations, like the
Stanford Medical School where

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.960
some people are sometimes paid
for their work in a hospital

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.460
according--

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.588
SPEAKER 1: I see.

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:37.490
But the general idea is that if
they're not providing service

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.870
or if there's a slow
day then they're

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.500
not going to be
making money that day.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.110
LAURENCE BAKER: Right.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.610
Right.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.040
The more services they do,
the more expensive services

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.390
they do, the more
costly that they do,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.250
the more revenue that their
practice will generate.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.958
SPEAKER 1: I see.

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.510
And we'll talk later about
whether that's a good idea.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.510
LAURENCE BAKER: Of course,
that has implications

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.970
for the way that physicians act
and the way that they practice.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.303
SPEAKER 1: So what's capitation?

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:58.090
Because I'm not
familiar with that.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.090
LAURENCE BAKER: So
capitation-- the general idea

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.120
is to do something quite
different than fee for service.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.134
The term capitation comes
from the Latin, per head.

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:08.550
SPEAKER 1: Oh so it is related
to decapitation, literally,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.050
per head.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.422
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:13.880
LAURENCE BAKER: So we're going
to pay physicians per person

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.254
that they have in
their practice,

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:17.740
and the kind of building
blocks of a capitation system

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.910
would be, one, a
panel of patients

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.645
who are assigned to a doctor.

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:24.110
So the doctor might
have 1,000 patients

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.715
for which he or
she is responsible.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:29.720
We'll call that group
their members, their panel.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.714
Sometimes people call
it their covered lives.

00:02:31.714 --> 00:02:33.380
Second piece of a
capitation arrangement

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.610
is an agreement about
what the physician is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.610
going to be responsible
for under the agreement.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.880
So we might say it's primary
care services, all the office

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.840
visits, and basic
tests, and follow-ups

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.830
that those patients
might need, but maybe not

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.350
their hospitalizations or their
expensive surgeries, things

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.750
like that.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.190
So you have some
group of patients.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.731
You have some agreed
set of services,

00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:53.430
and then you would define a
payment, which in the jargon

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.790
gets called the PMPM the
Per-Member Per-Month.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.850
SPEAKER 1: Per-Member Per-Month.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.300
And who is making this payment?

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.470
It is, I guess, the
employer of the doctor.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.095
So this definitely would not be
the case with a-- oh, go ahead.

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:08.303
LAURENCE BAKER: So it would
be the insurance company,

00:03:08.303 --> 00:03:11.060
generally, that's going to
pay the doctor this payment.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.820
So when an insurance
company, let's

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.055
say Blue Shield Blue
Cross, Aetna, Cigna,

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:17.430
any number of
different companies

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.270
that might be out there, has
an arrangement with a physician

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.760
that they take-- some number
of their insured people

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.650
become part of the
panel of that doctor,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.020
they could arrange to pay that
doctor on a capitation basis,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.950
by saying, you've got
1,000 of our patients.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.100
Here's what we're going to
pay you to take care of them.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.460
SPEAKER 1: I see.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.870
And it seems to
make a lot of sense

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.620
for the insurance
company, because now you

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.549
don't have this incentive
for the doctor to--

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.090
LAURENCE BAKER: You change the
way the whole incentive works.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.410
So now, if a
physician gets, say,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.300
$25 per member per month for
taking care of their 1,000

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.352
patients-- they get
$25,000 a month--

00:03:50.352 --> 00:03:52.810
they've got to do what needs
to be done for those patients.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.393
But they don't get paid extra
if they do something additional,

00:03:55.393 --> 00:03:58.211
if they do a more expensive test
as opposed to a cheaper test,

00:03:58.211 --> 00:03:59.460
they get paid the same amount.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.970
So you take away
the incentive that

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.910
exists in a
fee-for-service system that

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.892
tends to get people to
try to do more things,

00:04:04.892 --> 00:04:06.600
or at least creates
a world in which it's

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.294
possible to do more things
and get paid for it.

00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:11.460
SPEAKER 1: And it's more
predictable for the doctor,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.370
too.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.850
LAURENCE BAKER: Well, it could
be predictable for the doctor.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.689
Although, in some
sense, it's predictable.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:16.980
And in another sense, it's not.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.209
An important difference between
fee-for-service and capitation,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.150
we'll say, in health
policy, is associated

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.850
with risk or this
concept of risk.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.620
And when we talk
about risk here,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.970
we mean financial
risk associated

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.950
with the health of the
patients or variations

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.260
in the needs of the
patients in a given month.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.230
So if you're being
paid fee-for-service,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.600
the doctor doesn't
face any real risk.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.390
If it's a bad month,
everybody's sick,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.090
everybody needs lots
of care, they're

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.030
going to get paid for
delivering that care.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.420
Under capitation, the doctor
does face more of that risk.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.920
They're getting
paid a fixed amount.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.890
They've got to deal with
whatever the patients need.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.598
SPEAKER 1: I see.

00:04:50.598 --> 00:04:53.194
In a high-volume
month, the doctor

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:54.360
takes the hit in capitation.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.607
But in a low-volume month,
the insurance company

00:04:56.607 --> 00:04:57.190
takes the hit.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.981
So it goes both ways
and kind of evens out.

00:04:58.981 --> 00:05:00.600
LAURENCE BAKER: Right.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.180
The doctor benefits in
the low-volume months.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.680
Right?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.270
The doctor kind of averages out.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.940
In a good arrangement, this
will be sort of even over time.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.420
The doctors will come out OK.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.210
But these risk issues have been
problems in some capitation

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.900
arrangements, especially if
you're a small doctor practice

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.840
and you've got a lot of
variation from month to month.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.080
Maybe you're not
a great manager.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.450
You can go out of business
if you have a few bad months.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.046
SPEAKER 1: Who
decides that it will

00:05:22.046 --> 00:05:23.420
be capitation or
fee-for-service?

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.860
Is it the doctor's
choice or the insurance

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.430
company says, you will do this?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.290
LAURENCE BAKER:
So, over time, it's

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.998
been a bit of negotiation
back and forth.

00:05:28.998 --> 00:05:30.740
So insurance companies
have preferences

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.650
about how they do
this, and doctors

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.440
have preferences about
how this happens.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.220
And so sometimes some of
it's driven just by history.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.840
The Medicare
program, for example,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.500
got started in the 1960s
when fee-for-service

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.700
was the most common way
for physicians to be paid,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.310
and that's largely
persisted in that program

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.370
for historical reasons.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.630
It's just worked out that way.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.870
In the 1990s, a
lot of health plans

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.772
decided, the insurance
companies decided,

00:05:52.772 --> 00:05:54.230
that, in the private
market, they'd

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.610
like to do more
capitation, so they did.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.840
And they started pushing
these arrangements,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.286
trying to get
physicians to agree.

00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:01.660
They were successful
for a while.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.240
And then, lately, it's been
a little more-- physicians

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.040
have said, we don't
like capitation so well.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.550
We'd rather go back
to fee-for-service.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.310
That's working better.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.480
So the negotiations have gone
a little more the other way.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.896
SPEAKER 1: Have
there been studies

00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:15.430
that showed when doctors who
are compensated under capitation

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.152
don't order as many services
or perform as many services?

00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:20.860
LAURENCE BAKER: So
the literature on this

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.670
is pretty clear that
it makes a difference.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.600
We would like to think that
it doesn't make a difference.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.600
SPEAKER 1: Most of them
are all about the health

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.310
of the patient, but--

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.770
LAURENCE BAKER: Well, so there
are hundreds of thousands

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.004
of doctors in the country
and, undoubtedly, out there

00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:38.170
are some that pay close
attention to the financials.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.670
But I think, actually,
you're right.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.920
Most of them probably don't,
on a day-to-day basis,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.960
pay close attention.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.710
And at the end of year,
they'll see the financials

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.300
from their practice.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.410
Maybe they don't
think it through.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.760
SPEAKER 1: But if you got
to pay the college tuition,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.750
then all of a sudden,
hey, maybe an MRI

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.180
wouldn't hurt or a little
extra this or that.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.930
LAURENCE BAKER: I think
that's part of it.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.513
But the other thing that I think
is going on in the background

00:06:56.513 --> 00:06:59.310
is the general, maybe
almost subtle-- the things

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.060
that you don't notice
that create a system

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.060
and let a system evolve
in a particular way.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.260
So doctors like to do
things for their patients.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.170
Patients like to have
things done for them.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.880
A fee-for-service
system creates a world

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.754
in which everybody
is fine with that.

00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:11.420
You can do that.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.360
And so, pretty soon, you
get used to doing that.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.510
Which becomes the
first thing you

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.030
think of when you do
these extra things.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.170
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.253
Neither party, neither the
doctor nor the patient,

00:07:18.253 --> 00:07:21.564
has any incentive,
really, of saying, wait.

00:07:21.564 --> 00:07:22.480
Who's paying for that?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.438
Oh no, someone else is.

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:24.590
OK.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.590
LAURENCE BAKER: And it
creates in the background

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.410
these incentives for people
who develop new products

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.710
and services to develop them.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.690
And it makes it
easy for a hospital,

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.180
say, to put in a big
new piece of equipment

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.995
that they're pretty
sure they can pay for.

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:38.370
And once it's sitting there
and you pass it every morning

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.570
on your way into the
hospital, it just

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.150
becomes that much
easier to use it.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.290
And so it sort of guides
the evolution of our system

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.000
in a way that has
led us to a point

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.899
now where we consume
a lot of health care,

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:49.940
maybe, sometimes, health
care that we don't need.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.648
It's often health care
that's beneficial,

00:07:51.648 --> 00:07:53.474
but it's all costly,
and so that sets us up

00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:55.890
for the kind of dynamics and
the challenges we have today.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.850
SPEAKER 1: How common is-- maybe
we should talk about salary

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.850
before we talk about
how common they are.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.270
LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, we can
pick that up as we go along.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.390
Fee-for-service and capitation
have been ebbing and flowing.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.750
Frankly, in the US at the
moment, fee for service

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.220
is a very common way
for people to be paid.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.160
Capitation is declining.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.712
There are still places--

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:18.420
SPEAKER 1: So even
though fee for service

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.860
was where everyone
started, capitation kind of

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.870
went a little bit
[INAUDIBLE] and then no one's

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.230
really a fan of it.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.720
Or the doctors
aren't a fan of it.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:25.776
LAURENCE BAKER: Picked up.

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:28.431
The doctors were less of a
fan, and so the arrangements

00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:30.930
have been shifting more toward--
insurance arrangements that

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.690
would use more
fee-for-service these days.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.360
So the US is,
definitely, I think,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.640
majority fee-for-service.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.130
SPEAKER 1: Who decides what
the panel-- because it sounded

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.546
like the insurance
companies would

00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:40.969
pay for part of the
panel of a doctor who

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:42.133
would be under capitation.

00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:44.049
LAURENCE BAKER: So these
kinds of arrangements

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.560
can, in practice, get
kind of complicated.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.090
So the concept of paying
per head is clear,

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.830
but there will be
variations that go on.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.004
So if you change the
scope of services,

00:08:53.004 --> 00:08:55.295
you change the arrangement--
If you have a primary care

00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:57.580
arrangement for capitation,
that's one piece but,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.380
of course, it leaves off
the MRI or the surgery.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.950
And what would
happen in those cases

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.630
is the health plan would have
an arrangement for primary care

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.705
services with some
doctors under capitation.

00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:08.330
Then they would have
other arrangements

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.121
with other doctors.

00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.120
They might, say, have
a capitated arrangement

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.605
with some cardiologist
to do the cardiology.

00:09:13.605 --> 00:09:14.980
Or they might have
an arrangement

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.940
with some cardiologists
to pay fee for service

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.750
to those cardiologists,
so when the--

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.380
SPEAKER 1: I see, so
it's a big mix-up,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.420
but obviously
there's an incentive.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.810
If you are being
paid capitation,

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.707
you want the healthiest people
in that capitation panel.

00:09:25.707 --> 00:09:27.540
LAURENCE BAKER: So
there's another incentive

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.581
that's in the background.

00:09:28.581 --> 00:09:30.730
And that's a selection
kind of incentive.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.160
So it's, again, a thing where
I think doctors probably

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.930
don't think about this, most
doctors, on a day-to-day basis.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.050
But it's a subtle force
operating in the background.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.580
If you're getting
capitation and you

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.380
can take actions that would
get you a healthier patient

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.121
bunch for that same $25,000,
say, you end up a little bit

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.370
ahead at the end of the month.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.510
And doctors don't, I think,
like to shift patients off.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.230
And there's laws that prevent
certain kinds of activities.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.841
But, subtly in
the background, it

00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:58.590
helps the system evolve
in that direction.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.670
And so we would probably see
some of that kind of thing

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.210
happen.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:01.793
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:10:01.793 --> 00:10:03.320
And salary is what we imagine.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.030
This is how most of us get paid.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.280
LAURENCE BAKER: Salary
is what you imagine.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.530
It's an agreement to be paid
a certain amount per year

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.200
for some amount of
work [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.510
SPEAKER 1: This would be
from the insurance companies,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:11.800
wouldn't it?

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.500
LAURENCE BAKER:
So what happens--

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.960
we talk about these three
as being different things,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.240
but when you get to the
real-world interpretation,

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.120
or real-world looking at
systems that are out there,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.470
what you'll see is often
mixes between these.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.450
And so one of the pieces
of disentangling this

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.025
is multilevel systems.

00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:30.650
And that's where
salary becomes kind of

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.691
important to think about.

00:10:31.691 --> 00:10:35.220
So one common thing that happens
is physicians group together

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.940
into larger practices.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.660
And that larger practice
collects the activity

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.010
of all the doctors that
work in that practice, bills

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.385
for that from an insurance
company, and then disseminates

00:10:44.385 --> 00:10:46.296
or distributes the
money among the doctors.

00:10:46.296 --> 00:10:48.170
And so what you will
often see in real life--

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.190
and that complicates
the inference here--

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.410
is, say, a large practice
that billed an insurance

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.190
company on a
fee-for-service basis

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.430
for the collective activity
of all the doctors,

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.750
takes that resulting pool
of money and divides it up.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.820
Maybe pay some of
the doctors a salary.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.880
Maybe pays them a salary
with some sort of bonus

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.674
that depends on how
much work they did.

00:11:04.674 --> 00:11:05.590
And does other things.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.360
And so sometimes the incentive
that an individual doctor,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.670
sitting in a room with
a patient is looking at,

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.630
might be different than
the incentive based

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.706
on the managers of that
practice who might then

00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:16.330
want to get the
doctors to do something

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.360
that's different than--

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.470
SPEAKER 1: But the general
idea is that-- I mean,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.580
the only way to get a salary
is if there's some organization

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.829
between the doctor and the
insurance companies to kind

00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:23.660
of--

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:23.990
LAURENCE BAKER: Yes.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.940
SPEAKER 1: --insulate
the doctor.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.370
LAURENCE BAKER: So one of
the important pieces here

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.750
that we think about is that
fee-for-service works in almost

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.840
any physician practice, a
solo practitioner, one person

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.160
working by themselves, or
two together could do this.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.880
Capitation almost
always works in any kind

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.770
of physician practice,
with the exception

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.470
that, if you're a very small
practice, the risk you face

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.410
from month to month,
depending on the sickness

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.370
of your patients, might put you
out of business if you're not

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.417
really on top of it.

00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:50.250
So we like to think
capitation could work in

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.570
any practice, but
really only larger ones.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.179
And salary is a nice
incentive in a lot of ways

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:56.970
but requires you to
have a big organization

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.090
to be able to do this.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.590
And so some of the differences
you see in how physicians get

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.420
paid have a lot to do with
the size of the organization

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.240
they work in.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.573
SPEAKER 1: Makes complete sense.

00:12:04.573 --> 00:12:05.936
Well, thanks for that.
