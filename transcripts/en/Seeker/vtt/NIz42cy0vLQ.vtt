00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.290
We’ve found an Earth-like planet orbiting
a star RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO OUR SUN!

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.510
Pack your bags, kids!

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:11.969
LET'S GO TO PROXIMA B!

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.860
Hello there soon-to-be Proxima Centurians!

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.230
Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.300
A few weeks back we started hearing rumors,
really exciting rumors tales of the discovery

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.839
of a planet… and then we freaked out.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.439
Because the rumors are true!

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.849
Today, astronomers announced our closest neighbor
star, Proxima Centauri, has a rocky planet

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.479
orbiting in the habitable zone.

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.370
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Proxima b!

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.760
The planet is around 30% more massive than
Earth and is mind-blowingly close to its star.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.149
It only takes a little over 11 days for the
planet to complete a single orbit1 -- it's

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.290
95 percent closer to Proxima than we are to
our sun.1 It doesn't burn up because Proxima

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.539
is a red dwarf star, so it's much cooler and
smaller than our sun.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.140
The habitable zone around any star is the
distance at which a planet needs to orbit

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.089
that’s not too hot and not too cold for
liquid water to exist on its surface.3 As

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.170
far as we can tell, where there's water there's
a possibility for life.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.390
This is why astrobiologists get excited when
they find exoplanets in habitable zones.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.670
Just because a planet is in a habitable zone,
though, doesn't mean we can live there.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.980
And even though liquid water could exist on
Proxima b, that doesn't mean it has any.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.501
On top of that, red dwarf stars like Proxima
Centauri emit more intense x-ray flares, and

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:25.700
ultraviolet energies than our own sun.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.649
So, while we probably can't live there, it's
exciting because before 1995 we'd never confirmed

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.360
a single exoplanet.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.510
For all we knew, there were no planets out
there…

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.219
Much less one RIGHT NEXT DOOR… only four
point two light-years away!

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.180
Which is still far, but in astronomical terms
that's ludicrously close.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.180
So this is exciting for many reasons.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.090
First, this Proxima b is the closest exoplanet
beyond our solar system.1 Which is great.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.789
But, the fact that it’s Earth-sized AND
orbits inside the habitable zone are both

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:54.789
amazing!

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.789
Because c'mon.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:56.890
INTERSTELLAR MISSION, AMIRITE?

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.939
There’s currently a lot of excitement for
that possibility and plans in place to send

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.689
spacecraft to other stars, but we need new
technology.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.190
Our fastest current spacecraft would take
about 80,000 years to get to Proxima Centauri,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.340
but if we could go 10-percent the speed of
light we'd cut that to 50 years.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.470
We can't go that fast yet, but now maybe engineers
and scientists will be inspired to figure

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.520
out how to get to this new planet.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.490
Especially, if it’s Earth-like when we get
there!

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.420
But that’s a big IF.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.800
Though the media is calling Proxima b an “Earth-like”
world, that’s not particularly accurate.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.010
Just because a world is small and rocky like
Earth, and orbits in the habitable zone, doesn’t

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.410
make it an oasis fit for life.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.210
Just look at Mars and Venus; both of those
are in our habitable zone and neither are

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.980
particularly Earth-like!

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.840
I already mentioned the powerful X-ray and
ultraviolet radiation that Proxima b is likely

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.290
subject to… not great for biology.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.060
But also, red dwarfs are known to flare regularly,
blasting any planets with radiation.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.690
This means the Proxima b would have to have
a thick atmosphere and powerful magnetosphere

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.540
to protect it from damaging space weather
if life were to flourish.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.290
For now, we have no clue if it has either.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.800
And then there’s the question of Proxima
b’s really tight orbit.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.291
When a planet orbits its star so closely,
it will become “tidally locked” -- this

00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:20.660
causes one hemisphere to constantly face the
star while the other is in constant night.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.630
That is VERY un-Earth-like, and can make for
INSANE planetary weather.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.400
One side cooks while the other freezes.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.180
Look, in the end, this is still a VERY important
AND historic discovery.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.340
To have any world that just so happens to
have any Earthy qualities on our galactic

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.050
doorstep is an incredible stroke of luck and
will undoubtedly become a point of scientific

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.160
interest that could inspire Earthlings to
see interstellar travel as a possibility.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.190
When it comes to finding these tiny little
planets, how do we know so much about planets

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.790
that are so far away?

00:03:49.790 --> 00:04:04.850
DiscoveryNews Space Producer Dr Ian O'Neill
explains that for you, here.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.980
Special thanks to Ian for all his help with
this story!

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.560
You're a star, man!

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.290
How do you feel about this discovery?

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.290
Excited?

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.290
Nervous?

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.650
Want to go to there?
