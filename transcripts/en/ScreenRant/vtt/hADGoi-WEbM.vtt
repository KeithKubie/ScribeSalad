00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.920
Marvel has created one of the most lucrative film franchises in history.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.000
The MCU, employes countless crew behind the scenes and is always adding new faces to the lineup.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.020
And there's still so much more to look forward too, with no end in sight.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.500
Old fans and noobs alike all agree that the casting choices have been bang on so far,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.000
making the transition from page to screen a smooth one.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.920
All of the characters on this list are super, but that doesn't mean they're one dimensional

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.300
Each one projects strength in their own way,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.900
but Marvel has also given them the opportunity to be powerless too.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.500
Before we jump into the good stuff, we just wanted to thank you for checking out our video.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.800
You could be anywhere in the world, but you're here, with us

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.900
and because of that we've got a serious case of the warm and fuzzies.  Awwww

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.900
And hey, while you're here can you guess the movie based on these emoji's?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.500
Stay tuned for the answer.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Here are ten Marvel secrets that make their actors look weak.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.900
Chris Evans as Captain America.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.900
By this point audiences are so used to seeing Captain America as a dude who is thoughtful,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.500
noble and has the muscles to back up the title.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.500
And while its great for Chris Evans to have such an important role in the MCU

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.300
It's got to be hard to keep up with the workouts.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.800
But Cap wasn't always such a beefcake.  Remember his first movie?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.200
Steve Rogers was not exactly someone you would describe as muscular.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200
And that is the point, isn't it?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.600
Because the after picture means nothing if you don't get to see the one that came before it

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Otherwise he'd just be another Hollywood adonis with mommy issues.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.100
Mickey Rourke as Whiplash.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.600
Mickey has been  around the mountain a couple of times so to speak,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.500
and he's no stranger to playing the terrifying big bad.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.200
The actor has been boxing since he was about 10 years old and has sparred with some of the best.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.900
So theoretically he should be able to take on a silver tongued rich kid. Right?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.300
Well now if he wanted to beat Tony Stark, he probably should have learned how to use a computer

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.000
before stepping in the ring.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.300
Iron man is all about his technology,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.300
and clearly the best way to fight fire, is with fire.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.800
So Whiplash, whips up a suit similar to Iron Man's and the two have a rumble.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.500
But in real life, Rourke doesn't know his way around technology at all

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.100
and struggled through the entire shoot.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.600
Anthony Hopkins as Odin.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.400
Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest thespians to ever grace our planet.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.200
The renowned actor has performed in over 130 projects.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.900
He's so good, he could probably make a  statue weep real tears if he wanted to.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.200
While filming a scene for Thor, that's kind-of what happened.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.200
Director Kenneth Branagh asked Hopkins to improvise the speech he gives when

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.000
banishing the  titular character from Asguard. And improvise he did.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.700
Not only was the moment electrifying on film but the entire crew hard a hard time keeping their composure.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.700
Many of them cried, and both Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.500
admitted they were on the verge of tears as well.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.500
Robert Downey Junior as Iron Man.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.000
Robert Downey Junior is going to do what he wants. Okay? He's Iron Man.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.500
And if Iron Man wants to hide snacks all over the set

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.800
to eat when the cameras are rolling

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.600
then that's precisely what God damn Iron Man is going to do.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.200
There is no MCU without him after all.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.700
Low blood sugar isn't a heroic trait, and filming all day and night for months on end

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.400
will definitely take it's toll on anyone's body.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.600
So just let the man have his snacks all right?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.700
There's no point in taking them away either,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.500
because finding one hidden treat just means that there are still 99 others you haven't found.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.900
So if Marvel wants this stop,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.200
maybe they should try breaking for lunch occasionally instead....

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.000
BOOM

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.400
Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.100
Securing the role of Hawkeye, was an uphill climb for Jeremy Renner.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.600
Not only did he have to start doing the super hero workout, but he also had to learn archery.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.900
The majority of audience members probably thought he did a great job

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.600
when the character appeared in Thor.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.300
But eagle eyed fans noticed that Renner only shot with his right hand.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.300
Whats the big deal?

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.300
Well, Hawkeye is supposed to be ambidexterous,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.000
So the actor hustled and trained with Olympians to learn how to shoot with his left hand as well.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.500
Just to be a little more legit for the next movie.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.500
And that my friends is what we call dedication.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500
Tidla Swinton as The Ancient One.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.600
Before he got his own movie. Dr Strange was a relatively unknown member of the Marvel canon.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.900
Most movie goers hadn't even heard the name.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.200
But long time fans of the graphic novels could hardly contain their joy.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.300
That is, until some of the casting decisions were revealed.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.700
Audiences were mixed about Benedict Cumberbatch in the titular role.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.300
But the real riots happened after Tilda Swinton was announced to be playing

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.100
The Ancient One.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.400
The character is traditionally a Tibetan male.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.500
But Hollywood could not have picked a whiter actress.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.400
And the word white washing got thrown around quite a bit.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.800
So while she might not be a weak performer, she was a weak choice.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.900
Rocket Racoon "Oh.. Yeah"

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.400
Vin Diesel as Groot.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.600
Just to be clear, Vin Diesel is not a weak man.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.300
He's shorter than you might think.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.200
And his last name isn't really Diesel.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200
But nobody is going to call him weak to his face.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.800
Now if you only knew him from his voice work in Guardians of the Galaxy however.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.100
You might say that about his vocabulary.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.700
I AM GROOOOOOOOOOOTTT......

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.700
Are about as complex as his dialogue gets.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.600
Now obviously that was a writing choice and not on him,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.100
but if you were looking for a reason to hate on the actor.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.100
You might say it's just another entry on an already shallow resume.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.900
Iron Man. "My Turn"

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.300
Terrence Howard as War Machine

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.100
Money is a weird thing, and your experience with it

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.900
drives more of your behaviour than you might realise.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.100
Its a well known fact, that celebrities get paid a lot.  Specifically actors.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.200
So when one of their names ends up in a headline, stating that they demand more money for a role.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.700
It's all to easy to just roll your eyes.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.600
After the success of the first Iron Man instalment.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.600
Terrence Howard requested a pay bump.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.400
Not only was he denied the raise, he was straight up replaced.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.600
The studio brought Don Cheadle, who has played the role of War Machine ever since.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.400
The swap was played up to make Howard look like the greedy bad guy.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.200
When in reality, that might not have been the case.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.600
Tyre's screech

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.700
Loud Crash.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.700
Michael. B. Jordan as The Human Torch, and Jamie Bell as The Thing.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.100
Everyone has something to say about 2015's revamp of the big screen Fantastic Four franchise.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.500
And we're no exception.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.100
Tales of behind the scenes meddling done by the studio are usually to blame

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.600
for the movie's poor reception,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.400
and perhaps the most popular excuse for it's failure.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.600
It also tanks the credibility of some of the actors involved.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.200
But it's not actually their fault.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.100
Michael. B . Jordan blew everyone's socks off in Creed.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.200
And lets not forget that Jamie Bell wasn't just in Billy Elliot. He was Billy Elliot.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.100
So if you didn't know anything beyond what was happening on screen

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.100
You'd probably think it was just bad acting.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.000
History proves, that couldn't be more wrong.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.900
At least Jordan is getting the opportunity to redeem himself in

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.600
the MCU'S upcoming film Black Panther.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.300
Spider-Man. "I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr Stark, so..

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.300
I'm really sorry.  What???

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.800
Tom Holland as Spider-Man

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.400
For a lot of people, age ain't nothing but a number,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.200
and yet Hollywood still gets nervous when it comes to casting a young person.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.400
In an industry where it's impossible to tell anyone's real age from just looking at them,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.600
what's the difference?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.900
When 19 year old Tom Holland was revealed as the next Spider-Man.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.600
The studio was a wee bit nervous that he was too young.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.800
Despite the fact that the character is supposed to look young,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.200
act young and actually be young.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.200
Sure they could of hired someone twice his age

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.500
and thrown make up at them until the cows came home.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.200
But audiences aren't stupid

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.500
and instead of washing out someone else's performance with special effects.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.200
Casting a kid was probably the right way to go.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400
What do you think?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.200
Do these actors actually look as weak as we thought?

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.200
Or did our analysis miss the mark entirely.
