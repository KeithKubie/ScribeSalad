00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.970
Welcome back.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.000
We'll now try to see what
trigonometric identity we can

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.490
come up with if we start off
with cosine of alpha plus beta.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.520
Let's see if we can rewrite
this as another combination

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.170
of cosines and sines
of alpha and beta.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.310
So let's get started.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.660
And if you've already watched
the sine equivalent of this,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.320
this proof will be pretty
similar in how we operate.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.670
And we get a kind
of similar answer.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.870
And something interesting is to
kind of compare the difference

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.385
between sine of alpha plus beta
and cosine of alpha plus

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:41.900
beta after we're done.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.460
So just like that last proof,
let's say that this angle-- no,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.182
that color isn't bright enough.

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:48.580
Let's do yellow.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.450
Let's say that this angle
right here is alpha, and this

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.400
angle right here is beta.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.160
Right?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.340
We want to know cosine
of alpha plus beta.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.560
So alpha plus beta is this
large angle right here.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.140
Right?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.550
So what's the cosine of that?

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.890
SOH, CAH, TOA.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.930
So cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.160
Right?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.390
SOH, CAH, TOA.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.830
CAH.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.980
So cosine is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.730
So for this large angle,
what's the adjacent?

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.570
It's line AC.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.350
So that equals-- line AC,
that's the adjacent.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.890
The length of line AC over
the length of line--

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.790
what's the hypotenuse?

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.270
AB, right?

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.810
All right.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.400
AC over AB.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.670
Now let's see what we
can do with this.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.640
AC-- adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.100
Now can we write AC in any
other interesting way-- a

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.290
combination of some of the
other lines on this very

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.070
fortunately designed graph?

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.230
Let's see.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.640
Well isn't AC the same thing
as AF, this big line,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.660
minus-- what is this?

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.610
This is a D, right?

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.805
OK.

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:25.020
That's a D.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.920
Let me rewrite that as a D.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.770
D as in dog.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.440
There you go.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.570
So AF minus DE.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.210
Right?

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.090
Oh, I forgot to
draw some things.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.330
We assume that this line is
perpendicular to that line.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.790
We assume this line is
perpendicular to that line.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.060
We assume that line is
perpendicular to that line.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.450
Right?

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.470
And then by definition, that is
because we drew it that way.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.610
But anyway.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.720
So now you know that this line
is parallel to this line and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.730
this line is perpendicular.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.770
So we know that AF, this long
line, minus DE is equal to AC.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.560
Does that make sense?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.800
AF, this big line, minus
the shorter line is

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.070
the same thing as AC.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.600
Right?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.570
So let me write that down.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:25.850
That equals AF minus DE,
all of that over AB.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.935
And then, of course, we can
rewrite that as-- and I'm going

00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:43.080
to switch to some different
colors-- as AF over AB.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.650
Let me switch to maybe green.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:58.100
Minus DE over AB.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:07.600
So we have now AF over
AB minus DE over AB.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.320
And those are kind of
nonsensical ratios to me.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.300
Wouldn't it be great if
we could express it

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.640
somehow as AF over AE?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.300
Because then we could say well
that's cosine of alpha, and

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.050
do something from there.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.850
Well let's try.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.960
So let's try to rewrite
this first expression.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.720
So I'll switch back to
the purple just so you

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.890
know where this first
expression is coming from.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.690
Let's see if we can break
this down as AF over AE

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.690
times something else.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.710
Well, we could just
algebraically do it.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.760
That's equivalent to AF over--
I might run out of space--

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:52.170
over AE times AE over AB.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.370
And you're saying, Sal where
did you get that from?

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.870
Well, you can kind of say my
motivation was to have AF

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.540
as a ratio of over AE.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.330
And I just set it up so that
the multiplication would cancel

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.310
out, because the AE's would
cancel out and you'd be

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.550
left with AF over AB.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.810
Right?

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.490
So this is a reasonable
thing to do.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.200
I hope you see.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.520
And let me switch to the green
and do something similar.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.310
DE over AB doesn't
make much sense.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.680
But if I could maybe do DE over
BE, then if this angle I can

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.670
see is similar to alpha or
beta then maybe I can

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.060
make some progress.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:45.420
So let's say DE over BE times--
and we'll do the same thing.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.245
You just have to multiply
times BE over AB.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.790
And just like in that sine
proof, and we'll do the same

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.760
thing here, let's figure out
what this angle up here is.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.040
Right?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.950
Because if we know that then
these ratios become useful.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.730
So if this angle is an alpha,
then we know that this

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.860
angle right here is alpha.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.140
Right?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.800
Because DE-- because this
line-- is parallel to AF.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.100
You learned that in geometry.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.395
And if this angle is alpha we
know that this angle right here

00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:21.850
is 90 minus alpha, because
it's complementary.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.110
Right?

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.020
Because this whole angle
is 90 degrees, so this

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.730
is 90 minus alpha.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.670
And since this angle 90 minus
alpha, this angle 90, and this

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.580
angle add up to 180, we could
figure out that this is alpha.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.030
And if you don't believe me add
up alpha plus 90 plus 90 minus

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.190
alpha, and you will
get 180 degrees.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.022
So this angle up here,
angle DBE, is alpha.

00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:47.860
So that's very interesting.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.450
So can we rewrite these ratios
as the sines or cosines

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.360
of alpha's or beta's?

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.230
Well, let's try.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.970
Let me switch back to purple.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.330
So that equals--
what is AF over AE?

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.880
Well if we look at this right
triangle, that's the adjacent

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.820
over the hypotenuse for alpha.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.760
Right?

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.000
Adjacent over hypotenuse,
that's cosine.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.200
So it's cosine of alpha.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.030
And what's AE over AB?

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.920
Well, they're similar.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.840
If we look at this big right
triangle right here that is the

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.950
adjacent over the hypotenuse
for beta, so it's

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:36.930
cosine of beta.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.970
Switch my colors.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.515
Minus DE over BE.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.570
Well this is alpha, right?

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.440
Now there's a little smudge.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.420
You probably can't read it.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:56.980
But that was alpha.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.420
We showed that that was alpha.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.310
So DE is the opposite and
BE is the hypotenuse.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.540
Opposite over hypotenuse
is sine, right?

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.880
So that's sine of alpha.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.780
And what is BE over AB?

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.900
Look at this triangle again.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.000
Well, for beta that is
BE is the opposite and

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.250
AB is the hypotenuse.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.280
So opposite over
hypotenuse for beta.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.170
So it's the sine of beta.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.240
Times the sine of beta.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:26.860
I'm running out of space.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.660
I have to go to another line.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.390
Pretty neat.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.255
I'll rewrite everything in
a new and exciting color.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.620
OK.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.860
Let me do it in light blue.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:55.340
So we now know that the cosine
of alpha plus beta is equal to

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.970
the cosine of both of them
multiplied-- so cosine of

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:10.070
alpha, cosine of beta-- minus
the sine of both of

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.880
them multiplied.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.140
Minus sine of alpha
times sine of beta.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.850
I hope you found that
as satisfying as I do.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.080
See you in the next
presentation.
