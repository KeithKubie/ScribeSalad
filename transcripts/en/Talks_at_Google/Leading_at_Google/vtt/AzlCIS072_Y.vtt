&gt;&gt;Alana Weiss: Hello and welcome.

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:08.920
My name is Alana Weiss and today it is my
pleasure to welcome Susan Cain to the Leading@Google

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920
series.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.320
Today we'll hear about her new book Quiet:
The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.360
Stop Talking.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.320
Next week you'll see its number four on the
New York Times Bestseller List and Susan will

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.320
soon be giving a presentation at TED 2012.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.100
Before Susan became a writer, she practiced
corporate law for seven years representing

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.620
clients like J.P. Morgan and General Electric.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.100
She, then, worked as a negotiations consultant
training all kinds of people from Hedge Fund

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.290
managers to TV producers to college students
negotiating their first salary.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.090
She went to Princeton University and Harvard
Law School.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.780
Reflecting on these experiences Susan writes,
"From all this, you might guess that I'm a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.880
hardcore, wonderfully, self confident, pound
the table kind of person, when in fact I'm

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.719
just the opposite."

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:11.499
So today, in a room full of introverts and
their champions, Susan will share her research

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:15.720
and firsthand knowledge about the power of
introverts.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.380
Thank you and help me in welcoming Susan.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.380
[applause]

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.959
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Thank you, Alana.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:25.819
Hi everyone.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:31.219
Well, I have come to believe from researching
and writing this book for about seven years

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.689
now, started back in 2005, I've come to believe
that introversion and extroversion are as

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.749
profound a part of who we are, as core to
our identities as our gender.

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:50.639
And that therefore it's very important to
understand where we truly fall on the introvert/extrovert

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:51.639
spectrum.

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.299
And when I say this, I'm not talking about
where we appear to fall, or who we appear

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.409
to be because most of us, in this extroverted
culture of ours, act much more extroverted

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.159
than we really are.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.329
So what I'm asking is who you are deep down
if you could spend your time exactly as you

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.769
please, your workdays, your weekends who would
you be?

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.430
Would you be more of an introvert or would
you be more of an extrovert?

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.900
And this is a really important question so
I want us to get to the answer, get to the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.180
bottom of it before we move forward with the
talk.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.780
And so what I'm gonna ask you to do is to
break up into groups of six quickly and share

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.549
with your group a private and personal memory
from your childhood that you think illustrates

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.120
who you really are.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.829
And then we're gonna take the most private
and personal and profound of these memories

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.629
and share them with the entire audience.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.629
[laughter]

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.170
And yeah, that's right I'm just kidding.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.170
[laughter]

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.260
And if there are any consultants in the audience,
please don't do this to people in future talks,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.770
introverts hate this kind of stuff.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.770
[laughter]

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:04.769
So let me just though get a show of hands
how many of you were thinking, when you still

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.920
thought that I might be serious, like how
can I get out of here right now --

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920
[laughter]

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.920
without insulting the speaker?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.920
[laughter]

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.909
And how many of you would describe yourself
as introverts?

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.329
Wow, oh my gosh could it be a hundred percent?

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.329
No.

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.329
[laughter]

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.329
Any extroverts in the room?

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.329
[laughter]

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.329
Okay maybe.

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.329
I would say we have about five extroverts.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.290
So that's good because you can tell us your
perspective.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.290
[laughter]

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.989
So, of course also the important thing is
not only to identify who we are but why are

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.349
we the way we are?

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.409
What is it that makes an introvert an introvert
or an extrovert an extrovert?

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.280
And the truth is there are as many answers
to this question as there are personality

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280
psychologists.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.980
But boiling it down, what really distinguishes
us is that introverts prefer environments

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.779
that are lower stimulation environments.

00:03:54.779 --> 00:04:00.930
So I'm talking now about social stimulation
so by that I mean you'd rather maybe have

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.069
a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed
go to a thumping party full of strangers.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.859
But I'm not talking only about social stimulation
this also plays out in things like how much

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.340
noise you like to have on in the background,
how bright the lights are, how bright you

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.979
like your lights to be.

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.300
Even something as crazy as if I place a drop
of lemon juice on your tongue, if I could

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.180
do that right now, we would find that the
introverts in the room would salivate more

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.199
[laughs] in response to the lemon juice than
our five extroverts would, because introverts

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.060
respond more to stimulation and therefore
prefer lower amounts of it.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.400
And this is so important to understand because
what it tells us is that if we want to optimize

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.680
our lives and to be operating at our fullest
powers and with our fullest amount of energy,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.960
we really need to put ourselves in environments
that have the proper amount of stimulation

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.550
for us.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.030
And there's one interesting experiment by
the psychologist Russell Geen that has even

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.810
found that if you give introverts and extroverts
math problems to solve with different levels

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.460
of background noise, the introverts will do
better when the background noise is lower

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.150
and the extroverts will solve the problems
better when the background noise is higher.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.650
So we all have our different sweet spots and
then, of course, the question becomes most

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.270
of life is kind of a one size fits all environment:
our schools, our workplaces are like this.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.389
So how do you design things, how can we think
about ways to tailor the amount of stimulation

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.140
for individual preferences?

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:38.379
And the fuel that lead me to write this book,
to spend the last seven years doing it, is

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:44.550
that I have been distressed to see that our
world is primarily set up in a way that I

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.930
believe maximizes the energies of extroverts
while not those of introverts.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:58.169
I think the bias in our culture against introversion
it is so deep and it's so profound and we

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.580
internalize it from such an early age we don't
even realize that we're doing it.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.409
But from the minute that you're introduced
to a preschool classroom, when you were a

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:14.830
young child, you're immediately in an environment
where you're expected to be happy in a group.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.879
And teachers have been found, all the way
through at every age level of the educational

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.319
system, the vast majority of teachers believe,
thank you, oh much better.

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.680
The vast majority of teachers believe that
the ideal student is an extrovert.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.690
Even though, by the way, introverted kids
get better grades.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.090
And same thing is true at the work place,
in our work places, and you can tell me what

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.889
your experiences are at Google, I would to
hear about this when we get to the Q and A

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:41.889
later.

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.970
But, in general, in the work place, we now
live in an environment that it's increasingly

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.780
open plan offices where people don't have
very much privacy, they're working in groups

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.250
for a lot of the time.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.800
And studies tell us that introverts are routinely
passed over for leadership positions even

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.490
though research by Adam Grant from the Wharton
School, recent ground breaking research, has

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:08.949
found that introverted leaders often deliver
better outcomes than extroverts do.

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:14.940
And I say all this, when I say this is not
to take anything away from extroverts, I think

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:22.039
extroversion is a really enormously appealing
personality style, it's just to say that this

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.729
tendency, this kind of chauvinism that we
have, this two tier structure of how we view

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:34.710
personality leads to a colossal waste of talent
and of energy and of happiness and we need

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:41.800
to be adopting much more of a yin and yang
approach of balance between the two styles.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.990
And I wanna talk about how this plays out
in our lives and I wanna show you why it is

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.620
so important that we get to this place of
yin and yang and why we will all be the better

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.889
for it; introverts for sure, but all of us.

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:58.800
And to do this I'm gonna start in an unlikely
place.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.730
I'm gonna take you on a very quick tour of
the animal kingdom [chuckles] starting with

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.009
a colony of fruit flies.

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:14.780
So it turns out that there are introverts
and extroverts in almost every single species

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.780
of the animal kingdom.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.960
I mean, who knew this [chuckles] but I found
this out when I was doing my research.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.580
Many species have introverts and extroverts.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:27.800
So down to the level of fruit flies, there
are what biologists call sitter fruit flies

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.139
who kind of sit still and kind of hop up [chuckles]
and down in place.

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:36.900
And then there are rover fruit flies who explore
the outer margins of fruit fly society.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.900
[laughter]

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.610
And the reason that they do this, the reason
that many species are structured this way

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.010
is because the two types have very different
kinds of survival strategies.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.940
And so now I'm gonna move a little bit up
the animal kingdom and I'm gonna take you

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.690
to the world of pumpkinseed fish.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.200
An evolutionary biologist named David Sloan
Wilson did a really fascinating experiment

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:06.310
with a pond full of these fish where he came
to the pond and he dropped this gigantic trap

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.590
right into the middle of the pond, an event
which he says from the fishes perspective

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:15.690
must have seemed like a space ship landing
right in the middle of their backyard.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:21.670
And the fish responded really differently
to this foreign presence.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:27.730
Some of the fish, the introvert fish, responded
by saying, "I'm not getting anywhere near

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.290
that thing [chuckles]."

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.580
And they hovered on the sidelines of the pond
and as a result they made it completely impossible

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.070
for David Sloan Wilson to catch them in his
trap.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:44.370
So had that trap been a real predator those
fish, the introverted fish, would have been

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.900
the ones that survived.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.760
The extroverted fish immediately had to investigate
what this [chuckles] trap was and they went

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.880
swimming right up to it with no, with nothing
standing in their way and, of course, they

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.880
were immediately trapped.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.760
Had it been a real predator they would have
been zonked.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.310
But it's not so simple because then Sloan
Wilson comes back a few days later with a

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.510
fishing net and he manages to scoop up the
introverted fish who had eluded him the first

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.810
time around and he brings them back to his
lab.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:21.010
And what he finds in this environment is that
the extroverted fish do much better because

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:27.470
this is an alien world, it's a world of unfamiliarity
and extroverts tend to be more comfortable

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.590
very quickly in unfamiliar environments.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.590
And so in this case, the extroverted fish
started eating more quickly and going about

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.140
their business more quickly while the introverted
fish were kind of hanging back and not faring

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.560
well.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.520
So this is all kind of a parable [chuckles]
to tell us that there really are different

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:53.880
kinds of strategies for success and strategies
for the survival and thriving of our species.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.620
And so now I'm gonna come back to human beings
finally and I want first to talk to you about

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.030
children, about human children.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.730
Let me ask you, how many people in the audience
here have kids?

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.070
Okay, so probably about two-thirds of you.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.920
But even for those of you who don't have children,
the reason that what I'm gonna tell you is

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.670
important is that human children they haven't
yet absorbed the social norms of our society

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.860
and so therefore they act the way they are
really meant to act, the way they truly are.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.970
And so if we look at the behavior of children
we learn a lot about ourselves.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:33.700
So, of you parents, how many of you have ever
been to some kind of Mommy and me class or

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.140
a Daddy and me class?

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.140
[pause]

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.950
Okay, not many of you.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.950
So let me explain what this is 'cause it's
gonna be relevant.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:48.510
This is basically a class where a parent or
a babysitter takes a young child usually a

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.990
baby or a two year old, maybe a three year
old and you all sit around in a circle.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.950
I'm gonna show you what it looks like.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.950
Yeah --

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:55.950
[laughter]

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.580
it looks like this.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.280
You all sit around in a circle and you sing
songs and you play musical instruments and

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.290
like that.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:07.830
Now what you will find in these classes is
that some of the children will behave like

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:13.230
the sitter fish meaning they will stay closely
by their parents' sides, they'll sit in their

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:20.390
parents' laps, they won't really participate
and they will look either scared or just reserved.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.710
And then others of the children like that
[chuckles] little baby in the read jumpsuit

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.400
who's right in the middle of the room he's
a rover child.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.880
And so he doesn't know where his Mom is, it's
all good with him, he's perfectly comfortable.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.010
[pause]

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:40.540
Now the thing is that the parents of the sitter
children in this kind of a situation tend

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.040
to feel pretty worried about their offspring.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.330
They feel like, "Wow, my child's not getting
much out of this class and maybe this is gonna

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.220
be the story of his or her life.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.450
Maybe he or she will always have trouble participating
and won't get the fruits of what life has

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.020
to offer."

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.220
And this is a really understandable worry
but I want to broaden the picture for you

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.810
of what's really happening with a child who
behaves this way.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:13.130
That child is doing what psychologists call
paying alert attention to things.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.620
So it may appear as if the child is sitting
inertly and passively and not taking anything

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.580
in, but that's not what's happening.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.890
They're actually, they're learning by observing
and they're observing in a very intent way.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:31.130
And so very often with these children, I see
it again and again, it may take them minutes

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:37.191
or days or weeks or months to actually plunge
into the situation at hand, but when they

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:42.550
do they already know the social rules, they
already know the subtle nuances of what's

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:47.270
going on because they have been paying attention
all that time.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:53.110
And this form of paying attention to things,
of noticing things that are scary but noticing

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:58.770
things in general at a subtle level, this
carries through with these children all the

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.570
way into adulthood.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.760
It becomes a kind of way of dealing with the
world and a way of processing information.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:10.250
So, for example, if you give these children
when they're a little bit older this kind

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:15.730
of a puzzle to solve where you have two pictures
that seem to be very similar and you ask them

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.100
to figure out what the subtle differences
are between them, these kinds of children

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:25.170
will spend much more time than other children
will comparing the two.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.520
In the lab you can actually see their eyes
darting back and forth more times than those

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.850
of bolder children.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.950
And they more often get the right answers.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.230
And this kind of thing continues as these
kids grow up.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.230
So --

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.110
[pause]

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.370
you give them puzzles to solve, adult size
puzzles, they take more time to do it.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:51.200
They get better grades in school, they get,
they're more likely to get Phi Beta Kappa

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.480
keys.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.970
And then the other thing [chuckles] and I'm
sorry about this extroverts but introverts

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:01.370
have actually been found to know more [chuckles]
about many subjects.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:07.150
In one study of college freshman they tested
the students of their knowledge of, what was

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.360
it, 21 different subjects.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.830
It was like everything from art to astronomy
to physics to statistics and they found that

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.000
the introverts knew more about all of these
subjects.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.010
And what's relevant about this is that the
introverts are not smarter, as far as IQ goes

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.920
the two groups, introverts and extroverts,
totally similar IQ.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.380
So instead what's happening here, the advantage
that introverts have in these kinds of intellectual

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:38.810
problem solving puzzles is the very behavioral
style for which introverts often criticized,

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:43.860
the very behavioral style that has you sitting
still more, reflecting more, being more reserved,

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.290
being more just slow to process stuff, that
is the flip side of the behavioral style that

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.800
helps you in problem solving.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:59.390
Now another way in which these kinds of children
grow up to play really important [chuckles]

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:06.760
roles in our culture is introverts and extroverts
have very different attitudes to risk taking,

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.990
profoundly different attitudes.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:14.820
Extroverts are much more likely, when they
see something that they want, to go for it.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.180
And this actually goes down to the level of
neurochemistry.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:23.560
Extroverts have been found to have more active
reward networks in their brain so that if

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.710
they see something that they want or if they're
contemplating a promotion or whatever it is

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.820
literally their reward networks become more
activated and they get excited and this is

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.000
accompanied by all kinds of joyful and fizzy
emotions.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.700
And it's actually these emotions, I think,
that make extroverts such delightful company.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:46.110
They're kind of like champagne bubble emotions
that come with the contemplation of a reward.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.360
And this can be a really great thing because
it helps us to seize the day when we have

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.570
these kinds of feelings.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:58.230
But the downside to this way of being, is
that when you're that focused on a reward

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:03.051
you don't see the warning signals that are
also coming at you saying, "Hum. maybe you

00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:04.051
should stop.

00:17:04.051 --> 00:17:05.051
Maybe there's a problem here."

00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:08.049
I mean you literally don't see them as much.

00:17:08.049 --> 00:17:11.240
And introverts are much less likely to fall
prey to that dynamic.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.220
I mean they sometimes do, this stuff is not
black and white, but they're less likely to

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.049
fall prey to it.

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:21.049
And so this is not to say that introverts
don't also take risks 'cause they do.

00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:25.730
But they tend to be more slow and more circumspect
about it.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:31.940
One study of a group of traders at a London
investment bank found that the introverts

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:37.909
were the most successful traders, probably
because of this way of processing information.

00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:43.059
And another example of this would be somebody
like a Warren Buffett who is a self described

00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:49.330
introvert and is famous for sitting out on
market bubbles that other people fell prey

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.759
to 'cause he is the type of person, he's actually
said that the key to investing for him is

00:17:53.759 --> 00:17:55.720
not his knowledge but his temperament.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.240
So he pays attention to warning signals and
he sees them when they're coming.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:06.879
Okay, there are actually so many advantages
that I want to talk to you about but I'm gonna

00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:10.960
run outta time so I'm just gonna tell you
about one more for now and we can talk more

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.980
in the Q and A as well.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.129
I wanna talk to you about creativity.

00:18:18.129 --> 00:18:19.129
So –

00:18:19.129 --> 00:18:20.570
[pause]

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:26.480
two important studies by, one by the psychologist
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and another by Gregory

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.970
Feist have found that the most spectacularly
creative people in a number of fields have

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.370
tended to be introverts.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.210
And they're not just any introverts these
are introverts who have extroverted sides

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.850
to them as well.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.629
They're people who can go out and they can
exchange ideas and they can advance ideas

00:18:43.629 --> 00:18:44.669
and so on.

00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:48.570
But they're also people who are comfortable
with solitude.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:56.519
And that is the key component because solitude
turns out to be a real catalyst to creativity.

00:18:56.519 --> 00:19:02.070
Not the be all and end all it's not the, it's
a necessary but not sufficient condition,

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.700
but it is necessary.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.899
And the reason for this is, it turns out we're
such social creatures all of us [chuckles]

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:13.740
introverts included, we're such social creatures
that we can't literally be around a group

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:19.330
of people without being, without instinctively
mimicking the opinions of the people in the

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.610
group.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:25.940
So even something as seemingly primal and
personal and visceral as who you're attracted

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:31.039
to, you will actually, if you're in a group
of people who have declared so and so to be

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:34.400
attractive, you will start finding so and
so more attractive than you otherwise would

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.580
have.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.210
And this is just a kind of fundamental tenet
of human nature.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:44.580
And so if you want to go and find out what
you really think about things you almost can't

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.100
do it without secluding yourself to some degree.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:55.330
But I wanna be really clear about what I'm
saying here and what I'm not saying.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.340
So when I say this I'm not trying to argue
that [chuckles] man is an island after all,

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.040
to contradict John Donne.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.740
We're human beings, we love and we need each
other.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.820
And I'm also not trying to say that we should
be abolishing group work and abolishing team

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.820
work.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:17.409
I think it's clear that we need that part
of the creative puzzle as well.

00:20:17.409 --> 00:20:21.580
And that this is probably increasingly true
everyday because as the problems that we face

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.480
grow more complex we're going to need more
and more and more than we've ever done before

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.980
to really stand on each other's shoulders.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:36.360
But what I am saying is that there are two
kind of contradictory drives in human nature

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.420
and one of these drives is the drive that
makes us come together.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.400
It's the drive that makes us love each other
and need other and trust each other.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:51.429
And then another of these drives is the drive
for solitude and for autonomy and for independence.

00:20:51.429 --> 00:20:53.710
Excuse me.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.850
[pause]

00:20:54.850 --> 00:21:00.240
And introverts have that latter drive particularly
strongly but this is a drive that we all share.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.909
And so if we're going to, we need to figure
out ways of harnessing both of these drives

00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:09.010
as productively as we can.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:14.600
And so I'm just gonna call for three different
kind of takeaways for us to think about and

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.929
I'm talking now at the kind of big picture
level and then at the Q and A you can ask

00:21:18.929 --> 00:21:22.480
me questions that are more specific about
your lives, your work lives or your personal

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.460
lives or whatever.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.779
So the first takeaway I'd like to share with
you is just to give yourself more time for

00:21:29.779 --> 00:21:34.850
quiet, more time for solitude, more time to
just get away, to feel truly entitled to it

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.920
instead of feeling like it's something that
you need to feel guilty about.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:44.389
The second one is to think really differently
about the next generation of introverted children

00:21:44.389 --> 00:21:50.090
because the same children who have been sitting
on their parents' laps when they're two or

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:56.150
three years old and then grow into teenagers
who develop solitary interests that they love

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:02.299
to pursue whether it's in spider taxonomy
or for 19th century art, or whatever it happens

00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:07.190
to be these children often are the great artists
and writers and thinkers of tomorrow or they're

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.499
just really fantastic human beings.

00:22:09.499 --> 00:22:13.799
And so we need to stop treating them as if
there's something wrong with them and instead

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:18.760
appreciate and take delight in what is right
about them.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.519
And then the final thing that I would say
to you is for all of you to really think hard

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:35.510
about what is the key to your own power.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:45.519
and from fairy tales that there are many kinds
of different powers that are on offer in this

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:46.519
world.

00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:52.190
And some of us are given lightsabers like
Luke Skywalker, and we get to swashbuckle

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.409
our way through the galaxies.

00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:58.460
And some people are given scholars' education,
I am sorry wizard's educations.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:03.850
But then there are some people where the power
that is given to them is a key to a secret

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.129
garden that is full of inner riches.

00:23:07.129 --> 00:23:12.390
And the trick to living well, the trick to
living well is to use the power that has been

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:16.740
granted to you instead of trying to make do
with all the different powers that are on

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.740
offer.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.050
What is the power that has been given to you?

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.039
And so that is what I wanna say to you in
closing.

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:26.690
May you all use your powers well and brilliantly.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.220
Thank you very much.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.490
[applause]

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.760
[pause]

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:43.460
&gt;&gt;male #1: We have questions of course.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.460
[laughter]

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.460
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Okay I know there are questions.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.460
[laughter]

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.460
So -- you can ask me anything, any topic.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.580
It's all good.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.515
&gt;&gt;Alana Weiss: And I'll kick it off by --
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: You're gonna start

00:23:50.515 --> 00:23:51.515
&gt;&gt;Alana Weiss: by a reading a –
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Okay.

00:23:51.515 --> 00:23:54.259
&gt;&gt;Alana Weiss: question that came from Lynn
who's a Googler based in Chicago.

00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:55.259
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Okay.

00:23:55.259 --> 00:24:00.480
&gt;&gt;Alana Weiss: And she wanted to know what
you thought of the cover of Time Magazine.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.669
She writes, "As soon as I saw the cover, I
immediately became alarmed by how inaccurate

00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:06.889
Time could have been with its choice.

00:24:06.889 --> 00:24:09.399
The cover says, 'The Power of Shyness.'

00:24:09.399 --> 00:24:13.450
This is ironic since Susan Cain who's book
this Time article is based on wrote an article

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:18.929
titled, 'Don't Call Introverted Children Shy'
published by Time online at the same time.

00:24:18.929 --> 00:24:25.899
I believe this cover was widely read and it
is a respectable magazine."

00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:32.249
And she is concerned about this doing disservice
to children by reinforcing a misconception.

00:24:32.249 --> 00:24:37.309
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah, so thank you that's an
important question.

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:42.370
So yeah, Time Magazine did have this cover
story about a week or two ago that was based

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:50.500
on the research from my book and they called
it, "The Power of Shyness."

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.860
Shyness has nothing, well that's not true,
shyness is very different from introversion.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.149
So what shyness is, is it's the fear of social
judgment.

00:24:58.149 --> 00:25:02.580
It's the fear of being socially humiliated,
whereas introversion is just what I was talking

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.159
about before, the preference for lower stimulation
environments.

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:11.289
And, in practice, these two do overlap to
some degree so there are some people who are

00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:13.841
both shy and introverted.

00:25:13.841 --> 00:25:21.080
But psychologists debate to what degree they
overlap and so it muddies the waters to act

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.559
as if they're synonymous.

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:29.580
But it's also a tricky thing because at the
same time that I say all this there's sometimes

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:35.419
a tendency nowadays more and more people are
talking about the value of introversion and

00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:39.519
in doing this I think there's sometimes a
tendency to demonize shyness and I don't wanna

00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:40.669
do that either.

00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:45.760
Because really the under, shyness itself doesn't
have that much to recommend it.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.570
It's a painful emotion.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:52.960
But the underlying temperament, the careful
and sensitive temperament that tends to produce

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.720
people who are either shy or introverted,
that temperament has a lot of value to it.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.539
And these things all get kind of thrown together
into one soup.

00:26:02.539 --> 00:26:03.669
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hi, thank you --

00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:04.669
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yes, hi.

00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:05.700
&gt;&gt;male #2: for your talk.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.700
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Sure.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.749
&gt;&gt;male #2: One of the things that I've been
struggling with or at least listening to all

00:26:09.749 --> 00:26:14.100
of this is that I always struggled that I
didn't find myself as extroverted or introverted.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.100
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.679
&gt;&gt;male #2: And I've taken the Myers-Briggs
five times, six times, numerous times --

00:26:18.679 --> 00:26:19.679
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [laughs]

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:20.679
[laughter]

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:23.850
&gt;&gt;male #2: and extroverts will tell me, "Oh
you're definitely introverted" and then introverts

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:24.980
will tell me, "Oh you're definitely extroverted."

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.980
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Right, right.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.470
&gt;&gt;male #2: Even in your talk, like there's
certain elements that you'll tell about that

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.940
like when I was a child like I know I was
that way --

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.940
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.200
&gt;&gt;male #2: but then there's other things that
are like, oh no, I've definitely introverted

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200
so --

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.889
&gt;&gt;male #2: and then you have these key takeaways
where it's like I gotta find my inner self

00:26:37.889 --> 00:26:38.889
--

00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:39.889
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Um-hum.

00:26:39.889 --> 00:26:40.889
&gt;&gt;male #2: or like whatever gift has been
given to me.

00:26:40.889 --> 00:26:41.889
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [chuckles] Right.

00:26:41.889 --> 00:26:43.580
&gt;&gt;male #2: Well it's very unclear to like
what I'm supposed to be emphasizing and --

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.580
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [laughs]

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.889
&gt;&gt;male #2: no one's ever been able to tell
me otherwise --

00:26:45.889 --> 00:26:46.889
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [laughs] Uh-huh.

00:26:46.889 --> 00:26:49.309
&gt;&gt;male #2: so I'm interested to hear, I mean
am I like a mutant case or --

00:26:49.309 --> 00:26:50.309
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [laughs]

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:51.309
&gt;&gt;male #2: like --

00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:52.309
[laughter]

00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:53.309
or like is it, 'cause I know it's a gradient
and I know --

00:26:53.309 --> 00:26:54.309
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:26:54.309 --> 00:26:55.510
&gt;&gt;male #2: I know there's a lot of ambiguity
around it, but I'd love to hear your thoughts

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.510
on that.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.510
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.970
There's actually a word for people like you.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.840
You're not a mutant you're an ambivert.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.179
And that is the word for people who fall kind
of right of the middle of the introvert/extrovert

00:27:07.179 --> 00:27:08.499
spectrum.

00:27:08.499 --> 00:27:13.600
And I often think that people who are ambiverts
have the best of both worlds because I think

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.119
each of these personality styles has real
gifts and people like you can, I think, choose

00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:22.950
more easily which style you want to adapt
at any given moment.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:28.129
But I will say, too, even for people who really
feel like you're on one side of the spectrum

00:27:28.129 --> 00:27:35.320
or the other we're still gloriously mish-moshed
creatures, all of us.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.659
So we all have a little bit of the other side
in us.

00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:45.309
It's kind of like if I were standing up here
trying to give a talk on what maleness is

00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:46.919
and what femaleness is.

00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:51.640
I could get it mostly right but I wouldn't
be able to get it right for any one human

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.360
being, and I wouldn't be able to get it right
even for the group in general because it's

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.779
a little bit too complex.

00:27:56.779 --> 00:28:00.279
And yet it's useful to talk about these categories
'cause it does illuminate something.

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:01.679
So –
your question.

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:04.009
&gt;&gt;male #2: Yeah, thank you.

00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:05.009
[pause]

00:28:05.009 --> 00:28:06.009
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Hi.

00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:07.269
&gt;&gt;male #3: Hello.

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:12.009
So I've read a little bit about just kind
of different temperaments like the Please

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:13.299
Understand Me books --

00:28:13.299 --> 00:28:14.299
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Um-hum.

00:28:14.299 --> 00:28:19.700
&gt;&gt;male #3: Keirsey I think it is I'm not sure
but I'm wondering how your definition of introversion

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:25.320
and extroversion relates to these other aspects
of temperament like introspective and things

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.320
like that.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.549
Like how do these, how do they interact with
each other?

00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:35.140
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah, it's all very complicated
[chuckles] what this stuff is exactly.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:40.220
But I would say the definition that I'm using,
like in this talk, is it's pretty similar

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.082
to what you would find in those books.

00:28:42.082 --> 00:28:46.260
And another way of looking at it is to ask
yourself the kind of famous question you've

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:51.020
probably most of you heard, "How do I feel
after I've been out and about in company?

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:57.249
Do I feel energized and like I want more of
it or do I feel oh I'm really depleted I've

00:28:57.249 --> 00:28:59.840
gotta go home and just take a break?"

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.980
And the people in the latter category tend
to be more on the introverted side and useful

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.450
to know it 'cause then you can build in the
breaks you need.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.470
Which is something I have been doing on my
book tour.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:09.470
&gt;&gt;male #3: Thanks.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.470
I guess --

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:11.470
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Sure.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.370
&gt;&gt;male #3: I was just asking 'cause it seems
like a lot of the qualities of introverts

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:18.440
that you described are sort of these introspective
qualities sort of observing or taking in the

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.720
world around them.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.509
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Right, right.

00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:24.659
And I'm sorry and your question about that
is?

00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:26.009
&gt;&gt;male #3: [unintelligible]

00:29:26.009 --> 00:29:27.809
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Okay. [laughs]

00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:32.179
Yeah, yeah I would say that is very much part
of the way I've defining introversion.

00:29:32.179 --> 00:29:33.179
Yes.

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:34.179
Hi.

00:29:34.179 --> 00:29:35.929
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hi.

00:29:35.929 --> 00:29:38.159
It's somewhat related to the last question.

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:41.580
So you have a, your definition about seeking
lower stimulation environments --

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.600
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Um-hum.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:50.950
&gt;&gt;male #4: which most of the other qualities
[ inaudible ] fall out of, but another difference

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.551
I believe is extroverts talk all the time
--

00:29:53.551 --> 00:29:54.551
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Um-hum.

00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:56.149
&gt;&gt;male #4: and introverts wait 'til they have
something to say.

00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:57.149
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:58.149
&gt;&gt;male #4: And that doesn't really --

00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:59.149
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Absolutely.

00:29:59.149 --> 00:30:00.960
&gt;&gt;male #4: seem to follow from the previous
definition.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.080
How does that, how is that, does that fall
out of it?

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.530
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Well you mean what does that
have to do with stimulation.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.820
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yeah.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:15.820
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah, well it really, actually
if you think about it, talking and interacting

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.880
is kind of the highest form of stimulation
that there is.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:24.009
If you think about a, like a simple conversation
with your best friend there's an enormous

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:26.440
amount of stuff going on with it.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.590
You're reading body language, you're reading
facial expressions, you're thinking about

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.350
what you wanna say, you're reacting to what
they said.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:37.269
And so this is something that extroverts tend
to plunge into with a little more ease.

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:41.700
&gt;&gt;male #4: Right, but they will keep talking
with no response at all.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.700
[laughter]

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.710
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [laughs]

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:46.710
And --

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.879
&gt;&gt;male #4: So it's not working, they're not
getting stimulation from that so it's -

00:30:49.879 --> 00:30:52.030
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Oh, well I don't if I would
say that.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.200
Well, first of all I don't know that all extroverts
do that.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.200
&gt;&gt;male #4: Right.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.059
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: But to the extent that that's
happening, the active talking itself is a

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.059
form of --

00:31:02.059 --> 00:31:03.059
&gt;&gt;male #4: Alright.

00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:04.150
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: of real activity and of stimulation.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.409
&gt;&gt;male #4: Okay.

00:31:05.409 --> 00:31:06.679
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:31:06.679 --> 00:31:07.679
Hi.

00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:08.779
&gt;&gt;male #5: Hi Susan.

00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:09.779
Thank you for coming.

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:10.779
So --

00:31:10.779 --> 00:31:11.779
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: You're welcome.

00:31:11.779 --> 00:31:12.779
&gt;&gt;male #5: so I'm pretty junior in my career.

00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:18.500
I feel like many times I heard like from career
advices is that you should build your network

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.500
--

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.500
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.500
&gt;&gt;male #5: you should meet a lot of people;
you should know a lot of people --

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.500
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.029
&gt;&gt;male #5: I feel like obviously extroverts
has a leg up on introverts on this.

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:27.450
So what are your thoughts about that?

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:32.460
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah, I think that the key to
these kinds of exhortations is to find ways

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.910
to do it that really are natural to you.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.110
And that sounds ahh, that sounds sort of fluffy.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.720
But it actually really can be done.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:45.160
So for example, if you're going to a networking
event, I always approach any networking event

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.740
as a series of one-on-one conversations.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:55.200
And not only that I consider it to be a success
if I have made one honest to God new, authentic

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.119
relationship with one person who's company
I sincerely enjoyed and look forward to staying

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:00.519
in touch with.

00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:06.090
Because honestly how many people can you stay
in touch with in a real way after any given

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.090
event?

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:12.230
And if you use that test and you go to enough
events you will find pretty soon that you've

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:17.029
got a Rolodex of people where you really wanna
help them and they really wanna help you.

00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:21.129
So that's just one example but I think there
are ways to reframe almost all of the things

00:32:21.129 --> 00:32:26.009
that we need to do in the workplace in ways
that suit our natural strengths.

00:32:26.009 --> 00:32:31.529
And then I would say in addition to that sometimes
you really do have to kind of go out of, push

00:32:31.529 --> 00:32:34.859
yourself outside of your natural temperament.

00:32:34.859 --> 00:32:37.120
And extroverts need to do this, too.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.710
An extrovert might need to sit down and work
on a memo for five hours when they might prefer

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.320
to be chatting with colleagues in the hallway.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.499
So I think it's natural and good and healthy
to be able to stretch ourselves to some extent,

00:32:49.499 --> 00:32:53.909
but just to make sure that we're not living
in that place that's not really who we are

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:55.610
most of the time.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.610
Sure.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.610
[pause]

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:58.610
Hi.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:03.700
&gt;&gt;male #6: Unlike a lot of the people here,
I'm an extrovert married to an introvert --

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.700
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:10.639
&gt;&gt;male #6: and I'm also interested, so I'm
A interested in learning how to better work

00:33:10.639 --> 00:33:12.870
as an extrovert, deal with introverts --

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:13.870
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Right.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:14.870
&gt;&gt;male #6: and also --

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:15.870
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [laughs]

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:21.620
&gt;&gt;male #6: also I'd welcome any advice what
extroverts can learn from some of the advantages

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:26.419
that introverts have that may not have come
as natural to us but that we may want to work

00:33:26.419 --> 00:33:27.419
on.

00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:28.970
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Right, right.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.649
Would you like me to speak first about --

00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:31.649
&gt;&gt;male #6: Either, either

00:33:31.649 --> 00:33:32.649
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: the marital.

00:33:32.649 --> 00:33:33.649
Yeah.

00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:34.649
[laughs]

00:33:34.649 --> 00:33:38.779
So this is actually a pretty common question
because I don't know, the studies say that

00:33:38.779 --> 00:33:43.909
it's half of marriages that are introvert/extrovert
and that the other half people are married

00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:45.539
to those of a like type.

00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:50.960
But I can tell you in my anecdotal experience
it seems like most couplings that I've seen

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.320
are yin and yang couplings where it's one
introvert and one extrovert.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:00.539
And I think is because there really is a natural
and mutual attraction between the two types.

00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:04.690
And this has been found by the way int he
workplace, too, that teams that are composed

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:10.950
of a mix of introverts and extroverts that
these teams actually, they're more effective

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:13.480
because people are happier in that kind of
a setting.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:18.990
But having said that there are certain conflicts
that arise and I can tell you about two or

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:21.360
three of the main ones that come up.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.200
So one of them is the question of how much
to socialize.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.820
It might be that your partner wants to stay
home all the time and you wanna be going out

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:37.200
all the time and so the key is to really have
a sense of understanding where each person's

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.200
coming from.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.500
And I always say pre-negotiate these things
so that you don't have to negotiate it every

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.419
single Friday and Saturday night.

00:34:43.419 --> 00:34:47.010
Just agree in advance, "Okay we're going out
one night every weekend, we're snuggling on

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.340
the sofa the other night.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:52.720
That's it, we don't have to talk about it
anymore."

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.210
Another thing that comes up, that's relevant
to both marriages and workplace situations,

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:04.510
with the two types is they actually have really
different approaches to solving conflict.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:11.140
So in general, there's some exceptions to
this, but in general introverts prefer a much

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:16.880
more mild mannered approach to conflict and
might prefer to avoid it altogether.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.580
And extroverts tends to approach conflict
in a more confrontive style it's called.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:26.430
So I don't know if you've seen this in your
situation, but that can lead to real misunderstandings

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:32.510
'cause it can make the introverted person
in the relationship feel kind of aggressed

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:37.640
against if their partner or their colleague
brings up an issue too directly.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:43.440
But the extrovert can feel lonely and abandoned
if the introvert doesn't want to address an

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.440
issue.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.780
Like the extrovert might feel like they don't
really care that much or they're not that

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.700
engaged with me or else they would take the
trouble to [chuckles] just hammer this thing

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.700
out.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:57.860
So with all this stuff really understanding
where it's coming from can go a long way.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:03.210
&gt;&gt;male #6: And if you have any comments for
extroverts trying to learn from introverts

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.210
--

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.210
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Oh yes, yes, yes.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:10.710
Yeah so a big one that I would say is to learn
from introverts' tendency to think carefully

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.710
about things.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:16.490
I was talking before about the tendency of
extroverts to sometimes get so carried away

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:21.620
with positive emotions and with wanting to
go after a goal that you might not take the

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.390
time to slow down and see what's really happening.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:31.650
And, in fact, if you do slow down, if you
put in place certain mechanisms that will

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:39.480
say stop before you act you will be able to
see the warning signals that get in your way.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.960
It's the moving and the action that prevents
you from actually seeing those warning signals.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:49.790
And then another thing I would say extroverts
can learn from introverts is just to kind

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:54.520
of sit down and be still [chuckles] and see
what you can get from solitude and from just

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.980
thinking and being and not moving all the
time.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.100
&gt;&gt;male #6: Thank you.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.210
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: You're welcome.

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.210
[pause]

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:01.210
Hi.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.210
&gt;&gt;male #7: Hi.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.210
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Hi.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.210
&gt;&gt;male #7: I keep thinkin' about your fruit
flies --

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.210
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.761
&gt;&gt;male #7: that stay in one spot, introverts
stay in one spot and then you have the extrovert

00:37:07.761 --> 00:37:09.380
fruit flies that kind of roam the world.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.430
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:14.130
&gt;&gt;male #7: And so extroverts are kind of more
roamers and introverts kind of stay in the

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.770
same place or at least their more familiar
in the same area.

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:20.440
What does that say about, what studies have
been done about extroverts and introverts

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:25.750
in relationships as far as like faithfulness
or, or whether they roam--

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:26.750
[laughter]

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:30.370
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [laughs] Oh, Aha.

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:34.040
Actually, extroverts have been found to be
a little less faithful.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:39.850
It kind of goes into the overall profile of
risk taking we were talking about before.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:46.300
They've actually been found to get into car
accidents, to place larger financial bets,

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:52.550
to be somewhat less faithful in relationships,
I'm sorry, but that doesn't mean it's always

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:53.550
true.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.550
These are just --

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:57.150
&gt;&gt;male #7: I'm only partially an extrovert,
by the way.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.150
[laughter]

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.420
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.720
Some of these things have small affect, but
there are differences between the two groups.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.070
&gt;&gt;male #7: Okay, thanks.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.080
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Sure.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.080
[pause]

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:11.050
&gt;&gt;female #1: I just wanted to say you had
a pretty compelling talk to get me up to a

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.050
microphone.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.380
It only happens like once or twice a year
--

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.520
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Oh, thank you.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520
Thank you for being here.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.710
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah, so I just really appreciate
your book and also I wanted to ask you about

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:23.510
how introverts can get more visibility at
work because on my team there are people who

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.250
are shameless self-promoters who are always
saying, "Look I launched this thing --

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:27.250
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.780
&gt;&gt;female #1: and I'm just like, "Oh I could
never do that."

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.680
I kind of look at them with admiration and
then a little bit of irritation because it's

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.940
something I can't quite do myself --

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.330
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Right, right.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.710
Can you figure out what is the, what's the
essence of what's keeping you from doing it?

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:45.000
Is it that you don't really approve of it
or that you want to but you can't?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.440
&gt;&gt;female #1: It just seems too, I don't know
just self-promotion is really difficult for

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.810
me.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.960
It's being very verbal about what you've done
well.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.440
I guess it's kind of just saying that you've
done a better job than other people maybe

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.530
or I don't know.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.610
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Right, right.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:03.080
I mean so that's one, I don't if you guys
all heard that but that's one thing right

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080
there.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.600
If you view self-promotion as being an announcement
of superiority over your peers that could

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.150
be pretty inhibiting.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.520
So that's one thing I would just suggest reframing.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.550
It's not really that, it's more just talking
about what you personally have done and don't

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.420
think about it in relative terms.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.480
But I would also say, with all these things,
is to try to find ways of doing it that are

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.570
comfortable for you because if you try to
ape somebody else it's never gonna happen.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:33.400
You might push yourself to do it once or twice
but you won't keep doing it.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:40.340
So might it work for you to call, to ask your
boss, for example, for a meeting one on one

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.040
where you just talk about your career and
you kind of go over the things that you think

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.600
you've been doing well and where you might
wanna be in the future?

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.360
And maybe come to that meeting with a list,
a memo that you've prepared in advance that

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.660
lists the ways you've contributed.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.540
Like I wonder if something like that would
be more --

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.540
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah --

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.540
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: comfortable for you.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.540
&gt;&gt;female #1: sounds very appealing --

00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.540
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Does it?

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.540
&gt;&gt;female #1: [unintelligible]

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.540
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.540
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.540
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: You're welcome.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.540
Hello again.

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.500
&gt;&gt;male #8: So do extroverts have more fun?

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.040
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [laughs]

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040
[laughter]

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.100
Oh, yeah, well.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.021
So this is something I talk about this a lot
on my blog.

00:40:13.021 --> 00:40:18.260
I have a blog it's called, The Power of Introverts
dot com and I talk about this 'cause it comes

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.110
up in the research a lot.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:25.910
The idea that extroverts might be happier
than introverts because it does seem that

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:31.180
in general extroverts have more of the, they're
very exuberant, very fizzy emotions that I

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:35.920
was talking about that kind of accompany the
pursuit of reward.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.720
But being a pretty happy introvert myself,
I'm always motivated to think that must not

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.220
be the full picture.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:49.060
So yeah, what I think is that there are a
lot of different ways of having fun and that

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:53.710
many of the ways that introverts tend to have
fun, they're not necessarily defined that

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:58.660
way and they're accompanied by a different
constellation of emotions from the one that

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.830
we normally associate with fun.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:04.710
So it's not like jump for joy, huge grin on
your face.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.590
It's something else, it's something quieter.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:13.960
And I've even started to explore this state
that I call the happiness of melancholy which

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:22.150
is, why is it that things like minor key music,
I love minor key music it always makes me

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.740
happy to listen to it, why, why does it make
me happy?

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.100
Why does the evanescence of a cherry blossom
make us so happy when we know it's gonna wither

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.960
and disappear a week from the day that we're
viewing it?

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.570
Why does that make us happy that, it's like
the fact of it's imminent disappearance is

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.040
somehow elevating.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.120
And I think, I'm trying to figure out what
it is, I think it has something to do with

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:50.760
these kinds of states make us acutely aware
of the fragile beauty of life and of love

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:55.830
and that that's a form of a happiness in and
of itself that is not necessarily captured

00:41:55.830 --> 00:42:00.620
in the view of fun and of happiness that we
tend to think of in our culture.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:04.910
So that may be a more philosophical [chuckles]
answer than what you were hoping for, but

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.160
those are my thoughts for today.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.160
Yes.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.620
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hi, I work on a team where I'm
the introvert who is supposed to lead --

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.620
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: [laughs] Uh-huh.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.990
&gt;&gt;female #2: and I have a super-extroverted
member.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:20.090
And very strong, very strong team.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:26.020
But how do I, if I take a long time to talk
as you can see I'm doing right now --

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.050
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:31.000
&gt;&gt;female #2: and I have a colleague who can
fill that space very easily.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Right.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.221
&gt;&gt;female #2: Are there strategies for me to
honor that person's voice yet still be part

00:42:39.221 --> 00:42:40.221
of the conversation?

00:42:40.221 --> 00:42:41.221
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: But still be part of the conversation?

00:42:41.221 --> 00:42:46.050
Yeah, I mean does, are you at all comfortable
ever interrupting or does interrupting feel

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.570
to you like you're breaking a sacred trust?

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:52.650
'Cause I mean I think that is something a
lot of people feel.

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:54.940
&gt;&gt;female #2: I think that I, yeah, I think
it's challenging, yeah.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.010
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:02.530
So one thing would be to understand that to
interrupt is actually not a terrible violation

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.740
especially if the other person is talkin'
a lot.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.480
But --

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.210
[laughter]

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:13.890
and it might be helpful for you to interrupt
using your hands like to say, "Oh that's a

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:15.680
great point, what about this?"

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.410
And kind of signal that, physically that you're
now taking the space.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:22.820
I'm trying to think of other ideas for you.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:23.990
[pause]

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:30.280
Another thing, do you have the kind of relationship
where you can actually talk about this, you

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280
and your colleague?

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.550
&gt;&gt;female #2: That, that sounds like a good
idea.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:33.550
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: More comfortable?

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:34.550
&gt;&gt;female #2: [laughs]

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:35.550
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.550
&gt;&gt;female #2: Okay.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:37.550
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: Okay.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:38.550
&gt;&gt;female #2: Thanks.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:39.550
&gt;&gt;Susan Cain: You're welcome.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:40.550
And I thank you so much.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:42.450
You were a really wonderful audience and it
was an honor to be here with you.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:43.450
Thank you.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:43.451
[applause]
