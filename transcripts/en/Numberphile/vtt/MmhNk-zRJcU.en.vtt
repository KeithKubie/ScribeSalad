00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.019
ROGER BOWLEY: I think numbers
don't just percolate through

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.530
mathematics and physics and
chemistry and the sciences,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.650
but they're in everything
around us.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.610
So poetry is an extreme form of
word play in which numbers

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.330
dictate form and structure which
give more beauty to it.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.504
The number is 14.

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:28.510
14 because I want to recite to
you, Brady, a love sonnet

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.560
which has 14 lines.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.704
These 14 lines are structured
to come in groups of four,

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:36.680
four, four and two.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.780
And they actually have to go
all the way through in a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.330
particular structure using
what are called iambic

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.810
pentameters which means that
they go dah-dah dah-dah

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.630
dah-dah dah-dah dah-dah
in each line.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.350
So there's a rhythm of 10 in
each line, which imposes an

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.980
enormous constraint on a poet
trying to fit these da-dah

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.340
dah-dah dah-dahs into this rigid
structure of 14 lines.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.840
So the one I want to talk about
is "Sonnet 18." "Shall I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.250
compare thee to a
summer's day?

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.270
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.510
Rough winds do shake the
darling buds of May.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.200
And summer's lease hath
all too short a date.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.400
Sometime too hot the eye of
heaven shines and often is his

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.060
gold complexion dimm'd; and
every fair from fair sometime

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.550
declines, by chance or nature's

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.980
changing course untrimmed.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.270
But they eternal summer shall
not fade nor lose position of

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.070
that fair thou ow'st. Nor
shall Death brag thou

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.830
wander'st in his shade when in
eternal lines to time thou

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.550
grow'st; so long as men can
breathe or eyes can see, so

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.080
long lives this and this
gives life to thee."

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.700
Shakespeare wrote these poems
in the form of a sonnet.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.130
It's called a Shakespearean
sonnet.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.270
And they were love poems to--

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.020
well, I think it was written
either for his patron so that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.650
they could pass it to their
girlfriends, or to his

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.710
boyfriends.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.650
Who knows?

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.120
The numbers were this
beat of iambic

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.800
pentameters, 10 syllables.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.000
And at the end, you
have a rhyme.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.520
So in the first line, you have
"Shall I compare thee to a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.600
summer's day thou art more
lovely and more temperate."

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.600
May, date which rhymes
with temperate.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.170
Shines, dimmed, declines,
untrimmed, fade, ow'st, shade,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.650
grow'st, see, thee.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.140
So the last two lines don't
rhyme every other one.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.520
They have to rhyme
with each other.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.300
So this is a summary and a
sudden emphasis through the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.660
rhythm and through the
words of the whole

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.970
meaning of the poem.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.190
It's rigidly structured to have
these rhymes all the way

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.550
through it, to have these beats
running all the way

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.815
through it.

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:01.340
BRADY HARAN: Are the numbers
purely adding straight jacket

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.390
to constrain the poet or are the
numbers helping the poet

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.840
to add beauty?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.930
ROGER BOWLEY: That's a deep
question which you just

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.660
thought up.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.830
And I have no idea which way.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.760
Which comes first, the
chicken or the egg?

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.490
I think Shakespeare was so
fluent in all aspects of word

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.220
play that he could turn
his hand to anything.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.330
And it was almost as though he
took the old [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.480
version of sonnets, turned it
slightly differently, and

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.020
showed he could write 150-odd
of these things at will,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.970
knocking off 10 at a time,
because he was so fluent.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.390
And I don't think the
numbers were a

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.110
constraint to him at all.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.280
But to any other poet, modern
poets, they would find it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.860
incredibly difficult.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.250
Shakespeare had an enormous
vocabulary, much bigger than

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.240
scholarly people
of these days.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.660
It was as though he had words
from all sorts of

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.040
language mixed in.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.540
Now, how somebody from Stratford
could have such a

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.930
vocabulary is beyond me.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.810
And it's because of that that
he found such fluency.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.760
We got married in
'72 August 12.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.020
And that's the photo a year
later, and we were in

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.500
Stratford on Avon on a
beautiful sunny day.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.020
And my wife was wearing
a flowery dress.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.590
And she looked absolutely
beautiful in front of this

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.030
cottage which was Anne
Hathaway's cottage,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.510
Shakespeare's wife.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.519
Now don't think that
Shakespeare wrote

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.630
sonnets for his wife.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.600
It's not that sort of romantic
liaison they had.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.670
It was more--

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.160
well, he left her for example.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.650
And I've never left my wife
for any length of time.
