00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:10.225
Take a moment to think
about the US Constitution.

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.560
What's the first thing that comes to mind?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.741
Freedom of speech?

00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.836
Protection from illegal searches?

00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:18.030
The right to keep and bear arms?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.210
These passages are cited so often

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.306
that we can hardly imagine the document
without them,

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:26.679
but that's exactly what the writers
of the Constitution did.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.992
The list of individual freedoms
known as the Bill of Rights

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:32.246
was not in the original text

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:35.221
and wasn't added for another three years.

00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:37.746
So does this mean the founders
didn't consider them?

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:42.525
The answer goes back to the very origins
of the Constitution itself.

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:45.720
Even prior to the first shots
of the American Revolution,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.280
the Thirteen Colonies worked together
through a provisional government

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.245
called the Continental Congress.

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:53.722
During the war in 1781,

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:56.308
the Articles of Confederation 
were ratified

00:00:56.308 --> 00:00:59.243
as the first truly national government.

00:00:59.243 --> 00:01:03.181
But establishing a new nation
would prove easier than running it.

00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.120
Congress had no power to make
the states comply with their laws.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.137
When the national government proved
unable to raise funds,

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:11.553
enforce foreign treaties,

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:13.305
or suppress rebellions,

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:15.908
it was clear reform was needed.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:20.278
So in May 1787, all the states
but Rhode Island

00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:24.561
sent delegates to Philidelphia
for a constitutional convention.

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:29.350
A majority of these delegates favored
introducing a new national constitution

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.841
to create a stronger federal government.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.056
Thanks to compromises on issues
like state representation,

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:36.463
taxation power,

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.525
and how to elect the president,

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:41.304
their proposal gradually gained support.

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:43.603
But the final text drafted in September

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:48.154
still had to be approved by conventions
held in the states.

00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:50.055
So over the next few months,

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:53.741
ratification would be debated
across the young nation.

00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:56.054
Among those who championed
the new document

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:58.655
were leading statesmen Alexander Hamilton,

00:01:58.655 --> 00:01:59.959
James Madison,

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.555
and John Jay.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.507
Together, they laid out eloquent
philosophical arguments

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:07.840
for their positions
in a series of 85 essays

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.686
now known as the Federalist Papers.

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:13.499
But others felt the Constitution
was overreaching

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.370
and that more centralized authority

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.558
would return the states to the sort
of tyranny they had just escaped.

00:02:19.558 --> 00:02:22.461
These Anti-Federalists
were especially worried

00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:26.903
by the text's apparent lack of protections
for individual liberties.

00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:28.839
As the conventions proceeded,

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:33.308
many of these critics shifted
from opposing the Constitution entirely

00:02:33.308 --> 00:02:37.960
to insisting on adding an explicit
declaration of rights.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.845
So what was the Federalists problem
with this idea?

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:43.372
While their opponents accused them
of despotism,

00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:46.497
wanting to maintain absolute power
in the central government,

00:02:46.497 --> 00:02:49.403
their real motives were mostly practical.

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:53.846
Changing the constitution when it
had already been ratified by some states

00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:56.369
could complicate the entire process.

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:00.743
More importantly, Madison felt that
people's rights were already guaranteed

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:02.806
through the democratic process,

00:03:02.806 --> 00:03:06.743
while adding extra provisions
risked misinterpretation.

00:03:06.743 --> 00:03:11.282
And some feared that creating an explicit
list of things the government can't do

00:03:11.282 --> 00:03:14.428
would imply that it can do
everything else.

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:18.024
After the first five states ratified
the Constitution quickly,

00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:20.059
the debate grew more intense.

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.368
Massachusetts and several other states

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:27.274
would only ratify if they could propose
their own amendments for consideration.

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:30.776
Leading Federalists recognized the need
to compromise

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:33.210
and promised to give them due regard.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.492
Once ratification by nine states finally
brought the Constitution into legal force,

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:40.524
they made good on their promise.

00:03:40.524 --> 00:03:43.337
During a meeting of 
the first United States Congress,

00:03:43.337 --> 00:03:45.124
representative James Madison

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:48.210
stood on the House floor to propose
the very amendments

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.562
he had previously believed
to be unnecessary.

00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:53.276
After much debate and revision,

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:54.589
first in the Congress,

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:55.960
and then in the states,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.960
ten amendments were ratified
on December 15, 1791,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.526
over three years after
the US Constitution had become law.

00:04:05.526 --> 00:04:09.619
Today, every sentence, word,
and punctuation mark in the Bill of RIghts

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:13.788
is still considered fundamental
to the freedoms Americans enjoy,

00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:16.648
even though the original framers
left them out.
