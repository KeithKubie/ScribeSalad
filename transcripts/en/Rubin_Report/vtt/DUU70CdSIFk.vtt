00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.130
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.410
<v 1>do you want to be today is a comedian,
actor and podcasts there.
Nick Depalo,</v>

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.140
welcome to the Rubin report.
Next.
Dave,
how are you?
I liked it.

4
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:14.500
The first thing you said to me was to have to worry about any language here.

5
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.990
Yeah.
Which you ought to drop it right now.
You want to drop all your,

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.760
all your passwords notified.
Like you said,

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.250
I've seen you on youtube and it looks like a TV.

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.030
So I felt like I was walking into meet the press and yeah,

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.320
this is very professional.
Yeah.
Well you got the,
you know,

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.290
I wore a jacket for you though.
How I was going to put a tie on for you.

11
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.820
That would have been a bit much.
Yeah,

12
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:36.160
that's what I thought he would have seen right through that.

13
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.940
Does anyone want to see a comedian in a tie?

14
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.970
Only if the hanging themselves say something wrong.
Well that's,

15
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:45.790
I think that's going to be the theme of everything we're doing here.
Uh,

16
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:48.010
so for the people that don't know you,
give me a little,

17
00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:51.340
a little background on Nick Depalo pre stand up,
please stand up.

18
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.320
Did you have a life before if you call it a life.
All right.

19
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.420
I'm on my head a heartbeat now.
He's breathing.
Yeah.

20
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.820
I grew up about 22 miles north of Boston and the very middle class white suburb

21
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.080
pretty much.
And uh,

22
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.970
went to college at University of Maine and uh,

23
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.900
came out of college,

24
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:15.650
took a job selling frozen steak and seafood door to door out of the back of it.

25
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.730
And so it was a pickup truck that actually seems like a good credibility to

26
00:01:18.731 --> 00:01:23.010
stand up.
It was a great prayer.
I'd walk into places,
I'd lay out all my stuff.

27
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.830
Like I'd go on and say any,
any,
any residents,
small businesses.

28
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.150
I'd go into a real estate plan.
I lay out all my stuff if they let me in.

29
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.560
And uh,
you know,
there would be 20 people firing questions.

30
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.530
How much is that per pound,
Buh,
Buh,
Buh,
Buh,
Buh.
And it was great.

31
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:43.090
I'd make them laugh and,
and uh,
you know,
this stuff was really overpriced.

32
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.510
It was a boiler room operation and I'm sure there's people that have seen me on

33
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:50.290
TV since cause then I'm going to find that I bought Haddock for 85 bucks a pound

34
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:53.680
from that year.
So,
uh,
yeah,

35
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:55.900
I did that for a few years and then they took a job.

36
00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:58.720
We haven't see those companies late at night.
That market inventions,

37
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.430
if you have an idea for it.
Oh yeah,

38
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.440
I did that and started where we're meeting.
You did one of those infomercials?

39
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.370
No,
I was,
I actually was a uh,
a salesman.

40
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.670
Like I have my own corner office,
another boiler room operation.
Wow.
Jeez.

41
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.580
Which I didn't know when you come out of college will take a legitimate threat,

42
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.420
a nice building.
I got a suit on and stuff you find out.
But,
but the,

43
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:23.830
the biggest one that I took a job with New England rare coin galleries in
Boston.

44
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.270
It was like working at Merrill Lynch.
It was on the 31st floor of a skyscraper.

45
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:31.150
I had to wear a suit.
It looked just like a,
you know,

46
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:34.010
Charlie Sheen of Wall Street when I went to work.
So I did that for,

47
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.781
that was brutal.

48
00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:38.560
I'm trying to sell $50,000 coins over the phone to somebody you've never met

49
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:41.550
before.
This is after selling the steak and seafood on a tour.
Yeah,

50
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.420
there's [inaudible] ground that didn't last long.
Right.
So I quit that,

51
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.650
that,
that I quit that and about a month later I'm watching TV.

52
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:55.510
I see my boss being led out by the,
by the FBI knows ships.

53
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.800
It was like a boil,
another boiler operation.
Some of the coins were fake and,

54
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.850
but uh,
but I started doing stand up,
uh,
you know right at,

55
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:10.420
right after that,
probably a cup a couple of years out of college.

56
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.140
And this is in Boston,
in Boston,
a place called stitches.
There's a,

57
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:16.630
there's a document you've probably seen stand up,

58
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:20.440
stood out and that little club where they're interviewing people,
stitches.

59
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.190
That's the first place I did my first joke open.
Mike.
Yeah.

60
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.170
I was drunk at a cookout at my parent's house and like good parents that gave me

61
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:33.190
the keys and said,
I want to try.
So yeah,

62
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.250
I put my name and sure enough,
I get called a,
it was a Sunday night.

63
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:40.090
I pull up the stitches and Boston and on the Markia and never forget it says it

64
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:44.710
said comedy.
Hell,
that's what,
so that was my first,

65
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:47.320
George McDonald was the house this guy had and Boston,

66
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.770
my first line on stage was an ad Lib and that's when he said to me,

67
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:51.850
I knew you're going to be funny.

68
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.350
I followed some guy in a Tuxedo and a,

69
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:58.450
I have like a sweatshirt on and then,
and I'm like,

70
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:00.910
I didn't know what to how to dress.
And I said,

71
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:03.260
I didn't know how to be following him at fucking Mr. Sanders,

72
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.990
which is a local Tuxedo place.

73
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.850
And that got like a nice laugh and then I bombed it the next four minutes.
Yeah.

74
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.800
And uh,
I was stupid enough to go back.
Yeah.
So that's pretty,

75
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.750
that's pretty much the beginning of everybody.
Right.

76
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.480
You don't even know how to screw up at the beginning.
That's right.

77
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.780
So you're kind of good by accident or something like that.
That's right.

78
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.940
That must've been a magical time in Boston.
I mean,

79
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:25.180
that's what the documentary is hip,
but they were major,
major comics.

80
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.990
They're all doing it seemingly for the right reason.
Yeah.

81
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.700
More before they even knew what,
what stand up could become the yeah.
Yeah.

82
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:34.870
And it still to this day,

83
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:38.990
you think about the people that have come out of Boston.
I mean,
uh,
you know,
uh,

84
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.220
Jay Leno,
Conan,
Joe Rogan,

85
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.200
Louie Belieber,
uh,
myself,
uh,

86
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.570
even Kevin,
meaning Jenny graphql and moved to Boston at the time.
Yeah.
And yeah,

87
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.580
it was a crazy Steven Wright.
He's a,
yeah,
he's a legend.
Yeah.

88
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.680
I mean,
so it's,
it's a crazy,
but that was,

89
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.920
it reminds me of good fellows that they're going to,
it was a glorious time.

90
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.070
I had a pot of,
had a plot of coke next to my bed.
How many condoms?
Uh,
it was,

91
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:11.800
it was unbelievable.
How can you get cut the garlic?
What's that?

92
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.710
How thin did you cut the gold?
Very thin with the,

93
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.390
that you could do that metaphor there.
You could do that mix.
Yeah,
exactly.

94
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.100
It Nixa that's how they get paid to comedy club.

95
00:05:22.101 --> 00:05:26.310
You could get paid and coke or money.
And so there were a lot of drugs.
Yeah.

96
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.600
I wasn't a drunk guy.
I played,
I was a jock.
I played football in college and,
and,

97
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.190
and uh,
but they would kick me out of the green room.

98
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.700
Steve sweeting and Gavin and all of our veterans.
A rookie.

99
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:39.520
You going to do the Shit and get out?
Yeah,
I'm standing out.

100
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.380
One time I tried to John Pinette talk me into,
uh,
after about a year and a half,

101
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.740
he talked me to doing a line.
I go up on stage at mix,

102
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:50.950
I'll never forget it and I'm talking about,
I have cotton mouth from the Co.

103
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.540
My lip keeps getting stuck like this.

104
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.510
I have my hand in my pocket and I want to point,

105
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:58.160
it was quiet around this set of guy yells,
hey,
relax up there.

106
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:01.620
I was Jig jiggling my car keys.
Oh,

107
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.270
from comics in the back when Diane,
I kept it,

108
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.550
I kept tripping over my punchlines cause my mouth was,

109
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.440
my lip kept getting stuck in my teeth.
That was how he didn't die early.

110
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.870
I mean,
he's the only,
but I love them so much.

111
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:18.800
So I actually said I'll do it right at you.
I don't mean any disrespect to him,

112
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.650
but if he was doing a lot of cooks somehow the weight thing didn't make snow

113
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.560
snakes.
Yeah.
Was he was putting on cheeseburgers and you know,

114
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.290
I don't know,
but I'm,

115
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.580
so that was the beginning of that following guys like Lenny Clarke and Steve

116
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.060
Sweeney,
these guys are legends that your fans probably don't know who they are.

117
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.680
But to this day,
I mean Kenny Rogers and these guys were as good.

118
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.890
Now I'd been doing it 30 years later and I still haven't seen anybody,
you know,

119
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.980
Baraka Room like that with a material,
you know.

120
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.920
So what do you think happens to to that type of guy?

121
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:51.590
Because I don't even know those guys really like that.

122
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.020
The guys that don't make it,
cause I know,

123
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.770
I mean this is the same old story that we all have,

124
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:59.270
but like some of the worst comics that I started with have become successful and

125
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:02.900
some of the best and most actually of the guys that I thought were really great.

126
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.250
All right.
Completely disappeared.
And we all have that story.
Well,

127
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:11.510
the guys in Boston,
there was a a couple of reasons and it was so big.

128
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:14.420
Comedy standup was booming in the mid eighties,
late eighties.

129
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.660
And that was the Mecca like you said.
But these guys,

130
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:22.440
like Nick's comedy club held like 350 people and it was just a moneymaking

131
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.620
machine and it was run by the boys.

132
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.310
And they had like some of the guys sign agreement saying they couldn't perform

133
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.900
anywhere else,
but they will making,
this is back in the 80s.

134
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.660
I remember one of the guys tell me they were making three grand and 3,500 a

135
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:41.810
weekend.
Jeez.
So why would you late right in the cities,

136
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:43.430
it's not like you even had to go.
Yeah.

137
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:46.580
You didn't have to go on the road in their homes.
And they,
you know,

138
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:49.490
and like I said,
they party their ass off and,

139
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.260
and they signed some of them signed agreements and that they couldn't perform

140
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:57.370
elsewhere.
So that's what,
but I mean it will make killer money.

141
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.540
Didn't have to get on a plane and,
and um,
but by the,
in the,

142
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:04.910
in the long run was saying,
you know,
who are they?

143
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.280
But Steve Sweeney has been in a few fairly brother movies and,
and,

144
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.270
and learning clock was brilliant.
I saw these guys at their,
uh,
Kevin Meeney.
Yeah,

145
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.600
they had a,
I always love Kevin Meeting.
Unbelievably Sweeney meeting night.

146
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:20.880
They call,
I was a bar back at stitches comedy club before I come.

147
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.340
That was the other job.
I for about six months.
I just want her to be near it,

148
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.140
you know,
and it was sweetening meaty night.
It was Kevin,

149
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:32.300
Kevin Maney in Steve Sweeney,
who is the godfather of comedy.
Uh,

150
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:35.840
and they would,
they would,
uh,
yeah,
they had a show on Wednesday nights.

151
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.260
Kevin meeting would go out on the street with a camera alive and the a scream

152
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.810
and come down in the club so the audience could watch and he would pull over

153
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:49.060
buses,
get on buses and stop making fun of people on the boat.
Uh,

154
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.790
him and Sweeney went into,
uh,
the Chinese restaurant next door swing.

155
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:56.130
He's got like a cutout of a cop with his face,
throat.

156
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.320
He's pretending he's like a food,
uh,

157
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.870
yelling at the Chinese people to clean up the kitchen.

158
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.090
Then they go into a lady's room and there's a woman in the stove.

159
00:09:05.091 --> 00:09:06.510
It kick open the door with a camera

160
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.730
picture crowd in a glove would not fly these.
No,
of course not.

161
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:15.420
There'll be too much fun.
And uh,
but picture that people inside.

162
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:19.440
Well I've never heard laughter like that.
And I like Kevin,
Kevin,
me,

163
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:22.800
he waved down a cop and started giving the cop shit and a cop got mad.

164
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.260
You are watching this on a screen inside.
I mean brilliant,
brainy and you know,

165
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:32.130
it was,
it was,
it was,
uh,
unbelievable time.
There was more states,

166
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.410
more stages available than Comedians at there.

167
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.090
I've worked 300 nights my first year.
And because this is what,
you're around 88,

168
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.260
so this is like sort of sort of at the end of the boom,
boom boom,
right?
Yeah.

169
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.190
Cause,
what do they say that when dice sold out Madison Square Garden,

170
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:49.890
like three nights in a row,
that was when the whole thing shattered basically,

171
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.540
which I think was around 90 or 91.
Yeah,
that sounds about right.
Yeah.

172
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.560
But every I worked,
it's tough for these guys to,
the game has changed so much,

173
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.750
but me and Louis C K came up together.

174
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:03.360
He was already doing in a year or two before me.
I met him.

175
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:06.630
He was 18 and I was like 25.
And uh,

176
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.040
but every restaurant in pub in New England,
not just Boston,

177
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.320
I could show you my book for my first year.

178
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.600
Monday night I'd be a Chinese restaurant,
Rhode Island.

179
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.170
Tuesday night I'd be at some Mexican restaurant in Franklin,
mass.

180
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.240
Wednesday night I might do a college.

181
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.210
Thursday night I'd be a National Hampshire at a Holiday Inn,
uh,
you know,

182
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.010
and audit and seven nights a week there was so much stage time as you know,

183
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:33.060
as a stand up,
there's nothing more important.
And we thought that's how it was.

184
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:36.840
We didn't realize it was a boom going on.
Yeah.
We thought this is how it is.
Yeah.

185
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.760
So I quit my day job.
I was making more money.
After about 10 months,

186
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:45.640
I could handle a rough Rome.
I mean,
that's pretty crazy.
After 10 months I oil,

187
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.490
I could handle,
I could handle a rough Rome and some of the rooms are rough,

188
00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:52.560
the one nighters.
And I've got the reputation that I could close these.

189
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:57.420
There was one Kingston and Kingston mass down in the Cape and it was a pool hall

190
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.140
and hey,
let's go to have a bucket of blood room.
And um,

191
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.270
I went down and,
uh,

192
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:05.820
these people literally playing pool in the back while they're doing mice,

193
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.140
but by the end of it,

194
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:10.470
they had put their pool sticks down and the guy that ran the place said this.

195
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:14.370
He's the first guy that ever had those guys come in.
And I got,

196
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:18.680
so I started to close rooms after Buddy Barry Katz was by management.
Yeah.
He,
he,

197
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.700
he,
he booked every Roman New England.
So I had worked every night and uh,

198
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.570
you could make,
you know,
I was making on the weekends I'd make six,

199
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:31.370
700 $800 in cash and I was,
you know,

200
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.250
making about as much as I was during the day.
So I quit my day job.
That's crazy.

201
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:38.790
Cause you for your time,
right?
No,
no.
10 month comedian in New York City.

202
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:42.780
If you make 600 bucks in a year,
even now I think you're,
you're running thrilled.

203
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.660
Right.
I feel I would feel bad for these younger.
Yeah,

204
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.480
it's a whole different game.
What do you make of just sort of,
you know,

205
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:51.690
when people say,
well,
comics are all just messed up and the whole thing,

206
00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:55.030
what do you make about the pain to comedy that drags all of us in there?

207
00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.250
I think some of it's overblown.
I didn't,
you know,
I mean we're all,

208
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:04.810
we all have a screw loose somewhere,
but this whole stuff that,
you know,
it,

209
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.180
you know,
it has to be the kids who were bullied and I don't buy that.

210
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.510
Even Bill Hicks had a bit about that,
that he didn't buy into that either.

211
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.630
Supporting his parents,
supported him,
whatever he did,
blah,
blah,
blah.

212
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.560
Which is sort of the way I was very quiet and serious as a kid.
Yeah,
me too.

213
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.460
You and I bullied as much as I was blamed.
Nobody likes to say that,

214
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:27.340
but it's the truth.
That's the point we bullied.

215
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.110
I've been bullied and I bullied mic.

216
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.780
We're losing a lot of social justice warrior credit right now.

217
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.220
We're supposed to be victimized.
That's not what I'm here for,
man.
Bill Hicks,
I,

218
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.480
I Miss Bill Hicks.
I mean he was a little before my time,
but like,
but like that,

219
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:44.220
that relentless pursuit of truth and stand up.
Yeah.
And,

220
00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:46.840
and he was politically to the left,

221
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:52.030
but he was really funny and hateful about,
yeah.
I mean that was his conviction.

222
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:53.470
That's what I learned from watching him.

223
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.070
Even to this day when I have a joke in my head and I'm like,

224
00:12:56.071 --> 00:13:00.400
I don't if I should say this or not.
I use sort of him as a barometer.
Yeah.

225
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.210
But you know,
he was on the left.
He wasn't getting too much trouble showbiz wise,

226
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:06.750
but he said some,
you know stuff.
Yeah.

227
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.740
The way he used to talk about rush Limbaugh and stuff.

228
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:11.800
I do the same thing to Nancy Pelosi.
Yeah.
Well his little bit about Leno,

229
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.080
regardless of what you think about little,
I mean it's one of the,

230
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:19.070
it's one of the,
it's so absolutely pro.
It's just perfection is head blows.

231
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.870
Shelly Peacock,
I mean,
come on doc.
Is that a red jacket or is that done?

232
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:26.860
Is brains.
Yeah,
it's,
it's pretty perfect.

233
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:31.420
He Yanks and the,
I have a lot of that in me.
I have that chip that he had for,

234
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:34.250
I don't know,
for whatever reason I was born like that,
you know?

235
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.090
And that's what I loved about them politically.
You know,

236
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.400
he used to always say there's nobody out there that could hurt us when,
you know,

237
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.640
talking about Ay ay rack or whatever.
Right.

238
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.330
You know how we have the biggest military,
they have the third bay,
whatever.

239
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.820
This is nobody outdated.
It's a fucking threat to us.

240
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:51.070
I'd like to have bring them back to life and go,
you know,

241
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.400
tell them about nine 11 you know,
so,
but,

242
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:58.510
but he was so he was what a writer and you know,

243
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.170
I don't have to be on the same side of you.
Politically defined.
You're funny.

244
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.450
Yeah.
But I find that,
do you find the left doesn't do that?
Yeah.
All right.

245
00:14:06.451 --> 00:14:07.870
So let's,
let's shift.
They're a little bit,

246
00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:12.070
so what do you think has happened to stand up in the last say?

247
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.490
Well now it seems like 20 years,
but in the last couple of years especially,

248
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.140
it's gone from where it was seriously edgy,
where every,

249
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.100
every morning I wake up now and I'm like,
man,

250
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:22.630
I wish George Carlin was still alive.

251
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:24.250
Not only cause I think it was the greatest stand ever,

252
00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:26.500
but we need still some of that,

253
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:29.350
although he be getting booed off college campuses because he's an old white guy.

254
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.580
Yeah.
But he was,
he,
I,
you know,
I love Carlin.
He got my idols too,

255
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:37.980
but he was a lefty and he won.
He created this environment and,

256
00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:42.130
but he was more,
I mean he was most,
I guess he was a lefty,

257
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.120
but he was relentlessly against political.
Correct.

258
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.820
So that shows you how some of that stuff has changed.

259
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.760
But what do you make of sort of what's happened?

260
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:49.930
I was telling you right before we started,

261
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.160
and the only reason I'm doing stand up now again,

262
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.810
is because so many of these comics now,
uh,

263
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.620
have become the politically correct children that they're supposed to be making

264
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:03.980
fun of.
And I was like,
I guess I gotta go do it again.
And now I'm doing it again.

265
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.710
It's a bit bizarre.
I blame,
and I'm not kidding,

266
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.420
the feminist movement there at the core,

267
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.460
they are at the core of all this politically correct or shit that drives us
nuts.

268
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:21.320
They,
they are at the core of it,
the whole,
I think society has been feminized.

269
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:25.670
Yeah.
Uh,
we,
you know,
guys,
and again,
I'm generalizing here,

270
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:29.600
but for the most part,
even the loosest generalization,
we'll just,

271
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:33.590
cause I know
that's what they want though.

272
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:36.020
They want us to be walking around qualifying every statement.

273
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.090
I don't mean everybody,
you know,
example,
which I use it down.
Yeah.

274
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.550
That's one thing I do in my act.
I don't try to balance it out.
Yeah.

275
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.910
Pylon and um,
but,
but sensitivity,

276
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.080
pcs Bence is based in sensitivity.
Yeah.
And,
and,

277
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:55.480
and that's not an Idna lead.
And most guys,
you know,
I,
I,

278
00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.650
and they have a never,
they're never ending list of grievances.
They just,

279
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.710
they can't leave it alone.
I don't watch movies anymore.

280
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.270
I stopped about 20 years ago because I was aware of,

281
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.200
it's something made me aware of it.
I,
I,

282
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.460
I can't suspend my disbelief and watch Angelina Jolie beat up 10 marines.

283
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.410
I just can't fucking do it,
you know?
I really can't.
Yeah.
And a,
I just,

284
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.360
it's been feminized and,

285
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:24.140
and this business draws a lot of people who were bullied and shit.

286
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.370
Even back in the,
in the 80s when I would watch films,
I go,
why is,

287
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:31.370
and I would say this,
this was way before I was in comedy.
I go,

288
00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:33.410
why is the bad kid at the high school?

289
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.650
Always the white kid with a leather jacket,
the jock and every,

290
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:40.940
and it's still going to stay.
This is 30 years later,
back to the future.

291
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:45.530
Everything is this.
I mean,
I know it's just,
um,

292
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.800
you know,
there's a lot more women comics and,
and,
and whatever.

293
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.550
But th that's what the PC comes from.
It comes from the left.

294
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.050
Nobody ever says that the census shit,
I know people are bought into it.

295
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.150
Politicians on both sides in guys of Acquia.

296
00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:01.310
I guess this guy's fault that we let it get this far.

297
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.110
Is it weird how it flip though?
Like,

298
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.620
cause you could look at say the 90s when the right was screaming about video

299
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:09.560
game violence and all this stuff and it's like,
no,

300
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:12.910
it doesn't cause real violence.
If anything,
it actually confuses.

301
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:15.740
So this is where it's like,
to me,
the right doesn't get a pass.

302
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.090
They have the right is way better now in terms of political correctness and free

303
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:24.360
speech.
Um,
but,
but yeah,
the left has become,
well yeah.

304
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.640
[inaudible] it's one thing to yell above video game violence.
Why,

305
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.740
which may or may not be true.
Whatever.
I never bought into that.

306
00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:34.700
I watch the three stooges from age 60,
40.
I never fucking,

307
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:39.440
I never hit my mother would have with a crowbar.
Oh my mother in the eyes.
But uh,

308
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:41.740
um,
yeah,
they were wrong in some stuff,
but,

309
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.820
but not to the degree that the left gone with changing the political correct is,

310
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.740
you know,
the definition is,
you know,

311
00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:51.870
changing people's behavior through language and you know,

312
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:56.440
with the today it's going the he and the,
she I want to be called gay.

313
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.280
And I'm sorry that I didn't ask about your pronouns before we started.

314
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.010
I'd like to be,
I don't even know what they call me,
them it yet,

315
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.860
but most people call me.
So that was kind of funny.
Do you remember,
uh,

316
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.110
do you remember when it started seeping into the clubs?
Um,

317
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.080
not,
I don't,
there's no one specific moment.
You know,

318
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.310
I've been doing this 31 years or whatever.
So I finally,

319
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.570
after all this time,
people come out to see me.

320
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.330
They know what's coming.
You know,

321
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:35.010
but I do remember early in my career,
I was at Clark University.

322
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:39.240
I was doing a college and Clark Universe,
I think it's Clark and Massachusetts,

323
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:44.220
even liberal for Massachusetts school.
That's liberal.
Yeah.
And I did some joke,

324
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:48.800
uh,
about the Middle East and got a gas station.
He couldn't find my oil.

325
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:49.531
He was trying to chat.

326
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:53.160
I said I had the one Middle Eastern guy who came couldn't find or whatever,

327
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.390
and some kid in the front row college,
you've got sure.
He goes,
Jesus,

328
00:18:57.391 --> 00:19:00.210
that was a fun,
what are you going to do?
A Bush and jokes and acts.

329
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.230
So I just rattled off like eight abortion jumps off the top of my head and the

330
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:07.830
whole place was,
yeah.
And it's the only time I got off stage.

331
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:11.700
A couple of minutes early.
Really?
Yeah.
So that,
that was a long time ago.

332
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.140
But um,
I don't know if you say it with enough conviction.

333
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.640
Um,
I,
I don't know.
I get,
I get a thrill out of it.

334
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.560
These are good and bad times,
but I've always,
even after my first open mic,

335
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.460
about six months in my open mic experiencing a comic said to me,

336
00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:32.310
you are politically incorrect.
That's,
that's where it's headed.

337
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.460
And even I said to him,
I go,
I go,
it's going to get a lot worse.

338
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.530
That this was like an 88 or 89 yeah.
And it did get a lot worse.

339
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.930
Do you think it can get much worse than no.

340
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.050
And I mean now you see articles in buzzfeed every day about stand up either

341
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.410
needs to be not funny now we should enter it,
you know?

342
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:52.740
Did you see that article did see we should enter a phase where stand up

343
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:55.920
shouldn't be funny so that we could address compensation.

344
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.380
We're even having that compensate stand up.

345
00:19:58.381 --> 00:20:00.420
That's the antithesis of you stand as close to be.

346
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.360
You're supposed to say what people won't say.
And,

347
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:07.110
and that's in the DNA of a comic.
I mean in high school,

348
00:20:07.111 --> 00:20:10.590
if I saw an opening in class for a joke that,
you know,

349
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.760
let it fly and the,
I can't believe it's to this point,

350
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:20.130
but I don't know where else it can go.
Well,
I can go in the direction that,

351
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.431
you know,

352
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:24.190
they'll force clubs to stop booking people and they'll kick the rest of us off.

353
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.200
[inaudible] a black market will pop up like anything else when you prohibit

354
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:32.460
something,
right?
Yeah.
And then I'd get really good fun.
Then we have a civil war,

355
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.910
then we,
then we go,
right.
Yeah.
Can we have the Goddamn war?

356
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.500
I'm on the side with all the guns.
You can go right there.
I'm on the side.

357
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.650
I pulled a gun.
Okay,
let's get it on.
I'm tired of it,
man.
I,

358
00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:44.860
but,
uh,

359
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.630
at least I can set by now at least I market myself and people know at thanks to

360
00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:54.310
my podcast and,
and uh,
after 30 is a standard,
but I was never,
I always,

361
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:59.260
I said stuff on tough crowd.
I called A,
we showed a commercial and I said,

362
00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:01.900
that's cultural.
The Cultural Marxists that people are right.
They shit.

363
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:05.050
And everyone's like,
what's he talking to me?
And I got like pigeon hole that day.

364
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.480
Right.
You know,
that's gotta be at least 10 years ago.

365
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:10.810
So that's before these 10 years ago,
I was reading a lot of,
uh,

366
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.530
Pat Buchanan who I still up.
Okay.
What do you,
uh,

367
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:19.570
so you were in a tough crowd crew.
Colin Quinn obviously,
and that whole crew,

368
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.660
that show,
it was only on for a couple of years actually,

369
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.180
but it probably would never,
well not probably,

370
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:28.810
you would never make it on comedy central now.
Oh God,
no.
You know,

371
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.380
they actually said to Collin,
who's a genius,
Collin girl grew up in,
if you,

372
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:38.290
you know,
yeah.
I mean,
he's the sweetest guy.
As bright a guy as you'll ever meet.

373
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.710
He grew up in Brooklyn and I went to high school,
black kids,
Puerto Rican,

374
00:21:42.711 --> 00:21:44.850
Dominican.
He knows that world.
Yeah.

375
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.320
And they actually said them after a few episodes,

376
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:50.260
a tough crowd after or a couple of seasons.
They said,

377
00:21:50.261 --> 00:21:52.960
why don't you let leave the race stuff to Chapelle.

378
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.200
Can you imagine him saying that?
The colon that's actually racist.

379
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:58.630
I mean that of course it is.
Yeah,
of course it is.

380
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.060
People love that chokes me and Patrice.

381
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.110
Me and Patrice would unload on each other and people love me for,

382
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:08.940
I was on a plane in Atlanta right up to me and Beatrice had a good,
uh,

383
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.330
toe-to-toe,
uh,

384
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.200
on the show and I was a plant in Atlanta and I see this black guy look at him

385
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:19.090
with his son and I'm getting a little nervous and they come up to me and they
go,

386
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:23.440
we love you man on tough crowd.
Yeah.
And it's like,
you know,
people,

387
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.800
why don't you meet people face to face?

388
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.180
That's what sort of,
cause you clearly have a good disposition,

389
00:22:31.181 --> 00:22:33.130
especially for a comic.
Is that partly what it is?

390
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:36.490
Like I see this now after being on tour for the last year.
If I go online,

391
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:39.220
it's just like an endless hate festival.
Lunacy.

392
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.760
Everyone's trying to destroy each other.
Yeah.

393
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.560
And then every night when I'm touring and I do meet and greets after the show

394
00:22:44.561 --> 00:22:47.790
and all of these people and nobody cares what sex they are,

395
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.580
sexuality or bipolar and everyone's great.

396
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.120
So I feel like I live in these alternate worlds where the real world happens to

397
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:59.170
be pretty damn good.
It is.
And it's not just social media,
just the,

398
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:01.090
just the mainstream media.

399
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.890
I'll be laying there watching TV and all of a sudden a PSA.

400
00:23:03.891 --> 00:23:07.640
Oh come on for the bullying.
Jesus Christ's.
Leave it alone for five.

401
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.540
I can't watch a red sox game.
I'm from Boston.

402
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.710
New England sports network is the most PC.
I love my red sox.
I,

403
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.640
I had trouble.
There's always a,

404
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:23.910
Oh you've got 12 women from the main woman shelter here is kids with cancer.

405
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:28.410
It's like Jesus,
I go to,
I'm watching this to get away from that.
Yeah.
Well that,

406
00:23:28.411 --> 00:23:29.710
look what,
look what happened to ESPN.

407
00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:32.710
I mean they've destroyed themselves in the name of being woke and they didn't

408
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:35.980
give a shit that day.
They did.
They have that much money or that's Disney.

409
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:40.260
Nothing is more PC than Disney.
Yeah,
they're at the core of it toe.
So wait,

410
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.770
you mentioned we'll get,
we'll get there,

411
00:23:41.771 --> 00:23:45.010
but I don't want to jump over Patrice cause you've watched a couple of your core

412
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.853
guys

413
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.360
<v 2>died and then it's to this,
which is,
uh,</v>

414
00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.940
so Greg Giraldo was like on his way to becoming starved stars.

415
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:55.640
I used to live like two or three blocks away from him on the upper west.

416
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.970
And I remember seeing him,
I would see him all the time.

417
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:01.250
You'd have his two kids and you'd be walking them to school or whatever.

418
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:03.020
And I used to see him at Equinox at the gym and he,

419
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.260
he was fit and he seemed like he was like,
I used to look at them and be like,

420
00:24:06.261 --> 00:24:07.910
we didn't really,
you know,
he kind of knew I was a comic,

421
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:10.220
but we didn't know each other.
But I would look at him and I'd be like,
Oh,

422
00:24:10.221 --> 00:24:12.620
you're a comic who like became a human.

423
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.330
You actually became like a real person too.
And I thought of,

424
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.410
I sort of wanted to emulate that in a way.

425
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.860
And I remember I saw him at the gym one day and he's pumping and blah,
blah,
blah.

426
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.890
He was dead two days later and you're like,

427
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.480
it really threw me for a loop even though I didn't know the guy that well.
Yeah,

428
00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.410
you've had a couple of guys in your crew that just,
yeah.

429
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.170
<v 1>Portrays and,
and,
and,
and Greg,
uh,</v>

430
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:38.510
even now when I hear him on the radio,
you know,
if you listen to satellite and,

431
00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:43.250
and I'm like,
ah,
I got a good line from a tree,
a Gra.
And it just,

432
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:47.350
it never really got over.
The Geraldo just shocked me when,
when,

433
00:24:47.351 --> 00:24:51.410
when that happened,
he seemed too smart.
I mean he's a Harvard Guy,
law guy,

434
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.500
but that's what I loved about him.
He gave the lend some credibility to stand up,

435
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.930
uh,
and,
uh,
very bright kid and always.
Yeah,

436
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:04.490
he was always jovial and,
and you know,
and he would pick my brain,

437
00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:05.330
he would watch me,

438
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.200
I was a little ahead of him and he would be all asking all the right questions,

439
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.420
you know,
about,
stand up and,
and uh,
and he was on his way.
You know,

440
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.920
like you said a and Patrice.
I just loved Patrice cause he's a Boston guy.

441
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.960
He's a curmudgeon and didn't have,
didn't hide his dislike for Whitey.

442
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.370
I hide my dislike for him or his friends in which that's why we liked each
other.

443
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.240
You know what I mean?
And,
and uh,
what a blow to lose those.

444
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:33.910
It's always the good ones,
isn't it?

445
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.090
<v 2>Yeah.
Well only the good die young,
you know,</v>

446
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.140
Sarah yourself middle lived til she's a hundred as well.

447
00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.050
Patton Oswald and Kathy Griffin.
Oh,

448
00:25:41.051 --> 00:25:43.690
well now you're talking about the people that drag me back in.
I mean,

449
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.950
those three particularly actually,
but there's a couple of others that,

450
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.430
these are the ones that are talking about,
we can't let Milo's book be published.

451
00:25:50.431 --> 00:25:54.060
Doesn't matter what you think about Milo comedians talking about banning books.

452
00:25:54.061 --> 00:25:56.140
I mean,
can you imagine if you said that

453
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.890
<v 1>about whoever,
you know,
Belmarsh should not be able to write a book.
Yeah,
I mean,</v>

454
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:05.170
yeah.
I mean they are artists and they have four group thing.
Yeah.

455
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.550
Which is the quickest way to stifle any creative.
The little fascist Fox.

456
00:26:09.551 --> 00:26:13.330
I hate them.
I try to be nice.
I actually texted pat nozzle.

457
00:26:13.331 --> 00:26:17.050
I don't know him that well.
When his wife died,
I felt so horrible.

458
00:26:17.051 --> 00:26:19.690
I texted him a couple times and then I read this stuff,

459
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.920
know that he says tonight,
I'm like,
I don't like this guy.
We should was him.

460
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.910
There's the line that up just busting balls.
Right?
Yeah.
Um,

461
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:34.120
but you know what I mean?
Ray and Sarah Silverman.
Who is she?
Yeah.
Well,

462
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.710
couldn't follow me on my worst night.

463
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.250
<v 2>There it is.
So,
so what do we do to break that thing?</v>

464
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:43.620
Because it does still seem to be spreading.
Like I get that there's,
there,

465
00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:43.980
there's some

466
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.810
<v 1>pushback now and they're,
well,
first off,
do you,</v>

467
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:48.900
what do you consider your conservative?
I mean,
if somebody says,
I know,

468
00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:52.920
I know it doesn't really matter.
[inaudible] I know,
but I,
I,
I'm like,
and Quince,

469
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:56.640
Colin Quinn's others too.
I don't know.
I got labeled that after a tough crowd.

470
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.350
Yeah.
But what were in show business,
right.
I guess,
I guess something,

471
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.860
this is show business,
uh,
and,
and,

472
00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.240
and Hollywood or wherever and show up is if you,

473
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:10.980
if you're out of out of 20 issues,
if you lean right on two of them,

474
00:27:10.981 --> 00:27:12.350
you're not,
you're gonna have to.
Yeah.

475
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.420
So I kept getting pegged with that conservative,
conservative,

476
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.470
but I'm really not.
I,
I'm for the truth.

477
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.700
I call them as I see them and I'm sure,
you know,
uh,

478
00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.780
conservatives back in the civil rights,

479
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.930
we're on the wrong side of that and that now these guys have them,
they're there.

480
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:32.760
They're on the wrong side to me.
Uh,
anytime you want to sensor.
Uh,
but,

481
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:35.810
um,
yeah,
I mean,
uh,
I,

482
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.950
I'm pro gay marriage.
I don't really care about guns.
Um,

483
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:46.010
I can't say I'm prolife only because like I have a dead dying of Alzheimer's

484
00:27:46.801 --> 00:27:49.710
right now.
And if I could put them out of his misery tomorrow,
I would.

485
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.600
And when I was young,

486
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.190
I was glad there was planned parenthood drown when I got in trouble with a few

487
00:27:56.191 --> 00:28:00.000
girls or whatever.
So I'd be a hypocrite to say,
yeah,
but this way to me,

488
00:28:00.001 --> 00:28:04.230
your bushings,
I'll go with that.
I mean,
this is ridiculous what's going on.
Yeah.

489
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.110
It's strangely that those positions,
which I'm with you,
I described myself,

490
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:10.110
I'm begrudgingly pro choice,
I think.
I wish I didn't have to be yet,

491
00:28:10.111 --> 00:28:12.180
but I grudgingly I'd worried,
you know,
but I know,

492
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:15.400
I know several women that have had abortions in the last year.
I just,

493
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.770
I don't think I could take that away from them,

494
00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:20.100
but I completely get the prolife side.
Right.
But even to take those positions,

495
00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:20.934
you just said,

496
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.170
if you're going to take anything that's not on the progressive side,
you're,

497
00:28:24.171 --> 00:28:26.640
you're one of the bad guy.
Yes.
Well that's what it is.

498
00:28:26.641 --> 00:28:30.570
You have to check off all the boxes.
Yeah.
Well your ear at Nazi,
whatever,

499
00:28:30.571 --> 00:28:34.050
which is this whole,
you're a big and who do you,

500
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.280
who do you think you learn?
You can label somebody that,

501
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.040
that that is to me,
you've never had a racist thought or a muttered,
a racist.

502
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:46.770
Then those are the only people who have the right to call me a bigger and then

503
00:28:46.771 --> 00:28:51.660
that person doesn't exist.
I mean the sanctimony on it is fun.

504
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.450
I can't believe it.
Yeah.

505
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.790
My and my buddy Pete goes in and who's been on the show many times calls this

506
00:28:56.791 --> 00:29:01.150
thing a secular religion and that's what it is.
Become a really jets what it is.

507
00:29:01.151 --> 00:29:05.460
And these people,
yeah,
they put up before anything got,
you know,

508
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:09.630
we've got our work cut out for us.
Huh.
Uh,
I was say the solution is a war folks.

509
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:10.464
I don't know.

510
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.620
I mean we're all going to balkanize and break apart or whatever and whatever.

511
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.760
Well,
you know,
it's funny you say that,

512
00:29:17.761 --> 00:29:21.240
but I do see this undercurrent of people talking about that now.

513
00:29:21.241 --> 00:29:25.770
Do you actually think,
yeah,
that that's where we ended up eventually over years,

514
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:27.570
these ideas just keep percolating.

515
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:32.070
Everyone realizes how much they have in disagreement with their neighbor and

516
00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:34.080
then we ended up in some horrible base.
I mean,

517
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:35.670
it's pretty much everything I've been fighting against.

518
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:38.540
I've been trying to get these sides to be a little more decent.
But,

519
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.070
but I get the impulse on that actually too big.
No,

520
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:46.300
<v 2>there is no middle ground.
There is no the Senate.
I,
I,</v>

521
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:51.430
I use that analogy a,
it's like a athlete's knee and think of Bobby,
you,

522
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:55.270
ours,
my,
it's like a,
you know,
the cartilage is gone and now it's,

523
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.200
now it's bone on bone.
You know what I mean?
There's a,
yeah,

524
00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:03.610
I mean witness such a gap.
We're seeing the world through two different lenses.

525
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.120
Yeah.
I don't see that closing.
I only seen him,
you know,

526
00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.400
and social media is sort of through the gas on it and expedited.
Well,

527
00:30:10.401 --> 00:30:11.800
what do you make about what's going on with the,

528
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.780
with the tech companies and censorship and all that,

529
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:16.660
because that also is another thing that should be right in a comedian's wheel

530
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:21.480
house.
And I don't see these guys doing it.
I see Seth Macfarlane telling,

531
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.810
uh,
you know,
saying the family guys not going to do a gay jokes anymore.

532
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.510
The Simpsons isn't going to put our pool in episodes.

533
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:31.030
The hardest working guy on the show who was completely welcomed,

534
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.370
who is an immigrant that changed homer stance on illegal immigration.
And again,

535
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.700
you'll get other things in this country talking about Indian weddings and

536
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:43.530
Hinduism and Vegan isn't a horrible,
horrible [inaudible] I'm off the TVS,

537
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.140
just disgusting.
Yeah.
But all of this,
it's all related to social media,

538
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:48.280
the way everyone just,

539
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:51.580
we can look at the past and immediately erase it and we were automatically going

540
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:55.150
to be better.
And all of this endless bullshit.
What do you make of all of that?

541
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.480
Well,
the tech companies have it out for us.

542
00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.040
Are you starting that thing with Jordan?

543
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:04.720
We're working on it and I'll count you in.
I'll start patrion all right.
Yeah.

544
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.650
Yeah.
And you know,
and they looked at,
they've been fair to me,
but I,
you know,

545
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:11.730
I don't want to contribute to a,
yeah.
I don't know where their money's going.

546
00:31:11.731 --> 00:31:13.930
Right.
You're in.
We'll have to discuss the rest of it.

547
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:18.470
Not when the cameras of course.
Yeah.
Leave it to me to bring them.
Um,
so I do,

548
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.690
um,
well even just related to that,
you know,
I saw one guy,

549
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.540
it's like a fairly well known,
you know,
verified blue check,

550
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:28.840
lefty attacking me and Jordan over leaving because you know,

551
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.290
Carl Benjamin and sorry I got to,
Rick had said the n word and he said it,

552
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:33.400
and the guy kept saying,

553
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.910
if he had said it with an a at the end instead of an r at the end,

554
00:31:36.911 --> 00:31:40.150
it would have been okay.
And I thought,
you guys density,

555
00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.500
you've will get completely,

556
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.980
really serious because then it would have been sort of an endearing,

557
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:49.030
or at least a colloquial way of saying it,
but he said it with a hard r,

558
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.550
even though the way he said it was against the outright anyway,

559
00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:53.590
but putting aside reality for a second,

560
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:57.130
but I thought the way you people whittle down everything,

561
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.960
it tells you it's not even about a word.

562
00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:03.330
It's about the intonation that you say the word.
It's like,
think about that.
Yeah.

563
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.830
Just that alone.
If you've never said anything right,

564
00:32:05.831 --> 00:32:09.670
you've never said it one way or the other.
Exactly.
I corrected myself.

565
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.840
Uh,
yeah,
I mean proofs out silly.
Their arguments are.
Yeah,
but,
but,
uh,

566
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:21.841
I love that clip that Louie that at governors said that clip that surfaced a

567
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.320
couple of weeks ago.
Yeah.
So what do you make of that?

568
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:25.350
So you and Louis go way back.
Yeah.

569
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.380
Obviously everyone knows what happened with him.
Give me the sort of,
look,
I,

570
00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:32.410
I've said it a million times.
I,
if he did that to my sister,

571
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:34.780
I would have punched him in the face or a front,
you know,

572
00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:39.620
a girlfriend or whatever.
Obviously that was horrible behavior on his.
Yeah.

573
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.400
But

574
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.420
<v 1>I mean,
capital offense,
right.
Rolling his life and career.</v>

575
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.830
Get over yourselves,
ladies.
You know,
I lived with them,

576
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:51.920
I do a job on stage about it and I like,
let's say you have to,

577
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.010
let's differentiate between him and Harvey Weinstein.
I mean,

578
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.600
everybody's being lumped in now and a,
yeah,

579
00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.490
what Louie did was horrible and stuff,
but I,
you know,

580
00:32:59.491 --> 00:33:02.030
and then I do a bit of buddies.
I had lived with them for a year and a half.

581
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:04.370
I started his Dick maybe 10 times,
four times in essential.

582
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.060
So I love him.
He's,
he's a great father.
He's,

583
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:15.170
he's as smart a guy as I ever met and,
and he was all,
I loved him.

584
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:18.650
He was always a little reckless.
And,
and what do you make of that thing?
I mean,

585
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:21.140
it gets to where I talked about earlier or what we talked about earlier about

586
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:23.300
just comedians and sort of being messed up or whatever.

587
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.970
Like that thing about like he's got everything right.

588
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:29.120
I mean that paypal shot when he had that million bucks just sitting in there

589
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:31.340
cause he sold his special just like that.
Like everything.

590
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:33.440
He was respected by everybody.

591
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.540
Like and yet some other shit's still going down.
He,
and I think we're,

592
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.500
we all suffer from that at some level.
Like it's just,

593
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:43.730
it's part of the human condition.
Yes.
Yeah.
We're humans.
We have flawed,

594
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:44.983
he never,

595
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:49.280
Louis never cared about money even when he started to make it at the beginning.

596
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:53.540
And,
uh,
I was like his big brother,
he didn't even know how to handle money when,

597
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:57.720
when we were,
you know,
when we first met,
when we went to San Francisco,

598
00:33:57.721 --> 00:34:01.400
we're doing the punch line.
Me and him are like co headlining something.
He goes,

599
00:34:01.401 --> 00:34:04.430
I'm going out to rent the VCR.
This is back in the early nineties.

600
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:08.900
So we can watch movies at the hotel,
whatever.
And we both had literally,

601
00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:13.100
I'd probably,
uh,
probably $900 net worth between,

602
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:18.290
he comes back with a $600 trumpet that he bought.
This is how he,

603
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.450
he,
I had to explain to them the,
you know,

604
00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:24.200
the value of money and I still don't think,
um,

605
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.780
that's not what drives him.

606
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:30.020
I know you've got all that success commercially and all the money and stuff,

607
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:35.270
but he said he's the most interesting person I've ever met.

608
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:38.630
So what do you think you think he's doing the forgiveness machine,
right.

609
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.430
Basically,
I love what he did.
He waited,

610
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.890
he waited around and he saw the bitching and we'd be stuck his face out of two

611
00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:50.120
minutes and people go and wild.
You've got to let me know when he's at the club.

612
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:54.020
When you kill babies,
you know what do you,
what the fuck is going on here?

613
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.350
So he stuck his face out.
We took the temperature of,

614
00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.020
and it was a bunch of whining and stuff and he probably thought about mild,

615
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.370
but over a few months that,
fuck this,

616
00:35:01.371 --> 00:35:05.990
I'm coming back and I'm throwing haymakers I love the way and all this stuff.

617
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:07.250
All the people know that you know,

618
00:35:07.251 --> 00:35:11.460
before this that loved him now and now he's going to get,

619
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.880
and the comics too.
It's the comment.
Yeah,

620
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:18.050
but it goes back to that feminist stuff.
It always goes back to that,

621
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.920
you know?
So he gets,

622
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.610
he gets back in and then of course all the articles where now he's all right,

623
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.050
you saw all that,
you know,
there's going to be the king of the red states.

624
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.630
That's my,
I've been working at a 30 years.

625
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:37.470
I'll say I do is whip my dick out and I could,
um,
yeah.

626
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:41.970
And he won't be,
he know his comedy will be like,
it's always been,

627
00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.970
I don't think he will be the,
you know,
but,
but,

628
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:49.050
but I do have a problem with a few comics out there who are kind of famous who

629
00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:51.240
are now getting the label as a,
you know,

630
00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:54.230
a edgy and anti PC

631
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.720
<v 2>who's edgy that you think is actually edgy these days.</v>

632
00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.750
<v 1>May My whole</v>

633
00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.750
<v 2>career.
We should do a show together.
We should do it.
Yeah,
we should.
Yeah.</v>

634
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.620
All right.
We'll do something.

635
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.970
<v 1>Uh,
edgy is edgy,
is doing jokes,
pushing Rachel,</v>

636
00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:10.610
what were the table of black people right there where you could get punched in

637
00:36:10.611 --> 00:36:11.750
the fit that's edgy.

638
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.440
Not going and finding a Patton Oswald gone in front of the thousands of nerds.

639
00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.700
And that's not edgy.
It never was,

640
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:25.220
you know,
uh,
made telling my how I feel about women,
certain ones,
you know,
the,

641
00:36:25.221 --> 00:36:28.040
the feminist movement.
Yeah.
And doing stuff that could hurt you.

642
00:36:28.041 --> 00:36:32.890
I've been doing my whole,
but you gotta be funny about it first,
right.
First take,

643
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:37.160
you have to be offering,
otherwise you end up preaching and,
and uh,
um,

644
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.560
like Billy burger is now,

645
00:36:39.561 --> 00:36:44.561
he's getting labeled as kind of edge but Belize a very liberal guy and to me his

646
00:36:44.571 --> 00:36:47.120
politics of the past help create this environment.

647
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.320
<v 2>I love when they call them racist.</v>

648
00:36:48.321 --> 00:36:50.430
I was just at a wedding with him a couple of weeks ago.
He's white,

649
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:54.420
this black you eating,
you know,
I love his wife and he,

650
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:59.520
Billy is the least racist person or no,
can you imagine?
But,

651
00:36:59.521 --> 00:37:01.710
but those guys,
you know,

652
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:06.420
I was pushing that along time ago and now I'll be like,
he's,
you know,
real.

653
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.810
And that's Billy saw burger right now to me is the funniest.

654
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.560
He's like every guy I grew up with a Boston just,

655
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:16.530
he sounds like every kid I grew up with and,
and brutally funny.

656
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.560
But my point being those,
I have bell Myra was getting all,

657
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.460
remember Belmont when after his own audience because of the Muslim thing and

658
00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:28.110
stuff.
But,
but I said,
good for bill,
but bill,
you help create this environment.

659
00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:32.520
You know,
I,
I'm,
I'm,
so we caught with him because I loved him for so many years.

660
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.390
He was like my guy,
he was the right kind of liberal free speech,
liberal.

661
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.710
I loved him and I've always wanted it to be on the show and I want to do this

662
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:43.200
with him.
I really do.
But these last couple of years,

663
00:37:43.201 --> 00:37:45.690
even though I think he's still on the right side on the free speech stuff,

664
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:50.100
but when he apologized cause of the n word Thai iced tea or whoever it was,

665
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:54.570
it was like,
she says,
this is bad,
this is bad.
And now his Trump stuff has gotten,

666
00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:58.190
so he's like,
he's become like a character of a caricature of himself.
And I,

667
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.120
and I say that with like the most respect.

668
00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:03.210
Like I want him to be better again or something,
you know?
Yeah.

669
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.420
But what does that tell you about just sort of the way television also has

670
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:08.760
changed because you've been on the tonight show,
you've been on Letterman,

671
00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:12.930
you've been on all the late nights.
They seem completely irrelevant to me now.

672
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:16.430
I mean that,
oh,
I have,
I'm not putting you down.
You know what I mean?
No,
no.

673
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.530
Just like the machine has now changed leash.

674
00:38:18.531 --> 00:38:22.460
I did it on Jay was there and I love Jimmy to,
well I love [inaudible] too,

675
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:23.340
but it's

676
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.610
<v 1>a whole different and,
and my stuff,
I mean,
I wasn't,</v>

677
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.790
you know,
when we start comedy at the beginning,
you create,

678
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.380
try to have a lot of kind of TV clean because you want to get some exposure.

679
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.110
Yeah.
So I wasn't super edgy,
but my first let him,

680
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:41.420
and I did mention like a gay woman,
I agree with me about her dog or whatever,

681
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:44.600
whatever,
you know,
I guess compared to what other people,

682
00:38:44.601 --> 00:38:47.710
and I made fun of homeless,
my opening line or whatever.

683
00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:50.350
So I guess that was kind of edgy.
I could at least work.
Then.

684
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:53.210
Now you're knocking on the tonight show with that.
Well,
it's funny.

685
00:38:53.211 --> 00:38:54.850
At night I went to see my buddy,

686
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:59.020
Joe Lewis when he did his first Letterman and the girls said that they wanted me

687
00:38:59.021 --> 00:39:03.100
to come back on.
It was like a casual chat in the green room.
But she goes,

688
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:07.090
you can't do any cancer stuff any home.
She starts listing and I got him all set.

689
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.970
Thanks as much as I would.
I would love to done know,

690
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:12.370
you know one more let them in or whatever.
We all should have seen this.

691
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:14.320
What's that line from the comedian documentary?

692
00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:17.110
That Seinfeld dude when already Adam says he goes on the tonight show and they

693
00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:18.220
made him change.

694
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.750
You know there's one person on this bus and that person has a lupus or
something.

695
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:24.700
And that was his joke cause he was the only person on the bus,

696
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:29.080
but they made him change it from Lupus to muscular dystrophy or the other way

697
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:31.750
around.
Like the way they look at words like someone,

698
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:33.460
they ended debate like a network executive.

699
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:36.160
I had a debate like which is more offensive lupus or muscular dystrophy.

700
00:39:36.161 --> 00:39:39.310
I'm honestly not even sure which way it was,
which tells you how stupid is.

701
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:43.540
But what do you think about that?
Just the way,
the days,
the old days,

702
00:39:43.541 --> 00:39:44.830
like you know,

703
00:39:44.831 --> 00:39:48.340
you want it to get on Carson so you could do your five and maybe he invites you

704
00:39:48.341 --> 00:39:52.720
to sit down and if he does right now you're a star that's just,
Oh that's gone.

705
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.230
That's been gone forever.
Now.
I was excited because Jay,

706
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.630
Jay Leno was one of my influences.

707
00:39:58.631 --> 00:40:01.450
People laugh when I say I go go watch Jay Leno.

708
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.990
When he used to appear on the Letterman show in the 80s,

709
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.080
Jay would have month three times a month.
Yeah.

710
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:12.200
And Jay was the king of stand up at that point.
He would go on there.
Google.

711
00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.021
I you've got,
I've,
I've,

712
00:40:13.021 --> 00:40:16.360
I still go home and I go over with you sometimes watch Jay is a guest.

713
00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:19.960
How funny he was.
That's what really pushed me.
Jay,

714
00:40:19.961 --> 00:40:22.960
I grew up about 10 minutes from Jay.
He,
I go,
this guy looks like me.

715
00:40:22.961 --> 00:40:27.370
Sounds like me.
He's Italian,
he's Scottish and a and sarcastic.

716
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.870
And uh,
so that was one of my influences.
And,
and um,

717
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.120
but the whole game has changed.

718
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.270
Do you think it matters anymore that like there was a certain,

719
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:40.600
there was a certain magic to this idea that you could go through that machine.

720
00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:45.190
There was like an actual path to be and success.
Yeah.
That's all gone.

721
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.870
Do you think,
do you miss it at all?

722
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.620
Or the idea that I was just kind of a free for all.
I like it now.

723
00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.390
I like that we're all doing our own thing.
Yeah.

724
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.580
And I Kinison I use it as the model.
I Kinison was so offensive and stuff.
Yeah.

725
00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:58.630
But he,
but he became,

726
00:40:58.631 --> 00:41:02.500
it came such a cult had such a cult following and then Hollywood came to him.

727
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.900
Now why don't you get so big,
you know,
you have so many followers and stuff.
Um,

728
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.570
Candice and Sorta did that.
He made Hollywood come to him.

729
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.750
He was outrageous and they finally put them on,
let them and stuff.

730
00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.190
I like what's going on like as far as me on my podcast being able to cut loose

731
00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.550
and um,
people are looking for you and a guys like you,

732
00:41:21.551 --> 00:41:25.960
and I know this is very few.
I did a gig Friday night in San Diego,

733
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.320
uh,
the comedy palace and I was in San Diego Friday night.

734
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:33.770
Where are your [inaudible] into that little room?
I haven't done that,
but I,
well,

735
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:36.360
I was at the Balboa theatre repeaters in,
so that's,
that's,

736
00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:40.950
that's a different thing.
You should have come with a comedy.
I'd pull up.

737
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.110
They're like,
oh,
it's kind of a restaurant.

738
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.850
I go into beautiful comedy rooms set up perfectly.
Probably 150 people maybe.

739
00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.720
Yeah,
but San Diego,
a sweet spot for,
yeah,

740
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.880
it was 60% Latino and they loved me.

741
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.550
I,
there's an old,
this is what this is.
When you feel great about being,
as I said,

742
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:01.130
like a Mexican woman,
the front,
she had to be 65 years old.

743
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.770
She goes to me after the show,
say hi to the twinks.

744
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:07.430
Those are my two producers in my pocket.
She loved my podcast.

745
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:10.670
She's like a 65 year old Mexican one.
And when I was doing the religious stuff,

746
00:42:10.671 --> 00:42:14.250
she was hanging on every word and then it was all these biracial couples and a

747
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.150
white guy with a Mexican wave.
What you know,
vice versa.

748
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:22.370
And then some white military guys and they wanted to hear me.

749
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.580
I'm doing,
I'm going to get real political.

750
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:27.920
I'm not real when you come to see me now it's a mix,

751
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.160
but my next album is going to be all puck.

752
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.210
So I was going waiting to hear for they were,

753
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.750
they perk up when I go into the political stuff.
Yeah.

754
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.420
Well there's definitely a need for this type of political thing and stand up,

755
00:42:38.421 --> 00:42:40.250
which is what I'm doing.
But that's what I thought I was gonna ask you.

756
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:43.760
Do you even consider yourself political first say no.
Yeah,

757
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.160
so it's kind of bizarre,
right?
Colin Quinn,

758
00:42:46.161 --> 00:42:48.020
and I've used this at every interview I've ever done,

759
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.920
calling queen set at 20 it goes 20 years ago.
And I said,

760
00:42:51.921 --> 00:42:55.610
I'm not really political.
Comic con not really conserved.
He goes,
Nick.

761
00:42:55.611 --> 00:42:57.230
But he goes,
you have the type of guy you could be,

762
00:42:57.231 --> 00:43:00.140
you could be telling them Mcdonald's joke and people can't tell how you voted,

763
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:05.570
which is a great quote.
That sums it up.
I go after the macro.

764
00:43:05.571 --> 00:43:07.580
It's more cultural with me,
you know,

765
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:10.960
I don't go up there and talk about the farm bill.
That was,
you know,

766
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:14.720
I went in the toilet.
Uh,
I'm,
I'm more macro.

767
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.130
I always pushed the racial stuff because to me that's the,
that's the one,

768
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:19.993
um,

769
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:25.150
issue that is the biggest gap between how it's discussed privately as opposed to

770
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:27.770
publicly.
That's the biggest lie.
And the meat.

771
00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:31.610
I can't watch another home alarm commercial where the five criminals a white,

772
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:35.890
I said that 20 years ago I've been calling,

773
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.920
I started the whole look in a dumb white father and the commercial on my first

774
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:44.720
album in 1994 I said it,
I think I was listening to Russia at the time,

775
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.270
you know,
and he sort of may be aware,

776
00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:52.340
but I watch these commercials and it's,
it's just hilarious.

777
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:56.150
But it's weird how everything's become political,
right?
Like did he use to beat,

778
00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:58.880
I was always doing political stuff.
I was a political science major,

779
00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:02.550
so I was always into early.
Yeah.
But,
but actually I,

780
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:07.160
I'm so less interested in politics more so now than I've ever been.

781
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:08.370
I like the cultural thing.

782
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.630
What we're talking about here is cultural in that that's really critical per se.

783
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.880
Um,
but it's weird that everything is politics now.
Are celebrities,

784
00:44:16.881 --> 00:44:21.730
are politics everywhere always talking the Oscars or political sports centers,

785
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.740
political.
It's kind of gross actually.
Yeah.

786
00:44:24.741 --> 00:44:29.741
It was such a media driven society and now the social media has added another

787
00:44:31.771 --> 00:44:35.400
layer,
but it's gross.
It's all about,
so we don't want to have lives outside of,

788
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.983
you know,

789
00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.820
<v 2>you got to do the detox.
I get off on the weekends and I take August,
no phone,</v>

790
00:44:40.821 --> 00:44:44.090
no nothing.
All of August.
August.
No,
no news.

791
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.560
Tried to avoid CNN while you're [inaudible] helicopter.

792
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:52.280
I can't go to an airport.
I can't go to the gym.
I can't go to the burger joint.

793
00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:54.820
Literally just go into the gym.
I have to walk around like this.
But I,

794
00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:56.090
but I did it because I was like,

795
00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.950
I think you've got to escape some of this lunacy.
Oh,
you have or it,
again,
I,

796
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.590
and I don't even realize it,
but yeah,

797
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.870
like I accidentally put on a movie the other night.
I was like rocky free,

798
00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.390
whatever,
you know,
nothing but it felt so good.

799
00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.470
It actually felt like I was eating cotton candy is as opposed to always put just

800
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:18.250
flipping out.
But uh,
um,
yeah,
you're right.
I mean,

801
00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.220
and actually Joe List is calm again,
comics of that to me a couple of years ago.

802
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.670
He goes,
you watch too much news.
I go,
I have to defend myself from Asheville.

803
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.030
I was like,
yeah,
but uh,
so how do we,

804
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.090
how do we push back against the mob that,
that seems to be the big thing now.

805
00:45:32.091 --> 00:45:34.160
It's like,
I actually think there's some momentum there.

806
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.390
I think we're waking up a certain amount of waking up.
But here's the

807
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:38.870
<v 1>problem,
Dave,</v>

808
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:45.550
what we're watching now is a plan that the left put together 50 years ago,

809
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.420
infiltrating schools and all the institutions taken over,

810
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:55.430
you know,
Hollywood and it's all comic differ.
That's why they're winning.

811
00:45:55.910 --> 00:46:00.640
I don't think we will be able to,
you know,
I mean,
it'll take 40 years to,

812
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:05.270
to,
we have to grab back to institutions like,
you know,

813
00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:09.260
like detainment and,
and so what does that mean?
I mean,
well,
I guess we're doing,

814
00:46:09.261 --> 00:46:12.810
we'll be gone right when it will be all we got.
That's the product I am.

815
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:18.170
Unless again,
unless it comes to violence,
um,
I,
but yeah,

816
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:23.150
it's gonna take forever.
Oh,
as we have,
we don't as we have is Fox News,

817
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:24.220
you know,

818
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.710
<v 2>uh,
Fox are the only ones who put me on there.</v>

819
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.390
They the only ones I can to get my liberal credit left and right.

820
00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.470
I can't get a call from the other ones.
I have an interesting history.
Well,

821
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.870
you can't,
you're a gay conservative.
Yeah.

822
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:39.200
And I don't even call myself conservative.
I'm,
I'm actually a liberal,

823
00:46:39.201 --> 00:46:42.730
but there's no,
I'm a real liberal.
There's no,
there's none of us left anymore.

824
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:46.940
That's what Louis is.
Louis couldn't be more fair.
You know,

825
00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:52.070
when we used to argue race and Paul,
even when I did his,
his show on Fx,
you know,

826
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:56.780
uh,
um,
Horace and Pete,
he,
you know,
he wrote my,
and I would,
he would,

827
00:46:56.781 --> 00:47:00.520
let me look at it at first,
you know,
and he looked,
he's an all school there,

828
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.080
but it looks at both sides are thoughtful about it.

829
00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:04.240
But isn't that the irony with,

830
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:07.520
with what's happened to the comics is that most comics inherently I think are

831
00:47:07.521 --> 00:47:08.090
libertarians.

832
00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.330
Most comics want to be able to say whatever they want and live however you want

833
00:47:11.331 --> 00:47:14.330
it know,
and I'm going to live however I want,
but they've been like,

834
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:17.750
they've been brainwashed.
They've been like,
yeah,
it's even worse.

835
00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:20.810
They'd been just infected by this thing that I guess,

836
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.110
I guess it will in the short term,
give them some success or something.

837
00:47:24.111 --> 00:47:26.690
So it's easy to do it,
you know,
and what's creeping me out.

838
00:47:26.691 --> 00:47:30.030
It seeped into management now.
Like people who run the clubs.
Yeah.

839
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:34.030
That's what creeps me out.
Is that happening?
I haven't encountered that.

840
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:38.350
Kurt Metzger get in trouble for doing a rape joke or yeah,
they send them all,

841
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:42.770
but don't tell him why.
And Bobby Slayton going after,
you know,

842
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:46.660
Joe out some black woman in the crowd and she got offended and now the helium

843
00:47:46.661 --> 00:47:51.490
doesn't want to use him.
How could you love Bobby slate?
I mean,
um,

844
00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.840
and I mean,
where are we done Rickles B right now?
You know what I mean?

845
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.450
And that was,
he didn't hold the right reasons.

846
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:01.690
Every ethnic joke was for the right reasons because we're all equal in this

847
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:03.190
country.
You freaks.

848
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:07.480
He when he was on to let them in a few years ago,

849
00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:10.570
one of his last appearance that's probably going on 10 years ago,

850
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.650
they had a camera and a bar next door,

851
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.280
like in the lobby and the two black older black woman at the bar or whatever,

852
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:21.750
and Rick calls and I go,
hey,
oh hey.
And they're looking around at the camp,

853
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:26.320
you know,
what are you drinking them [inaudible] married,
whatever,

854
00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.410
ripple and all these,
I'm going home.
Even me,
I'm sitting home gone,
you know,

855
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.190
and they still don't know where the Cameron [inaudible] and then you hit records

856
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:34.810
goes and they wonder why they can't get any work.

857
00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.580
Even the crown of lemons like,
Nah,
you know everybody,

858
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:44.560
everybody across the board.
Not that you have to,

859
00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:45.670
that's my role to,

860
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:49.740
I don't feel I need to be balanced because when I sit home and I watch how white

861
00:48:49.741 --> 00:48:52.330
men are portrayed and commercials and on TV and in movies,

862
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.480
I feel no need to balance it out after the show.
People go,

863
00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:59.470
why did you make fun of white people?
I go,
go home and watch TV.
Yeah.
Well,

864
00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:04.471
it does seem like it's coordinated what's going on in this endless of straight

865
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.120
white men and that,

866
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.240
that politicians are doing it constantly that it's about white men.

867
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:14.950
It's like you are racist.
You people who call everyone racist,
you are racist.

868
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:18.250
Congrats.
Oh yeah.
You can generalize now about white guys.
Yeah.
I mean,

869
00:49:18.251 --> 00:49:21.840
I've been hearing that phrase forever.
Typical typical frat boy,
you know,

870
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.600
that's code for White.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.

871
00:49:25.601 --> 00:49:29.920
You said it's coordinated.
It really is,
isn't it?
I mean,

872
00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:33.520
this is where it's a conspiracy.
Colin Quinn has egos.
It's not a conspiracy.

873
00:49:33.521 --> 00:49:36.370
It's so big that it's not a conspiracy.
That's his theory.

874
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.370
It's not that it's that infiltrated me ever in academia.

875
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.100
They don't even have the kitchen.
And I'm like,
no,

876
00:49:42.101 --> 00:49:46.030
I still think there's 10 guys in a room.
So that's uh,

877
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:50.330
it depends how far you want to go down.
Like,
yeah,

878
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:51.970
from a gay naturally,

879
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:54.950
now two of them are black and I don't know what the other four,

880
00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:58.480
but it does feel like an agenda because they follow a certain,

881
00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.280
every commercial has that certain,
you know,
yeah.

882
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:05.470
That progressive progressive commercials would show US Gillette.

883
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.890
You must have loved that one.
Oh my God,
I couldn't believe it.

884
00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:14.090
That's Gillette as in Robert Craft.
They owns the Patriots.
Right.
Actually.
See,

885
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.690
I'm up.
You know,
I'm,
I'm a die hard patsy.
I go,

886
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:21.530
I don't even know if I'm gonna Watch the Super Bowl,
but a infuriated.
Yeah,

887
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.580
but how about the progressive commercials?
George shores,

888
00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:28.190
that's one of his companies by the way.
I see have auto insurance.
Yeah.
Yeah.

889
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.960
<v 1>Those are the worst as far as emasculating white guys,
especially the,
the,</v>

890
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:34.880
the latest one that I,
the guy,
he's in a,

891
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.720
he's got like a members only jacket on and he's got a black buddy and they're

892
00:50:38.721 --> 00:50:42.590
going out in,
the black guys have bills.
My best friend,
but he's really changed.

893
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.050
He's handing out directions to the club,

894
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:47.600
get all that he printed out and you know,

895
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:52.370
can we get some Jalapeno poppers plays and he's get Khakis on and he's playing,

896
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:56.690
you know,
a guitar on the dance floor.
Just this,
just the,

897
00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.010
I mean it doesn't even bother me anymore because I started picking these things

898
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:04.630
out years ago.
But this one,
it is brutal.
You might have a,

899
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.820
it would be like having a black guy tap dancing and fried chicken and a

900
00:51:07.821 --> 00:51:11.720
commercial that,
you know,
that offensive.
And the movie,

901
00:51:11.721 --> 00:51:16.430
I just watched that movie green book.
Oh,
I didn't see it.
Try to watch that one.

902
00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.490
Especially if you're Italian.
You talk about offensive.

903
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.900
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Oh my God.

904
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.070
<v 2>I can't believe we don't.
We over God.
Italians have the sentencing,</v>

905
00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:31.350
we have a statue.
They literally have an Italian guy.
He had a wife beat a fold,

906
00:51:31.351 --> 00:51:34.170
a whole pizza
and eat it.

907
00:51:34.171 --> 00:51:37.170
And then the black guy in the movie doesn't even know how to eat fried chicken.

908
00:51:37.171 --> 00:51:40.220
He had never had fried chicken,
was a stuffy,
raised,
you know,

909
00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:41.820
we'll remember later.
He doesn't know how to hold it.

910
00:51:41.821 --> 00:51:44.480
Like a guy who had commercials and infomercials on how to use a camera and

911
00:51:44.481 --> 00:51:48.840
payload.
Is this stuff that happened to you?
I mean,

912
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.560
it's propaganda data.
Remember when,

913
00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:56.750
when Anthony Scaramucci had to step down after two days is Tom's director.

914
00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:00.540
But every joke was about him being Italian and in the month and I didn't see

915
00:52:00.541 --> 00:52:05.370
Italians rioting or screaming and it was just like,
no,
we did all right.

916
00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:10.820
<v 1>You know?
Yeah.
That's why we can take it.
But I,
I it just this see this movie,</v>

917
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:15.470
it's why I don't go to the movies and it was so predictable.

918
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.110
I should brew on the ending for everybody.
But uh,
oh,
I didn't know how to,

919
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.830
I've never had fried chicken before.
And he's,
and the Italian guy is just like,

920
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.360
they projected everything like,
uh,
black stereo,

921
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:33.140
typical behavior on him and his character.
It was just a reverse of roles.

922
00:52:33.141 --> 00:52:36.140
They sat down and literally did cross referencing.
It looked like.
Yeah.

923
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:36.830
You know what I mean?

924
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.980
<v 2>Do you ever get worried that you just,</v>

925
00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:40.840
even though you said it's infiltrating the clubs,

926
00:52:40.841 --> 00:52:42.670
that like management and the rest of Hollywood,

927
00:52:42.671 --> 00:52:46.320
that you're just not going to get other gigs or will be passed up on all that

928
00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:47.163
stuff?
Yeah,

929
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.780
<v 1>I've given up on Hollywood a long time ago.
Um,</v>

930
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:56.390
I'll always,
uh,
you know,
stand up,
there's always going to be a place,

931
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:58.610
even when they're trying to shut down speech,

932
00:52:58.611 --> 00:53:02.240
it's going to make it better for guys like us,
I think in the,
in the long run.

933
00:53:02.241 --> 00:53:06.560
But um,
yeah,
I've,
I've given up on that.
Yeah,
I like it.
I mean,

934
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:09.910
if somebody wants to throw me in a film or whatever,
I told my agent,

935
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.040
I go up to breakdown,
doesn't say nick,
Nick Depalo type.

936
00:53:13.041 --> 00:53:17.900
I don't want to do it pretty cocky.
Um,
but uh,

937
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:22.140
thank God to stand up and the Internet podcast,
you know,

938
00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:25.980
you think we're going to be better off in a couple of years or not?
You think?
I

939
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.750
<v 2>mean that,
that's where we're at,
right?
Like</v>

940
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.640
when you say better off as a nation,
are you and I is uh,

941
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.100
well I mean just generally like just this look,
if we,

942
00:53:35.101 --> 00:53:37.560
let's pretend the civil war doesn't come back in five years.

943
00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:41.790
Where do you think we're at?
Um,
we're on the brink of civil war.

944
00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:44.850
You're,
you're going bullish on this side.

945
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:50.660
<v 1>Where else we can go that there's one side that doesn't want to play is one</v>

946
00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:54.140
side.
It has no,
you know,
you can't keep calling people bigots.

947
00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.310
People who go out and work and bust their ass blue collar people that make this

948
00:53:58.311 --> 00:53:59.780
country great.
Sounds Corny,

949
00:53:59.781 --> 00:54:03.080
but they do and you're going to keep pointing your finger column racists and

950
00:54:03.081 --> 00:54:06.470
bigots and,
and,
and take more.
They confiscate their money.

951
00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:10.780
Ocasio Cortez and her stupid plan.
Yeah.
Yeah.

952
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.950
<v 2>Percent.</v>

953
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:15.220
If you live in New York City and you're over making over 10 million and it's

954
00:54:15.221 --> 00:54:15.491
like,
yeah,

955
00:54:15.491 --> 00:54:17.830
we'd all love to make 10 million doesn't mean the government gets to take it

956
00:54:17.831 --> 00:54:20.530
just because they want to.
And that's confiscation.
But she's moral.

957
00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:23.200
She said it's moral.
That's how they do it.

958
00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.860
<v 1>If you are immoral,
right.
If you are amoral,
they can call you whatever you want.</v>

959
00:54:27.861 --> 00:54:30.290
That's the whole Nazi,
you know,
Trump's in now if he's a Nazi,

960
00:54:30.291 --> 00:54:33.980
you can kill him if he really believed that.
Right.
That's what they do.

961
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:38.030
That's what gets me the most that sanctimony yeah.
On the left of,

962
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:38.791
<v 2>Oh,</v>

963
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:42.810
they're just doing all the shit that they're claiming everyone else projecting

964
00:54:42.811 --> 00:54:43.531
on us.
It's like,

965
00:54:43.531 --> 00:54:47.400
imagine what it'll be like if these guys have the political power and the tech

966
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:50.760
power while you're going to do all the time.
Well,
that's the thing.

967
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:53.580
They're going to do all of the things that they say Trump is doing,

968
00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:57.780
but nobody's in jail over free speech right now.
No.
You know,
it's like once,

969
00:54:57.781 --> 00:54:59.510
my biggest fear.
Yeah.

970
00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:04.790
<v 1>Um,
that they have,
they have labeled Trump,
you know,</v>

971
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:05.390
I mean,

972
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:10.200
just relentless on this guy and they create chaos and people eventually going to

973
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:12.380
get tired of the chaos.
Even if you like Trump.

974
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.470
That's what I think their plan was.

975
00:55:15.471 --> 00:55:19.880
The left just constant chaos with this guy,
accused them of everything.

976
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.790
And eventually,
even the people in the middle of my God,
we have to,

977
00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:26.660
this is tiring right?
Yet,
even though I love what he's done,

978
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.590
I love how he's exposed the swamp.
I really,
you know,

979
00:55:30.591 --> 00:55:32.960
I didn't like him as an entertainer and stuff.
One of the apprentice,

980
00:55:32.961 --> 00:55:34.160
I never watched any of that garbage.

981
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:37.740
I loved him for what he's done to expose the,

982
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:40.840
these liberal fascists in their crazy ideas.
You

983
00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:44.690
<v 2>most get them to make,
take any position now too,
because if Trump says anything,</v>

984
00:55:44.691 --> 00:55:47.960
they're automatically against it.
So when he's antiwar,
they're pro war.

985
00:55:47.961 --> 00:55:50.950
I mean it's actually an unbelievable,
yeah,

986
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.930
it's like we're scaling back wars and now they're for more war in Syria.

987
00:55:53.931 --> 00:55:57.680
You're first staying in Afghanistan like what the hell is going on here?
I know.

988
00:55:57.681 --> 00:55:59.620
I thought you were the anti war progressing.
Oh,

989
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:03.050
<v 1>they soap blinded and again,
and nobody mentioned this.</v>

990
00:56:03.051 --> 00:56:04.850
Everybody ways and why did they hate him so much?

991
00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:09.560
I go because he's an Alpha male,
blonde haired,
blue eyed billionaire.

992
00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:14.900
That's why nobody brings that up.
He embodies the devil for them.

993
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:19.280
And older white guy,
billionaire,
you know,
Alpha male.

994
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.840
Who Greg says he likes to grab women's posts.
That's,

995
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:28.270
<v 2>that's evil to them.
All that is evil.
Nobody ever brings up,
why are,
you know,</v>

996
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:32.020
they always dance around it on shows on Fox.

997
00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:35.890
And I'm trying to think what you're going to get in the most shit for in the

998
00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:37.210
last hour.
What I'm going to,
what,

999
00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.130
what you're going to get in the most shit for it for the last hour.

1000
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:42.460
What do you mean?
Just as you said,
hey,
let's grab 'em by the Pussy.
It's like,

1001
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:42.641
you know,

1002
00:56:42.641 --> 00:56:46.360
cause there's always people waiting to watch something for an hour and find the

1003
00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:49.840
10 seconds that they can grab them and,
and they'll edit it.
Yeah.

1004
00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:53.770
I don't give a fuck.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's all.
He can't hurt me anymore.

1005
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:59.920
Um,
but uh,
that's not why I love him cause he said that.
I'm just saying,

1006
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:03.070
yeah,
no,
I got you.
I got you.
But I always had that in the back of my head,

1007
00:57:03.071 --> 00:57:07.000
you know?
Oh absolutely.
No,
I don't.
Right before I do an interview,
I go,

1008
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:11.110
this is how it's gonna go.
Um,
what are the,
how are they going to hurt me?
I mean,

1009
00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:15.520
going to kick me off my own podcast,
or it's not like I'm on an ABC Sitcom or,

1010
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.650
right.
Well,
they could start going for servers and,
you know,

1011
00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:21.380
tried to pump everybody off all of these social media sites.
I mean,
that's,

1012
00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:24.460
perhaps there's some people working on a solution to that,

1013
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.420
if you know what I mean.
I heard that.
I'm praying that it's true.

1014
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:32.740
I'm in the middle of reading his book right now,
that guy or that guy,

1015
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:38.080
and he's brilliant.
And the,
I was,

1016
00:57:38.081 --> 00:57:39.700
I get from the book because you're supposed to do the right thing.

1017
00:57:39.701 --> 00:57:41.740
Who wants to look that way?
It's very boring.
Yeah.

1018
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:47.980
It's better than the alternatives.
[inaudible] right.
But,
you know,
yeah.
Um,
I,
yeah.

1019
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:51.610
I hope that comes to fruition.
All right.
Well,
all right,
let's,
uh,

1020
00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:55.390
let's do a gig together.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Please.
Yeah.
All right.

1021
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:59.230
We're gonna make it happen.
All right,
cool.
Uh,
everybody can follow.
Nick,

1022
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:03.580
can I send them to your Twitter?
Set them to nick.
Dip Dot.
Give Dot.
That's right.

1023
00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:07.950
And I can show the Nick Depaulo show.
It's,
it's free on Monday and Wednesdays,

1024
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.660
streams on youtube and Facebook live and a few other places.

1025
00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:14.260
And then a Tuesday and Thursday.
It's a patriot,

1026
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.940
but you can do it all at my website.

1027
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:19.540
And we made it so simple because I'm not a tech guy either,
but nick,

1028
00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:23.170
dip.com and that's where you go and come see me live because,
uh,

1029
00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:28.540
still my bread and butter,
Nick,
dip.com and don't forget to try the veal.
