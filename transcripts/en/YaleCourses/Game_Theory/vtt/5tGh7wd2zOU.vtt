1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.300
Okay.
So I want to set up on a,
a new topic today.
Uh,
and to get us started,

2
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:07.350
I thought we'd play a game.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.150
So the game is going to be cold cash in a Hass and we'll see what this game is

4
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:15.120
like in a minute.
So the idea is this,
that we to Paez,

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:17.250
I'm gonna pick on two of you,
I hope.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.580
I hope I can find people who brought some money to class.
All right,

7
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.840
so play a one.
We'll have a choice.
Play a one can put nothing,

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.620
$1 or $3 into a hat.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.250
The hat will then be given to play a two.

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.413
<v 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.580
<v 0>And play a two can look at what's in the hats and either she can match what's in</v>

12
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.430
the hats.
I add the same amount in.
So one,

13
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:47.290
if it's one or three of its three or she can simply take the cash.

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.250
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.700
<v 0>All right.
The payoff,
this game will be as follows,
right?
Play a one.</v>

16
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:54.410
If they put nothing in,
they're not going to get in the thing.

17
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.820
If they put one in and it's matched,
then they double their money.

18
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.830
So they get to back.
If they put three in at it's matched,

19
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.790
then they double their money.
So they get six backups,
they'll net three.
Uh,

20
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.470
however,
if they put one in and play a two takes it,

21
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.220
they've just lost their dollar.
I,
if they put $3 in and play a two takes it,

22
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.140
they've lost $3.
Hi Ron.
Everyone understand that?

23
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:24.350
Pretty simple from player to his point of view.
Uh,

24
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.750
if play a two matches,

25
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.850
then they get them their investment back plus a dollar 50.

26
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.100
If they matched one look at two 50 back at all and they get their investment

27
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.490
back plus $2 if they match three.
So that's if they,

28
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.200
if they get five back at all.

29
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.770
And of course if they sent me to take the money out of the hat and put it in

30
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.190
their pockets,
then that's what they get in the game.
I just,
once again,

31
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:54.050
if play a two matches with $1,
$1 and a half and she matches,

32
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.960
then she gets back to 50 for a profit of one 50.

33
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.000
If there's $3 and g matches three,
she gets back five for a profit of two.

34
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.870
And if she simply takes the money out of out of the hat and puts it in her

35
00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:10.700
pocket,
then she gets how much money was in the hat.
All right,

36
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:14.900
so I hear will be the provider of the hat.

37
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.040
We'll use the same hat we use before and if necessary I provide sheets of paper.

38
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:23.090
We can write IOUs on front.
I'm hoping we can play for real cash.
Uh,
later on.

39
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:25.970
We could.
Nice to get a chair here.
But for now,
let me just go down here

40
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.570
and I'm going to grab this mic.
All right.
Who here wants to be player one?

41
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:35.990
Who brought some money to class today?
I'm quite willing to pick on somebody.

42
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.670
All right,
good,
good,
good.
So play a one is,
uh,
what's your name again?
Justin.

43
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.540
Justin.
To hold them to that hat for a second.
All right.
And uh,

44
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.440
who wants to be player too?
All right.
So this gentleman here,
his name is Nate.

45
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.130
Nate's.
All right,
we have Justin in Nate's.
All right.
So Justin,

46
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:55.010
you have to decide how much money you're going to put in the hat.

47
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.090
Did you make some money tonight?

48
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.990
But to make sure you have always borrow some from your neighbors.
All right,

49
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.100
I'm going to put in a buck.
All right.
All right,

50
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:08.101
so the money's been put on the hat and delivered to a knife.

51
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.900
It's,
I'm going to put in the buck tears that I get.
All right?

52
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.400
So if we empty out the hat,
here's our beautiful pink cat.

53
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.970
Really had the hat passed across the room rather than have me do it,

54
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.260
but we have $2 on the hats.
So I'm going to pay each,

55
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:24.040
I'm going to pay a,
what am I going to pay?
I'm gonna pay player a one,

56
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.310
a $2 I got to give back to the original dollar and give them to in a second and

57
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:34.030
I'm going to play play a to a dollar 50 you just hold the hat.

58
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.430
We'll do that for the $2 and 50 when you get your money back.

59
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.610
Trying to cheat.
You hear me?
All right,
so play.

60
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.730
I'll get you the rest of the second.
I got a second for now.

61
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.620
It's your double the money.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Here.

62
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.760
This is one reason to take this classes and you play while you get money.

63
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.260
All right,
now let's just try again.
All right,
so we had one round of this.

64
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:59.230
It's to have another round horse will be player one now.
All right,

65
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:03.190
so Katie is buyer one.
All right,
can you bring some money?

66
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.620
All right.
And who wants to be pled to further away?
Um,
uh,

67
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.000
Steven,
isn't it that right?

68
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.200
So Steven's going to be player too and he brings him cash?
I think so.
All right.

69
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.590
All right.
Otherwise borrow it from your neighbors.
I can have IOUs here.

70
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.150
So here's the hands.
You got coins.
Ah,
ah.

71
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.770
All right.
All right,
well putting,
okay,
great.
So to post that,
post that down,

72
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:29.140
we'll see if it makes it that just the honesty of the classic

73
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.170
working its way down.
I'm gonna have to,
we go,
here we go.
Oh,
we're down to Steven.

74
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.880
Okay.
Check how much is in there.

75
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.410
You can decide whether they match or not,

76
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.230
or is it Steven's going to match as well?

77
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.040
All right.
Once again,

78
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.610
we have this time rather annoyingly a dollar and some coins in here,

79
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.880
which I will empty on the stage to prove to everybody.
All right?
And I will,

80
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:57.330
I will.
All right,

81
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.130
North Koreans in here throwing matches in a second and give it back to you guys,

82
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:02.150
right?
Everyone understand the game?
All right.

83
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:03.580
Ever understand how this game works.

84
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.090
So we're gonna spend a while discussing this and we'd go and playing.

85
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.170
He said eventually lose so much money.
I'm going to run out of lunch money.

86
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.260
Put Ca's would objects.
All right.

87
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.840
So what I want to do is I want to analyze this game.

88
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:20.650
I want to think about what this game's about.
What's really going on here?

89
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.710
All right,
so first,

90
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.050
this is just a little game in both putting some money in a hat,

91
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.770
but I want to suggest to you that this is a,

92
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.870
a toy version of a much more important game.

93
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.230
This is a toy version of a game involving a lender and the borrower.

94
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.770
So you could think of our player ones here.
That was Katie on the second round.

95
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.040
And uh,

96
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.130
Justin on the first round and Justin on the first round as I imagine them

97
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.780
working in an investment bank or perhaps in a venture capitalist firm,
right.

98
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.260
And what they're doing is they're giving a loan to somebody,

99
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.390
some budding who's come up with a new project.

100
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.070
So Steven in round two and who is my budding entrepreneur in round one?

101
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.070
What was your name?
Nate.
In round one,

102
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.490
I've come up with some budding products that they've left Yale perhaps after

103
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:11.420
their junior year.

104
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.470
They doesn't know they've left early cause they've got some great idea for

105
00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:17.330
something which is going to make the millions who either it's a new mouse trap

106
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:20.780
or a new version of Facebook or something and they go to the,
oh,
that's hard,

107
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:23.120
isn't it?
To something better than the new version of Facebook.
Right.

108
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.680
And they go to the,
there's venture capitalist firm,
uh,

109
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.750
maybe it's some firm in New York or maybe it's the Yale Investment Trust,

110
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.290
whatever.

111
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.310
And they explain this great idea to them and they asked for some money to invest

112
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:38.230
in this firm,
to buy machinery and to pay early wages and so on.
All right.

113
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.850
And the lender,
the lender,
the Buckeye works,

114
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:45.230
the venture capitalist firm has to decide how much money to invest in this

115
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:49.880
project.
Right after having a off.
This money has been invested in the projects.

116
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.460
The person who borrowed it face these choices,

117
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.030
they could go forward with that project,
work hard,

118
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.310
spend the money on the things they're supposed to span,

119
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.480
or they could just disappear to Mexico.
All right.
All right.

120
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.660
Go back to Yale for that matter.
All right.

121
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.240
And there's actually something in between they could do,

122
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:10.220
which is less romantic than disappear into Mexico.

123
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.990
They could just not work particularly hard shirk perhaps join joining someone

124
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:18.440
else's projects and just let the money run down without the lender really

125
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:23.090
knowing about it.
Alright.
So this is a very real problem that some of you,

126
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:26.270
if some of the budding entrepreneurs in the room are going to face when you

127
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:29.870
leave gale and more of you who are going to end up working for investment banks

128
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.470
apps unfortunately are going to face as well.
All right.
Okay.

129
00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:38.150
So gonna spend the whole of today analyzing this,
but before we even start,

130
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.750
let's notice that there's something different about this game.

131
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:43.460
Other than that sheer triviality.

132
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.540
There's something different about this game than games we've played all the way

133
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:52.220
up to the midterm so far.
What's different about this game?
What's different?

134
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.840
Yeah.
Can I um,
can I get a mic in here?
Sorry.
Ah,
yes.
What's different?

135
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.620
Moves aren't simultaneous.
The moves and not simultaneous.

136
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.280
This is a sequential move game and put the rules up here

137
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.920
and bring this down.

138
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.360
So for the first time we're looking at a sequential

139
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.300
<v 1>move game.</v>

140
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.080
<v 0>I'm waiting to spend most of the rest of the term looking at sequential move</v>

141
00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:30.100
game where it needs to kick games that involve sequential elements.
Now,

142
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:32.710
what's really what makes this as sequential move game,

143
00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:33.910
let's be careful about this.

144
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:39.090
What makes it as a sequential move game is not simply that pile one moved first

145
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.460
and play out two moved second.
Although that's true.

146
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.060
What really made this a sequential move game is that play to knew what player

147
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.110
one had done before he got to make his move.
Right?

148
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.600
It isn't the timing per se that matters.
It's going to turn out.

149
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.750
It's the fact that player to could observe player one's choice before having to

150
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:04.860
make his or her choice that matters.

151
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.490
And notice just while we're on the subjects more than that,

152
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.770
play a one knew this was going to be the case.
All right,
so let's get that down.

153
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.610
Sorry.
In this game,

154
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.780
play at two news.

155
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.700
Hello Ari.
One's choice

156
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.040
before she chooses she being planned to four p let's play before two chooses.

157
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.530
Alright.
And second play on one

158
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.420
news that this

159
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.210
will be the case.

160
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.263
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.500
<v 0>And the way we dramatize this just now is play a one.
Put the money in the hat.</v>

162
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.710
The hat was transported across the classroom with people.

163
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.020
Very honestly not stealing the money to play a,

164
00:10:02.021 --> 00:10:04.210
to play a two could look in the hat,

165
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.740
could see how much money was in there before Steven or Nate had to make that

166
00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:11.980
choice.
Is that right?
All right,

167
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.510
so how do we go about analyzing games that have this sequential structure?

168
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.000
So turns out that a useful way to analyze them on the way I want to get us used

169
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:25.380
to today already is to draw a tree.
So the first half of the cost,

170
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:28.660
we'd do a lot of matrices.
Now we're going to draw trees.

171
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.870
And for those people who haven't seen trees before,
not a big deal.

172
00:10:31.871 --> 00:10:35.080
It's an object that looks like a tree.
That's why it's called a tree.
All right,

173
00:10:35.081 --> 00:10:38.130
so let's have a look during this particular game.

174
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.440
Here is player one making her choice and in fact she has three possible choices.

175
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.510
She can put nothing one or three into the hat.

176
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.910
All right?
Play a two then chooses,
well,

177
00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:57.940
they're really pay a two only has choices to make if there's the money in the

178
00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:02.941
hat and play a two has two choices in this particular game.

179
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.080
Any of the case,

180
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.260
I the player two is going to add a dollar or $3 into the hat or they're going to

181
00:11:12.761 --> 00:11:17.350
disappear off to Mexico taking our investors lunch money with them.

182
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.190
All right and let's put down the payoffs.
So let's put down as pay offs.

183
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.130
The net gains they make.
All right,
so if nothing goes in,

184
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.520
no one makes any money.
So zero,
zero be the payoff.

185
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.690
If one is matched by one,
then the investor,

186
00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:38.440
the lender doubles her money to do make a net profit of one.

187
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.200
If if uh,

188
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:46.201
if the money is taken out by a Plat to then she loses one right down here.

189
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.620
If she,
if if two matches her investment of three,

190
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.870
she gets an she doubled her money again.

191
00:11:52.871 --> 00:11:56.740
So makes a net profit of three and if the money is taken out,

192
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.540
<v 1>she loses three.</v>

193
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.080
<v 0>Everyone all right with that,
let's do play a tos payoffs.</v>

194
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.570
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.510
<v 0>In the case in which he in which he matches one,</v>

196
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.720
he makes a net profit of one 50 in the case in which he just steals the one,

197
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.780
he makes a net profit of one and down here in the case where he matches three,

198
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.220
he makes a net profit of two.

199
00:12:20.221 --> 00:12:22.620
He gets five back that he did arrested three to start with.

200
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.870
And here if he just takes the money out,

201
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.500
<v 1>he makes a profit of three.
All right,</v>

202
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.570
so this game,

203
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.310
<v 0>it's just a illustrated on the board.
And for some of you,</v>

204
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:36.930
this is the first time you've seen a tree.

205
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.410
But I'm going to claim it isn't such a it isn't it a complicated object.

206
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.820
And we could a lot of time analyzing this in terms of connected graphs and so
on,

207
00:12:44.821 --> 00:12:48.780
but it isn't really worth it.
It's just a tree.
All right?
Okay.

208
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.770
So let's just make sure we understand that the payoffs here represent,

209
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.680
play a ones,
pay off and play a two page twos payoff

210
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.560
<v 1>respectfully.
All right,</v>

211
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.780
<v 0>so how do we analyze what to do in these games?</v>

212
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.790
It's a good idea always to write up the tree.

213
00:13:04.791 --> 00:13:06.440
They get a good idea to write up the matrix,

214
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.080
but how to analyze what we should do.
One,
before we do that,

215
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.090
let me just grab the mic and find out from our,

216
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.890
from our players what they should do.
All right.
All right,

217
00:13:15.891 --> 00:13:20.420
so where are,
where was my first investor?
All right,
so Justin,
why,

218
00:13:20.421 --> 00:13:25.290
why do you put $1 in there of a $1 in Houston incentive to put $1 into,

219
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.970
they're putting $3.
She's just going to take the money and run.
All right.
Okay,
so,

220
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.540
so what's,
what's just enduring,
Justin is looking forward if you like,

221
00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:35.550
he's putting himself in play or two shoes.
This was uh,

222
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.140
who was our investor are receive and Nate,
Nate,
Nate,
Nate shoes,

223
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.730
and anticipating what needs going to do.
And as Justin said,
if he puts in three,

224
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.640
Nate's going to have an incentive to take the money and run.
In fact,

225
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.460
what would need have done it and made it.
If three had been in the hat,

226
00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:52.580
what would you have done?
Um,
I like Justin,
but I would have taken the money.

227
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.200
All right.
All right.
Even though,
you know,
Justin,

228
00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:57.890
you'd taken the money and disappeared somewhere.
We don't quite know.
Right,
right.

229
00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.340
It's the same.
True for PR for the other past.
So it's okay.
You also put one in,

230
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.740
is that your explanation as well?
Same reasoning.
Okay.

231
00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:06.140
So everyone figured out what was going on I wanted to get,

232
00:14:06.141 --> 00:14:08.360
and we think probably that's try Steven.

233
00:14:08.361 --> 00:14:10.640
If it'd been $3 on a hand or what do you have done?

234
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.990
I would've taken it and taken it.
All right.
So yeah,

235
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.060
so we basically getting what the,
what's predicted here,
uh,
out of the game.

236
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.620
All right.
And let's just see that more formally,
that idea.

237
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:26.890
So the idea here is that the players who move early on in the game should do

238
00:14:27.591 --> 00:14:28.820
something we've always talked about before.

239
00:14:28.821 --> 00:14:31.490
They should put themselves in the shoes of the other players.

240
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.560
But here that takes the form of anticipation,
right?

241
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.980
That anticipating what players down the tree are going to do.

242
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.070
All right.
So the key idea here is anticipation.

243
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.023
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.670
<v 0>All right.
Well they're going to do is they're going to look down the tree.</v>

245
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.940
Imagine themselves in the shoes of the later players.

246
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.360
Look at the incentives facing those later players.

247
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.730
Imagine that they do the best they can.

248
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:06.170
There's better players do the best they can and then walk backwards through the

249
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:10.850
tree.
So the key idea here is to look forward,

250
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.820
look forward to the end of the tree and work back.

251
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.650
Look forward and work back.
All right.

252
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:26.210
And that's exactly exactly the process that Katie and Justin described

253
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:30.430
themselves as doing
right now in this tree.

254
00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:31.430
Let's have a go at this.

255
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.610
So let's imagine ourselves in Steven or neat shoes having found as they did,

256
00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:40.220
in fact,
having found $1 in the hat,

257
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.000
they then are making a choice between adding a dollar,

258
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.420
which nets to them a dollar 50,
or taking the dollar,

259
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.950
which nets them lets them one,
one 50 is bigger than one.

260
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.460
So we think they're going to go this way.
All right?
If we're happy with that.

261
00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:00.670
Conversely,
if they found themselves with $3 in the Hass,
uh,

262
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.380
then if they add an $3,
they match.

263
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.560
They're going to get $2 they're gonna net $2 if they take the money out,

264
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.660
they're going to get away with $3 all right.

265
00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:14.450
Three seems bigger than two so we think they're going to go this way.

266
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.060
I'm going to go with you.
We're assuming that these are better real payoffs.
Okay,

267
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.040
so from player one's point of view,

268
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:26.930
since player one of knows that player two we'll observe the toys before making

269
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:29.990
her own choice and since play a one can,
I can put him,

270
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.430
put him or herself in play or two shoes and anticipate this choice play a one is

271
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:38.660
essentially choosing between one.
If she puts in zero,
she gets zero.

272
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.780
If she puts in one,
she knows too,

273
00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:44.390
we'll match and she'll double Hamani and get one.

274
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.440
And if she puts in three then she knows pay a two we'll take them on the Iran.

275
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.780
In which case I'll lender will have lost $3 so she's choosing between zero one

276
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.390
and minus three I'm just going to choose one

277
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.660
<v 1>which is exactly what happened in the game.
All right,</v>

278
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.900
everyone happy with how we did that?

279
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.600
<v 0>Right?
So this idea of starting at the last player,
the player who moves,</v>

280
00:17:10.601 --> 00:17:13.300
lost,
solving out what they're gonna do,

281
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.050
and then working our way back through the tree has a name.

282
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.590
The name for this is backward induction.

283
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

284
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.250
<v 0>Am I apologize for the business school students in the room who've had this</v>

285
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.050
habit into them too many times already?
So yeah,

286
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.930
<v 1>apologize for them in advance.
Right?</v>

287
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.370
Backward induction now turns out

288
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.950
<v 0>is precisely one controversial thing about backward induction,</v>

289
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.210
which is whether you should say backward induction or backwards induction.

290
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.660
So I'm going to leave the s off and call it backward induction.
But,
uh,
uh,

291
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.850
it's up you with which when you think of the correct English is

292
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.760
<v 1>all right.
Okay.</v>

293
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.060
<v 0>So since we've got this game here,
let's talk about it a bit.</v>

294
00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:03.250
This idea of the lender and the borrower,

295
00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.280
it's not an unimportant situations we've had,

296
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.480
we've simplified it down to a very simple choice here,

297
00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.710
but it's a very basic choice out there in the real world.
All right?

298
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.630
And it's an important choice.
After all,

299
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.870
what keeps the economy running is the ability of lenders to lend money to

300
00:18:16.871 --> 00:18:21.070
businesses that then invest them profitably and are able to make returns.

301
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.600
So there's this underlies a whole bunch of what a of staff going on in the

302
00:18:25.601 --> 00:18:27.340
economy.
All right,

303
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.880
so let's talk about this in the first thing I want to talk about is I want to

304
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:34.040
point out that there's a,
there's a,
there's a problem here.
There's a,

305
00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:35.530
there's a bad thing here.

306
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.910
Much like there was a bad thing in the very first class of the,
of the semester,

307
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.940
in the very first class of the semester.
The bad thing was a prisoner's dilemma.

308
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.930
All right?
But here it's a little different,
but that's focused on it awhile.

309
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:52.060
So the bad thing is we ended up here,
none of disaster.

310
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.880
All right?
The lender doubled her money.

311
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:59.290
The borrower was able to go ahead with the project on a small scale and make

312
00:18:59.291 --> 00:19:04.270
some money.
The bad thing,
however,
is that we would have liked to end up.

313
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

314
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.110
<v 0>All right.
Hi.
Don't,</v>

315
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:15.150
we've been able to have a large projects funded with $3 and had the borrow,

316
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.630
uh,
repaid.
Those dollars are matched in effort or whatever happens to be,

317
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.590
then we'd end up at an outcome that is better,

318
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.560
not just for the lender.
It's obviously better for the landline,

319
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.430
but it's also better for the borrower.
Everyone see that?

320
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:37.310
So the outcome we'd like to have reached gets us against the lender three where

321
00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:42.311
she's only getting one where we ended up and it gets the borrower to where he's

322
00:19:42.441 --> 00:19:46.370
only getting one 50,
where we actually ended up.
Alright.

323
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.600
Why is it that we were unable to both of our pairs,

324
00:19:50.601 --> 00:19:53.480
both Justin and Nate's and Katie and Steven.

325
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.490
Why will we unable to get to here or were unable to get to here?

326
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.160
They take us what got us well,

327
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.670
what prevents us from getting to this to this good outcome?

328
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:15.180
Let's go back to to Katie a second and see if we can,
yeah,
you go ahead.
Oh,

329
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.880
I'll come to right.
All right.

330
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.600
So Katie was saying why she invested one.
I picked on Justin before.
So,

331
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.490
so you know,
here's this good outcome.
It's better for you.
It's better.
Steven,

332
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.460
who's your,
who's your borrower?
Why aren't we getting to this three,
two outcome?

333
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.850
Because if I played three,
um,

334
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:39.140
him matching my money is dominated,
right?
Strictly dominating.
All right,

335
00:20:39.141 --> 00:20:40.700
so the problem here,

336
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.850
the problem here is Katie would like to invest three if she knew that in fact

337
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:50.770
Steven was going to,
but she knows Steven's not going to match,
right?

338
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:53.920
Steven and facts,
it's gonna run off with the cash.
All right?

339
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:57.190
It's gonna end up being spent at Starbucks or something.
All right.

340
00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.320
And for Steven's point of view,

341
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.490
he would actually like to be able to borrow the $3.

342
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:07.150
He would like to be able to end up at this three two outcome as well.

343
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.670
The problem is he knows,
and Katie,

344
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.530
he knows the key to load and Katelyn is the heroes,

345
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.630
but in fact he's going to run off with the cash.
Is that right?
Is that right?

346
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.730
All right.
It's worded a bit of a problem here.

347
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:20.740
We'd like to get this good outcome,

348
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.880
but incentives are preventing us from getting there.

349
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.260
What do we call this kind of situation?
What do you call this kind of problem?

350
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.463
<v 1>Anybody</v>

351
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.250
<v 0>order takers?
All right.
This is called moral hazard.</v>

352
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.640
This is called moral
hazard.

353
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.530
How many of you have heard the term moral hazard before?
All right,

354
00:21:52.531 --> 00:21:54.390
number of people had it,
so here we are.
Moral hazard.

355
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.890
Here's the problem that the agents,
in this case,
the borrower,

356
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.150
the borrower hasn't set has incentives,

357
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.230
will have incentives to do things that are not in the interest of the principal.

358
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.060
All right?
If we're not careful and as as we would for example,

359
00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:13.080
by getting too big alone,

360
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.100
the incentives of the borrower will be such that they will actually not be

361
00:22:17.101 --> 00:22:21.690
aligned with the incentives of Orlando and that will prove to be bad for the

362
00:22:21.691 --> 00:22:22.524
lender.

363
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:28.190
But notice the existence of this moral hazard problem isn't only bad for the

364
00:22:28.441 --> 00:22:33.150
lender.
It ends up being bad for the borrower as well.
All right,

365
00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:35.970
let me give you another example.
In insurance,

366
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.970
does that class probably the classic moral hazard problem.

367
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:43.890
If an insurance company insures me against having my car stolen,

368
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.460
there's a moral hazard problem in that I animate.
Not if I,
if I,

369
00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:48.900
if the car is fully insured,

370
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:53.760
I might now have the incentive not to bother to lock my car or to leave it

371
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.700
anywhere on the street in new haven.
All right.
All right.

372
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.460
Because I'm not bearing the cost and all right,

373
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.630
so we need you to be able to the insurance companies to worry about that in

374
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.740
writing an insurance contract for me and in practice what the insurance company

375
00:23:07.741 --> 00:23:10.560
does is it forces me to take a deductible.

376
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.960
It doesn't allow me full insurance.

377
00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:16.860
It makes sure that some of the costs of having a car stolen,

378
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.060
it's gonna fall on me.

379
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.380
That's bad for me by the way because it means I can't get full insurance.

380
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.260
Alright.

381
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.720
And there was just not what happened here is rather similar in this case,

382
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.800
both the lender and the borrow would rather have a big project,

383
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:36.210
a big loan and have the uh,
have the agent pay back that loan.

384
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.290
They'd prefer the streets you outcome,
but they can't get there.

385
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:45.350
And therefore rather than having a full scale projects KCO Justin only offered

386
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.010
the borrowers as small scale project.
All right,

387
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.750
so the idea here and this example was and this example,

388
00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:55.670
<v 1>okay,</v>

389
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.560
<v 0>what happened was we kept</v>

390
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.580
the size of the project or the size of the loan.

391
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.350
You can think of this as the project if that borrowing something

392
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.370
<v 1>small
to reduce</v>

393
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:16.630
the temptation

394
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:21.963
to cheat.

395
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.160
<v 0>Okay.
To reduce that temptation,
not to re not to repay the loan.</v>

396
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.123
<v 1>All right,</v>

397
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.610
<v 0>so these problems are all over the all over society but that particularly</v>

398
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:40.500
prevalent in situations involving uh,
lenders and borrowers.
All right,

399
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.980
so a good question is how might we solve this problem?

400
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.610
A lot of you about to go out and try and borrow money to start your projects

401
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:52.650
that run your new version of Facebook would ever,
and a lot a lot more of your,

402
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.840
you said before going to end up loaning money,

403
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.820
perhaps someone else's money probably least for awhile.

404
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.370
And we want to know how you might solve this moral hazard problem.

405
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:03.900
We've seen one way to solve it,

406
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.210
one way or something to keep the size of the project small.

407
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.250
What else could we do?
We come down and try to have a discussion.

408
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:14.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

409
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.110
<v 0>What else could we do to Steven?
What else could we do?
You with a borrower,</v>

410
00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:20.950
what else can you like?
Uh,
impose laws.
We can impose laws.
Okay.

411
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.040
So we could impose laws much like we talked about in the prisoner's dilemma.

412
00:25:24.041 --> 00:25:25.600
We can regulate this market.

413
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.060
There's going to be a little bit of a problem we're gonna run into,

414
00:25:28.061 --> 00:25:32.020
in regulating the law,
uh,
in,
in,
in,
in,
in,
uh,
in using the lower here.

415
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.850
What's the problem we're gonna run into here?
I mean,

416
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.660
we do have laws that regulate borrowers and lenders.
What's the,

417
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.670
what's the law that regulates borrowers and lenders?

418
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:46.170
Bankruptcy law,
right.
So it,
right.
We have,
we have law that regulates,

419
00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:48.810
to some extent what lenders and borrowers can do.

420
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.740
One of things we do in that law is we limit the degree to which we're allowed to

421
00:25:52.741 --> 00:25:54.060
punish the borrowers.

422
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.710
It's a bankruptcy law pretty much says we're going to put some limit on how much

423
00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.550
Casey can inflict pain on Steven for running off with a bunch of money.

424
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.780
All right,
Steven,
can somebody say,
I can't repay.
I'm bankrupt.
You know,

425
00:26:06.781 --> 00:26:08.670
he's more or less,
I've allowed at a fresh start.

426
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.780
So the Lord the Lord be good here.
But what does limits to what we can do?
Right?

427
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.080
We could go back to the Dickensian world of throwing Stephen in jail for not

428
00:26:16.081 --> 00:26:19.650
repair,
not repaying the loan,
but it's tough.
There are downsides to that.

429
00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:24.510
It turns out all right.
So what else?
What else could we do?
Yeah.
Uh,

430
00:26:24.511 --> 00:26:27.320
I'm gonna have to dive in there a little bit.
So shout into the mic.

431
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.920
The venture capitalists can impose restrictions on what the person can do with

432
00:26:31.921 --> 00:26:35.770
the money.
All right.
All right.
So,
so you could try and say,
ah,

433
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.790
there's only certain things you can do with the money and for example,

434
00:26:38.791 --> 00:26:41.580
to make that credible,
what am I have to do is to say,

435
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.760
show me what you're going to do with the money.
Me The receipts.
Right.

436
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.500
I don't think you could say is I will,

437
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.300
I will only give you the money if you show me exactly how you're going to spend

438
00:26:51.301 --> 00:26:55.020
this high.
That's a good,
that's a good solution.
No,
just that one you could,

439
00:26:55.050 --> 00:27:00.030
you could regard that as changing the order of play writes a little bit like

440
00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:03.710
saying let's have the borrower have to move first.

441
00:27:03.711 --> 00:27:06.780
Let's have the borrower have to commit what their actions are going to be.

442
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:10.170
How are they going to spend the money before and shut your show the,
the,
the,

443
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:13.860
the contracts before the,
before the lender lending the money.
Right.

444
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.790
And that's a good solution.
But again,
there are limitations to this solution.

445
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.220
What are the limitations to that solution in the real world?

446
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.820
Let's go back to one of you are thinking about making millions met with your new

447
00:27:24.821 --> 00:27:29.680
Facebook.
What are the limitations to,
to uh,
having some contracts with that,
with,

448
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.510
with the bank,
with chase saying exactly how you're going to,

449
00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.800
not only at saying exactly how you're going to spend the money,

450
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.290
but actually detailing it already with contracts ahead of time.

451
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.673
<v 1>What are the problems with that?</v>

452
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.770
<v 0>Someone else was thinking of going into business here.</v>

453
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.370
Let me pick on somebody a second.
So what's your name?
Say Kelly.
Kelly's what?

454
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.300
Imagine you have some projects you're going to,

455
00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:54.900
you're going to borrow some money from chase or Mr Swenson to start this fun.

456
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.510
Why might you worry about having everything written out in contractually had to?

457
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.420
Yeah.
Um,
I mean,

458
00:28:01.421 --> 00:28:05.000
then it restricts your freedom on what your ideas are,
I guess.
Right?

459
00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.180
So one problem is that's just sheer lack of flexibility.
All right?
If,

460
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.930
if in fact the entrepreneur is not going to lead any,

461
00:28:10.931 --> 00:28:14.290
it's not going to be flexible in how they actually run the project.

462
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.140
The North Point of being an entrepreneur in the first place,
right?

463
00:28:17.141 --> 00:28:20.110
Yet there's a limit to how much control you want to give to the lender,

464
00:28:20.111 --> 00:28:23.130
the lenders,
and really wanted to run the project for you,
right?

465
00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.420
There's all sorts of their problem of timing you simply,

466
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.410
it's something not going to be possible to specify all the expenditures of a

467
00:28:29.411 --> 00:28:30.221
project up front.

468
00:28:30.221 --> 00:28:34.110
You're going to need some money to do some things ahead of time.
All right,

469
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.840
so it's a good idea.
Changing the order of play as a good idea,

470
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.260
but there's gonna be limitations to this.
What else could you do as the lender?

471
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.553
<v 1>What else could you do?</v>

472
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.150
<v 0>Thank you for loaning some money in here.</v>

473
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.350
Learning some money to one of your classmates for some project.
Let's try again.

474
00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:56.580
Maybe like blowing money over time in stages and observed progress.
Good,
good.

475
00:28:56.581 --> 00:28:57.660
So one possible he,
sorry.

476
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:02.810
One possibility is to break the loan up and give it and they come in small

477
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.060
installments.
If you do well on the first installment,

478
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:09.960
I'll give you a bigger installment next time.
All right.
I notice it's that.

479
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:12.660
That's a little bit like,
cause then we talked about the very first week.

480
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.160
It's a little bit like taking this one shot game and turning it into a repeated

481
00:29:17.161 --> 00:29:18.470
game,
right?
It's tea,

482
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.710
it's turning a one shot interaction into a repeated interaction and we'll come

483
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:25.980
back and talk about repeated interactions later on in the course.
Again,

484
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.530
notice that the might be some limitations of that.
I mean,

485
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.680
I think it's a good idea and in general you should be trying to do this,

486
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.940
but it could just be that to set up for need to set up his new Facebook and for

487
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:37.830
Steven's up his new mouse trap factory.

488
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.720
They just need a chunk of money at the beginning.

489
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:43.690
There may be some limits to how little money you can give them at the beginning

490
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.470
since they have to hire workers and set up the factory and make some big splash

491
00:29:47.471 --> 00:29:51.430
and advertising and so on and so forth.
All right,
so again,
it's a good idea,

492
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.550
but there may be limitations here.
What else could you do?

493
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:57.880
Let's have a look at the numbers on the board right now.

494
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:02.050
The numbers on the board say that if Steven's mouse trap projects,

495
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.240
we do the Facebook and the see if Steven's fact,

496
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:08.770
if even mouse trap project goes well and it ended up being a big project with

497
00:30:08.771 --> 00:30:13.150
lots of money available.
There are five units of money available in profit,

498
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.870
right?
Three plus two.
All right.
The way we've,

499
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.780
the way we've designed things so far are Linda,

500
00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.740
I gave you these payoffs in the game.
The lender is going to double her money.

501
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:24.730
She's going to get three,

502
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.820
six bactrim it to net three and Steven's going to get to,

503
00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:30.490
so the division of that five is three and two

504
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.410
but we don't have to divide the money like that.
If you're a lender,

505
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.590
you may want to think about how you divide up the spoils of a successful

506
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:40.540
projects.
All right,

507
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.430
so how else could you divide up those $5 that three plus two in a way that might

508
00:30:45.431 --> 00:30:48.070
be better for everybody?
Hey,

509
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.160
we invested $3 and 1 cent.

510
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.940
If they do that other choice and then take a little bit of a hit,

511
00:30:54.941 --> 00:30:58.900
but that way you'll still have something that's pre to optimal to the other.

512
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.480
The other choice that we came to before,
all right,

513
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.170
I'm guessing you didn't hear that,
but that was right.

514
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:03.520
So we said that's exactly right.

515
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.790
So what you could do here is you could redesign the payoffs of this projects in

516
00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:12.190
the event that it's successful.
All right?

517
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:16.990
What you could do is take these five units of profits and instead of having

518
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:19.480
three to try it in a different color,

519
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.810
we could give the the borrower,

520
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:27.870
the entrepreneur 3.1 leaving a 1.92 a the lender.

521
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.741
All right,

522
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:37.741
so we could change the payoffs of this contracts to be 1.9 3.1 in the event of a

523
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:42.040
big project.
Why does that help?

524
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:46.390
Because now our borrower needs,
or Steven,

525
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.650
where are they to end up with a hat with $3 in eds.

526
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.710
They now will find it's in their interest to match the,

527
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.580
the $3 and get 3.1 rather than three.

528
00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.930
<v 1>All right.
All right.</v>

529
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.110
<v 0>So what's,
this is an example of this,
is this,</v>

530
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:10.130
this idea of changing the contracts to give the borrower incentives to repay

531
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:12.041
incentives,

532
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:16.660
not to shirk and not to disappear with the cash is an example of what's called

533
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:17.620
incentive design.

534
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.573
<v 1>Hi.</v>

535
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.760
<v 0>The idea here is in all of businesses,</v>

536
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.030
incentives are not given by God.

537
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.130
They're designed by the people who write the contracts.
All right?

538
00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.190
And if you're in the,
you're uh,
either the borrower,
the lender,

539
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.760
you should be thinking about writing a contract that's going to achieve the end

540
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:44.594
that you want.

541
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.160
Now notice in this particular example exactly as Nate said,

542
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.260
the lender is going to take a bit of a hit here.

543
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:53.120
They're not going to get 100% return,

544
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:58.160
but the ending up doing better than they would have done by giving a small loan

545
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.140
high,
they've ended up getting 1.9 rather than one.

546
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.640
All right?
Then have a 1.9 rather than one.
So in this particular example,

547
00:33:08.641 --> 00:33:11.400
it won't always be the case,
but in this example,

548
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.880
they're taking a smaller share.

549
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:16.920
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

550
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.250
<v 0>a smaller share of a larger pie.</v>

551
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.613
<v 1>Okay.</v>

552
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:28.770
<v 0>And sometimes a smaller share of a larger pie is bigger than a larger share of a</v>

553
00:33:29.981 --> 00:33:31.690
smaller pie.
Not always,

554
00:33:31.691 --> 00:33:36.691
but sometimes the reason the pie is larger is we're able now in incentive

555
00:33:38.201 --> 00:33:41.260
compatible way,
we're able to go ahead and have a large projects.

556
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.000
So in this example,

557
00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:47.440
the smaller share of the larger pie actually ended up being bigger than the

558
00:33:47.441 --> 00:33:51.370
largest share of the smaller pipe.
So smart.
A smaller share of a larger pie

559
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:56.250
<v 1>can be
bigger</v>

560
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.140
<v 0>van,
a large share.</v>

561
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.703
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

562
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.640
<v 0>all of a smaller pie.
Not always,
of course.</v>

563
00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:15.800
<v 1>All right.
This is just an example.
All right.</v>

564
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.540
<v 0>Oh,
this must be a little bit careful here.
All right,
so this particular example,</v>

565
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.190
even though this,

566
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.400
this 1.9 this return that our lender is able to make by accepting a smaller

567
00:34:28.681 --> 00:34:31.860
share of a larger pie,
even though it's a bigger absolute return,

568
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.120
it's smaller in another sentence.
And what sense is it smaller?

569
00:34:36.121 --> 00:34:39.270
Let's be careful here.
So what time did you say,
look,

570
00:34:39.271 --> 00:34:42.300
it's 1.9 1.9 is bigger than one.
That's going to be a good thing.

571
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.080
But since some of you actually are going to go out and investment banks and you

572
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.330
might be posed this question,
let me just not let,

573
00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:50.970
let me just make sure we don't make a blunder that's going to spoil your

574
00:34:50.971 --> 00:34:53.440
interview.
So what,
what,

575
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:56.520
what might you be worried about as an investment banker about this deal?

576
00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:01.410
About this,
about this,
this contract?
Somebody else.
Anybody else?

577
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:06.660
So I'll,
I'll,
I'll come down again.
All right.
What might you be worried about?

578
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.360
Who has the be honest?
Who here is in,

579
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:13.590
has been interviewing with either investment banks or venture capital firms or

580
00:35:13.591 --> 00:35:18.210
private equity firms?
Raise your hands.
Oh,
come on.
It's getting more than that.

581
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.740
All right.
All right.
It was a hand a little bit.

582
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.880
What was the hand at the back of the hand?
Way Back here.

583
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.510
<v 1>Hello?
Yeah.
Hello.</v>

584
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.630
<v 0>So what,
what,
what might be wrong with this project?</v>

585
00:35:30.631 --> 00:35:31.740
From your point you've actually taken,

586
00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:33.090
it can kind of get on the mic on that side.

587
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.010
<v 1>It's of my head.
What might be wrong w with the product from</v>

588
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.890
<v 0>your point of view,
if you could actually just find three small projects,</v>

589
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:44.400
then you could still get 100% returns just by dividing it up.
Good.
Good.

590
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:44.880
You're going to get a lot.

591
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.920
You're going to be lots of money from Morgan Stanley or whatever it is.
Good.

592
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.570
Good.
[inaudible] name is Brian writes,

593
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.650
he's a good habitat and a could add to hire Brian Morgan Stanley.
All right.

594
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.730
All right,
so what,

595
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:59.390
what Brian said was it's true that you're making a bigger absolute return here.

596
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:04.240
This is a bigger absolute return,

597
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:09.160
but this return up here is 100% return on your capital.

598
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.090
The rate of return on capital is higher,

599
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:18.240
making 100% return on investment of one they're making a 1.9 return on

600
00:36:18.431 --> 00:36:22.270
investment of three.
The rate of return is better in the in the,

601
00:36:22.271 --> 00:36:25.390
in the smaller case,
so which is the right answer?

602
00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:30.690
Should we worry about the rate of return but a hundred percent rate of return or

603
00:36:30.851 --> 00:36:32.620
should we worry about the absolute return?

604
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.610
If you're in the business of investment banking,

605
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.680
who thinks you just worry about the absolute return?

606
00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.930
Who thinks we just worry about the rates of return?
Who thinks it depends?

607
00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:47.740
What does it depend on?
What does it depend on

608
00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.940
to keep keep you from falling off this day?
What does it depend on?

609
00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.650
Somebody you said it depends.
What does it depend on?

610
00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.170
It depends on your good compromise voter.
You get [inaudible],

611
00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.970
you know it depends on,
yeah,
the gentleman here.

612
00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

613
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.370
<v 2>Since an investment banking firm only has limited amount of money to invest,</v>

614
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:09.510
you want to see if you can get a higher rate of return investing elsewhere.

615
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.300
<v 0>All right,
so so this to this,
I think you're on the right lines.</v>

616
00:37:13.301 --> 00:37:14.650
There's two things to worry about.

617
00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:19.890
One is what is your supplier of funds to invest and the other is what's the

618
00:37:20.501 --> 00:37:23.230
other supply you're worried about as it as an investment bank or venture

619
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:27.010
capitalists or private equity investor.
What's the other supply coming your way?

620
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:30.430
Yeah,
the number of projects coming across your door.

621
00:37:30.431 --> 00:37:33.130
If you like the demand for your cafe,
the demand for your cash.

622
00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.880
Let's apply of projects.
All right.
All right,
so the,

623
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:42.070
what we have to worry about here is what is the true opportunity cost of that

624
00:37:42.071 --> 00:37:46.570
money.
All right.
If there are very few projects out there,

625
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:47.861
all right?

626
00:37:47.861 --> 00:37:51.010
Then you basically just want to want to go down the list of projects picking off

627
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.700
absolute return.
However good.
The other extreme,

628
00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.400
if there's an infinite supply of projects all coming in,

629
00:37:57.401 --> 00:37:59.320
all of which will offer a hundred percent return.

630
00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.900
Then is our banker at the back told us,

631
00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:06.120
you should just go for three small projects rather than one large one.
Right?

632
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.760
But the question is questions of which is better,
three lights,

633
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.050
which isn't as simple as saying,
yes,

634
00:38:11.051 --> 00:38:13.900
we should always go for three small projects that may not be free.

635
00:38:13.901 --> 00:38:17.680
Small projects out there that offer 100% return.
All right,

636
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.860
so what's going to matter here is what's the true opportunity costs of the

637
00:38:20.861 --> 00:38:24.160
capital,
and that's going to depend on what projects are available to you.

638
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.810
All right.
This was just an example of incentive design.

639
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.420
One example of incentive design.

640
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.880
Let's talk about other examples of incentive design.
So design,

641
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.050
it's been a lot in the news lately who,

642
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.830
who else tends to have incentive contracts other than borrowers?

643
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.950
Who else out that tends to have incentive contracts?

644
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.650
It's a big topic in the know in the news these days.

645
00:38:48.651 --> 00:38:52.460
So who has an incentive contract incentives written into their contracts?
Yeah,

646
00:38:52.461 --> 00:38:57.130
way over here.
Let me run over at the risk of blurring the camera.
All right,

647
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.090
so who else has an incentive?
My contract managers.
Managers.
All right.

648
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:05.590
So CEOs have huge incentive clauses in their contracts.
All right?

649
00:39:05.591 --> 00:39:07.660
Sometimes in the form of options,

650
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.500
why do they have those incentive causes in that contract?
Well,

651
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:13.030
there's two interpretations of this.

652
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.300
One interpretation is it's just a bad thing or they're just trying to screw the

653
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:19.540
world,
but there's a more,
there's a more,
uh,
um,

654
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.490
moderate view of this.

655
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:24.400
The more moderate view of this is that those incentive clauses in their

656
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:29.320
contracts are attempts to align the interest of the managers with the interest

657
00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:33.980
of the shareholders just as this contract is attempting to align the interest of

658
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:38.230
the and the interest of the borrower.
All right.
So by managers,

659
00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:39.610
I took him to me and CEO,

660
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:43.300
but what other kinds of managers recently in the press very recently this

661
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.200
weekend,
how been talking about incentive contracts,
uh,
somebody way,

662
00:39:48.201 --> 00:39:51.770
way over the Avnet caught on the wrong side as he's over.
Um,
yeah,

663
00:39:51.771 --> 00:39:54.820
I can I just squeeze through,
I'll try and squeeze through.
Can I squeeze through?

664
00:39:55.210 --> 00:40:00.010
Sorry.
All right,
sorry.
Here we go.

665
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.840
Where was it?
Where was,
where was my answer to that question?
Here we go,
man.

666
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:06.160
Who's a baseball teams just to manage managers.

667
00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:09.280
A sports teams also have incentive contracts these days,

668
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.670
right incentives to to achieve certain levels.
All right.

669
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.810
Here it's not quite clear to me exactly what's going on.
Right?

670
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.230
We call those incentive contracts,
but you might want to worry a little bit.

671
00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:24.010
I mean do we really think that the manager has an incentive to lose otherwise?

672
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.061
All right,
so let's talk.

673
00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:28.510
Part of what's going on with this into contracts isn't actually incentive

674
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:29.290
contracts.

675
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:34.060
Part of it is about sharing the risk [inaudible] kind of contracts have been

676
00:40:34.061 --> 00:40:36.850
written about over the weekend with Joe Torres contract for the gang gears,

677
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.900
which you turned down is partly perhaps to give them incentive to try and win,

678
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:45.250
but perhaps it's more to do with sharing the risk among the general manager and

679
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:48.760
the manager of the team if they don't make it to the playoffs,
but all right,

680
00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:49.930
this one incentive contracts,

681
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:54.160
are we seeing incentive contracts elsewhere and we've seen them since the Middle

682
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.960
Ages,
right?
In the Middle Ages,

683
00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:01.050
incentive contracts took a particular form and the form was called or two

684
00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:05.260
things.
Peace Rights.
Put it up here.

685
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:07.270
Peace Rights.

686
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.810
I did agriculture.
It took the form of sharecropping.
Yeah.

687
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.123
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

688
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.060
<v 0>What our piece rates.
Somebody want a piece rates.</v>

689
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.930
What a piece rates.
Anybody,
anyone know anyone who's on piece rates?

690
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.510
What is sharecropping?
Somebody must be from a farming state.

691
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.360
There's not somebody out here.
The guy in orange.
Yep.

692
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:42.300
Um,
sharecropping is where the landowner takes a portion of the,
um,

693
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:46.350
of the farmers crop at the end of the,
at the end of the farming season.

694
00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:46.831
All right.

695
00:41:46.831 --> 00:41:51.831
So sharecropping is a contract whereby part of the output of the farm goes to

696
00:41:53.251 --> 00:41:57.600
the landowner and part is kept by the farmer.
Got in the Middle Ages.

697
00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.800
Part of the output would stay with the peasants and part of it would go to the

698
00:42:01.801 --> 00:42:06.270
Lord of the manor.
Alright.
Peace rights or a similar idea rather than playing,

699
00:42:06.271 --> 00:42:10.290
paying wages to workers,
just bundles of cash.

700
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.630
The amount of which they're paying depends on output.

701
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.960
So piece rates would say if you produce a 17 yards of cloth,

702
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.230
then you'll get paid.
Uh,
the,
the,

703
00:42:20.231 --> 00:42:23.250
the revenue that's derived from three of them say all right.

704
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.520
Both of these forms of contracting are that partly to create incentives.

705
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:34.470
They create incentives because they create the incentive of the farmer to

706
00:42:34.471 --> 00:42:39.471
increase yields and then create incentives on the part of the worker to increase

707
00:42:39.511 --> 00:42:43.980
output.
All right,
so piece rates are a big part of the story.

708
00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.773
<v 3>All right.</v>

709
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.370
<v 0>Sense of his lines are pretty big topic and we don't really have time to go into</v>

710
00:42:50.371 --> 00:42:54.280
it much in this course,
but it's worth mentioning that in fact,

711
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.230
the Nobel prize that was one last week by those three economists we talked about

712
00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.810
was partly about incentive design.
All right?

713
00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:04.500
It's regarded as an important enough topic for the design,

714
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.550
the design of incentives across the science as a whole to have been worthy of,

715
00:43:08.551 --> 00:43:11.760
of winning the Nobel prize.
My guess is there's another Nobel prize.

716
00:43:11.761 --> 00:43:15.900
It's going to come out in this same area in the next five or 10 years.
All right.

717
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:20.090
Just make it clear.
You can have problems.
You can bet,

718
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:24.420
you can write incentives badly.
It's classic story that you've all heard of.

719
00:43:24.421 --> 00:43:28.350
I'm sure that in often in PA,
in the provision of public goods,

720
00:43:28.351 --> 00:43:31.020
let's say bridges or highways or tunnels,

721
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:35.190
the incentives for the construction companies tend to be rather badly written.

722
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.870
They,
they're meant to have incentive clauses,

723
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.790
but they never seem to quite get them right.

724
00:43:38.791 --> 00:43:40.320
It's easy to get these incentives wrong.

725
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.750
And just to prove this doesn't just happen to management.

726
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:47.190
Let me just tell a story against myself.
So a year ago,
a year we're going to go,

727
00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:52.340
I was picking fruit with my then three year old daughter and I wanted to make

728
00:43:52.981 --> 00:43:57.090
sure that we got some fruit home to eat for dinner and she didn't just eat all

729
00:43:57.091 --> 00:43:59.890
the fruit as we picked it.
These were raspberries.
Uh,

730
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:03.000
so I decided to have a rule that sounds efficient.
I said,
well,
any,

731
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.810
any item of fruit that gets picked,
that's in good condition,

732
00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:07.860
we'll take it home for dinner.

733
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.950
But if it's squashed then we'll go and we'll eat it then and there.

734
00:44:10.951 --> 00:44:12.630
Or we're picking the fruit.
All right.

735
00:44:12.631 --> 00:44:14.870
So my three year old procedures to go along the,
the uh,

736
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:19.230
bushes of Rosa is picking the Roseberry turning round to me and saying squashed

737
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.980
and putting it in her mouth.
All right.
All right.
Squashed.
Squashed.
Right,

738
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.740
which shows the three year old knows more than a professor about moral hazard.

739
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.960
Alright.
Alright,

740
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.390
so one thing we can do is worry about design in the design of the contract.

741
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.970
There's another thing we can do here.
Watch.
The other thing we can do here.

742
00:44:36.971 --> 00:44:39.720
I mean we're missing out something very basic.
What is,

743
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.580
what is it that's that our borrower,

744
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:45.390
Steven and Nate's can do or putting more generally for all of you.

745
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:49.110
If you go out and start a company and you borrow some money to start your

746
00:44:49.111 --> 00:44:51.840
company,
when you leave Yale,
what are you going to have to do?

747
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:56.840
What's the borrower?
Well,
what's the lender?

748
00:44:56.841 --> 00:44:59.750
What's the bank grew incest or what are they going to assist on

749
00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.613
<v 1>anybody?</v>

750
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.350
<v 0>They got to insist on collateral.
They're going to insist on collateral.</v>

751
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.310
What is collateral?

752
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:21.881
I'm,
I'm,

753
00:45:21.881 --> 00:45:25.210
I'm a somewhat Tom to see a few of you are going to end up borrowing money but

754
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.240
uh,
but as you haven't got trust fund,
you're gonna end up borrowing money.

755
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.950
So what is collateral?
Let's say?
Yeah.
Yes.
What's collateral?

756
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:36.560
You give someone the whole ease.
You left the bank hold onto something,
right?

757
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.100
You let the bank hold on to something in the events,

758
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.670
in the event that you default on the loan.
All right,

759
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.880
you're going to let the bank hold on something in the event that you default on

760
00:45:45.881 --> 00:45:50.780
the loan.
Now for most people here,
what are they going to post as flat as it?

761
00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:53.680
Let's assume that we can,
we're back to our original contract here.
We can't,

762
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:56.020
we can't do this.
We're back to our original case.

763
00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:00.730
What are most of you are going to end up using as collateral if you borrow
money?

764
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:05.760
Yeah,
everyone take a house.
I'm guessing that for most of you,

765
00:46:05.761 --> 00:46:08.310
I'm not going to look around the room cause I don't know how many trust from bay

766
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.640
trust from babies I got in the room.
But for most of you it's going to be what?

767
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:15.570
It's going to your parents' house.
All right.
All right,

768
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:16.943
so why?

769
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:21.540
Why is it that your parents house being posted as collateral is going to prevent

770
00:46:21.541 --> 00:46:25.280
you from disappearing to Mexico with the loan?
Well,
let's have a look.

771
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:29.250
Has it changes the payoffs?
Now if you take the money and run,

772
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.470
you disappeared to Mexico,

773
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:36.650
but you end up with $1 minus a house here and $3 minus the house.

774
00:46:38.071 --> 00:46:41.970
That of course where we're lying here on you liking your parents.

775
00:46:41.971 --> 00:46:44.370
Enough not to mind about the fact that we were sleeping in the rain,

776
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.660
but as long as that's the case along,
if that's the case with all PR,

777
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:51.270
I think with high probability you're now going to decide to return the loan at

778
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:54.490
least if you can.
Is that right now?
No,

779
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.670
just that the way in which this collateral works,

780
00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:58.830
there's a subtlety to how this classical works.

781
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.980
You might think that the way in which collateral works is that now the lender

782
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:08.460
feels safer because even if you end up defaulting on the loan,

783
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.080
at least they get this house.
All right?
And that's true.

784
00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:17.520
There's some truth in that,
but that's really not the key here,
right?

785
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.570
Frankly,
most bank lenders don't want your parents' house,
right?

786
00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:22.980
Or your parents might have very nice houses,

787
00:47:22.981 --> 00:47:26.280
but this isn't a good housing market right now and they didn't particularly want

788
00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:29.530
to see your parents on the streets.
The way in which this works is not,

789
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:34.150
not so much that it gives an extra positive return to the lender.

790
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:39.750
The way in which it works is it gives an extra negative return to the borrower.

791
00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.520
All right,
let's just do this backward induction again with the house in place.

792
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:50.380
All right,
so with this house in place as before,
you'll return the loan up here,

793
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.290
but now provided you'd like your parents enough.

794
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.500
You would also return the loan here cause you'll prefer $2 to your two to $3

795
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:04.120
minus your parents' house,
in which case you'll get a loan of three.

796
00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.070
<v 3>All right?
All right.</v>

797
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:13.110
<v 0>So the way in which the collateral worked was by hurting you enough in the Ed,</v>

798
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:13.541
or in this case,

799
00:48:13.541 --> 00:48:18.541
I go parents enough in the event of default in such a way as to change your

800
00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:22.900
behavior,
but notice it helps you.

801
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.720
So here's a subtlety coming in here.
By issuing collateral,

802
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:32.770
we actually lowered the payoff of the borrower,

803
00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.960
had certain end points of the tree.

804
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:39.160
We lowered the payoff of the borrower at certain end points of the tree.

805
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:43.840
But as a consequence,
we were able to end up at an outcome

806
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.530
that was better for the borrower.

807
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.680
Sometimes having lower payoffs can actually make you better off.

808
00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:59.640
And the reason that it makes you better off is it changes the behavior of other

809
00:48:59.641 --> 00:49:02.080
players in the game in such a way as it may.

810
00:49:02.081 --> 00:49:06.840
It may benefit you in this example by by inducing the lender to give you a

811
00:49:06.841 --> 00:49:09.990
bigger loan.
All right?

812
00:49:09.991 --> 00:49:13.620
So the way the collateral works is it lowers,

813
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.233
<v 3>yeah.</v>

814
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:22.300
<v 0>Louis,
your payoffs
if you do not repay.</v>

815
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.473
<v 3>Oh,</v>

816
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.720
<v 0>but it leads to you being better off.</v>

817
00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:31.830
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

818
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:35.340
<v 0>And the reason it makes you better off is it changes.</v>

819
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:41.200
It changes the choices of others,

820
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.230
change the choices of others in a way,

821
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.970
in a way that helps you.
All right?

822
00:49:55.971 --> 00:49:59.060
We're going to see lots of examples of that in the next couple of days.

823
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.833
<v 3>All right.</v>

824
00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.280
<v 0>No,
collateral is an example.</v>

825
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:07.910
We what have incentive design collateral is also an example of something larger.

826
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.870
The larger thing is the idea of commitments.

827
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.310
Collateral is a commitment strategy.

828
00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.530
It's a commitment strategy.

829
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.520
It commits you to repaying the loan.

830
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.410
All right.

831
00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.890
I want to give another example of a commitment strategy.
I can think.

832
00:50:35.891 --> 00:50:37.810
I think the idea of commitment's important one,

833
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:39.430
and we have just about time to do,
right?

834
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:43.600
So I wanted it to go completely away from the context of our lender borrower

835
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:46.710
game a second and look somewhere else entirely.
All right.

836
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:47.770
I'm gonna get rid of this for now.

837
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:56.400
I want to take us back to a 10 66

838
00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:57.843
<v 3>okay.</v>

839
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:00.960
<v 0>What happened in 10 66</v>

840
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:02.803
<v 3>okay.</v>

841
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:04.770
<v 0>What happened in 10 66 I know.</v>

842
00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.780
I know what he does in America and no one gets an indication anymore,

843
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:08.260
but still what I've been in 10 66,

844
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.250
the Norman conquest took place in 10 66.
Right?

845
00:51:12.251 --> 00:51:16.990
So the norm and army invades from Norman be led by William the conqueror and

846
00:51:16.991 --> 00:51:20.470
lands on the Sussex speeches at Hastings.
All right.

847
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:25.660
And what I want to imagine is a game involving the normal army or William the

848
00:51:25.661 --> 00:51:30.010
conqueror in particular,
and the Saxon Army.
All right?
So here's the little game.

849
00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.720
So we're now in the,
when they were in the area of medieval military strategy.

850
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:40.570
All right,
and here is the game.
All right,
we'll start with the Saxons here.

851
00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:43.600
The Normans have already invaded.
So I guess I guess the normal,

852
00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:47.900
I've already moved it moved.
But here's the,
uh,
here's the sacs.

853
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.770
Now me making a decision.
They're deciding

854
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:57.560
between,
uh,
fighting and the important medieval military,

855
00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.470
a military tactic known as running away.

856
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:05.550
And of course the Normans.

857
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:08.860
I got to know whether the Saxons are actually going to charge down the beach and

858
00:52:08.861 --> 00:52:13.720
attack them and they are going to have to decide whether to fight or run away.

859
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.420
All right?
And let's put the pay offs now.
Leave some space below here.

860
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:24.250
Leave some space down here on your notes.
All right?
That's what the payoffs in.

861
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:28.930
So I'm going to put the northern payoffs first and the Saxon payoff second.
Okay.

862
00:52:28.931 --> 00:52:32.340
Norman payoffs first.
Saxon payoff second.
All right,

863
00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:36.580
the pay offs are going to be like,
like,
like this.
If both,
if both sides fights,

864
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:39.100
a lot of people are not dead and we'll call that zero zero.

865
00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.310
If the sanctions fight on the Normans,
runaway,

866
00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:45.610
the Saxons get to in the Normans get one because at least they're alive.

867
00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:51.030
If the sanctions runaway in the Normans fights,
then uh,
the new,

868
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.790
uh,
New Orleans get to and the Saxons get one in.
Just flip things around.

869
00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:58.780
And if Bruce lots runaway,
then ultimately it's good for the Saxons.

870
00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:04.260
Alright,
so this is the gate.
All right,
let's be careful.

871
00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.460
I've put the Sax and pay off second the Sax and pay off the second.

872
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.120
If we analyze this game,
my backward induction,

873
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.980
we can see that the Normans are in trouble.
Why are the normals in trouble?

874
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:22.160
Because if they are tagged by the Saxons than fighting yields zero and running

875
00:53:22.501 --> 00:53:25.680
away yields one.
So they're to run away.

876
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:31.880
And conversely,
if the Saxons runaway,
then in fact the Normans,

877
00:53:31.881 --> 00:53:34.580
we'll stay in fights because it's easy to stay and fight against people who are

878
00:53:34.581 --> 00:53:38.780
running away.
Even I can do that.
Alright,
so that's uh,

879
00:53:38.781 --> 00:53:40.520
so they're going to go for two rather than one.

880
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.570
But now the Saxons face this choice.
They know that if they attack the Normans,

881
00:53:44.571 --> 00:53:47.060
the Normans will run away.
And the Saxons we'll get to,

882
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:48.950
but if the facts and run away,

883
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.190
then the Normans will stay and fight or the Saxons will only get one.

884
00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.890
So the Saxons are gonna end up fighting.

885
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.270
<v 3>All right.</v>

886
00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.830
<v 0>All right.
I want to see how we did the backward induction.</v>

887
00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:04.390
So this is not a good situation if you happen to be the Norman commander,

888
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:09.070
if you're the guy who led these troops across the channel,
all right,

889
00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:11.280
so what did William the conqueror do?

890
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.230
He burned his ships,
right?

891
00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.830
So let's now make this game a little bit more like the real historical
situation.

892
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:22.000
Here's a move that William the conqueror,

893
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.590
the king of the of the Normans can do.

894
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.770
He can either not burn his ships

895
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:33.410
or he can burn them
if he burns them.

896
00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:37.010
Then the game is rather different.
Once again,

897
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:42.040
the Saxons can decide whether to fight or run away,

898
00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:47.120
but now the Normans really don't have any choice.

899
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:52.130
They have to stay and fight because swing back to from swearing armor is

900
00:54:52.131 --> 00:54:56.320
difficult.
All right,
so the payoffs zero,

901
00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:59.300
zero and two one as before.

902
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:04.190
All right,
so we know now that the normal is going to stay and fight.

903
00:55:04.191 --> 00:55:05.940
That's all that's available to them.
I've,

904
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:08.540
I've put it that they hit that even have the option of,
of running away.

905
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:09.051
If you wanted,

906
00:55:09.051 --> 00:55:12.350
you could put running away yield to them in a minus infinity or whatever it is

907
00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:14.150
to get drowned.
All right,

908
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:18.170
so now if the Saxons,
if,

909
00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:20.120
if the Normans have burned the boats,

910
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:24.530
the sanctions knew that if they fight the Saxons,
we'll get zero.

911
00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:28.520
If they run away,
they'll get minus one.
So now they'll run away.

912
00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.230
And then from,
from William the conqueror,
his point of view,

913
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:37.390
what you choosing between,
he knows that if he doesn't burn his boats,
the Saxons,

914
00:55:37.391 --> 00:55:39.790
we'll fight and his troops will run away.

915
00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:42.640
But if he does burn his boats,

916
00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:45.610
the Saxons were runaway and his troops were fights.

917
00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:51.160
So he wants to burn his boats.
All right,
everyone.

918
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.760
Okay with example,
all right.

919
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:58.430
Now this is probably the classic example of our commitment strategy,

920
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.410
William the conqueror and this example,
or Cortez and hatch,

921
00:56:03.411 --> 00:56:04.730
the more famous example,

922
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:08.930
burn the boats to get rid of some strategies to get rid of some choices all

923
00:56:08.931 --> 00:56:12.380
together.
And you might think,
how can get reading?

924
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:15.860
How can getting rid of choices make me better off?

925
00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:21.830
And the reason in a game is picked a sequential game.
But the game generally,

926
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:26.890
the reason getting rid of can make me better off is it changes the behavior of

927
00:56:27.461 --> 00:56:31.510
people on the other side of the game in such a way as benefits me.

928
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:36.190
In this particular example,
it makes the other side less likely to fight.

929
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:38.630
<v 3>All right?</v>

930
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:40.760
<v 0>So once again,
this is a commitment.</v>

931
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:46.403
It's a commitment.

932
00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:52.100
And the way it works is this example of a commitment is actually to have fewer,

933
00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.240
to have fewer options.

934
00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:56.933
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

935
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.790
<v 0>fewer options and it changes.</v>

936
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:04.290
It changes the behavior

937
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:10.720
of others.
We didn't change the behavior of others.
It wouldn't be worth doing.

938
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:18.500
So let's just talk about this a little bit more.

939
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:22.780
There's another famous example of a military commitment strategy,
uh,

940
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:25.650
that occurs in the movie Dr. Strange love.

941
00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:27.630
How many of you have seen the movie doctor strange love?

942
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:31.490
How many even not seen the movie doctor?
Strange love.
All right,
good homework.

943
00:57:31.491 --> 00:57:34.430
Exercise for the weekend.
Rent the movie,
Dr. Strange up.
Great.

944
00:57:34.431 --> 00:57:37.520
It's very good movie.
All right.
Stanley Kubrick,
I think.
All right.

945
00:57:37.521 --> 00:57:41.420
So in the doc in doctor strange love,
there's a famous commitment strategy.

946
00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:43.970
What is the famous commitment strategy in Doctor Strangelove?

947
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.940
Somebody has going to Mike,
uh,

948
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.910
can get a mic down here that there's one on the way.
The guy in White's,
I go,

949
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:54.470
there you go.
Yep.
There you go.
Great.

950
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:57.860
Lose radio contact with the base,

951
00:57:57.861 --> 00:58:01.490
which means that they're going to end up dropping the bomb are that's true.

952
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:04.910
I was thinking more a more deliberates what was that?
One of the more deliberate,

953
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:08.180
the guy in red at,
what did that in red here.
Here we go.

954
00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:12.530
Try the Soviet constructed doomsday device.
So if their attack,

955
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.740
they automatically launched their,
all of their nuclear weapons goods.
Good.

956
00:58:15.741 --> 00:58:20.180
So the worry that the Soviets have is they think the Americans might attack them

957
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:23.810
and they worry that the Americans might attack them thinking that they won't

958
00:58:23.811 --> 00:58:27.230
retaliate because they weren't ever really have an incentive to retaliate once

959
00:58:27.231 --> 00:58:30.260
their citizens are destroyed.
So they construct a device,

960
00:58:30.261 --> 00:58:34.070
they call the doomsday device that will automatically launch nuclear missiles

961
00:58:34.071 --> 00:58:38.570
back on the Americans if the Russians are attacks.
All right.
It's a commitment.

962
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:42.950
It's a commitment device to make it credible that they will actually respond.

963
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:47.360
Were they,
were they to be attacked by the crazy Americans?
All right,

964
00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:51.650
so there's a mistake,
however,
that the Russians make.

965
00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:56.390
What is the mistake that the Russians make?
The mistake?

966
00:58:56.391 --> 00:58:59.630
The Russians make a tie.
We here,
the guy in the yellow sweatshirt here,

967
00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.760
they don't tell anyone about the machine,
right?

968
00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:09.260
They don't tell the Americans that they built the doomsday device.
All right?

969
00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.980
So this is really an important idea hidden in.
It's really a great movie.

970
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.000
Commitment strategies are a good idea.
They can make things credible,

971
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:22.210
but the only reason that having fewer strategies is good you is because it

972
00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:25.910
changes the behavior on the other side.
In this case,
it behave.

973
00:59:25.911 --> 00:59:28.790
It changes the behavior of the Saxons.
It doesn't work.

974
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:31.840
If the other side doesn't know about it,
why?

975
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:35.390
It's crucial that the other side knows.

976
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:39.610
So the other players,

977
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:44.223
Moss,

978
00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:46.803
<v 3>Miss Nadeau.</v>

979
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:50.980
<v 0>All right,
just to hammer this home,</v>

980
00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:55.750
notice that the expression in the English language is burning your boats.

981
00:59:56.050 --> 01:00:00.070
It's not going over to your boats and just as quietly drilling little holes in

982
01:00:00.071 --> 01:00:02.710
them,
right?
It's burning your boats.

983
01:00:02.711 --> 01:00:07.210
You want the other side to see this big bonfire on the beach and to know that

984
01:00:07.211 --> 01:00:11.060
the boats are no longer available
as in doctor strange love.

985
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:15.100
It's crucial and it's a terrible mistake for the Russians not to tell the

986
01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:16.870
Americans that they've built this machine.

987
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.670
<v 3>Alright,
alright,</v>

988
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.850
<v 0>so knowledge here is crucial knowledge of the other side.</v>

989
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:25.550
Now I should just complete the history of this.
This didn't work.

990
01:00:25.551 --> 01:00:26.960
In the case of the battle of Hastings,

991
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:30.230
the Saxons attacked anyway and it just turned area.
There was a big blog book,

992
01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:33.610
blood bath and the Normans really only won this battle because somebody's got a

993
01:00:33.611 --> 01:00:36.710
lucky,
lucky shot and hit their hit kit,
King Harold in the eye,

994
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:39.770
so they actually know this is a good story.
We didn't as a,
as a monitor,
a tactic,

995
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:42.830
not a,
and I'll actually a true story and I do that.

996
01:00:42.831 --> 01:00:45.260
I'm adding that in because otherwise they're going to get hundreds of letters

997
01:00:45.261 --> 01:00:48.710
from people who watch the video.
All right.

998
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:51.680
Now we've got a bunch of lessons today,
but I'm not done.

999
01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:54.050
I want to play one more game.
Before I do though,

1000
01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:57.410
I want to make sure we understand.
We're gonna play another games every stay put.

1001
01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:01.610
I want to make sure that there's a bunch of lessons on the board and I wanted

1002
01:01:01.611 --> 01:01:04.010
you to understand what's important and what's more important.

1003
01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:06.740
Everything is important,
but somethings are more important.
All right?

1004
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:11.950
So the idea of commitment is an important idea and the idea of incentive design

1005
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:14.870
is an important idea,

1006
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.190
but there's one idea here that is more important than anything else.

1007
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:22.100
And that idea is backward induction.

1008
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.880
All right?
What else?
Son rounded.
Okay.
How important is backward induction?

1009
01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:32.841
I couldn't.

1010
01:01:32.841 --> 01:01:37.450
Induction is the most important thing I'm going to teach you in the second half

1011
01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:38.570
of the,
of the semester.

1012
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:41.060
It's probably the most important thing I'm gonna teach you in the whole
semester.

1013
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.290
And it may be the most important thing you're gonna learn at Yale.
All right?

1014
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.320
How it,
it's the onset of all questions.

1015
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:52.820
If I asked you a question and as happens from time to time you've been sleeping

1016
01:01:52.821 --> 01:01:56.720
in cars and you wake up startled because I've now asked you a question and that

1017
01:01:56.721 --> 01:01:59.780
camera is on you,
right and you don't know what the question is,

1018
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:04.120
then the answer is backward induction.
All right,

1019
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:08.870
I'm stressing this because six weeks from now,
whatever it is in December,

1020
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:10.250
there's going to be a final exam.

1021
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.260
I guarantee now that there will be a question on the final exam that involve

1022
01:02:15.261 --> 01:02:19.380
backward induction and I guarantee that at least one person in the room,

1023
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:23.340
well forget to solve it.
My backward induction.
All right,

1024
01:02:23.341 --> 01:02:26.790
so all you're going to use backward induction on the final exam.
Yes,

1025
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:28.290
you're all going to remember it.
Okay.
Okay,
good.

1026
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:31.380
Now we'll play one more game just for fun.
All right,

1027
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.950
well before we pay,
when we get getting read and I'll do one of the things.
Sorry,

1028
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:37.980
one other thing before we pay that one more game.
I apologize.
Um,

1029
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.960
the one thing I want to do here is,
uh,
I put up a tree here,

1030
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:46.800
but I forgot to tell you anything about the tree.
This was a tree.

1031
01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:49.111
And I would be,

1032
01:02:49.111 --> 01:02:51.510
I would be remissed if I didn't tell you a few things about trees.

1033
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.780
So there's a certain amount of jargon that goes along with trees,

1034
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:57.390
and I want you to go to read the textbook and know what that jargon is.

1035
01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.630
So these spots,
he's dose in the tree.

1036
01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:05.760
These things are called nodes,
all right?
They're called nodes.

1037
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.290
And in fact,
the end points of the tree where the payoffs are,

1038
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:14.610
these are also called mode,
but they're called end nodes,

1039
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:21.600
all right?
And these branches and the tree,
the brushes are,

1040
01:03:21.601 --> 01:03:25.650
they are,
the branches are called ages.

1041
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.890
All right?
So tree consists of nodes,
edges,

1042
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:34.610
and these missing endnote.
Missing dots are the end nodes.

1043
01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.600
The end nodes are associated with payoffs.
Do we need to write that?

1044
01:03:38.601 --> 01:03:40.550
That's obvious,
right?
That's to do with payoffs.

1045
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:44.650
And every other node belongs to somebody who's chosen,
whose,

1046
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:49.320
whose turn it is to make a decision at that node.
All right?

1047
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:50.870
So there's these other nodes.

1048
01:03:50.871 --> 01:03:54.480
The ones on ed nodes are called decision those.

1049
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.933
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1050
01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.850
<v 0>and it's perfectly possible,
for example,</v>

1051
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.110
in our Norman conquest game for somebody to have several nodes,

1052
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:05.570
somebody could move once and then later on in the game,

1053
01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:08.090
I may also be noted that it never reached.
And again,

1054
01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:13.840
one last piece of jargon I route through a tree from the beginning to an end is

1055
01:04:15.321 --> 01:04:19.190
called a path,
a path,

1056
01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.130
a way of getting through the tree from the beginning to the end.

1057
01:04:22.131 --> 01:04:25.070
So I have a pop quiz on that jargon later and now it's play.

1058
01:04:25.071 --> 01:04:26.180
The last game I wanna play,

1059
01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:29.140
<v 1>we've got 10 minutes,
right?</v>

1060
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.420
<v 0>Okay.
Everyone understand the jargon?
I want to play a game now,
right?</v>

1061
01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.120
So the game we're gonna play is a game.

1062
01:04:39.121 --> 01:04:43.270
We're going to call the hungry lion game.
All right?

1063
01:04:43.271 --> 01:04:47.760
It's the hungry lion game.
And what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pick on a,

1064
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.830
a row of the clause,
actually gonna pick on this row of the class.
All right?

1065
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.800
And this row of the class,
everyone can see this row crop bag.

1066
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:57.210
You're leaned over the balcony,
this row of the clause.

1067
01:04:57.690 --> 01:05:01.920
We're going to imagine that everybody in this row is a lion.
All right?

1068
01:05:01.921 --> 01:05:04.010
They're all,
they all look like lions.
Not much,
but never been.

1069
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.600
Pretend they're lions,
right?
Suspension of disbelief.
All right?

1070
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.020
They're all lions and they're all hungry.

1071
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:13.620
I accepts except for one person.

1072
01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:17.650
Who's this guy at the end whose name is Alex?

1073
01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:22.540
So Alex is a sheep.
Alex,

1074
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.100
how's the MS?
I had the misfortune of wondering into this pack of pride,

1075
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:32.020
pride of lions,
and is liable to get eaten because they're hungry.
All right?

1076
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:36.580
However,
one thing stands between Alex,

1077
01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.160
Alex,
the sheep,
and being eaten.

1078
01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.990
The one thing that stands between him and being an Eaton is that in Lyons

1079
01:05:42.991 --> 01:05:43.824
society,

1080
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.960
the only lion who is allowed to eat the sheep is the headline.

1081
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.710
The Big Lion whose name is Ryan,
right?

1082
01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:58.360
Ryan is the headline here,
alright,
only Ryan can eat addicts.
The sheep.

1083
01:05:58.361 --> 01:06:03.330
No other lion can.
He acts the sheep.
All right?
Now there's a catch.
If I,
if I,

1084
01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.640
if Ryan Eats Alex,
if Ryan the lion eats out at the sheep,

1085
01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:11.350
the coaches that if Ryan the lion eats ice for sheep,
then Ryan,

1086
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:15.790
the lion will fall into a postprandial stupor,
fall asleep.

1087
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:19.690
At which point,
the second largest lion who's name is Chris,

1088
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.610
Chris can eat Ryan a neurosis.

1089
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:27.310
Chris can never eat the sheep.
He can only ever eat the lion,

1090
01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:31.120
the big lion,
and only then if a lion is eating the sheep and falls asleep,

1091
01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:35.950
it's very strict,
right?
Lions society is very hierarchical like England.

1092
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:38.530
All right,
right,
right.
If,

1093
01:06:38.531 --> 01:06:41.650
however Ryan the lion eats Alex the sheep and is then eaten,

1094
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:43.210
falls asleep and isn't eaten by Crystal Lion,

1095
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.890
then and only then he will fall into a stupor when which point he can be eaten

1096
01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:51.520
by Isabella Isabella,
who's the third largest line and so on.

1097
01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:56.230
Every understand the game.
All right.
No questions.
No talking among yourselves.

1098
01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:00.370
Write down what you would do if you were our key decision maker.

1099
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.640
Who is Ryan Ryan the light?
Well,
before we'd write it down,

1100
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:08.470
can I get Alex to stand up a second?
Stand up.
All right.
The camera on him,
right?

1101
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:13.120
This is,
this is the menu.
All right?
All right.
Thank you.
All right.
All right.

1102
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:17.170
Okay.
So you have to write down on your notepad whether you Ryan,

1103
01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:21.340
the lion in Ryan's,
um,
shoes or pause or whatever,

1104
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:25.570
whether you would eat addicts,
the sheep,
and we've written something down.

1105
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.420
All right?
Now this,
let's ask grind the lion what he's gonna do.
So Ryan,

1106
01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:34.480
are you going to eat Alex the sheep?
No,
he says no,
he's not going to eat.
Why not?

1107
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:38.200
Cause then I'll shout out,
shout out.
Then I'd be eating as well,

1108
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:40.190
but it'd be eating what I see if he would have been eaten.

1109
01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.620
So how do Eaton rx the sheep then he would have fallen asleep and then he'd been

1110
01:07:44.621 --> 01:07:49.360
in danger of being eaten by,
by Chris.
Chris,
would you have eaten Ryan?
Nah.

1111
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.330
Nah.
So he wouldn't have eaten him and fats in fights.

1112
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:55.690
It looks like Ryan would've got a free lunch.
Right?
And only no free lunches.

1113
01:07:55.691 --> 01:07:58.190
Economics.
Something's wrong.
All right.
All right.
Uh,
and what,

1114
01:07:58.191 --> 01:08:00.610
why is Chris worried about it?
Chris?
He's worried about it because Chris,

1115
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:04.750
because Chris is worried about Isabella Isabella eating him and what am I doing

1116
01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:09.430
wrong?
What's wrong with this analysis?
By the way,
before you see what's wrong,

1117
01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:10.383
how many of you,

1118
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:14.320
how many of you in Ryan shoes would have eaten that the sheep and how many of

1119
01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:18.740
you would not have in the sheet?
Okay,
what am I doing wrong?

1120
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:23.900
I'm in totally the wrong part of the room.
I shouldn't be here at all,
right?

1121
01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:27.050
I shouldn't be a toll in this part of the classroom.
I can't get round.

1122
01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:31.490
Wait a second.
Excuse me.
All right,

1123
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.450
I should be okay.
Which row is my,
where my lions.

1124
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:40.700
Where's my lion row?
A QBO.
I should be way over here with the baby lion.

1125
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.380
Who's name is.
Hey,
gay egg has a little baby lion.
Very cute,

1126
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.490
but a gay if you get to chose to eat is going to eat.
Why is he going to eat?

1127
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:54.680
Cause there's no one to eat him.
All right,
have anger gets the chance to eat.

1128
01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.760
The second law is the second baby and his name is John.
John.

1129
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:03.110
That egg and we'll eats.
All right.
So if John gets a chance to eat Ben,

1130
01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:08.180
Ben is John gonna eat badge now Jonny,
you gonna eat band?
No.
No.

1131
01:09:08.181 --> 01:09:11.690
John's not going to eat band because John knows he'll get eaten by gay.
So Ben,

1132
01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.660
if you get a chance to eat,
Vidar,
Vidar,
are you going to eat?

1133
01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:17.990
You're gonna eat Virta wait a second.
Wait a second.
So we don't,

1134
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:20.060
we just argued that if you eat,

1135
01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.270
then the second largest line whose name was John John is not going to eat.
Yes.

1136
01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:27.840
Okay.
So we have,
we know that it looks lions going to eat.

1137
01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.960
So the second leg of this line is not going to eat.

1138
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:32.330
So the 3rd of July and can eat safely.

1139
01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:36.260
So the fourth of US lion should not eat right.

1140
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:40.980
So the fifth that was lion should eat.
We've got eats,
eats not at EADS.
Eat,

1141
01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:46.010
not eat,
eat,
eat,
not eat,
eat,
eat,
eat,
not eat,
not eat,
eat,
eat,
eat,

1142
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:50.600
eat,
eat the rice.
That right.
So in fact,
you should have eaten him.

1143
01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:54.380
More important point is,
how should we analyze this game?

1144
01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.060
What was should we have used?
Paquin induction.

1145
01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.590
How many of you use backward induction?
Be Honest.
How many of you,

1146
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:06.680
so what's the point here?
The point,
the point is this,

1147
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.160
five minutes ago I said,

1148
01:10:10.161 --> 01:10:13.670
the most important thing you'll ever learn at Yale is backward induction.

1149
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.660
Then I distracted you with some fairly irrelevant nonsense

1150
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:21.320
and five minutes later,

1151
01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.920
nobody used backward induction to the main lesson from today that it's we're

1152
01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.980
going to pick up on Wednesday is to use something.
What are we going to use?

1153
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.350
All right,
we'll see you on Wednesday.
