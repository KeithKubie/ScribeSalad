00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.610
In the last video, I told you
that for a quadratic function,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.660
that the change in the change
of y is constant.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.060
What I mean by that-- this is
what we did in the last video.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.240
This was a quadratic,
this was data

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.140
from a quadratic function.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.670
That when x increased from
1 to 2, y increased by 2.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.270
Then when we increased
x from 2 to 3, y

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.220
didn't increase at all.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.690
It increased by 0.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.040
So the change in y was
clearly not constant.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.420
And then we went from 3 to 4,
y actually decreased by

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.270
negative 2.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.110
So the change in y was not
constant, but the change in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.630
the changes of y-- we had a
change in y of 2, then a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.620
change in y of 0-- so our change
in the change of y was

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.870
negative 2.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.450
Then we went from a
0 to a negative 2.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.910
So the change in the change
of y was negative 2.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.660
What I want to do in this video
is show you why that

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.350
works for a quadratic
function.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.630
And just to make the math
simple, I'm going to pick the

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.320
simplest of quadratic
functions.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.389
And if you have some free time
on your hands, you might try

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:07.600
it out for the more
general case.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.560
But I'm going to show you
that it works for y

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.050
is equal to x squared.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.950
And you could try it later
with ax squared

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.360
plus bx plus c.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.080
And I'm going to increment
x by 1.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.410
This'll work as long
as you increase x

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.930
by a constant amount.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.350
But 1 makes the math a
little bit simpler.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380
So let's pick some x's.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.165
I'm going to keep things
a little bit general.

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:35.710
So it's going to be very
abstract and algebraicy for a

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.130
little bit.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.860
But I think you might
find it satisfying.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.690
Then we'll figure out
our y's given the x.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.330
So let's say that x is x1.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.600
So when I write this little
subscript 1 here, that means

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.070
I'm picking a particular x, a
particular example of the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.680
variable x, a particular x in
the domain of this function.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.500
So in that situation, what's
y going to be equal to?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.060
Well, y is just going to
be equal to x1 squared.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.900
Let me do that in orange, keep
the colors consistent.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.550
x1 squared.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.550
Now let's say we increment
x by 1.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.590
So our next one is going
to be x1 plus 1.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.030
I'm just going 1 above
that number there.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.990
If this was 3, this
is going to be 4.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.880
If this was 0, this
is going to be 1.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.240
Then this is going to be x1 plus
1 squared, which is equal

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.930
to x1 squared plus 2x1 plus 1.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.090
All right, let's increase
this by 1.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.320
So then we get to x1 plus 2.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.600
If this is 0, this
is 1, this is 2.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.730
If this is 10, this
is 11, this is 12.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.570
So then y, when we have this
x value, will be x1 plus 2

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.205
squared, which is equal to x1
squared plus 4x1 plus 4.

00:02:56.205 --> 00:02:59.680
Let's do two more actually.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.830
Now let's increase
by another 1.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.680
I think you see what
I'm doing.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.000
x1 plus 3.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.250
The y value when x is x1
plus 3 is going to

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.260
be x1 plus 3 squared.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.230
Which is equal to x1 squared
plus 6x1, plus 9.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.170
Let's do one more.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.550
So when x is going to be-- let's
increment it by 1 more--

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.970
x1 plus 4, y is going to be x1
plus 4 squared, which is equal

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.560
to x1 squared plus
8x1, plus 16.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.680
Now, given this, let's figure
out the changes in y.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.120
So let me write here
the change in y.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.510
The change in y as we increment
x by 1 each time.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.230
So here the change in y, we'll
take this point or this y

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.010
value minus this y value.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.720
If we take this y value minus
this y value, so from here to

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.110
here, our change in y is going
to be x1 squared plus 2x1,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.312
plus 1, minus x1 squared.

00:04:14.312 --> 00:04:19.899
So these cancel out and we
just get 2x1 plus 1.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.970
Then when we go from this
point to this point, our

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:31.670
change in why is going to be x1
squared plus 4x1, plus 4,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.960
minus x1 squared, minus
2x1, minus 1.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.050
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.630
This is going to be equal to--
these guys cancel out-- 4x1

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.480
minus 2x1 is 2x1.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.790
And then 4 minus 1 is 3.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.540
So plus 3.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.330
Now let's do the next one.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.740
When I go from this y value to
that y value, change in y is

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:08.460
going to be x1 squared plus
6x1, plus 9, minus

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.910
this guy over here.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.560
x1 squared plus 4x1, plus 4.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.860
These cancel out.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.250
Sorry, I have to distribute
the negative sign.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.670
I'm subtracting this
whole thing.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.950
Put a minus there and a minus
negative sign there.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.070
6x1 minus 4x1, that is 2x1.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.980
And then I have 9 minus 4.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.450
So plus 5.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.780
So this is the change in y.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.240
The first change in y was that,
the second change in y

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.260
is that, third change
in y is that.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.450
Let's do this one over here.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.820
So our change in y is x1 squared
plus 8x1, plus 16,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.360
minus this value over here.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.710
Minus x1 squared minus
6x1, minus 9.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.980
I'm distributing
the minus sign.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.440
That cancels out.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.410
8x1 minus 6x1 is 2x1.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.820
16 minus 9 is equal to 7.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.560
So plus 7.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.200
So our change in y's from here
to here is 2x plus 1, right

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.360
there-- 2x1 plus 1.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.680
Then it's 2x1 plus 3.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.720
Then it's 2x1 plus 5.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.110
And then it's 2x1 plus 7.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.320
So what is the change
in the change of y?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.170
Notice, these are not
the same values.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.550
They're increasing.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.430
And so we're kind of
jumping the gun.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:37.200
What is the change in delta y?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:46.080
So if we go from 2x plus 1 to
2x plus 3, well, if you

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.430
subtract that from that, the
2x's are going to cancel out.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.610
3 minus 1 is 2.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.290
If you go from 2x plus 3 to 2x
plus 5, once again, the 2x's

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.840
cancel out.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.460
We've just increased by 2.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.530
If you go from 2x1 plus 5 to 2x1
plus 7, once again, you're

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.750
increasing by 2.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.940
So for at least the situation
of y is equal to x squared,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.410
hopefully it satisfies you that
no matter which x1 you

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.140
pick, as long as you keep
increasing by 1-- and it's

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.920
actually true if you increase
by any constant number-- the

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.150
change in your y values
will not be constant.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.950
Notice this is not that,
which is not that,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.230
which is not that.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.950
But the change in the change in
y's-- the change in y's are

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.080
increasing in this example
at a constant rate.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.980
So this was completely analogous
to what we did here.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.720
And if you have some time on
your hands, you can actually

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.250
prove this or show it or kind
of prove, you know, get

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.470
comfort that this will work for
the more general case of y

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.840
is equal to ax squared or ax
squared plus bx plus c.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.340
Or it will work for ax squared
plus bx plus c, if we

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.290
increment just by any arbitrary
constant here.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.990
So you could put a k, 2k, 3k.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.480
The algebra gets a little
bit hairier, that's

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.460
why I didn't do it.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.085
But it should still work.

00:08:01.085 --> 00:08:04.010
So hopefully you found that
kind of satisfying.
