00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.560
Caesium-137 is a
radioactive tracer element

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.830
used to study
upslope soil erosion

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.090
and downstream sedimentation.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.750
It has a half-life of
approximately 30 days.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.480
So this half-life
of 30 days, this

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.370
means that, if you were
to start with 2 kilograms

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.690
of caesium-137, that
30 days later you're

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.270
going to have 1
kilogram of caesium-137.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.360
The other kilogram has
decayed into other things.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.840
And if you waited
another 30 days,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.080
you would have half a
kilogram of caesium-137.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.490
Assume that the amount A in
becquerels of caesium-137

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.150
in a soil sample is given by
the exponential function A

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.530
is equal to c times r to the t--
where t is the number of days

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.990
since the release of caesium-137
into soil and c and r

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.330
are unknown constants.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.700
So this bears some explaining.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.920
What is this becquerel business?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.330
So normally, if I were
to talk about the amount

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.360
of some element, I'd probably
be thinking in terms of mass

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.640
and I might talk in
terms of kilograms.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.720
But some people might
also be referring

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.060
to the amount of this
radioactive substance

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.190
in terms of the amount of
radioactivity it produces.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.020
And becquerels is the
international unit

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.430
of radioactivity-- named
after Henri Becquerel, who

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.110
codiscovered radioactivity
with Marie Curie.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.220
So you could consider this
the amount of caesium-137

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.270
that causes A becquerels
of radioactivity.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.316
But either way, we can just
think of it as a quantity.

00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:43.690
But it's really
the quantity that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.680
causes A becquerels of activity.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.120
So just to be
clear, the amount is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.130
given by the
exponential function

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.630
A is equal to-- let me just
rewrite it-- A is equal to c

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.060
times r to the t power--
where t is the number of days

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.800
since the release of the
caesium-137 in the soil and c

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.400
and r are unknown constants.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.610
Fair enough?

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.590
So let's just be clear,
this is days since release.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.430
In addition, assume that we
know that the initial amount

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.210
of caesium-137 released in
the soil is 8 becquerels.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.766
Solve for the unknown
constants c and r.

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:24.890
So the initial in the soil.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.140
That's when t is equal to 0.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.770
When no days have passed.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.320
So we could say that the amount
at times 0-- well, that's

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.220
going to be equal to c
times r to the 0 power,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.480
which is just going to be
equal to c times 1, which

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.710
is equal to c.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.860
And they tell us what A of 0 is.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.810
They say A of 0 is 8 becquerels.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.990
So this is going
to be equal to 8.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.920
So our constant here, the c is
just going to be equal to 8.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.410
What is the value
of the constant?

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.650
We could just write
8 right over there.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.430
So the value of the
constant c is 8.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.560
What is the value
of the constant r?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.020
Round to the nearest thousandth.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.630
So we're starting with 8.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.780
So A of 0 is 8.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.457
How much are we going
to have after 30 days?

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:12.040
And the reason why
I'm picking 30 days

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.840
is-- that is the
half-life of caesium-137.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.760
So A of 30, remember our
t is in-- let me just

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.660
switch colors just for fun.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.250
Remember, t is in days.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.290
So A of 30.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.300
So after 30 days, I
am going to-- if I

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.400
want to use this
formula right over here,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.290
if I wanted to use
the description

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.730
of this exponential function,
we already know that c is 8.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.490
It's going to be 8 times
r to the 30th power, which

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.680
is going to be equal to what?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.805
Well, if we started
with 8, 30 days later,

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:47.180
we're going to
have half as much.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.380
We're going to
have 4 becquerels.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.270
And now, we can use
this to solve for r.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.120
So you have 8 times r to the
30th power is equal to 4.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.000
Divide both sides by 8.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.500
You get r to the 30th power
is equal to 4 over 8--

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.660
which is the same thing as 1/2.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.730
And then, we can raise both
sides to the 1/30th power.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.079
r to the 30th--
but then, you could

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.016
think of the 30th root
of that or raising that

00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:19.390
to the 1/30th
power-- that's just

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:27.060
going to give us r is equal to
one half to the 1/30th power.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.390
And that is something
that's very hard

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.730
to compute in your head.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.696
So I suggest you use
a calculator for that.

00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:34.070
And they hint
because we're going

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.440
to round to the
nearest thousandth.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.490
So let's get a
calculator right out.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.150
And so we're talking about
one half to the 1/30 power.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.980
So we get 0.9771599--
it keeps going.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:04.370
But they tell us to round to
the nearest thousandth, so 0.977

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.030
rounded to the
nearest thousandth.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.710
And then, they finally say-- how
many becquerels of caesium-137

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.920
remain in our sample 150 days
after its release in the soil?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.440
Use the rounded value of
r, and round this number

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.620
to the nearest hundredth.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.070
So just to be clear, we
already know c and r.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.180
We know that the amount of
caesium-137 in becquerels--

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.700
as a function of
time in days-- is

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:44.460
going to be equal to 8
times 0.977 to the t power--

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.419
where t is the number of
days that have passed.

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:47.959
And they're essentially
saying, well,

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:49.660
how much do we have
left after 150 days?

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.480
So they want us to
calculate what is A of 150?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:04.950
Well, that's going to be 8
times 0.977 to the 150th power.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.860
And so clearly, we need
a calculator for this.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.670
So let's calculate that.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.590
So it's going to be
8 times-- and they

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.710
tell us to use our rounded value
of r, not the exact value of r.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:26.985
So it's going to be 8 times
0.977 to the 150th power.

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:29.110
And they want us to round
to the nearest hundredth.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:36.240
0.24.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.370
0.24 becquerels is kind
of the radioactivity level

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.664
of the caesium-137
that we have left over.

00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:45.080
Now, one interesting
thing is they

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.840
asked us to use the
rounded value of r.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.290
So we used the
rounded value of r.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.620
Because this right over
here is a multiple of 30,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.950
you could actually-- in not
too difficult of a way--

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.923
find out the exact
value that's left over.

00:06:57.923 --> 00:07:00.173
And actually, you don't even
need a calculator for it.

00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:01.105
I encourage you to
pause your video

00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:02.271
and try to think about that.

00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:04.150
Find the exact value.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.810
Well, instead of writing
0.977, let's write A of t

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.240
as being equal to 8 times our r.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.726
This is an approximate
value for r.

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.350
If we wanted to be
a little more exact,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:23.070
we can say that our r is one
half to the 1/30th power.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.710
And we're going to raise
that to the t power.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:33.060
Or we could say A of
t is equal to 8 times

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.001
one half to the t/30 power.

00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:37.500
If we raise something
to an exponent

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.958
and then raise that
to an exponent,

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.290
we can take the product
of those exponents.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.342
So that's one half
to the t/30 power.

00:07:43.342 --> 00:07:45.050
Let me actually do
that in another color.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.091
Let me do that in yellow.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:52.475
So that's 8 times one
half to the t/30 power.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.510
And actually, I don't need this
parentheses right over here.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.230
This is another way
to describe A of t.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.925
So what is A of 150?

00:08:04.925 --> 00:08:14.430
So A of 150 is going to be
equal to 8 times one half

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.280
to the 150/30.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.330
Well, that's just 5.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.870
One half to the fifth power.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.880
Well, what's one half
to the fifth power?

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.920
That is 1 to the fifth over
2 to the fifth or 1/32.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:36.799
So this right over here is 1/32,
which is equal to 8 over 32,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.630
which is equal to
1 over 4, which

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:45.520
is equal to 1 over 4 or 0.25.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.320
So using our
approximation for r,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.400
we got 0.24 when we
rounded to the 150th power.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.150
So that's using our
approximation a lot.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.370
We're taking 150 of these and
multiplying them together,

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.869
but it's not too far off
of what the real value is.

00:09:01.869 --> 00:09:03.660
And they asked us to
use the rounded value.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.780
But if we'd used the precise
value, the actual value,

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.960
0.25 becquerels
would be left over.
