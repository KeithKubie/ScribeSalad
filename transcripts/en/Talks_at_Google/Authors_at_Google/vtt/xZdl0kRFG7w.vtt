LOGAN URY: So thanks
for joining us today.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.190
My name is Logan Ury.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.370
I'm really excited to have
Gretchen Rubin with us.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.780
I actually work in a team
called the Irrational Lab

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.350
and we study human behavior
and products at Google.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.890
So I'm particularly interested
in all of Gretchen's work,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.980
and we're lucky enough to
have her with us today.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.240
I'll ask some questions
until around 1:40,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.330
and then I'll open it up to you.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.470
So Gretchen Rubin is one of the
most provoking and influential

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.380
writers on the linked
subjects of happiness, habits,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.690
and human nature.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.150
She's the author of many
books, including "The New York

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.189
Times" best sellers
"The Happiness Project"

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.720
and "Happier at Home."

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.400
Rubin has an enormous
following in print and online,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.370
and her books have sold more
than a million copies worldwide

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.370
in more than 30 languages.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.270
Rubin started her
career in law and was

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.180
clerking for Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor when she realized

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.900
she wanted to be a writer.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.660
She lives in New York City with
her husband and two daughters.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.685
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm pleased to introduce

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:53.740
Gretchen Rubin.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.184 --> 00:01:00.510
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well, I'm
very happy to be here.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.010
LOGAN URY: So I
want to start just

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590
by finding out
about the transition

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.390
from clerking to
becoming a writer.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.034
What was that like?

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.450
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Well, I was lucky.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.172
Because a lot of
times, people know

00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:12.130
they don't want to do
something, but they don't

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.880
know what they do want to do.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.640
And I was fortunate because one
day I was doing my clerkship

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.260
and I was going for
walk at lunchtime

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.580
and I was staring up the Capitol
dome against the blue sky.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.539
And I thought, if I
were to write something

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.080
that was interesting to me, that
was interesting to everybody

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.913
else in the world, what
would I write about?

00:01:32.913 --> 00:01:36.482
And I thought, power,
money, fame, sex.

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:38.190
And all of a sudden
it hit me, and I just

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.648
started this giant
research project

00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:41.490
on power, money, fame and sex.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.890
And I was doing it
in my free time.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.382
I was staying late at work
and I was working on it

00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:47.160
on the weekends.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.220
And finally it occurred to me
that this is the kind of thing

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.370
that people do as a job.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.590
They write a book like
this as their job.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.190
And I was treating
it as a hobby.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.866
And then I thought well,
maybe I should do it as a job.

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:01.240
And my husband
and I were getting

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.680
ready to move to New York, and
I couldn't think of a law job

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.570
that I wanted.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.330
Here I was, I had a lot of
feathers in my cap as lawyer,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.680
and I couldn't think of a
single law job that I wanted.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.830
So I thought, well you know,
I'd rather fail as a writer

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.540
than succeed as a lawyer.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.770
And this is my time to do it
because I'm moving to New York.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.830
If I get a law job, I'll
probably never leave it.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.390
So I should try to
get a book written.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.140
And so that's when I
tried to get an agent

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.000
and write a book
proposal and all that.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.319
LOGAN URY: So you moved from
money, fame, sex and power

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.860
to happiness?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.310
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well, in
between I wrote a book.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.980
So I know it sounds strange,
but really my real subject

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.650
is human nature.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.691
That's the thing that's
always interesting to me.

00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:45.590
So I wrote about power,
money, fame, sex.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.260
It was called a user's
guide, and it's sort of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.560
like "The Preppy Handbook" for
power, money, fame, and sex.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.000
Sort of satirical.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.250
Then I wrote biographies of
Winston Churchill and JFK,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.900
because these are such
exaggerated-- they're so huge,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.600
you could see human
nature more clearly.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.017
I wrote this weird book
called "Profane Waste,"

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.600
because for a long
time I was obsessed

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.240
with the question
of why owners would

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.460
destroy their own possessions.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.410
And then I got to "The
Happiness Project."

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.300
But to me, they all
seem very interrelated.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.910
Even though from the outside,
it's sort of bizarre shifts.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.780
LOGAN URY: Yes.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.030
So I think a lot of
people in this room

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.320
are really interested in
everything around happiness.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.220
What are some of the
biggest misconceptions

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.785
around happiness?

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:28.330
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well, one
of the most complicated

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.560
and emotionally charged
areas within happiness

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.660
is the role of
money in happiness.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.730
And people will often say,
well, money can't buy happiness.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.770
And it can't.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.650
But it can buy a lot of things
that contribute powerfully

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.000
to happiness.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.390
And so money has a
real role to play.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.900
But it's a question of how
are you spending your money?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.037
Because you could buy a bike,
or you could buy cocaine.

00:03:49.037 --> 00:03:51.370
And those are probably going
to have different outcomes.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.990
And people have different needs.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.485
One person might have a lot
of people depending on them.

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:00.180
And one person might
live alone with a turtle.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.070
And so the level
of money that would

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.100
make them feel safe and
secure would be different.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.085
So one is related to money.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.570
And one, I think, is this
idea that certain things

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.810
make people happy.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.290
Music makes people happy.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.709
Travel makes people happy.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.130
Shopping makes people happy.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.690
Wine makes people happy.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.700
None of those things
make me happy.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.014
There is no one size fits all.

00:04:27.014 --> 00:04:28.680
We all have to know
what makes us happy.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.870
And sometimes that's
surprisingly hard to do.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.726
So I think the idea
that there's something

00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:35.350
that we can all just point to--
except relationships, probably.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.227
Relationships do
make people happier.

00:04:37.227 --> 00:04:38.810
But what those
relationships look like

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.080
are very different
for different people,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.795
depending on how
many relationships

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:42.700
they like to have.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.740
LOGAN URY: So speaking
of what makes you happy,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.720
what single change that
you made in your life

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.819
contributed the most to
your personal happiness?

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:49.610
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.620
Well, switching from being
a lawyer to a writer.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.117
LOGAN URY: Oh.

00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:53.111
GRETCHEN RUBIN: For sure.

00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:53.610
Yeah.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.810
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.800
LOGAN URY: What about
through the book?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.170
Through the experiment?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.711
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh,
through the book.

00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:57.670
Through the book.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.270
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.460
There were so many things.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.530
I mean, there were
a lot of things.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.720
And if I keep working on this.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.180
Which is I have a very-- we
were talking about this--

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.854
I have an intense personality.

00:05:08.854 --> 00:05:10.020
I have kind of a short fuse.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.000
And so a lot of habits and
resolutions and everything

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.930
that I've done.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.430
Everything from
going to bed on time

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.492
to trying to under
react to problems.

00:05:18.492 --> 00:05:19.950
I mean, a million
different things.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.040
Trying to just
stay calm and light

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.420
hearted and have
a sense of humor.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.185
I mean, not take it up to 11
like an opera star every time

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:31.060
something goes wrong.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.810
LOGAN URY: And what are
some of the easy things

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.710
that people in this
room or people watching

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.330
could do to be happier?

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.720
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Get enough sleep.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.120
How many people here regularly
get seven hours of sleep

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.960
a night?

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.920
OK, that's pretty good.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.930
That's pretty good.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.900
AUDIENCE: Liars.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.385
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Huh?

00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:46.870
AUDIENCE: Liars.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.745
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:05:47.745 --> 00:05:48.325
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:49.491
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, liars.

00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:53.074
How many people here
regularly use a snooze alarm?

00:05:53.074 --> 00:05:54.490
Oh, it's an
instrument of torture!

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.342
Well, and then relationships.

00:05:58.342 --> 00:06:00.300
Really when you look at
people who are happier,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.660
they're the ones that have
deep, meaningful relationships.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.850
To be happy, we really
need relationships.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.680
And so anything that you can do
to broaden your relationships

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.510
or deepen your
relationship is something

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.090
that's likely to have
a big happiness payoff.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.030
I'm a big fan myself
of joining groups

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.860
because I think groups
are a great way to stay

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.980
in touch with a lot of people.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.542
So those are some of the things.

00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:25.000
LOGAN URY: So transitioning
from "Happiness" to your newest

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.529
book, what role do habits
play in contributing

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:28.445
to people's happiness?

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:30.340
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well,
it's interesting.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.810
Research suggests that
about 40% of everyday life

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.470
is governed by habits.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.180
And so habits are the invisible
architecture of everyday life.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.870
If you have habits
that work for you,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.015
you're much more likely
to be happier, healthier,

00:06:42.015 --> 00:06:42.937
and more productive.

00:06:42.937 --> 00:06:44.770
If you have habits that
do not work for you,

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.680
that is going to be
much more difficult.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.660
And I got drawn into
the subject of habits

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.150
from "Happiness" because I
was researching and thinking

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.220
and talking to people
about happiness so much.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.700
And very often, I
noticed a pattern that

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.230
was when people would talk
about either a big gain

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.440
that they had experienced
or more often,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.870
a challenge that they kept
facing about happiness,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.990
it was something that to me at
its core looked like a habit

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.810
problem.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.490
And so I became
increasingly interested

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.252
in this question
of why do people

00:07:19.252 --> 00:07:20.710
have trouble forming
certain habits

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.000
if they say they want them?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.320
And sometimes they can form
them, and why can they?

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.607
And then sometimes
they can't, and trying

00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:30.940
to understand what was going on.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.730
LOGAN URY: So what do
you say if someone says,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.050
oh, that seems so exhausting?

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.310
Or it's going to take away
the spontaneity in my life?

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.040
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well, this
is the thing about habits.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.040
There's good things about
habits and bad things.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.080
So the good things about
habits is that they

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.640
are freeing and energizing.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.410
Because when
something's a habit,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.970
we don't have to
use decision making

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.553
and we don't have
to use self control.

00:07:49.553 --> 00:07:51.330
So I don't decide to
get up at 6:00 AM.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.090
I don't decide whether
to skip dessert.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.690
I'm not using my willpower.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.310
I just don't.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.747
I made that decision long ago.

00:07:57.747 --> 00:08:00.080
People sometimes say, I want
to go through my day making

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.150
healthy choices.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.600
I'm like, no you don't!

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.475
Because if you're trying to
make a lot of healthy choices,

00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:06.850
a lot of the time
you're probably

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.141
going to make the wrong choice.

00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:11.202
You want to choose once, make it
a habit, put it on auto pilot.

00:08:11.202 --> 00:08:12.660
And then that just
is going to run.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.970
And you don't have to
use decision making,

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.430
you don't have to
use self control.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.930
However, the downside of
habits is that they speed time

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.380
and they deaden.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.440
So you know, your
first month on a job

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.320
lasts longer than your
fifth year on a job.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.000
Because everything speeds
up when it's on a habit.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.094
And also your response
to a situation

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.260
is going to be less intense.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.980
So if you're doing something
for the first time,

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.409
it's this spontaneous thing,
it's going to be more intense.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.210
Whereas if it's something
that you're doing every day,

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.309
is going to be deadened.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:40.610
But this can be good too.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.490
You deaden pleasure, but you
also deaden negative emotions

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.350
like anxiety.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.540
If there's something
that makes you anxious,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.560
probably the more you
do it, the less anxious

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.430
you're going to feel.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.680
I heard a guy, an expert
on anxiety, talking.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.680
And a woman said, well,
I get very, very anxious

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.240
every I have to
get off a ski lift.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.340
And he said, strangely,
it's because you

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.640
don't get off ski lifts enough.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.640
If you got off a ski
lift three times a day,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.220
you would be in the habit of
it and your anxiety would drop.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.030
But it's just novel enough that
you can have this big stress

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.530
reaction.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.120
So the deadening can be helpful.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.220
But often we
experience it as oh, I

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.950
don't enjoy my cup of coffee
in the morning anymore.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.631
I don't enjoy.

00:09:20.631 --> 00:09:23.130
I'm driving to work, I don't
even see the beautiful scenery.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.950
Because it just
deadens, speeds away.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:27.710
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.555
One of my favorite parts of
the book was about abstaining.

00:09:29.555 --> 00:09:30.210
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
[LAUGHS] Oh yeah.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.376
LOGAN URY: And how you can make
powerful changes in your life

00:09:33.376 --> 00:09:35.000
just by not making
a decision about it.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.230
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.210
LOGAN URY: Or making a
decision about it once.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:36.620
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.740
LOGAN URY: Can you talk
a little bit about that?

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.115
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yeah, abstaining.

00:09:39.115 --> 00:09:42.760
OK, so I have 21
strategies in the book.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.650
And don't feel like
oh my gosh, 21!

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.410
It's too many.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.910
It's good.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.150
You can have a lot to
pick and choose from.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.070
And the strategy of
abstaining is interesting

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.340
because it's a strategy
that works extremely

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.650
well for some
people and does not

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.090
work at all for other people.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.756
So it's very important
to know if you're

00:09:57.756 --> 00:10:00.240
an abstainer or a moderator.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.160
For abstainers, it's easier
to do something not at all.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.980
It's easier to give
it up altogether.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.850
I can have no Thin Mints,
and I can have 10 Thin Mints.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.060
But I cannot have
two Thin Mints.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.220
It's easier to have none.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.542
Once something's off the
table, it just goes away.

00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:23.500
I'm not bothered by it.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.249
But once I start, I
have trouble stopping.

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:26.306
It's all or nothing.

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:28.180
And then there are people
who are moderators.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.740
And moderators get
panicky if they're told

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.396
they can't have something ever.

00:10:32.396 --> 00:10:34.270
They need to know they
can have it sometimes.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:39.464
They can have it occasionally.

00:10:39.464 --> 00:10:42.479
And one of the things
that many moderators will

00:10:42.479 --> 00:10:44.770
do-- this was a pattern that
puzzled me for the longest

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.710
time-- is they will keep a bar
of fine chocolate squirreled

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.840
away somewhere.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.050
And once a day, they
will eat one square

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.300
of that bar of fine chocolate.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.402
Now my whole day would be like,
a square now, a square later.

00:10:57.402 --> 00:10:58.110
It's my birthday.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.950
I'm on vacation.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.890
I was so good, I'll
eat the whole thing,

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.389
I'm not going to
eat anything today.

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:04.780
So you know, I
would eat that bar.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.290
But a moderator likes to
have just a little bit.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.360
And so it's really
important to know

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.295
whether abstaining works
for you or moderating

00:11:12.295 --> 00:11:13.170
works better for you.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.253
So how many people here,
hearing this description,

00:11:15.253 --> 00:11:16.790
think that they're abstainers?

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.010
How many people think
they're moderators?

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.040
OK, so now you see the
point of conflict, right?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.499
Because the moderator
is like, well

00:11:22.499 --> 00:11:23.998
let's just buy a
carton of ice cream

00:11:23.998 --> 00:11:25.450
and keep it in the freezer.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.530
And you can just learn
to control yourself.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.024
And the abstainer's like, I'm
gonna eat the whole thing!

00:11:30.024 --> 00:11:31.190
Don't bring it in the house!

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.000
So it's hard.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.560
But this is something
that works also

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.360
for any kind of
strong temptation.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.262
And as I imagine you
guys are well aware,

00:11:39.262 --> 00:11:41.720
it's something that some people
have to do with technology.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.960
My sister cannot play a
little bit of Candy Crush.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.810
She had to delete it
from all of her devices.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.362
So sometimes when people can't
do something a little bit,

00:11:51.362 --> 00:11:52.820
they have to give
it up altogether.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.530
And that sounds harder because
it sounds more extreme and more

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.020
rigid and more demanding.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.900
But if you are an
abstainer, it's easier.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.530
It's the lazy way.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.820
It's easy to give
something up altogether.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.250
It's much, much,
much harder to try

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.814
to be moderate if you are
the abstainer personality.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.730
LOGAN URY: So one thing
I really found helpful

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.810
in the book is understanding
to change our habits,

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.915
we must figure out ourselves.

00:12:15.915 --> 00:12:16.580
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.530
LOGAN URY: And I think a
lot of people in this room

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.330
read your books and they
follow your blog because they

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.740
do want to hack their
lives and improve.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.510
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.470
LOGAN URY: Maybe you
could talk a little bit

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.330
about the four tendencies.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:24.620
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.650
LOGAN URY: And how that's
helped people make habits.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:27.350
GRETCHEN RUBIN: OK.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.850
So of everything
in the book, I have

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.350
to say this is the thing
that is the most original.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.600
It was definitely the most
intellectually challenging.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.610
It took me months
and months and months

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.400
of deep pondering to come
up with the four tendencies.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.234
So I'm going to outline
the four tendencies,

00:12:41.234 --> 00:12:43.775
and then I'm going to go through
and ask you raise your hand.

00:12:43.775 --> 00:12:45.300
Because whenever
I speak, I'm very

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.966
curious to see what
the distribution is.

00:12:49.972 --> 00:12:51.680
And it starts out
sounding really boring.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.346
So just hang in there
with me, because I

00:12:53.346 --> 00:12:54.550
promise there's payoff.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.770
But it really does sound
boring when I start.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.050
So this has to do
with how you respond

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.800
to the idea of an expectation.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.650
So there are outer expectations,
like a work deadline,

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.017
or request from a spouse,
or a traffic regulation.

00:13:07.017 --> 00:13:08.600
And then there are
inner expectations,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.900
which is like your own desire
to keep a New Year's resolution,

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.720
or your own desire to
get back into meditation.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.670
The first category of
people are upholders.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.880
Upholders respond readily to
outer and inner expectations

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.420
alike.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.300
So they meet a work deadline
without too much trouble.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.674
They keep a New
Year's resolution

00:13:25.674 --> 00:13:26.590
without much trouble.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.750
It's very important to them
to meet external expectations,

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.010
but it's just as important
or more important

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.330
for them to meet their
expectations for themselves.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.820
Next, questioners.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.930
Questioners question
all expectations.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.980
They'll do it if it
makes sense to them.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.120
They hate anything
arbitrary or irrational.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.780
They want to know why
am I listening to you?

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.980
They want reasons and
justification, sometimes

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.440
too much.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.280
And so in a way,
they make everything

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.890
an inner expectation,
because they'll do it

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.650
if it passes muster with them.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.660
So it's an inner expectation.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.070
Then obligers.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.311
Obligers readily meet
outer expectations,

00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:06.310
but they have trouble
meeting their expectations

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.980
for themselves.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.320
So for instance--
and I talk about this

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.695
at the very
beginning of the book

00:14:09.695 --> 00:14:11.860
because it was a very
clarifying moment for me--

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.326
a friend of mine said,
why can't I exercise?

00:14:14.326 --> 00:14:15.950
In high school, I
was on the track team

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.570
and I never missed
track practice.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.060
But I can't go running now.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.096
Why?

00:14:20.096 --> 00:14:21.220
Because she was an obliger.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.340
When there was a team,
when there was a coach,

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.190
she could meet the
external expectation.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.680
But she can't go
running on her own

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.520
because that's just
an inner expectation,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.400
and so that's harder to meet.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.030
And then finally, rebels.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.364
Rebels resist all expectations,
outer and inner alike.

00:14:34.364 --> 00:14:36.280
They want to do what
they want to do when they

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.900
want to do it in their own way.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.640
If you ask or tell
them to do something,

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.499
they're very likely
to do the opposite.

00:14:41.499 --> 00:14:43.540
And they sometimes become
frustrated because they

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.119
don't even want to tell
themselves what do.

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:47.660
So they resist outer
and inner alike.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.000
OK, upholders?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.920
Readily meets outer
and inner expectation.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.755
Upholder.

00:14:52.755 --> 00:14:55.100
Yeah, that's
definitely my tendency.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.960
Next, questioners.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.760
Questioners question
all expectations.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.450
Yeah, OK.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.160
Next, obligers.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.260
Obligers readily meet outer,
struggle to keep inner.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.140
And then rebels.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.924
Rebels resist both
outer and inner alike.

00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:10.327
OK.

00:15:10.327 --> 00:15:12.910
LOGAN URY: My theory was there
would be more rebels at Google.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.740
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Ah.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.976
Well, I've spoken to
groups that had no rebels.

00:15:16.976 --> 00:15:20.190
LOGAN URY: Any themes among
groups with no rebels?

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.310
GRETCHEN RUBIN: The
theme you would expect.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.080
They tend to be places where
there's a super high emphasis

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.740
on keeping rules.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.670
Strangely, the group that
had the highest percentage

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.990
of rebels-- well, I should
start by saying rebel

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.070
is by far the smallest category.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.160
Very, very few
people are rebels.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.240
But what was surprising to
me was that very few people

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.516
are upholders.

00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:42.640
It's a very small category.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.864
These are the extremes.

00:15:43.864 --> 00:15:45.530
When I was starting
this book, I did not

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.910
realize that I was part of
the freaky fringe, but I am.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.440
But the group that I spoke to
that had by far the highest

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.980
percentage of
rebels-- it was still

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.360
on absolute terms
a small number,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.020
but in terms of the number
of hands that went up,

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.840
I was astounded-- was
when I spoke to group

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.220
of Christian ministers.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.150
And there's a whole
thing that I won't

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.980
go into about why that
is, about rebels are often

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.250
attracted strangely to
areas of high regulation.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.970
But by far, most people are
questioners or obligers.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.700
I think obligers is
in the slight lead.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.170
There's a quiz on my site
if you want to take it.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:23.810
117,000 people
now have taken it.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.390
But most people are questioners
or obligers, overwhelmingly.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.150
And I couldn't totally
get a sense of it,

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.460
but I think that was pretty
much what we saw here.

00:16:32.712 --> 00:16:34.420
LOGAN URY: So one of
the things about you

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.950
that I'm so impressed
by is your productivity.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:36.320
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.790
LOGAN URY: How often
you post to your blog.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.900
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh yeah.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.316
LOGAN URY: You say you answer
every email within 24 hours.

00:16:40.316 --> 00:16:42.090
GRETCHEN RUBIN: No,
not within 24 hours.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:42.420
LOGAN URY: Oh.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:42.870
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.740
LOGAN URY: What's
your email rule?

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.130
GRETCHEN RUBIN: I
don't have a rule.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.530
I'm an upholder, so I'm like,
I will answer that email.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:47.880
So yeah.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.086
LOGAN URY: So how are
you so productive?

00:16:50.086 --> 00:16:54.534
Can you share some of your
productivity tips with us?

00:16:54.534 --> 00:16:56.390
GRETCHEN RUBIN: I think
that's what funny.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.535
What I realized, a lot of
people who write books like this

00:16:59.535 --> 00:17:00.320
are upholders.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.740
And we're like, why
is this is so hard?

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.760
People should just do what I do.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.552
It's really simple.

00:17:03.552 --> 00:17:05.968
And then you're like, no, it's
because that's your nature.

00:17:05.968 --> 00:17:06.720
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.558
So you think a lot of
authors are upholders?

00:17:08.558 --> 00:17:09.349
GRETCHEN RUBIN: No.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.460
I think a lot of authors of
things about productivity

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.044
and efficiency.

00:17:12.044 --> 00:17:12.730
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:13.050
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:13.680
LOGAN URY: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.109
GRETCHEN RUBIN: I don't
know if anybody here

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:15.490
has read Laura Vanderkam?

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.300
She's a time management expert.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.790
I really love her stuff.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:24.760
And she was telling me
that she was in labor

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.579
and really about to have the
baby, like barely made it.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.870
And she still wouldn't let
her husband park illegally

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.823
in the parking lot.

00:17:30.823 --> 00:17:32.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:33.287 --> 00:17:34.370
Because she's an upholder.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:39.220
But I think one of the
things is regular work.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.110
That's what works for me is to
work a little bit every day.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:50.290
And to really always
stay inside a project.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.020
I have a friend.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.677
She's a writer, he's a painter.

00:17:52.677 --> 00:17:54.260
And she said they
have this rule like,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.550
could you work for 10 minutes?

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.540
Meaning are you
so in your project

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.210
that if you even had
10 loose minutes,

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.720
that you could sit down and
get something done because it's

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.000
just in your mind so vividly.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.310
And so I think that's
part of what works for me.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.831
But I have to say
though, I always

00:18:11.831 --> 00:18:13.830
thought that was a standard
thing that everybody

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.913
should do in order to be
productive and efficient.

00:18:15.913 --> 00:18:19.530
But one of the things I
learned from the book,

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.600
one chapter is on the
strategy of distinctions,

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.877
which is understanding
how people are alike

00:18:23.877 --> 00:18:24.960
and how they're different.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.850
Because a lot of times,
I assume everybody

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.099
would do better if they
worked a little bit every day.

00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:30.730
Because isn't that the best way?

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.890
No, it's the best way for me.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.650
So there's marathoners
like me who like

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.287
to do a little bit steadily.

00:18:36.287 --> 00:18:38.620
We feel like that helps our
creativity and productivity.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.906
But then there are sprinters.

00:18:39.906 --> 00:18:41.780
Sprinters like the
adrenalin of the deadline.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.245
They like to do everything
up against that end.

00:18:44.245 --> 00:18:45.870
They feel like that's
what crystallizes

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.760
their thoughts, that's when
they're most productive.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.843
And if they start too
early, they kind of burn out

00:18:49.843 --> 00:18:52.500
and waste time and the
whole thing stretches out.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.400
And it was a real
revelation because I just

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.130
thought that they were
being irresponsible.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.724
Why would you possibly
wait like that?

00:18:59.724 --> 00:19:02.140
But then as I would really
talk to people about their work

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.427
habits, that's really
how they worked best.

00:19:04.427 --> 00:19:06.010
And there's no right
way or wrong way.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.715
But you can imagine
in a team situation,

00:19:07.715 --> 00:19:08.780
it can be really hard.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.640
And I've heard from a
lot of people saying,

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.770
oh well, I worked
in this law firm

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.270
for this partner
who was a sprinter.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.690
And I couldn't work like that.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.280
It seemed crazy to me.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.410
Or I was talking to a guy
who led a software team.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.796
And he's like, oh, that's
when teams come together.

00:19:23.796 --> 00:19:25.170
That's when the
great ideas flow.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.210
And I was like, no.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.090
For you.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.350
I couldn't work like that.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.610
So it's understanding that
maybe people have different work

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.330
styles, work paces.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.780
And so if you talk
about what are the best

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.406
habits for productivity,
should you do it first thing

00:19:38.406 --> 00:19:39.030
in the morning?

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:40.863
Not if you're a night
person, because that's

00:19:40.863 --> 00:19:43.350
when probably at your foggiest.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.080
They might do it
at eight o'clock

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.130
at night, which is when
I can barely speak.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.550
So it's hard to say,
because it's really

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.950
about that individual fit.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:52.680
LOGAN URY: That's
what I found really

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.960
empowering about the
book, was saying,

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.040
oh that didn't work for me.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.280
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.280
LOGAN URY: Because I'm this
different type of person.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.630
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:57.615
LOGAN URY: But I am
a morning person.

00:19:57.615 --> 00:19:57.880
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.760
LOGAN URY: So I've started
making habits based on that.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.910
GRETCHEN RUBIN: No, because
I think a lot of people

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.480
get discouraged because
something doesn't work.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.490
And on paper, it sounds
like a great idea.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.224
And then you're like well, maybe
it's just not suitable for you.

00:20:07.224 --> 00:20:07.890
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.120
So what would you
say to managers

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.590
in the room who are
trying to figure out

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.580
how to make their team
happiest and most productive?

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.490
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well,
I think the thing to do

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.890
is to really look at what is the
reality of how people behave?

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.770
And not say well, this
is the best way to do it.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.455
Because maybe you have to
work with different types.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.250
Let's say that you're
managing obligers.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.630
Well, then you
need to have forms

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:30.760
of external accountability.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.300
You can't be like well, will
you just go do this and tell me

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:33.910
when you're done?

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:35.210
Because it just
might never get done.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.377
You need to have a deadline.

00:20:36.377 --> 00:20:38.376
You need to have a sense
of supervision, a sense

00:20:38.376 --> 00:20:39.950
that there's external
accountability.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.204
But obligers often burn out.

00:20:41.204 --> 00:20:41.870
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.495
GRETCHEN RUBIN: So
if you're a manager,

00:20:43.495 --> 00:20:47.130
you need to encourage your
obligers to take time.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:51.390
To not push themselves
too hard, because it's

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.160
going to be hard for them not
to meet an external expectation

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.285
even when they're really
at the end of their ropes.

00:20:56.285 --> 00:20:57.760
So you have to
find ways to force

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.620
them to relax and to say no.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.160
Questioners.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.712
A lot of times in teams,
there's one person who's like,

00:21:04.712 --> 00:21:05.920
why are we doing it this way?

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.760
Why are we doing it at all?

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.945
Why am I listening to you?

00:21:07.945 --> 00:21:08.820
Is this the best way?

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.859
Is there another way?

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:10.900
Did you think about this?

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.460
Maybe we should
interview somebody else?

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.126
And everybody's like,
we've all decided!

00:21:14.126 --> 00:21:15.100
Let it go!

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.455
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:16.455 --> 00:21:18.830
And questioners sometimes get
frustrated with themselves.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.890
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.240
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Like
a friend of mine said,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.710
I have analysis paralysis.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.040
I always want just a little
bit more information.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.690
I don't like acting without
perfect information.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.395
But the fact is, often we
don't have perfect information

00:21:29.395 --> 00:21:31.640
and we can't wait for
perfect information.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.480
And so part of it
with questioners

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.154
is giving them
the justification,

00:21:35.154 --> 00:21:36.570
taking them through
the rationale.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.090
And then also helping
them to say we're

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.290
going to interview five
people, but not 50 people.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.570
We're going to look at this
for this amount of time

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.986
and to this degree,
and then we're

00:21:44.986 --> 00:21:47.524
going to move on so
that it's bounded.

00:21:47.524 --> 00:21:48.190
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.490
GRETCHEN RUBIN: So
there's a lot of ways

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.820
that it can come up in teams.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.180
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.260
I really like the part of
your book how you name things.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.011
Because I think it's
also very empowering.

00:21:55.011 --> 00:21:57.343
Because then I can see somebody
saying to their manager,

00:21:57.343 --> 00:21:57.980
I'm an obliger.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.180
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.725
LOGAN URY: So I need you to
create more accountability.

00:21:59.725 --> 00:22:00.050
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:00.430
Yes, yes.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.160
LOGAN URY: And I think
naming things is great.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.420
Maybe you can talk a little
bit about loophole rejecting?

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.080
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh right, right.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.190
LOGAN URY: That's one of
favorite terms that you coined.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.250
GRETCHEN RUBIN: So I love
all my 21 strategies.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.732
But the funniest strategy, and
the one that I was always-- you

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:16.190
know how you always want to
work on the things that already

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.819
the best?

00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:19.860
I was always tinkering
with the loophole chapter,

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.530
because I love it so much.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.490
So there's 10
categories of loopholes.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.690
They are all hilarious
because we are

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.419
such advocates for ourselves.

00:22:26.419 --> 00:22:28.460
So a loophole is something--
you're not mindfully

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.679
making an exception to a
habit, which we can all do.

00:22:30.679 --> 00:22:31.470
We're all grownups.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.750
We can do whatever we want.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.956
But a loophole is when in
the heat of the moment,

00:22:35.956 --> 00:22:37.830
it's like a cellphone
searching for a signal.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.440
You're like, wait a minute!

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.580
I'm off the hook here!

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.624
I forgot, I'm going to
be so good tomorrow,

00:22:43.624 --> 00:22:45.040
it doesn't matter
what I do today.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.007
All right!

00:22:46.007 --> 00:22:46.840
Or it's my birthday.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.506
I'm on vacation.

00:22:47.506 --> 00:22:48.870
It's raining.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.070
I hurt my foot.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.050
And so there's 10
categories, and they're all

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.080
incredibly popular.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.340
Everybody has a few favorites.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.923
My favorite is the
false choice, which

00:22:57.923 --> 00:23:00.890
is I'm too busy
writing to exercise.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.000
No, really the day
is long enough for me

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.540
to do both those things
most of the time.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:11.230
Another very popular one is
the fake self actualization

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.660
loophole, which is when in the
moment, you're like, you know,

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.866
you only live once!

00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:17.490
Life's too short not
to have a brownie!

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.270
LOGAN URY: The YOLO loophole.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:18.780
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.647
YOLO.

00:23:19.647 --> 00:23:21.480
I have to take advantage
of this opportunity

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.326
or miss out forever.

00:23:22.326 --> 00:23:23.575
I mean, a pumpkin spice latte.

00:23:23.575 --> 00:23:24.360
Who could say no?

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:29.050
So that's fake
self actualization.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.330
Another one is planning to fail.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.489
Which is when you very carefully
arrange a set of circumstances

00:23:34.489 --> 00:23:36.530
so that then you're in a
place where no one could

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.890
expect you to resist.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.700
And my favorite story like this
was told to me by a friend.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.520
And he had a friend who
had a gambling problem.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.520
And so he ran into the guy--
he lived in Los Angeles.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.699
And he ran into the guy
and he said, how you doing?

00:23:49.699 --> 00:23:51.740
And the guy said, I'm not
doing so well because I

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.680
lost a lot of money gambling.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.690
He said, well, I
thought you weren't

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.055
going to do that anymore.

00:23:55.055 --> 00:23:57.740
And he said, well you
know, I was in Vegas.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.560
Why were you in Las Vegas?

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.410
Well, I just bought a
new car and I wanted

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.900
to take it for a test drive.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.750
To Las Vegas!

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.751
That's planning to fail.

00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:06.416
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:24:06.416 --> 00:24:08.770
GRETCHEN RUBIN: But one of
the most dangerous loopholes,

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.480
because it's absolutely true
and it works in every situation,

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.570
is the one coin loophole.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.310
And this comes from
an ancient teaching

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:22.100
story which says would you say
that one coin makes a man rich?

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.020
You would say no.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.437
One coin does not
make a man rich.

00:24:24.437 --> 00:24:26.020
But what if you give
him another coin,

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.616
and what if you give
him another coin?

00:24:27.616 --> 00:24:29.990
At some point, you have to
say that a man has become rich

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.250
because one coin made him rich.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.050
And this is the
thing with habits.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.280
What is one trip to the
gym going to do for me?

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.809
What's one cupcake?

00:24:40.809 --> 00:24:42.600
Why should I bother to
wear a helmet today?

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.890
What are the chances I'm going
to get an accident today?

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.406
But the only way
you get the benefit

00:24:47.406 --> 00:24:48.780
of a habit, the
only way you form

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.260
a habit is one coin after
one coin after one coin.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.330
But at any particular
moment, that one-- why

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.290
should I work on my
Ph.D thesis today?

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.070
I'm not going to turn
it in for two years.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.305
It always works.

00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:03.050
It always works.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.200
But the fact is that's the
only way we do anything

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.250
is by doing it right now.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.805
And so people will often
shift between these two

00:25:11.805 --> 00:25:12.680
at their convenience.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.888
Like it's really important
to me to read to my child,

00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:16.820
but I'm not going
to do it tonight.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.780
But how are you ever going to
do if you don't do it tonight?

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.480
So it's a really
insidious loophole,

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.700
because it's always accurate.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.580
But if you really
follow it, then you

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.070
would never do anything.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.140
But they're all so fun.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.370
They're all so imaginative.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.090
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.090
One part of your book I
found really interesting

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.290
was how hard it is to start
a habit the second time.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:34.590
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes!

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:35.960
LOGAN URY: So you put a lot
of effort in the first time.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.680
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Weird, yes!

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.660
LOGAN URY: Can you talk
a little bit about that?

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.360
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, it's
this thing that I noticed.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.690
Starting over is harder.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:40.800
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.383
GRETCHEN RUBIN: And many people
would say oh, I did this thing

00:25:43.383 --> 00:25:44.590
and it was not so hard.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.767
But then for some
reason I stopped,

00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:48.350
and then I had to
start over, and then

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.110
I couldn't do it again.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.631
And so it's very
important whenever

00:25:51.631 --> 00:25:53.130
you have a good
habit that you don't

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.722
want to allow yourself to stop.

00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:57.930
Let's say you go on vacation.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.620
You don't want to conceive
that as a stopping, but really

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.220
always have a plan for what
happens on the other side.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.870
Like maybe I can't do it for
this month, but on this date

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.630
I'm going back to
the gym or I'm going

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:13.270
to start doing my Spanish
class again or whatever it is.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:17.647
And weirdly, a strange stopping
point is reaching a goal.

00:26:17.647 --> 00:26:20.230
You would think reaching a goal
would energize people and help

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.590
them keep their habits.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.160
But actually hitting a goal
is a kind of finish line.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.150
You feel like, oh
I've achieved my goal.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.927
I did a 60 day sugar detox.

00:26:30.927 --> 00:26:32.760
But really if you're
trying to form a habit,

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.590
you want it to keep going.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.970
So the finish line is dangerous.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.845
You maybe want to think
of it as a milestone.

00:26:37.845 --> 00:26:40.196
It's an exciting milestone,
but it's not a finish line.

00:26:40.196 --> 00:26:41.180
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.490
That resonated a lot with me.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:42.690
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.856
LOGAN URY: So Google products
are immensely popular.

00:26:44.856 --> 00:26:46.954
For example, there's over
500 million Gmail users.

00:26:46.954 --> 00:26:48.370
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yeah. [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.130
LOGAN URY: With this in mind,
and with probably people

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.005
in this room who work
on those products, what

00:26:52.005 --> 00:26:54.144
are some things that Google
could do to help people

00:26:54.144 --> 00:26:56.810
through the insights that you've
had about happiness and habits?

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.120
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Interesting.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.020
Well, it's always good
to make everything

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.869
that you want to do
to be very convenient

00:27:02.869 --> 00:27:05.285
and anything you don't want
to do to be very inconvenient.

00:27:05.285 --> 00:27:07.065
So I'm trying to think of what--

00:27:07.065 --> 00:27:08.940
LOGAN URY: So there's
YouTube, Gmail, Search.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.398
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Oh, maybe you could

00:27:10.398 --> 00:27:13.090
have a thing on your
Google Maps that blacks out

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.200
a certain kind of thing.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.254
Like I'm not going to see any--

00:27:18.254 --> 00:27:19.295
AUDIENCE: Baskin-Robbins?

00:27:19.295 --> 00:27:20.075
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:27:20.075 --> 00:27:20.616
There you go!

00:27:20.616 --> 00:27:21.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:21.920
Yeah.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.680
Somebody's speaking
from experience.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.586
Right.

00:27:23.586 --> 00:27:25.150
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.430
It's going to just wipe it
out so you can't find it.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:28.680
Or yeah.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.075
I mean, there are ways
to block certain-- I

00:27:31.075 --> 00:27:32.450
mean that's
something that people

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:37.280
do is they shut off their
internet part of the time

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.205
or they shut off certain sites.

00:27:39.205 --> 00:27:41.415
LOGAN URY: What about
notifications, reminders?

00:27:41.415 --> 00:27:43.362
Do you use that?

00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:45.320
GRETCHEN RUBIN: I don't,
but some people really

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.195
do find that helpful.

00:27:46.195 --> 00:27:48.950
Well, one thing
along those lines

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:53.950
is one habit that
many, many people want

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.720
to have is the habit of
going to bed earlier, which

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.987
is very challenging for people
for a lot of different reasons.

00:27:59.987 --> 00:28:01.820
But something that works
for a lot of people

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.881
is to set an alarm that
reminds you go to bed.

00:28:03.881 --> 00:28:06.130
And you almost need the
snooze alarm for going to bed,

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.860
because you need
that time to be like,

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.443
OK, it's time to
start getting to bed,

00:28:09.443 --> 00:28:11.340
and then it's
actually your bedtime.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.910
Yeah, so that kind of
notification or anything.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.567
Except some people, they
use a mindless notification.

00:28:16.567 --> 00:28:18.900
So this bell rings, and that
reminds them to be mindful.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.010
But I was thinking, that would
be so deeply annoying to me

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.509
that there's this bell going
off randomly throughout my day.

00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:26.280
It would not make me
mindful in a good way.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.400
But yeah, notifications
can be really--

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.966
LOGAN URY: Speaking
of mindfulness,

00:28:29.966 --> 00:28:31.590
I thought-- not to
give away a big part

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.673
of the book-- but your
journey through meditation,

00:28:33.673 --> 00:28:34.995
and ultimately you gave it up.

00:28:34.995 --> 00:28:35.990
GRETCHEN RUBIN: My
thwarted journey

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.605
through meditation, yeah.

00:28:36.605 --> 00:28:37.330
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:39.320
That was very humanizing
for me when I read it.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.790
Because I was like, oh
Gretchen's not perfect.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.629
She tries to do this
habit and she couldn't.

00:28:43.629 --> 00:28:45.420
Maybe you can talk a
little bit about that?

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.295
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:28:46.295 --> 00:28:48.990
Well, so I felt like I'm doing
all this happiness research

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.323
and trying out all these things.

00:28:50.323 --> 00:28:52.520
And then it was like, how
is it that I had never

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.280
tried meditation?

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.125
Because this is like the
top one of the top things

00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:59.280
that people are always
suggesting that you try.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.075
And I'd heard all these people
talking about how great it was

00:29:02.075 --> 00:29:03.950
and how much it had done
for their happiness.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.700
So even though it had
never appealed to me

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.450
and I had this
identity as like, I'm

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.030
the happiness expert
who doesn't meditate,

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.759
then I thought, I
really should do it.

00:29:12.759 --> 00:29:14.550
I should let go of that
part of my identity

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.014
which is not helpful to me
and I should try meditation.

00:29:17.014 --> 00:29:19.430
So I did what I always do,
which is I got a bunch of books

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.263
and read about what you
were supposed to do.

00:29:21.263 --> 00:29:23.850
And I had my whole routine
and I did it every morning.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.180
I did it every morning
for months and months.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.732
And I got very excited
about the idea of embracing

00:29:30.732 --> 00:29:31.940
this new part of my identity.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.315
It was going to
be this new thing

00:29:33.315 --> 00:29:36.230
and maybe I was going to
have this exciting experience

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.040
and it would be
really interesting

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.870
and I would have my
meditation experience

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.867
to be able to talk to all the
other people who were doing it.

00:29:45.867 --> 00:29:46.950
And it did nothing for me.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.749
It just started
driving me crazy.

00:29:49.749 --> 00:29:51.290
And people who
meditate will be like,

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.710
that's because you
needed it so desperately.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.220
And if only you'd
worked through it,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.386
you would have gone through.

00:29:55.386 --> 00:29:58.650
And so I did that for
a month where I'm like,

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.450
I'm going to break through.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.680
And then yeah, I was just
like I have to let this go.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.190
This is just not helping me.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:11.150
This is actually not
helping me because I just

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.670
am finding it frustrating.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.090
And so I gave it up.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.910
But the funny thing was is
that it was hard to give it up.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.240
Because I had attached
to this fantasy of myself

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.070
as a person who did meditation.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.400
And so just as I'd had
to embrace that identity,

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.510
then I had to relinquish
that identity.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.950
Because I wanted to be the
kind of person who meditated,

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.240
but that's not the same thing
as actually wanting to meditate.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.940
So I felt like I had
to be Gretchen and drop

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.302
the meditation.

00:30:40.302 --> 00:30:41.760
I'll probably try
it again sometime

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.926
because people are always
telling me I should do it.

00:30:43.926 --> 00:30:45.841
So I'll probably
experiment again.

00:30:45.841 --> 00:30:48.090
LOGAN URY: Oh yeah, be
Gretchen is one of your secrets

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:48.540
of adulthood.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:48.810
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes.

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:49.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.930
LOGAN URY: And I've been
using a lot of those.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.580
Food tastes better if you
eat it with your hands.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:52.850
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:53.490
LOGAN URY: It's true.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:54.000
GRETCHEN RUBIN: I know.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.875
That's sort of gross.

00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:56.210
But it is true, I think.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.460
LOGAN URY: So as a final
question before we open it

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.700
up the audience,
I'll ask you what

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.241
I like to ask people
who visit, which

00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:03.799
is, if you could take over the
Google homepage for one day--

00:31:03.799 --> 00:31:04.590
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh!

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.620
LOGAN URY: And write a line of
text under the logo, what would

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.120
you say?

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:13.860
GRETCHEN RUBIN: I would say
perform the easiest good deed

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.180
that you could ever perform and
sign up to be an organ donor.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.880
Because organ
donation is something

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.100
that almost everybody supports.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.000
Not almost everybody, but
many, many people support.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.840
And they just haven't
signed the organ registry.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.710
And so then if the opportunity--
and it's a very rare privilege

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.168
to die in a way that would
allow you to donate your organs.

00:31:33.168 --> 00:31:36.429
And then in this moment
of terrible catastrophe,

00:31:36.429 --> 00:31:37.970
their families don't
know what to do.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.469
And then this opportunity for
all these other people's lives

00:31:40.469 --> 00:31:41.630
to be saved is lost.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.780
And to me, it just
seems like sad

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.342
that there are all these people
who would be happy to do it,

00:31:47.342 --> 00:31:49.550
and they just haven't been
organized enough to do it.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.921
And all you have to is click,
just to actually sign up

00:31:53.921 --> 00:31:54.420
to do it.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.800
Or even just tell
the people around you

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.390
that you want to be an
organ donor, because they'll

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.170
be asked, does this person
want to donate their organs?

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.270
And if they know the
answer, then they'll do it.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:02.860
And this has special
resonance for me

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.580
because my husband
had hepatitis C

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.940
and so he was a really very
likely candidate for needing

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.010
a liver transplant.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.230
And so it just became
very obvious to me

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.790
how there's this very high need
for organs and all these people

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.320
who would like to
give their organs,

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.620
but it's just not known in time.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.340
And the miraculous thing is that
there was this new drug that

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.256
went on the market last
year and so my husband

00:32:25.256 --> 00:32:27.740
is cured of hepatitis C,
which he's had for 30 years.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.280
This amazing thing.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.556
But I'm still so frustrated
by organ donation,

00:32:33.556 --> 00:32:34.930
because it does
seem like there's

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.324
this disconnect between what
people really want to do.

00:32:37.324 --> 00:32:37.990
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.614
GRETCHEN RUBIN: And the fact is,
if you want to do a good deed,

00:32:40.614 --> 00:32:43.330
pay it forward, random
acts of kindness,

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.330
it takes you no time, no effort.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.520
And it's not even like donating
blood where you to show up

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.270
and the drink your orange juice.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:50.960
This is nothing.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.800
You'll never hear
about it again.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.525
LOGAN URY: You just have to die.

00:32:52.525 --> 00:32:53.400
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.270
Well yeah, that's
out of your hands.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.800
So there's no
effort on your part.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.841
It's the easiest good deed
that you will ever do.

00:33:00.841 --> 00:33:02.010
And it's transformative.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:03.400
It's huge.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.060
Something like
seven people's lives

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.550
can be saved or transformed.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.417
So I think that I would make
a pitch for organ donation

00:33:10.417 --> 00:33:11.500
if I had that [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.373
LOGAN URY: That was a
surprising and beautiful answer.

00:33:13.373 --> 00:33:13.736
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh, thanks.

00:33:13.736 --> 00:33:15.880
LOGAN URY: Do you know all the
behavioral economics research

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.550
about organ donations?

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.740
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh
yeah, believe me, I do.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.210
LOGAN URY: So you
guys know it's about--

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.460
GRETCHEN RUBIN: But there's
all kinds of complications

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.322
with state legislatures.

00:33:22.322 --> 00:33:24.780
And they often advocate for
things that are not politically

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.050
realistic in the United States.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.585
Like having the default
be that you opt in,

00:33:27.585 --> 00:33:28.790
and you have to opt out.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.300
That's not going to go over
well in the United States.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.110
It's a good idea.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.450
It's not politically realistic.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.850
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.450
GRETCHEN RUBIN: So yeah,
there's huge amount of people--

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.690
LOGAN URY: Dan Arielly
has this funny line.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.740
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.089
LOGAN URY: I hope my kids
grow up to be form designers.

00:33:41.089 --> 00:33:42.880
Because of how much it
matters whether it's

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.120
an opt in or an opt out.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.830
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:45.510
Yes, yes.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.990
Or one of the things
that it turns out

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:51.220
is if the question on
the driver's license

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.650
is do you want to be an
organ donor, yes or no?

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:55.555
You don't want that.

00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:56.780
That is really bad.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.850
You want it to be yes
or not at this time.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.610
You don't want people to start
having the identity of no,

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:03.060
I don't want to
donate my organs.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.000
It's like, right now I don't
feel like donating my organs.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.370
But you know, not at this time.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.880
LOGAN URY: That's interesting.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.420
I've never heard that.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.128
GRETCHEN RUBIN: No,
very, very important.

00:34:10.128 --> 00:34:12.830
Because one state did that
it had real consequences.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.270
So you're exactly right.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.979
Form design is so
powerful and important.

00:34:15.979 --> 00:34:18.603
LOGAN URY: And it's what you see
with updates on your computer.

00:34:18.603 --> 00:34:20.107
Yes, not now, all
of those things.

00:34:20.107 --> 00:34:20.940
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes!

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:21.305
Right, right.

00:34:21.305 --> 00:34:21.570
Later.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:21.939
LOGAN URY: Yeah, same thing.

00:34:21.939 --> 00:34:22.800
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.270
LOGAN URY: We should
chat about this, yeah.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.625
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:24.980
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.935
So I want to give you all
time to ask questions.

00:34:26.935 --> 00:34:27.330
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:27.500
I'd love some questions.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.041
LOGAN URY: So Bjorn
has a microphone.

00:34:29.041 --> 00:34:31.239
So ask the question-- oh,
I don't need to repeat it

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:31.449
because there's a mic.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:32.219
GRETCHEN RUBIN: And
you get a gold star.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:32.440
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.356
GRETCHEN RUBIN: If you
ask the first question.

00:34:34.356 --> 00:34:37.295
AUDIENCE: I think one of the
ways to be more productive

00:34:37.295 --> 00:34:40.134
and have good habits is to come
up with systems for yourself.

00:34:40.134 --> 00:34:41.050
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Right.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.080
AUDIENCE: But like you
said, everybody's different.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.413
It's not immediately obvious
whether a particular system

00:34:45.413 --> 00:34:46.710
is going to work well for you.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.120
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Right.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.449
AUDIENCE: So you need to be
able to try it on for size

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.219
and commit to it.

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:52.616
And then at some
point, evaluate.

00:34:52.616 --> 00:34:53.449
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes.

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:55.157
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any recommendations

00:34:55.157 --> 00:34:58.550
for how long to try something
before you turn around

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.340
and evaluate it?

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.910
Or how to go about
evaluations so

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:01.890
that you can--
because you really

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:02.780
have to commit to that time.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:02.880
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Right.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.930
AUDIENCE: If you're
constantly questioning

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.190
whether this is
really a good idea,

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:06.065
you'll never make it, right?

00:35:06.065 --> 00:35:06.790
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Right.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:08.480
Now there is sort
of an urban legend

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.940
that it's either 28 days
or 21 days or 30 days

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.790
to form a habit.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.700
But actually that's not true.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.010
There is no magic number.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:19.376
There was a study that said that
66 days was the average time.

00:35:19.376 --> 00:35:21.750
But that means nothing, because
it means some were longer

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:22.600
and some were shorter.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.100
And some people could
form habits easily

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.110
and some didn't
form them at all.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.276
And some habits were easy
and some habits were hard.

00:35:27.276 --> 00:35:30.780
So the number 66, that
doesn't tell you anything.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.400
And I think there
is really no answer,

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.330
because some habits, if
it clicks in right away,

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.270
you can sort of
feel that this is

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.867
the way that's working for you.

00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:43.200
And sometimes you're right,
you have to let it play out.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.690
And I don't think there's
an easy way to know.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.600
Except that I think
you can tell when

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.990
something is going
against your grain,

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:52.030
that it's not coming easily.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.290
Like again, with the
night people trying

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.780
to exercise in the morning.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.800
Every day, it's a huge struggle.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.140
It never is coming easily.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.681
It's never feeling
like it's helping.

00:36:02.681 --> 00:36:05.180
And so that's when you want to
say this is not right for me.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.609
But I also think that you
can design it up front.

00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:09.900
I think if you think about
yourself with the strategies

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:16.176
that you could try, you can
avoid a lot of false starts

00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:18.800
because you're designing things
in a way that are going to work

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.030
for you from the beginning.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:21.530
And a lot of times,
people are like,

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.489
well this is what worked
for Benjamin Franklin.

00:36:23.489 --> 00:36:26.071
Well, it's going to work for you
if you're a lot like Benjamin

00:36:26.071 --> 00:36:27.259
Franklin, but otherwise no.

00:36:27.259 --> 00:36:28.800
And another thing
that's very helpful

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.174
when you're trying to evaluate
what might work for you is

00:36:31.174 --> 00:36:35.340
was there a time in your past
when you had good success?

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.390
Like my friend.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.650
There was a clue
to her that she had

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:42.030
no trouble with this habit
when she was on the track team.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.300
She didn't understand
what the clue was.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.890
The clue was external
accountability.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.050
But there was there.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.883
And I talked to somebody
who was like, well,

00:36:48.883 --> 00:36:50.210
I thought I hated to cook.

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.270
But then when I
thought back on it,

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:52.630
I realized when I
lived in a group house

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.130
after college I cooked all
the time and I enjoyed it.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.320
And when I thought about
what was different,

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.470
it's that my roommate
loved to food shop.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.700
She said, I realized it's
not that I dislike cooking.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.874
I hate food shopping.

00:37:05.874 --> 00:37:07.290
And so then she
organized her life

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:08.780
so she didn't do
any food shopping

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.230
and then she was happy to cook.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:12.344
So sometimes looking
at times in your past

00:37:12.344 --> 00:37:14.510
and thinking about well,
what were the circumstances

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.344
there that contributed
to it being possible?

00:37:16.344 --> 00:37:18.676
Because a lot of times when
we're trying to form habits,

00:37:18.676 --> 00:37:21.470
there have been times when we
were able to be productive,

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.869
or we were being able
to stick to something.

00:37:24.869 --> 00:37:27.035
But then I think sometimes
we don't think about that

00:37:27.035 --> 00:37:28.425
when we're moving forward.

00:37:28.425 --> 00:37:30.550
AUDIENCE: And you think
that's a core nature thing?

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:33.610
Not a, when I was 20, I was a
different person than I am now?

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:36.210
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well, I think
it's probably a core nature

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.710
thing.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.722
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:38.722 --> 00:37:42.620
AUDIENCE: Is it possible
to help others form habits?

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:46.760
Especially those who
are trying and failing

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.200
and you want to do something?

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.116
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Right.

00:37:49.116 --> 00:37:50.930
AUDIENCE: Can you
help or does it

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:54.672
have to come from within
the person him or herself?

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.880
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well, that's
an interesting question.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.040
Because if a person
truly doesn't

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.290
want to form a habit then I
think it's very difficult.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.100
And sometimes people have what
I would call red herring habits,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.490
where they're making the sounds.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.080
I really should exercise.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.350
You're telling me to exercise.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:10.840
Yeah, you're right.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.920
I should really exercise.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.220
They have no intention
of exercising.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.344
They're just saying that
to get you off their back.

00:38:15.344 --> 00:38:16.530
They don't really want to.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.830
And in that case, it's very
hard because they really just

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.502
don't really want to.

00:38:23.502 --> 00:38:26.240
You know, I should stop
drinking so much coffee.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.547
But I don't really intend
to stop drinking coffee.

00:38:28.547 --> 00:38:29.380
So that's one thing.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.810
But often people really
do want to change

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.560
and they're frustrated
because they can't.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.184
And I think in that
case, you can help.

00:38:35.184 --> 00:38:37.996
And one way you can help is if
the person-- for many people,

00:38:37.996 --> 00:38:39.620
not for rebels, but
for everybody else,

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.630
and particularly obligers.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.020
Crucially for obligers.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.710
External accountability
is helpful.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:48.320
So if you see a person
who is struggling,

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.880
maybe help them
get accountability.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.630
You could act as an
accountability partner

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.670
or you can figure out
whatever the behavior is,

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.830
what would the accountability
be and build that in.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.480
Another thing is to do
the behavior yourself.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.580
Because in the strategy
of other people--

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:07.464
I talk about this-- we swiftly
pick up habits from each other.

00:39:07.464 --> 00:39:10.130
And this is why you want to hang
out with people who have habits

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:11.500
that you like, because
their habits are

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.380
going to rub off on you.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.170
Your habits are going
to rub off on them.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.980
I had a funny experience
because every year we

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.720
go on a beach vacation
with my in-laws,

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.710
but this year I went on
my book tour instead.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.000
So they all went without me.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.520
And my husband texted me
after three days and he said,

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.332
you're not here.

00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:29.290
Everything's starting an
hour and a half later.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:30.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:30.365 --> 00:39:31.870
Because I'm an early riser.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.120
And I'm the one saying, I'm
getting a little hungry.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.370
Are you guys ready for dinner?

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:36.830
And everything would start.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.550
So one person was affecting
the habits of five people.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.590
Not because I was actually
shaking them awake

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.330
in the morning, but
just because I--

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.090
So our habits.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:45.590
So if you have good
habits yourself,

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.790
that's going to be helpful.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:49.660
But another really, really
good way to be helpful

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.660
is to make a habit
more convenient.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:57.410
We are crazily influenced by
how convenient or inconvenient.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:00.030
These are twin strategies,
convenience and inconvenience.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.377
If you don't want
someone to do something,

00:40:02.377 --> 00:40:03.460
make it very inconvenient.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.900
If you want them
to do something,

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.700
make it as convenient
as possible.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.400
And this is where another
person can play a role.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.840
So if you're like, you're
not taking your medication,

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.477
can I get one of
those trays where

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.935
it's divided into
days of the week,

00:40:14.935 --> 00:40:17.280
and can I load it up every
week so that it's all there?

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.700
And can I put in front
of the coffee pot,

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.020
so if you're going to have
coffee in the morning,

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.530
you're going to have to
have your pill first?

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:22.909
And can I stand
there and say I'm

00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:24.200
going to check it off the list?

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:25.975
You know what I mean?

00:40:25.975 --> 00:40:28.180
Because the more you
make it convenient,

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.310
the more it's going
to make it easy to do.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.930
And I had this
experience because I

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.250
wanted to help my
now 16 year-old form

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.800
the habit of working on her
homework on Sunday morning.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.180
Getting up early and doing
some solid work before the day

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.880
went on.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.660
And she agreed to
do this, but you

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.940
can imagine it wasn't
something that was

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.690
naturally attractive to her.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.920
And so I make it as
convenient as possible.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.330
I wake her up gently.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.810
I help her carry her
stuff up into my office,

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.332
because I work next
to her, which is

00:41:01.332 --> 00:41:02.540
the strategy of other people.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.610
She's working, I'm
working on Sunday morning.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.480
And I bring her breakfast
on a tray with her cup

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.210
of tea and her whole breakfast.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.140
If she's chilly, I
get her a blanket.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.370
I want to make it as easy
and pleasant as possible

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:17.560
so that I grease the
wheels of that habit.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.000
So those are some things
that a person can do.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.560
But if it's an obliger, the
absolutely crucial thing

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.539
is to help them figure
out how to build

00:41:25.539 --> 00:41:26.830
in the external accountability.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.450
Because for so many
obligers, that's

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:32.320
just the thing that just
unleashes whatever the habit is

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.856
that they're trying to form.

00:41:33.856 --> 00:41:36.380
AUDIENCE: What's your
view on addiction?

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.000
So people who are
not necessarily

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.180
abstainers or moderators,
but overdoers?

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.780
And it seems like a
core nature thing?

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:51.137
So how would they break
that [INAUDIBLE] trait?

00:41:51.137 --> 00:41:52.720
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well,
what do you mean

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.170
by overdoers versus addicts?

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:59.120
AUDIENCE: So I guess
to me, addiction's

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.780
characterized by
overdoing and not

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.060
able to moderate or abstain.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.160
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Right, right, right.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.670
Well, that's a very
interesting question.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.880
And I've looked a lot at
these studies of addiction

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.760
because it's very
related to habits

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.780
and particularly how
people overcome addiction.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.310
In the book, I don't
talk about addiction.

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:15.600
I don't talk about addiction,
compulsion, disorders,

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.100
or nervous habits, so things
like hair twisting or nail

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.680
biting, which to me are
seen very different.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.840
And it's controversial whether
addiction is even real.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.030
Many people argue that
there isn't really

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:29.060
"addiction" in the way
that we think of it now,

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.200
which is a fairly new idea.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.820
But I think that the
line between addiction

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.800
and abstainers is interesting.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.250
Because for a lot of
people, it's all or nothing.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.190
There is no middle ground.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:46.550
And so I think one of
the interesting things

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:53.230
that in knowing when do you
need to control something that

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.770
seems like you're overdoing
it to other people,

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:59.360
is do you feel like this
is enriching your life?

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.280
Do you feel like this
behavior is good for you

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.790
and making your life
richer and more complete?

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.470
Or do you feel
like it's actually

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:08.499
dragging you down and making you
feel full of guilt and remorse?

00:43:08.499 --> 00:43:10.540
And this is actually
sometimes very hard to tell.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.541
I know several people who,
other people around them

00:43:13.541 --> 00:43:15.540
would be like, you've got
an exercise addiction.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.000
You exercise too much.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.840
But they're like, this is great.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.340
I love it.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.190
I see my friends.

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.620
I have all these
accomplishments.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:22.953
I love it, I love it, I love it.

00:43:22.953 --> 00:43:23.950
I'm out in nature.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:27.160
To them, it's enriching.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.270
It's not constraining
their lives.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.080
So sometimes what looks like
an addiction to one person

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.270
isn't for another.

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:42.517
But yeah, this idea
of do you manage--

00:43:42.517 --> 00:43:44.350
and I just have to say
as an abstainer, that

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:45.350
just seems easier to me.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:49.230
It's hard for me even to think
of the mindset of somebody who

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.004
would fight the desire
to overdo something

00:43:52.004 --> 00:43:52.920
by doing a little bit.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.546
Because that just
seems so challenging.

00:43:54.546 --> 00:43:56.753
But for some people, that's
really what works better.

00:43:56.753 --> 00:43:57.462
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:57.462 --> 00:43:58.753
So thanks for coming to Google.

00:43:58.753 --> 00:44:00.700
I'm a huge fan of "The
Happiness Project."

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.030
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh, thank you.

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:02.030
AUDIENCE: Love the book.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.694
I'm wondering if you still-- you
had a whole system of yourself

00:44:04.694 --> 00:44:05.485
for accountability.

00:44:05.485 --> 00:44:05.770
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, yes.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.570
AUDIENCE: All these
charts and ways.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.150
And for readers to do that
for themselves as well.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.840
Do you still do that?

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.860
Are you still checking off
the boxes of new habits?

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:19.040
Or do you feel like there's
a point where a habit becomes

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.791
so ingrained that you don't
need the accountability anymore?

00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:27.090
GRETCHEN RUBIN: See, now having
gone through all this habit

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:31.260
stuff, I understand I
don't need those anymore.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.430
But that I think is
my upholder nature.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:37.170
So I internalize the
checklist and it's not hard

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:38.700
for me to do that.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.470
But I think for many people,
keeping the checklist probably

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:44.040
might be useful indefinitely.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.920
Because it is a form
of self accountability.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.794
And so I don't.

00:44:49.794 --> 00:44:50.710
I don't have to do it.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.020
Well, I do some things.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.140
Like I keep a food diary.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.740
And for a while, I
was tracking my sleep,

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.770
though I stopped doing that.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:03.910
But I think for a lot
of people, tracking

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.230
is very useful for a long time.

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:08.670
And it also gives you that
sense of accomplishment too.

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:10.040
It's very satisfying.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.550
And it also keeps you from
feeling like you've blown it.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.530
Because you're like,
well, maybe I was bad.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:16.155
For three days, I
didn't keep my habit.

00:45:16.155 --> 00:45:17.890
But look, I did for so long.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:18.964
I can get back into that.

00:45:18.964 --> 00:45:20.380
So there's a lot
about it that can

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.742
be reassuring and energizing.

00:45:21.742 --> 00:45:23.450
So I think for a lot
of people, it really

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:26.920
is helpful to keep the
checklist going just depending

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.415
on what works for you.

00:45:28.415 --> 00:45:29.600
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.440
My question is more
about sharing the habits

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.610
that you've seen as working.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:35.443
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes.

00:45:35.443 --> 00:45:37.786
AUDIENCE: I think I always
wanted to do something,

00:45:37.786 --> 00:45:39.410
but I don't really
know where to start.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:40.284
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah.

00:45:40.284 --> 00:45:42.440
AUDIENCE: So can you
share maybe three things

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.980
that you've seen
people have done

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.892
this that had positive impacts
and we can try them out?

00:45:46.892 --> 00:45:48.100
GRETCHEN RUBIN: In what area.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.140
Like in what area?

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.170
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:51.850
Fitness, maybe?

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:52.850
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Fitness?

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:53.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.869
I feel like I don't
have great ideas.

00:45:55.869 --> 00:45:57.660
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Right,
right, right, right.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:01.845
AUDIENCE: I like to borrow from
someone who has done something.

00:46:01.845 --> 00:46:03.010
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Right.

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.856
Well, on my site-- I came
up with this too late for it

00:46:05.856 --> 00:46:07.480
to be in the book,
so it's on my site--

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.010
I have a checklist
for habit change.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:14.420
And so the idea is you could
put the habit that you want,

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.600
and then you could go
through and generate ideas

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.567
based on all the 21 strategies.

00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:20.900
And so first of all, when
you're trying to form a habit,

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.690
you want it to be as
specific as possible.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.900
So you wouldn't want to
form the habit of being fit.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.300
Obviously, that's a description.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.674
But you'd want to
be like, I want

00:46:27.674 --> 00:46:29.730
to have the habit of
going for a run every day.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:34.010
Or I want to have the
habit of walking to work

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.500
or whatever it might be.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.850
And then you can go through
all the 21 strategies

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.350
and figure out, how can I
make this more convenient?

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.790
How can I make it more
inconvenient to do

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.490
the opposite?

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:47.200
How can I use pairing, which is
when you do two things at once?

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.619
How can I give myself
healthy treats that

00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:50.910
are going to keep me energized?

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.850
How can I think about
being with other people?

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.350
How can I think
about my tendencies?

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:59.130
So when it comes to
fitness, some obligers

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.060
have told me
hilarious strategies

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.050
that they've used for fitness.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:06.350
My favorite, two obligers
decided that they

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:07.840
would be workout buddies.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.470
And at the end of the workout,
they each trade a shoe.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:13.580
So if you don't come
tomorrow, I can't work out

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:14.850
because you've got my shoe.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.255
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:17.255 --> 00:47:19.050
You have to come!

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.830
So there's a lot of
things like that.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:21.700
But it's like this.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.960
For a rebel, that
would them not go.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.240
Because they'd be like, no
one can tell me what to do.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.573
I'm not going to just because
it's inconvenient for you,

00:47:28.573 --> 00:47:30.240
because I don't feel like it.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.540
And so for them, that
would be counterproductive.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:36.290
So it's again figuring out well,
what's going to work for me?

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:39.522
Or a questioner might
be like well, I'm

00:47:39.522 --> 00:47:41.105
supposed to be doing
this gym routine,

00:47:41.105 --> 00:47:42.420
but I'm not convinced
it's the best for me.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.920
I really need to
put it in the time.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.620
The desire to make
an Excel spreadsheet

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:49.330
is a very big tip off that
someone's a questioner.

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.750
And you know, I had a
friend who was a questioner

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.920
and she wanted to start
eating more healthily.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.420
And she interviewed
10 nutritionists

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.794
and had an Excel spreadsheet
and ranked them on a 1 to 10

00:47:57.794 --> 00:48:00.330
scale on seven
different questions.

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:03.380
And then she believed, really
believed in what she was doing.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.921
And then she was
able to stick to it.

00:48:04.921 --> 00:48:06.400
So again, a
questioner might say,

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.290
I'm going to look at these seven
different types of exercise

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.770
and decide which
is the one that's

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:12.710
going to do for me what I want
in the most efficient, best use

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:14.240
of my time way.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.600
And really put the time in.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.590
Because a lot of times,
when questioners can't

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.595
do something-- like a
questioner was like,

00:48:19.595 --> 00:48:20.980
why don't I take my vitamins?

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.070
I got all these vitamins.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.456
The doctor told me to take them.

00:48:23.456 --> 00:48:24.430
I don't take them.

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:27.280
And I said, well, do you
think you need to take them?

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.927
She said no.

00:48:28.927 --> 00:48:31.510
If you thought that they really
mattered, you would take them.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.390
So I mean, a part of it is
just figuring out yourself

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.754
so that then you can shape
the habit in a way that's

00:48:36.754 --> 00:48:37.670
going to work for you.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:41.230
Because there's
all different kinds

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:45.673
of strategies to use depending
on what works for you.

00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:47.256
But some things are
counterproductive.

00:48:49.824 --> 00:48:51.490
The same strategy can
work for somebody,

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:53.406
and actually be
counterproductive for somebody

00:48:53.406 --> 00:48:54.035
else.

00:48:54.035 --> 00:48:54.440
LOGAN URY: Cool.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.720
We have time for
one more question.

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.390
And I don't want to forget
to mention your blog.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.950
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh!

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:58.915
LOGAN URY: Oh, your podcast.

00:48:58.915 --> 00:49:00.915
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes, I
have a new podcast called

00:49:00.915 --> 00:49:02.940
"Happier with Gretchen Rubin."

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:06.780
We were at, I think, number nine
on iTunes after we launched.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.844
And it's with my
sister Elizabeth Craft.

00:49:08.844 --> 00:49:10.260
And if you've read
the book, she's

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.814
in the book on her
treadmill desk.

00:49:12.814 --> 00:49:14.480
Logan showed me the
treadmill desk here.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.860
I'm very envious
because I can't have

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.109
a treadmill desk in my office.

00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:18.089
It's too small.

00:49:18.089 --> 00:49:18.880
So it's really fun.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.690
We talk about happiness and good
habits and our own experiences.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:22.920
And it's really fun.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.060
So check it out. "Happier
with Gretchen Rubin."

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.590
LOGAN URY: And signing
up for the newsletter.

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:28.390
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh, and
I passed around-- oh I

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:29.510
forgot to pass around the sheet!

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:30.850
Oh, will you start
passing it now?

00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:31.400
LOGAN URY: Sure.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.150
GRETCHEN RUBIN: I
guess what we'll do--

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.520
LOGAN URY: Sorry,
it's next to you.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.762
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Shoot.

00:49:33.762 --> 00:49:34.720
It's right next to you.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.300
Yeah, I have a sign up sheet.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.640
I have a monthly newsletter.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.098
I have a daily
happiness quotation.

00:49:40.098 --> 00:49:44.260
I have a monthly book club
where I recommend a happiness

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.580
or habits book, a work
of children's literature

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.550
because I'm a children's
literature freak,

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:52.050
and then one
eccentric pick where

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.650
I get to pick a book
that I love but that I

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:59.520
can't, in all fairness, say that
I think everybody would love.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.020
Yeah.

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:00.330
So those are [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:00.402
LOGAN URY: OK.

00:50:00.402 --> 00:50:01.700
When we post the video, we'll
put a link to the newsletter.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.110
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh
good, good, good.

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:02.970
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:03.190
Great.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.550
GRETCHEN RUBIN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:03.840
LOGAN URY: Well, this was great.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.210
GRETCHEN RUBIN: This was great.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:04.830
LOGAN URY: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:06.121
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Thanks so much!

00:50:06.121 --> 00:50:09.650
[APPLAUSE]
