DAVID KWONG: My name's
David Kwong.

00:00:03.355 --> 00:00:06.620
I am both a magician and a "New
York Times" crossword

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.020
puzzle constructor.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.280
That basically means I've taken
the world's two nerdiest

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.100
hobbies and put them right
into one career.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.100
And it's a real honor for me
to share my art with all of

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.310
you, some of the most creative
and innovative

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.640
people on the planet.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.620
What I'd like to speak to you
about today is the notion of

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.130
cross pollination.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.420
Basically the idea of taking
different disciplines and

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.180
finding the common strains
within to synthesize something

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.050
new and creative.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.030
And in my life, I've had three
very different passions,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.750
magic, puzzles, and movies.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.460
And somehow, surprisingly,
they've all

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.430
come together recently.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.460
So I'm excited to share
those with you today.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.380
So do we have any "Scrabble"
players in the house?

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.170
"Scrabble" players?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.140
"Words with Friends" players?

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.860
Yes?

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.470
"Bananagrams?" "Scramble?" I
love "Scramble." I play it

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.550
like half an hour a day.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.390
I'd like to teach you a little
bit about "Scrabble." And it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.705
involves bingoing.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.690
I'm going to try something
with the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.320
"Scrabble" tiles here.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.980
And I would like this young
man here to please grab a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.160
handful of tiles
out of the bag.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.470
Yes.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.250
Very good.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.904
And would you grab a handful
of tiles out of the bag?

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:28.700
AUDIENCE: Can he do it?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.180
DAVID KWONG: Yes.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.220
You may do it.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.172
Your name is Ethan.

00:01:34.172 --> 00:01:35.780
No, you have a name tag on.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.790
DAVID KWONG: Ethan, Ethan, drop
them in the cup for me.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.340
Ethan, drop those tiles
in the cup.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.670
Very good.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.400
Have you drop your tiles
in the cup, sir.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.120
Very good.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.130
And would you grab some tiles?

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.360
Now, I'm taking a selection
from you.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.050
There are 100 tiles
in the bag.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.080
There are nine A's and one
Z. And would you grab--

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.640
Oh, thank you so much.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.610
That was an O. OK.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.530
Now, you'll notice I'm not
using the whole bag.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.000
Let's turn the projector
on, if you don't mind.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.479
Because if I were to use the
whole bag, then I would able

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.540
to memorize exactly
what to do here.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.580
But I'm using a selection of
tiles from all of you.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.480
And I will bring this around
so you can actually

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.030
read what I'm doing.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.840
Turn this on.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.700
And my goal here is to
bingo using the tiles

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.660
you've given me.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.770
And I will make it a little
more difficult.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.190
Actually, let me first tell
you about bingoing.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.010
Here's how we bingo at a
competitive level in

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.790
"Scrabble."

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.420
You take something like the
tisane list, that's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.720
T-I-S-A-N-E, tisane.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.700
It's a type of herbal tea.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.680
That's a six letter strain, and
it consists of very easy

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.970
letters to anagram.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.520
So if you were to get the Z, or
the Q, or the X, you don't

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.140
want to hold onto them.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.570
You want to get rid of them
right away and end up with

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.580
S's, and T's, and R's, and A's,
and very easy letters

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.140
with which to anagram.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.790
This six letter strain you can
add a seventh letter to, and

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.460
you can bingo for
the tisane list.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.100
Now, it works for every letter
except Q, Y, or J. It doesn't

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.500
work for those.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.840
But it works for the other 23.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.920
So, sir, would you
give me a letter?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.590
I'll demonstrate the
tisane list.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.490
AUDIENCE: H.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.770
DAVID KWONG: So H plus
T-I-S-A-N-E, you can spell

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.980
"shitane." Shitane,
which is a bingo.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.690
And would you give
me a letter?

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.540
AUDIENCE: R.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.420
DAVID KWONG: R plus T-I-S-A-N-E.
You actually also

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.970
create the satire list.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.310
So there are a plethora of
bingos like retains and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.270
retinas, stainer and restain.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.944
And last, one final letter.

00:03:38.944 --> 00:03:39.740
AUDIENCE: L.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.550
DAVID KWONG: L. You can spell
"elastin," which I think is a

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.930
type of protein.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.380
You actually don't have to
know what they mean in

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.240
"Scrabble." You just have
to know they're words.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.760
And you can keep me honest
with this dictionary from

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.010
1996, which was my best
friend in high school.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.280
Maybe my only friend
in high school.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.280
So my goal here is to bingo
using these tiles.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.000
And to make it a little more
difficult, I will go for

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.350
eight-letter bingos.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.720
And I will try to interlock
the rest of the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.110
tiles at the same time.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.459
And to add a ticking clock, I
will try to do this in under

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.670
three minutes.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.240
Here we go.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.519
Now, can we see the timer?

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:21.880
Here we go.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.480
Three minutes to make three--
that's a blank--

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.630
eight-letter bingos and
rearrange the rest of the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.450
tiles at the same time.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.700
Here we go.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.020
OK, so you have given me
C-W-M, which is a great

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.045
vowel-less word, "cwm,"
which is a cirque.

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:42.380
It's a lake.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.850
It's a Celtic word, I believe.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.100
Let's do--

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.710
well, you gave me the
K, which is good.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.895
So let's do walk.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.010
And sidewalk is my first
eight-letter bingo, sidewalk.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.030
If you get lots of vowels,
you have to dump them.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.450
This is an anoa.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.190
The anoa is a Southeast
Asian water buffalo.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.940
I'll place that there.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.265
Ka is the Egyptian soul.

00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:16.500
But I need to use that K again,
so we'll stick that

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.610
there and do via.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.860
And let's--

00:05:23.634 --> 00:05:24.750
Do I have another S?

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.250
Good.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.510
This will turn into--

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.340
if I have the letters--

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.930
skydive.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.930
Take this V back.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.180
We lost the timer.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.920
Skydived.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.070
OK.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.080
And last but not--

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.860
I need another eight-letter
bingo.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.930
Ae is an old way of saying
the number one.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.540
We have bed.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.020
If you have two U's, you might
want to dump them with the

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.830
ulu, which is an Eskimo knife.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.820
The ulu.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.940
Those are legit too.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.230
You have to know your
two-letter words.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.090
There are 100 of them.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.360
OK, row.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.460
And I need one more, so let's
take this B and do-- and this

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.520
L-- and do bull here.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:25.690
With this W, we can spell
"bullwhip." A bullwhip is an

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:26.550
eight-letter bingo.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.010
So let's see if I can get
through the rest of these in

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.070
under the time.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.075
We have nay, up.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.860
OK, 50 seconds to get
through these.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.660
Ram, let's do row again.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.660
How am I doing on time?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.930
AUDIENCE: 45.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.340
DAVID KWONG: OK.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.950
Fa.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.615
OK.

00:06:52.615 --> 00:06:55.465
[SIGH].

00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:57.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.840
DAVID KWONG: You gave me a
lot of vowels, people.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.310
OK, we'll do it.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.040
The two letter words, you can
see, are essential to getting

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.290
through this.

00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:11.220
20 seconds.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.470
OK.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.030
This is killing me.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.590
Deer.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.924
Ire works here.

00:07:26.924 --> 00:07:29.409
AUDIENCE: Three, two, one.

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:30.403
DAVID KWONG: There we go.

00:07:30.403 --> 00:07:35.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.820
DAVID KWONG: I really just
didn't use a couple of

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.870
letters, a C and an E. But
I did accomplish what

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.840
I set out to do.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.300
Bullwhip, sidewalk
and skydived.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.870
And it's good that I didn't use
a couple of letters, a C

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.750
and an E, because I'm going to
tell you a little bit about

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.410
"Scrabble" scoring.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.270
Who can tell me what happens
when you don't use a couple of

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.005
letters in Scrabble?

00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:54.910
AUDIENCE: You lose the points.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.710
DAVID KWONG: You lose
the points, and your

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.540
opponent gets them.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.680
But actually now with inflation
in the scoring

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.730
system, you actually just get
double what your opponent was

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:03.510
left over with.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.330
And I'm going to draw
your attention over

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.450
here to this board.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:08.420
So it was, what was it?

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.720
A C and an E, right?

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.400
A C and an E, which is a
net of eight points.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:25.940
But I did make three
eight-letter bingos, skydived,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:33.275
bullwhip, sidewalk.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.280
Now, I'll put in the unique
values for the letters.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.120
And these never change.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.159
For those of you unfamiliar
with "Scrabble," the S is

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.880
always one, the K
is always five.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.990
There's only one K in the bag.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.510
But I managed to make
it intersect, so I

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.720
have it twice on here.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.700
And I'll put the rest in.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.220
The Y is four, two, one,
four, one, and two.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.690
And three, one, one, one, four,
four, one and three.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.180
And one, one, two, one, four,
one, one, and five.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.805
I play a lot of "Scrabble."
Now, with these three

00:09:04.805 --> 00:09:08.370
eight-letter bingos, if you
add them vertically, you

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.040
actually get a new eight-digit
number, right?

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.460
So let me show you
what I mean.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.440
If we were to take the S, plus
the B, plus the S, that's like

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.090
a one plus a three plus a one.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.850
That's a five.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.490
Now, I just want to review that
there were some puzzle

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.040
pieces in play before.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.880
And one of them was
a piece of fruit.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.620
You cut open the fruit, you
pulled out from within it a

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.670
dollar bill.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.200
And that was your dollar
bill, sir.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.780
Yes?

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.200
And you still have your
dollar on it.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.540
You signed it.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.020
You have it.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.520
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.110
DAVID KWONG: You'll notice on
your dollar that there's an

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.270
eight-digit serial number
on that dollar bill.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.520
AUDIENCE: Ohhh!

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.910
DAVID KWONG: Would
you take a look?

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.686
Does the first number to the
far left-- is it a five?

00:09:48.686 --> 00:09:49.070
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.430
DAVID KWONG: It is.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.825
What's just to the
right of that?

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:52.290
AUDIENCE: Holy cow.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.065
DAVID KWONG: Holy--

00:09:53.065 --> 00:09:56.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.170
DAVID KWONG: What's just
to the right of that?

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.910
Is it a seven?

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.310
Five plus one plus
one is seven.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.690
AUDIENCE: Seven.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.790
DAVID KWONG: What's just
to the right of that?

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.380
AUDIENCE: Seven.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.120
DAVID KWONG: Because four plus
one plus two is seven.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120
Just to the right of that?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.630
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.070
DAVID KWONG: Two plus one
plus one is four.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.100
Just to the right of that?

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.320
AUDIENCE: Nine.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.790
DAVID KWONG: One plus four
plus four is nine.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.790
Just to the right of that?

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.130
AUDIENCE: Nine.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.190
DAVID KWONG: We should
have another nine.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.860
Four plus four plus
one is nine.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.310
And what do we have just
to the right of that?

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.550
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.670
DAVID KWONG: Here's what's
interesting.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.730
We have D plus P plus
K. That is a zero.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.770
Carry the one, mind you, carry
the one to get a four.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.143
And that should match
your dollar bill.

00:10:24.143 --> 00:10:25.129
I think it does.

00:10:25.129 --> 00:10:26.115
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:26.115 --> 00:10:27.365
DAVID KWONG: Thank you.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.590
Jonathan, you'll notice also
that there are two letters

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.950
that surround that
serial number.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.380
AUDIENCE: Oh my.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.914
DAVID KWONG: What are they?

00:10:41.914 --> 00:10:42.750
AUDIENCE: C--

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.900
DAVID KWONG: They're a C and an
E. So thank you for that.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.855
[APPLAUSE]
