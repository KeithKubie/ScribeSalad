1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,893
Do Do, do,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:07,450
do Cho motherfucking d a sub
brother on the drive up here.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,400
I was thinking about all the busted ass
holes that are in the hospital today

4
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:13,690
from the Gay Pride Parade.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,550
Can you imagine how many guys went down
there just to say I ended up getting

6
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,820
fucked in the ass by the same time,
Bro. Let me tell you something.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,690
That was one of the biggest turnouts my
friend went and he said he had a fucking

8
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:29,710
blast. One of my guerrilla buddies said
he had a blast. Blast gay people. Great.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,400
And fucking New York all over. Everywhere.
Everywhere they're celebrating,

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,720
they can be free. But anybody who's
got a problem with them, it's crazy.

11
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:40,480
But on the dark side, let's
talk about the facts here.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,800
A couple of confused little young white
dudes went down there yesterday. Sure.

13
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:48,520
I'll go have a drink. Oh yeah. Some
guys who just wanted to be an ally.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,220
Ally to the gay folks. I just want
you to know I'm not gay, but uh,

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,870
I am your ally. Next thing
you know, Chad's millionaire.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,880
What's up brother? That's what guys
have to remember. Gay dudes are dudes.

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,980
They're all same rules apply all same
rules of scumbag Uri that apply to men

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,090
apply to gay men. Yeah.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,260
There's like three types of gay is this
gay guys that aren't interested? Yeah,

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,800
there's gay guys or the semi interested
and the gay guys that live the converge.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,420
It hurts my feelings as a 51 year old
man that that's still a big deal that

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,430
anyone cares at all. It
really does. It does.

23
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:29,140
It hurts my feelings because I thought
that by the time I was at fucking middle

24
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:34,120
aged 51 year old father that we'd be done
with that people wouldn't care for the

25
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:34,960
people who are gay. Like

26
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,570
I've all this shit to worry about of
all the shit in the world to worry about

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,050
you worrying about guys who like
guys like what do you give a fuck?

28
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,010
And they always go biblical.
They always go biblical.

29
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,420
Like it's always a, if God
wanted the be in the Bible,

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,570
all that is. That shit drives me crazy.

31
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,970
Where I lived in my old
house in North Hollywood,

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,700
there was a gay couple
across the street, two dudes.

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,200
One was the pilot for a major airline
and he was in the process and the other

34
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:08,350
guy got fired from target
for being a transgender.

35
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:13,330
This goes back to 2010 and they
had cats, you know, made dog.

36
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:14,920
I talked to the guys about cats.

37
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,800
There was an old guy down the block
that would come home and talk to him.

38
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:22,690
Like you can't talk them old white
dudes like you can't talk to them.

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,610
Can't encourage that in that neighborhood.

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,150
I don't want to do more of those
fucking assholes moving in. And I go,

41
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:31,690
they're out here feeding fucking
homeless cats. What's the

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,153
plan? Right?

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,380
So this day whenever I go to my old
neighborhood and I see him outside of that

44
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,140
pull over, I talked to him,
say hello. It just too sweet.

45
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,230
People trying to be fucking just
being who they are. Trying to be.

46
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,150
Who the fuck they are. I
don't. We make jokes, hey,

47
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:49,030
I make jokes and the whole
thing. But at the end of the day,

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,970
I learned the hard way. And I
talked about on stage here at night,

49
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,360
you were there when I said that
my daughter invited me to a party,

50
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,990
that she went to school with a kid and
his parents should train agenda and I

51
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,010
kind of weird. And

52
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,830
I went and on the way
out, I looked at the kid,

53
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,970
I seen 60 transgender people
that could come from a community.

54
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,490
And I saw this little kid
smiling. I'm like, Oh,

55
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,650
I'm adopted that kids are adopted.

56
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:14,800
Look what they're doing for that kid
that they're making them a life like,

57
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,300
and I closed the door and I went
in and like I said in the joke,

58
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:23,230
I hugged the lead tranny just and
now we're fucking tight. That's it.

59
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:27,160
I eat the food. Yes.
Yeah. It doesn't matter.

60
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,300
It does matter. The only time it
matters with me is with sports.

61
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,010
Just stop with that. Just stop with that.
And we're going to be fine with this.

62
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:38,990
I look, there's some statistic,
see if this is true, um,

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,300
that someone sent me that out
of the 14 states that allow, uh,

64
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,620
high school kids to compete
as the gender that they,

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,430
they identify with rather
than their biological gender.

66
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,350
In those 14 states,

67
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:58,351
transgender students are just
dominating transgender male to female.

68
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:01,540
They're just dominating,
just winning everything.

69
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,320
It's crazy. I know you
have problems with the box.

70
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,100
I have a problem between
the sports, all of it. When,

71
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,950
when it comes to like power sports,

72
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,680
like I'm not sure they've
done the work here.

73
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,960
I don't like this idea that every trend,

74
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,190
like they use the excuse of outliers and
the outliers are there some like super

75
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:22,120
athletes, right?

76
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,660
Like you can get a regular girl who
weighs 145 pounds or you can get,

77
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,620
you know, a Ronda Rousey weighs
145 pounds. You know, there's like,

78
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:35,950
there's extreme athletes that are
people that are different, right?

79
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:39,940
Like Serena Williams is clearly a
different level of athlete than a regular

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,950
person. Right. If regular girl who's
like her weight, she's just superior.

81
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,760
And I think that that is what you see
with some of these transgender athletes

82
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:54,640
that come over to become women. They
say, well they're no different than a,

83
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,980
like an an Wolfe who was like a
superior athlete. Female boxer.

84
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,850
You ever see in Wolf knock
girls out? No Dude Dude,

85
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,120
she haymakers is chick with a right
hand and say one of the most brutal one

86
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:11,980
punch knock outs you've ever seen.
Men or women, perfect technique. Boom.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,750
She has way lays this girl Tim Bell,

88
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,140
she falls out cold and there's not a
whole lot of women other than maybe Amanda

89
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,480
noon has been. Amanda Nunez is doing
it with them. Little gloves on.

90
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,110
I wonder if she would be able to do
it like that with those big gloves.

91
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:29,800
I think she probably could cause she
hits that God damn hard. But you know,

92
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,410
you gotta judge each sport by, you know
the, the like we see Pauline Manoj,

93
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,430
she goes over to bare knuckle boxing.

94
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,750
He doesn't do that well in comparison
to say like if somebody's like,

95
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:41,741
you know,

96
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:46,741
like a really good high level striker
with knockout power with the big gloves

97
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:50,980
on. Would you put like, if you put
Deontay wilder and little gloves,

98
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,250
I w I don't imagine anybody
being able to take that.

99
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,790
He's fucking people up at like a
heavyweight with those big gloves.

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,080
So it's a different thing, you
know? So who the fuck knows?

101
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,530
But the idea is the outlier,
the outlier, like the, the,

102
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,620
if you get one superior athlete and then
you have them sort of commensurate with

103
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,420
a transgender athlete,

104
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,010
a good guy who was an athlete
who became a woman that you know,

105
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,580
in his thirties and they identify
as it goes through the surgery.

106
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:26,540
But how much benefit does he take of
having testosterone flow through his body

107
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,750
for 30 plus years? We really don't know.

108
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,730
It doesn't mean you
hate transgender people.

109
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,550
It doesn't mean you don't love everyone.

110
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,060
It doesn't mean you don't want everyone
to live their life and be whoever they

111
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:42,560
want to be with total freedom.
I don't think we have,

112
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,610
we have males compete against males for
a reason cause we feel like it's more

113
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:46,940
fair.

114
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,520
Even though it's not like it's not more
fair if I'm playing basketball against

115
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,030
Michael Jordan, that's not fair.
He's better, he's better athlete.

116
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,520
There's just people that are going to be
way better than you no matter what you

117
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,030
do.

118
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,080
Like if I had trained all my life to be
a better basketball player than Michael

119
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,000
Jordan, it's not even physically possible.
Right? So there's outliers in males,

120
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,260
but when the outliers, when
there's so many, you have to,

121
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,220
when you see so many transgender athletes
that are dominating and sports and

122
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:16,910
then when you add combat sports,
which is how I got involved in this,

123
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,670
when a woman was doing that,
who was a transgender woman,

124
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,030
just not telling anybody and
saying it was a medical issue.

125
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
Like that's fucking
crazy. We all, we know,

126
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,930
we want to pretend that
everyone's equal. You know,

127
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,860
we want inclusiveness and we want
peace. We want everyone to get along.

128
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,910
We want in quality one gender
equality. Okay, I get it.

129
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,670
I see where you're going. But
we also have to look at reality.

130
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,500
The reality is there's this
fucking giant physical differences.

131
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,030
These transgender athletes are dominating
against women who are born a woman.

132
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,320
They have to be a woman their whole life.

133
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,220
They never have 30 years of testosterone
through the throne flowing through

134
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,740
their veins. It's like doing steroids
for 30 years and then stopping.

135
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,060
It's crazy. That's what I think.
You freaking me out. You know,

136
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:06,030
I just smoked some reef. Me Too, man.
How did you get me on this subject?

137
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,590
I don't even know how the Fuck Oh,
transgender people, but as human beings,

138
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,810
I love them all. I love
everybody. Dude. I,

139
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:16,110
Eddie Izzard is one of my favorite
guests of all time. He's so interesting.

140
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,090
He's been transgender since
85 I believe. He said, um,

141
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,690
prefers women likes women
is not, not a gay fellow,

142
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,390
just likes dressing up as a woman
and a extremely intelligent,

143
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,630
very interest. I fuck event
special on me. There you go.

144
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:37,620
15 years ago was mind bock. Yeah.
Say what you want to say. It was my,

145
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:42,621
it was up there with the great specials
because it had more of a one man show

146
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:45,990
tone to it. Yeah, you didn't
qualify that as a special,

147
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:49,650
but when you look at it as a whole,
it was a great fucking performance.

148
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,340
He's a special person and a,

149
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,140
um,

150
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,330
you just happens to be transgender.

151
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,850
That it kind of makes him
even more interesting.

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,370
Big Mouse special people.

153
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,330
I got to apologize to you for sound
for me because I've always had this

154
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:08,900
discrepancy. Last night I went out
for a little while. I got home,

155
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,040
I had a couple of numbers in
me. I grabbed the fucking apple.

156
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:18,041
I sat on a constant unwind and I put the
TV on and in front of me was the blues

157
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:21,770
brothers. Ooh. When was the last
time I watched the blues brothers?

158
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:22,604
I don't know.

159
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,790
So the scene that opens up is them at
the restaurant when he's trying to talk

160
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:32,750
the Maitre d and the join the band
and there's a family next to him,

161
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,980
a husband or wife and three
daughters. And the guy's telling them,

162
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:39,020
I'm not going to join the
band. So he goes, really,

163
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:40,010
you're not going to join the band.

164
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,700
He takes a bottle of champagne and he
goes over to the table and he goes,

165
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,910
so how much was that little goes,

166
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,720
I wasn't ready for that. I just
lost it. Right? He's like, I said,

167
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,630
[inaudible] goes, and the guy's like,
what? And he goes, for the women,

168
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,920
I want to pay you for the women. And
the guys like, you know Sara, sir,

169
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,580
he turns around, the guy comes
over, breaks his balls again,

170
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,870
he fucking turns over to the guy
again. He goes so much further. Wife,

171
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,070
wife, I remember this day,
this is Claire. This is crazy.

172
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,360
This is craziness.

173
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,140
This would never have mouth full of food.

174
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:26,650
And Dan Akroyd continues eating
in that background. And Dan,

175
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:29,440
we got to talk about Dannatt quick,
cause he's been like a hemorrhoid.

176
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,150
He's the silent, he don't make a
bull and make guy's phenomenal.

177
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,640
He's still around. And
if you don't believe me,

178
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:40,690
watch a movie named my girl and
then watch this and then watch him.

179
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:44,740
The fucking Liberace movie. He's
outlasted everybody. You know,

180
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:47,560
he's a serious believer in you. LFOs well,

181
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:51,250
what are you going to do with everything's
got problems right here. Right here.

182
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:55,690
When he threatens him right here. How
much for the wife? Okay, look at the guy.

183
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,200
Just joking. Just shit like it.

184
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,310
Them Champagne and then watch fucking
then Akroyd watch what he does.

185
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,060
He goes, if you don't fucking,
if you don't join the band,

186
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,410
we will be in here every
day for breakfast, lunch,

187
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,640
and fucking dinner and watch it. Dan
Akroyd does at this fancy restaurant,

188
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,470
but Joe, it doesn't stop that. They get
in the car. They drive off. Look at him,

189
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,290
look at him. That's craziness.

190
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,930
This is the last of real comedic.

191
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,510
If you're going to get into
comedy or you want to be,

192
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,710
this is comedy one oh one they
walk out, they get into a car.

193
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,750
That black fucking car, this is nonstop.
Joe Rogan. There's not like a hug,

194
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,890
like there's no swath. They get
into a car, they get into traffic.

195
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,120
The cop comes up to him, he goes, there's
Nazis, the having parade, and he goes,

196
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,230
the blue. She goes, Illinois and
Nazis. I hate them more than anything.

197
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,550
He looks at Ackroyd,

198
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:55,420
they fucking pull over and they take
the car and go right for the Nazis.

199
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,090
The Nazis have to jump off the bridge.

200
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,550
White people are clapping and
shit that they knocked them off.

201
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,230
Then they pull into a black neighborhood.
Who's playing the fucking guitar?

202
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,050
Your boy, John Lee Hooker down the middle
of the street. Don't quit. Don't quit.

203
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:15,430
Don't quit. Just playing the fucking
guitar. Then after he sang the song,

204
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,330
brothers fucking everywhere doing
that business. John Lee Hooker,

205
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,510
Belushi and Aykroyd, they just
stare at them down. Then from there,

206
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:27,040
they walk into a diner to get the
fucking guitar play and it's a reap the

207
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:31,590
Franklin and Aretha Franklin
to get at the fucking ambush.

208
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,520
That led to midnight. I got to go to bed.

209
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,600
I gotta get up at six 15 with the baby.
I don't give a fuck. I'm watching this.

210
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,660
Aretha Franklin goes off. They do a dance.

211
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,920
The black dude leaves with a white guitar
player. Then what the fuck would I go?

212
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,940
A pawn shop with the
fucking black piano player,

213
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,600
Ray Charles. He's the pawn shop owner.
He opens up the day. He's blind.

214
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,730
He owns a punch shop. Look at him. He
owns a points yet this doesn't stop.

215
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,680
Wow. I had a fucking finally got to bed
and then I felt bad about going to bed.

216
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,780
They will never make a movie
like this ever, ever again.

217
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,520
Then they start dancing like it's Greece.
This little dance. Let it go. Jail.

218
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,390
This got dancing. I'm like, look
at this like it is fucking Greece.

219
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,650
Look at this. This will
never happen again.

220
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:26,630
Joe Rogan layer black people flipping
in the air. This one, Calgary,

221
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,480
I'm the cut. This will never happen
again. These were these old shit.

222
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,860
This the WHO direct. Isn't this part
liberal? Look at these two. You take.

223
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,890
Belushi gave a fuck. Wow.

224
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,300
Look how free people were in movies.
There was no superhero more later.

225
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,450
Yeah.

226
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,980
It costs millions to make this
movie. Look at me. Look at,

227
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,480
they're dancing it out that you know
I forgot. Oh, goddamn fun. This movie,

228
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:57,470
this movie is fun. And then the
chick that died on the airplane. Oh,

229
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,310
what's the chick that
died on the airplane?

230
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:02,900
That was a star wars chick that died
on the airplane that was at Star Wars.

231
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,850
The chick last year might be the
best description of anybody ever.

232
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,030
The reefer I had that killed the,
what's that chicken down on the plane?

233
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,640
She has sleep apnea. She was
doing pills on the plane. Who?

234
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,370
She played the actress and
Star Wars. Carrie Fisher.

235
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,000
Carrie Fisher is chasing him throughout
the whole movie because he dumped her.

236
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,870
Oh, that's right. Throwing
missiles and grenades. Right.

237
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,170
And then they go into the bar and
they tell the fucking dude that they,

238
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,700
the good old boys. Oh my God,
this is don't stop. Oh my God.

239
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:34,590
Whoever wrote this directed this
shot this. So this whole movie,

240
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:35,670
they have the Nazis.

241
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:39,480
A looking from John Candy is
looking from with the state police.

242
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,830
Wow. That's all Chicago.

243
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,300
This is wild man. It's just what
the folks who are just listening,

244
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,890
she says the blues brothers,
1980 shake tail feather,

245
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,610
seen four of nine on movie clips.

246
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,890
How does that work with like

247
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,330
a year? Are they allowed
to show these? Yeah.

248
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,600
They made a deal with them
because this links also to the,

249
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,060
if you want to watch it, you can pay
right here to rent it and all that stuff.

250
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,290
Oh, look at this stuff. It just means
you fully support buying this movie.

251
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,560
You're looking at me going, Joey, it's
a Cami. Why they dead? Look at the,

252
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,370
it just took a brilliance. They look
at you, they're having a good time.

253
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,670
All of that. If they're not snorting
blow, they're not doing anything. Okay.

254
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,710
Now what's is this movie where he would
walk off the set and just knock on

255
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:31,460
people's door? One of those
movies, Bro. This fucking nuts.

256
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,080
When they would say, cut, you
got, you know, 18 go sit down.

257
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,870
Belushi was so fucked
up in the night before.

258
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,210
He would just wander
off into a neighborhood.

259
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:46,370
I'm not consuming these dong go you
mind if I crash on your couch? Yeah,

260
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,830
Bro. They had to go looking for
them in neighborhoods and shit.

261
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,330
He would just find people and
ask to sleep on that couch.

262
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,510
What duel could you knock on?
Look, the blues brothers may have,

263
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,490
John Belushi fell asleep
in a stranger's house.

264
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:03,491
Dan Akroyd proposed to Carrie's faces
crazy like this was this caddy shack.

265
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,590
You know when they shot caddy shack,
they shot it in Florida. I hit one.

266
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,910
Paramount went down there and they
fucking went nuts. They were like dog.

267
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,560
They found everybody snorting coke. Rodney
was throwing a party. They couldn't,

268
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:18,140
you know, this is a different type
of movie. These people having fun.

269
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,450
That's a different stab and fun on
that set. That's probably alcohol.

270
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,260
The director's drinking, you know,
he's keeping her bill. How many extras?

271
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:31,010
We're dancing fucking
hundreds. They're all in tune.

272
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,240
And it was like everybody
loved that movement.

273
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,850
That's one of the rare movies with a
musical scene that fucking everybody loved

274
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:41,090
the Blues Brothers Right now
the blues brothers started.

275
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,020
I'm saying that live like that was a
sketch, I guess. So Yak right. Wrote it.

276
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,230
John Landis directed it.
They covered it together.

277
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,720
Ackroyd's crazy in the you LFOs he's like
one of the main celebrities they pull

278
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,530
up when people start talking
about, uh, like UFO real believers.

279
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:02,510
He's done like little clips where he
narrates things, UFO shows and shit.

280
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,810
He fucking believes what
didn't. They just released that.

281
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,950
There's even more belief now
about foes. I, yeah, it's fun.

282
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,690
I don't know if it's real but
a, it's fun. That's how I feel.

283
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,010
Doug,

284
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,010
I did a podcast with Jim Florentine and
I explained to Jim Florentine that what

285
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,830
people don't know is that
Hudson county, New Jersey,

286
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,610
northern New Jersey is the number one
place in the country where they have the

287
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:33,590
most UFO sightings. Really?
Northern New Jersey. Look it up,

288
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,930
Jeremy, if you've got a
minute please. Not to be rude,

289
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,390
but isn't that like near
a couple of airports? No,

290
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,320
it's closer to like you don't like when
you live in New York City and then you

291
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:43,400
look at the Hudson River,

292
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,100
they say that people go on their
balconies to drinking coffee,

293
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,450
they talk on the phone and they'll
see a little flying social go by.

294
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,220
And I know for a fact
that in 1976 little one,

295
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,750
whatever the fuck they are,

296
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:59,751
I know for a fact that in 1975 and
1976 you could check me out on this.

297
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,820
Are you a full Landon
in Hudson County Park?

298
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,110
I was a kid and the next day the feds
locked off the park. That yellow tape.

299
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:11,650
They had samples. Go look it up dog.
They say you at fault. There's a, that's,

300
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,110
you see that? That, that, that, that's
called the north burglars where I'm from,

301
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,200
that's called, I forget what it's
called, but it was, so there was,

302
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,490
it's a circular building.

303
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,340
So they did so much coke in there
in the 80s they called it the grind.

304
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,350
That's the thing called it cause it was
shaped like the stone edge. Stonehedge.

305
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,150
I have a couple of
friends that lived there.

306
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,100
People that lived in that building have
seen UFO for fucking years and if you go

307
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:38,900
to youtube, there's an
actual north Hudson Park UFO.

308
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,870
They dug up, they even,
they came out the Mar,

309
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,540
there's a liquor store and the liquor
store guy says, you seen the lights,

310
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,220
you heard like the organ music
that they play. They landed,

311
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,810
a couple of Martians got out and took
samples and got back in the thing and took

312
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:55,644
off.

313
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,880
There's a youtube thing is a history
channel special about it and I still

314
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:02,430
remember being a young kid.
Did you find anything Jeremy?

315
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,850
Not Given that that was
what's pop pop popping up,

316
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,040
all that stuff about that
building and oh yeah, no, no, no.

317
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,650
It's anything that says a UFO landed that,

318
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,330
that's the story I'm reading right
now is what he's saying and witnesses,

319
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,790
you know, it's not just one
guy that says, oh no UFO.

320
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,390
It's people who got knocked in the
door and said, do you see anything,

321
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,610
anything at 1110 at night?
And I said, you know what?

322
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,890
There were lights flashing outside.

323
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,710
They contacted police departments
to see if there was any,

324
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:33,470
they went full to and the FBI
came in, circled the park closed.

325
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,810
It was by the little league field and
Hudson county, but it's, you know,

326
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,970
like you'd think it was area 51 you think
it was close with northern Las Vegas.

327
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,920
The number one place to see you
in foes is northern New Jersey.

328
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,870
They even made a reference to it.

329
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,530
The Sopranos when he said something and
he goes, what are you talking about?

330
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:55,710
Last week you said you were saying that
you were following Hackensack because

331
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:59,460
that's where they're at.
Hackensack Monache throw those,

332
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,660
you'll go to Monaca in New
Jersey. A lot of ugly apples.

333
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,780
A lot of people were big heads.

334
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:08,640
The only good thing in New Jersey is
fucking Segovia Spanish restaurant.

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,060
It's been, this is 19
fucking [inaudible]. I Dunno,

336
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,210
but that's the only good
thing about Murdoch.

337
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,070
I think those people in
Munafiki had been abducted.

338
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,730
They stuff and they put them back
as big Heather motherfuckers.

339
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,790
I did a Gig there a couple times.
Oh yeah. They used to be like a bar.

340
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,660
There's a bar that did
something. Pop Gonzo Gig. Yes.

341
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:31,170
Outside the C club was it?
Yeah, it's outside. No, no, no.

342
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:34,290
I think Bob is more down the shore
and stuff, but, well he had gigs all,

343
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,990
he had gigs all over.
Bob, how I met Bob was,

344
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,880
he did a Gig in Romanos Italian restaurant
in my hometown and my buddy's like,

345
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,220
hey, aren't you a comedian?
Let's take you up there.

346
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,890
And we went up there and Bob was like, I
don't know, you know, he said I'm known

347
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,920
and next to him Bob came up and
I was like, no gotta put you out.

348
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,180
Cause my friends threatened me.

349
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,410
So Bob put me up and we become a
friends ever since. That's awesome.

350
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,310
I think I follow him on Facebook. We have
a chat from time to time on Facebook,

351
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,120
but yeah, for you UFO motherfuckers
look into northern New Jersey.

352
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,860
That's the fucking mother load
of them. That's interesting.

353
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,410
I had read that before
but I kind of let you go.

354
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:16,300
51 51 UFO sightings in 2018 I as a,

355
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,850
you get biased because the, the,

356
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:23,470
the story is always some person in
the woods and they get abducted.

357
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:26,380
They say UFO and some strange
town in the middle of nowhere.

358
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:30,190
The aliens land of duck people. You
always think about it being a rural thing,

359
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,310
but if I was an alien, of
course I'd go to New York City.

360
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,670
Of course I go to New Jersey.
What the fuck? Why wouldn't you?

361
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,300
You want to go see the craziest
thing we have. You got like

362
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,480
7 million people stuffed together on a
fucking tiny island and in comparison to

363
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:50,140
the rest of the planet, if stuff's
stacked on top of each other, awesome,

364
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:53,080
amazing buildings in all
these lights at times square.

365
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,760
Look at all these people mulling around,

366
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,080
traveling over these bridges to get to
this one hub is one hive of humanity.

367
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,440
Of course, if I was an alien,
I would check that out.

368
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,880
Why would I look at a
barn? You know what I mean?

369
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,930
They used to have a joke that w w
the United States is the Tijuana.

370
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,930
If outer spray by the space like that,
like where are we doing this weekend?

371
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,821
We're going to fucking,

372
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:15,190
they'd come down when they're fucked
up and they want to see a show

373
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,380
that was the whole bed. Is that, I think
aliens come here when they're high.

374
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,080
I did. They just get fucked up.
They're like, come on, let's go.

375
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,340
Let's go check out the monkeys. This
go dude. Come on. What's up? Duck Duck.

376
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:31,630
A couple of them have a good time.
Let's go see those monkey people.

377
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,400
I never saw a fucking UFO or I
want to, I never have though.

378
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,820
I want to see it Atlanta and I want to
see one of those green dudes get out.

379
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,210
Sorry. I thought I saw
some shit when I was a kid,

380
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,620
but as I got older I thought that
was like a fighter jet or something.

381
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,560
That's what that was like.
There was something that of,

382
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,910
it's a real sketchy memory.

383
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:54,190
It's one of those memories
that's like barely active,

384
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,820
but I remember thinking for like a
day or two when I was a little kid.

385
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,020
Maybe I saw UFL, but I think I was trying
to convince myself of it. You know,

386
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:04,810
I was bored, but I think it was a jet.

387
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,420
I think it was something
something fast and unusual.

388
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,890
Have you ever seen one of those stealth
bombers that looks like a fucking UFO?

389
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,520
You're seeing one of those
things in the sky? No. Yes.

390
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,870
It looks like a star wars. When you go
to like a, a blue angel fucking thing.

391
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,790
Those plants know that those are
like, I think those are f a teens.

392
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,060
That's what I think it is. I think that's
what that is. I flew in one of those.

393
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,350
I had a bit about that too. Yeah.
You gotta do you hold onto the hand.

394
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:35,410
You gotta do it. You Hook. Either
you either hold on to your handle.

395
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:39,280
If you're steering the plane or you hold
onto your straps. If you're a pastor.

396
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:41,310
I was a strong, I was in the pastor seats.

397
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,210
I grabbed ahold of my straps and
you have to go like go to school

398
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,500
and you have to force blood
in your brain. Stay awake.

399
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,660
That's how much g force
you're going through.

400
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,690
It's insane for blood and your
brain to stay awake. See that's,

401
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,320
that's one of those stealth bombers. I
saw one of those in the air over. Uh,

402
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,010
I guess it's Edwards Air Force Base. Is
that what the one it is? That's Edwards,

403
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,310
the one that's out near
Palmdale. I think that's it.

404
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,610
Cause we used to film fear factor in
Palmdale and we saw that they fly overhead

405
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,890
like that. Look at that thing.

406
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,740
Tell me that doesn't look
like it's from another planet.

407
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,500
When you're on the ground and you
see that fly overhead, you're like,

408
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:21,170
what the fuck is that?

409
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,040
So I think that's responsible for a
bunch of the things that people saw.

410
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,780
I think it's military craft. Can
I should question that article.

411
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:34,070
You pulled up to 51 sightings. What
type of sightings do you look at?

412
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,310
This fucking thing. What
is consider this side?

413
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,710
Well the thing is like you just
see shit, but how do you know?

414
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,350
What are you doing? You know,
these are the sidings. Okay.

415
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:49,820
But go back to that video, look
at that thing. I mean come on.

416
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,170
If you're just sitting on the ground,

417
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:55,220
you saw that you're like their combat
aliens are coming that does not look like

418
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,950
it's from this world.
That thing is madness,

419
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,700
especially with those two guys next to
him. God, it's fucking beautiful though.

420
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,410
It's like what a amazing design.
That thing flying through.

421
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:08,490
It looks like something
on a keyboard. You know?

422
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,330
It looks like a symbol on a keyboard and
it's just flying perfectly through the

423
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,030
air. That looks like the future.

424
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,660
I mean that really does look
like it's from another world.

425
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,760
I would imagine like little blue dudes
have black eyes talking to each other in

426
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:23,594
that thing, but

427
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,030
going through fucking
wormholes and shit. I mean,

428
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:30,650
that's what that thing
looks like. And what's the,

429
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:32,660
what's the thing that they're going
to have a hundred years from now?

430
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,160
Just imagine that. Just
want to know what the,

431
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,240
what the logistics is for it
to be consumed. Oh, agenda.

432
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,510
Eligible sighting. Legitimate
siding should have been said.

433
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,400
It just means that someone saw it.

434
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,030
You know why you don't like
if you're a lawyer, okay,

435
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:52,460
and you see something and then you
convince yourself that what you saw was

436
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:56,180
something extraordinary and you need to
have the feeling that you're looking at

437
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,350
something from another world.

438
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,860
But if it's just some drone
or some military vehicle
and then you look at it and

439
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:04,190
then you convince yourself,

440
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,170
then it becomes a bigger and
bigger deal in your head.

441
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,730
That's a problem with people.

442
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,160
It doesn't mean that everybody that
sees something and seeing that,

443
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,280
but people are kind of full of
shit. Well, let's say you see,

444
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,170
let's say there's a one 800 call
Martian, right? I see a fucking thing.

445
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,100
I call that one 800 call mark. Call. I'm
washing. Okay. Whatever the fuck. Okay,

446
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,900
1-800-MARTIAN though the phone
won't stop ringing. Okay.

447
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,210
The phone won't stop ringing.
It will never stop ringing.

448
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,860
It'd be people talking to Martians.

449
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,520
My concern is when do they
consider it a credible?

450
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,960
What does it take for it to be
credible? For me for it to be credible,

451
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:42,590
I got to see the motherfucker
land get out. My a,

452
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,810
my take usually military guys. Um, when,

453
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,980
when you have a military fighter
pilots, that's an extraordinary human.

454
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Those that's a, you know,

455
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:55,860
if you can be one of those guys that
flies one of those [inaudible] to,

456
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:59,400
for them to trust you with that
billion dollar fucking spaceship dude,

457
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:01,770
you gotta be, uh, an exceptional human.

458
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,560
There's no room for
someone who's full of Shit.

459
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,320
You're going to be a top
flight fighter pilot.

460
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:11,910
You're going to fly around with gunfights
in the sky because that's what they

461
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:14,040
do. They have gun fights
in the fucking sky.

462
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,130
Those guys are exceptional human beings.

463
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,470
So when they see something,

464
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,730
that's when I listen for sure
everybody else, I'm not that.

465
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,700
Not that I wouldn't listen, but I don't
know. You know, you might be crazy,

466
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,820
but if someone then you might be
crazy. Even if you're in the military,

467
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,530
you might be crazy. If
you're a fighter pilot,

468
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:35,280
it's 100% possible fighter pilots and
all those air force pilots that do test

469
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:38,280
runs or whatever they, they see,
they say that they see things,

470
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,020
there's a bunch of signings. None of them.

471
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,410
They a bunch of sightings is a bunch
of sightings from these really credible

472
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,530
guys. What does it say?
Fleet of UFOs followed us.

473
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:51,300
Aircraft Navy pilot says May 29th call
about these guys that are talking about

474
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,340
these things. These aren't uh,

475
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,310
guys with histories of
embellishing things. There's a,

476
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,350
I mean they have this whatever that is
that radar, what are they looking at?

477
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,040
Is that infrared? Like what, what is the,
that screen that they're looking for?

478
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,160
Does it say what kind of image it
is? Cause it's like a weird look.

479
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:10,170
It's not like a photograph,
right? It's like a weird

480
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,550
computer image because it's, um, it's,

481
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,410
it's detecting it right with
some piece of equipment. Right?

482
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,680
Isn't it like tracking it on
radar or something like that?

483
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,590
I know what you're saying cause I feel
like I've heard that description of it

484
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,430
too. But this, this article just says
it's a video of two aerial encounters,

485
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,120
but that video doesn't look
very clear. Why isn't it clear?

486
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,570
My phone does a better job in that
shit and I'm very good cameras on those

487
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,630
cameras. They have good candidates.
I mean, they don't have good ones,

488
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:43,560
but like in order to catch movement at
that high speed up there, Yada, Yada,

489
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:46,950
all that stuff. Oh, so it would
require some exceptional gear, I think.

490
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:49,350
And it could've also been at night.
I don't know what time of day.

491
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,990
It was so convenient,

492
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,760
so convenient that they never have a clear
picture that drives me fucking crazy.

493
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,710
It drives me fucking crazy because
if it is real, I am. I love,

494
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:06,560
I want it to be real. Honestly. I
really do. But when I look at it like,

495
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,231
Oh God damn.

496
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:09,720
So many people are so crazy and told
me the people were so full of shit.

497
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,530
You personally believe
in soda. Why don't done,

498
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,220
there's other galaxies out
there. There has to be. Well,

499
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:20,560
it definitely the galaxies, other
civilizations, civilizations. Yeah.

500
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,120
Some form somewhere. I live nine
planets. It's gotta be, Dude,

501
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,260
there was a song thing, but
I don't know what I didn't,

502
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,920
I'm not going to sit here and tell
you what that called or whatever,

503
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:31,110
but there has to be
something at this point.

504
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:33,840
You have to believe that
the universe too big.

505
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,290
It's just too big to discount
and say nope or doubt it.

506
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,220
Like that's so crazy to say
this is because we haven't
seen it yet. It's so big.

507
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,350
Okay. It's 40th caught. And
what he said that though,

508
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:51,520
tracking equipment radar and infrared
cameras on his aircraft detected ufs both

509
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:55,510
times. He was unable to capture
them on his helmet camera. Okay,

510
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,980
so maybe you couldn't look at it.
Hmm. Get it in good vision or whatever

511
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,360
or that's a good,

512
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,430
excellent reason why I would imagine as
fast as those goddamn things are going,

513
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,340
it must be really hard to get a candidate
to be able to constantly focus in and

514
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,410
out. And that's interesting.

515
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,150
He says that Luke Tyler and Ryan
Grimes put heaves, graves', whatever,

516
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,470
a squadron of UFO Fall,

517
00:30:18,471 --> 00:30:23,080
his navy strike group up and down the
eastern coast of the U S for months.

518
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,020
That's, I'm telling you
that little fucking,

519
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,940
I read something about the Hudson River
that all those people that live across

520
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,261
the Hudson River,

521
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:36,310
whether on the Weehawken Edgewater
side or the west side of Manhattan,

522
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,760
those are where the people on
their balconies see all that shit.

523
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,480
Look at this shit. We did have issues
with them and we went to the Middle East.

524
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,180
Lieutenant Graves said, Ooh,
imagine them following the war.

525
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,080
Imagine if you were there were aliens
and they came down to follow the war.

526
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:55,270
So they see the war going
on and they were how crazy.

527
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,000
Afghanistan come down and
they're checking it out.

528
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,500
Just to did go on the
cynical side of this,

529
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:03,650
they're not necessarily
saying they are an alien ship,

530
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:06,470
they're saying it's a UFO, so it's
something they're not sure of.

531
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,350
What if it's some sort of awesome drone
that some Middle Eastern company has an

532
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,340
they can just follow shit
or fast or something?

533
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,950
Sure. That would be the more
likely explanation. Right?

534
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:20,220
Terrestrial would be more likely
that someone has advanced shit.

535
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,790
We know they have advanced shit. I mean
we know they have incredible drones.

536
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,500
You know what I mean? The stuff
that they can do, they got a drone

537
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,710
that green berets, the seals,

538
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:36,540
you put razor blades on them and they
slit your fucking throat when you're

539
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:37,950
driving. Whoa.

540
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,590
That's how good the technology
is on those drones. Jesus Christ.

541
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,280
I wouldn't be shocked if they
can do all kinds of things.

542
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:52,281
We can be standing there and they could
take the drone to just come down fucking

543
00:31:52,351 --> 00:31:54,240
they put razor blades
on them or some shit.

544
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,380
Well you could totally see someone
having a small drone, like a small thing,

545
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:02,790
like the size of a cheeseburger that has
poison in it and you just slamming into

546
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,080
somebody. You could see, I
could see that this though,

547
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,610
what you're seeing when you're seeing
stuff that's flying around the sky,

548
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,110
most likely it's made by a person because
people make stuff and people know how

549
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,640
to make stuff that
flies around in the sky.

550
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,580
But then when you get this
shit like defies physics,

551
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:23,910
like some of the things he's
fighter pilots say that's
when you got to go wait a

552
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,743
minute. He,

553
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,780
you see these extraordinary
feats of traversing distances.

554
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:34,530
Like they can get from one
place to another place so fast.

555
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:38,100
It looks like they disappear. This
is something they all talk about.

556
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,660
They all talk about insane speed
at which these things can go.

557
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:43,130
They can just change angles.

558
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:48,131
They can just go and then take a tarred
right angle turn and they can do stuff

559
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:52,790
that nothing that we know how to make
can do. That's where it gets to be like,

560
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:56,810
whoa. Like nothing sounded like it's
like, oh, that's like a fighter jet,

561
00:32:56,811 --> 00:33:01,160
but like really fast. You know what
I'm saying? It's like an alien car. Oh,

562
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:04,820
it's like a car, but it's way faster.
Like you know it's an alien car,

563
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,450
but this is not like anything
that we make these fucking things.

564
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,970
They fly this way. They say flat like a,

565
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,410
like a plate hovering over the
ground or, but when they go to fly,

566
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,460
when they go to take off,

567
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,520
they flip up sideways and they have like
the bottom of the spaceship is pointing

568
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:26,480
towards where it wants to go and it
does something to space and time.

569
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,600
Make some sort of fucking
magnetic gravity connection.

570
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,300
Insert big spooky words,
whatever, then no,

571
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,370
they don't know how the
fuck it does it. Right.

572
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,530
This thing can go like insane distances
and insanely small amounts of time.

573
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,750
Then when they all report the same
kind of behavior of these things,

574
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,230
so many of these reports are like that.

575
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,230
They're talking about this thing that
goes insanely fast turns on its side.

576
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,750
It looked like a tick tack.
It looks like a saucer.

577
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:53,570
It looks like they're trying to figure
out what the fuck the shape is because

578
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:55,040
it's moving so goddamn fast,

579
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,970
but it's doing stuff that nothing we
know how to make and do. I thought,

580
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,550
I don't know if it's from another
planet, it might be from here,

581
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,660
but it's exciting. It's exciting shit.
I want it to be from another planet.

582
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,280
That's what I want. Like unbiased.
Like what my honest, what I would,

583
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,820
I would love it. Just be completely
honest. I would love it if it was aliens,

584
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,440
but it was people. I'd be even
more scared because, hey god damn,

585
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:22,370
people can do that. People
can do that and no one knew.

586
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,170
Like some kid.

587
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,200
If you can imagine a person who can
make a spaceship that defies all of the

588
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:33,710
rules that we know about
travel, about air travel,

589
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,850
they can make something that defies all
that shit and somehow now they're keep

590
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:43,330
the whole development and production of
it a secret and then have this thing and

591
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:45,860
take it off and no one knows
how the fuck they did it.

592
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,500
That's almost more impressive than aliens
because that's what these things are

593
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:58,721
doing is so if these pilots are accurately
reading what's happening and they're

594
00:34:59,001 --> 00:34:59,900
telling the truth,

595
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,340
the thing that's remarkable is
their stories are very consistent.

596
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:09,020
There's a lot of very similar stories
from different people that they're make a

597
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:13,670
living flying super fast warships,
you know, they see things,

598
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,850
they know what the fuck they're looking
at. They see something they don't know.

599
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:20,390
They're like, what in the fuck is that?
When they see something like that,

600
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,360
that freaks me out.
That's when it gets me,

601
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,050
because when some fucking kids riding
his bike to school and he looks up and he

602
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:30,530
sees a UFO, okay, maybe it did
happen. Maybe it did happen.

603
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,280
Maybe the kids being a hundred
percent honest or maybe he was bored.

604
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,010
Maybe he was bored and decided to
make up a store and, and stuck with

605
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,680
it. And then after a while telling
it, maybe he believed in himself.

606
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,470
That happens to people see things,

607
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:45,990
they don't know what they're seeing and
they decide that it's a different thing.

608
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,010
I've said this before, but it's a
true story. When I was in, in Alberta,

609
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,940
there's wolves there and I thought I
saw a wolf for like a whole second.

610
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,450
It was a squirrel fucking squirrel,

611
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,580
but I saw grey for
movement. Wolf Squirrel.

612
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,270
Like if you're dumb or if
you're compromised or if you're,

613
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,430
you get a little drunk, maybe
a little tired, you know,

614
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:15,070
maybe just saw something that looked
really weird because of, you know,

615
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,530
whatever weather conditions that are
affecting some part of the world you live

616
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:23,310
in, there's things called ball. Lightning,
flies through the air, you know,

617
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,290
it's a, it looks like a
UFO. You ever see that shit?

618
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,090
It's like a real natural phenomenon.

619
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,960
Somebody might see something like that
and then add a bunch of other shit to it.

620
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,400
And that's where you get a lot of these
stories yet like natural phenomenon and

621
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,230
then people adding a
bunch of shit to things,

622
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,820
but then on top of that you have credible
stories and you can't throw out any of

623
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:45,990
them like you gotta you. It's
when you look at all these things,

624
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:49,840
you can't decide just cause there's a
bunch of crackpot stories about UFOs that

625
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:53,610
the ones by legitimate fighter
pilots that those aren't real.

626
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,230
Can't look at it that way.

627
00:36:55,231 --> 00:37:00,231
It's crazy to look at it that way because
it's more likely there's something out

628
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:03,930
there. Then there isn't something
out there. It's way more likely.

629
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,620
When I was a kid that happened to
Hudson county park, I wrote it off.

630
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:10,530
I didn't pay attention. I
remember riding my bike up there,

631
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,020
seeing the Fed tape and seeing people
with those, a orange protective suits,

632
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,560
huh? Yeah. I was like, these
people are fucking out of my mind.

633
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:25,070
Then one night I got high five or six
years ago and I saw it if somebody had

634
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,180
posted on Facebook or youtube,

635
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,080
and I read more and more into it and I
discounted it until I read the accounts

636
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:37,920
of the 28 people, you
know, in that building,

637
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,600
the liquor store,

638
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,310
there was a guy who had just got dropped
off a bus from New York because buses

639
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:48,670
drop you off there from New York. The
bus driver said there was a flash.

640
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,663
He couldn't, you know,

641
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,510
there were just so many people
with stories that, you know,

642
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,460
they didn't see a fucking guy get out.

643
00:37:56,461 --> 00:38:00,230
Only three people saw
people get out [inaudible].

644
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:05,280
Everybody else discounted the lights and
the noise and the other bullshit that

645
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:08,760
went with it. I would've shipped my
fucking pants. If I live in that building,

646
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,830
it's all three little Martians get
out or it could just be fucking hold.

647
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,330
Hold on. Who knows who
gives a fuck? Yeah, man.

648
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:19,530
You just want me to tell you that that's
where he can get freaked out and they

649
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:23,910
can, you know, they can think all kinds
of things. That didn't really happen.

650
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,590
They, one night I was on acid,
I thought it wasn't fucking,

651
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,480
I put the FBI was out there with dogs and
I, the next day it was fucking a fire.

652
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,920
All right. I dumped the ounce of
coke down the toilet. Oh my God.

653
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,100
Because I hallucinated

654
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,800
because when you doing the coke
more than fucking 10 hours,

655
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:41,630
you start hallucinating.
I started hallucinating.

656
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,350
It was fucking dogs and
it was a fire hydrant.

657
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,640
You know how stupid I felt the next
day. Pretty fucking stupid. Ugh.

658
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,570
Pretty fucking stupid. I sat
there and I went over and pet it.

659
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,480
Dihydrate you fuck you. Fuck.

660
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,570
This is a problem with any story.

661
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,200
Like all these fucking UFO
stories is people's memory.

662
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,100
Memory's not that good.
It's just not that good.

663
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,390
It's too hard to figure out what it
actually looked like after you saw it.

664
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,340
Like you see something crazy like a year
ago and then you try to describe it.

665
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,270
It's too hard to describe.
Like you barely remember it.

666
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:24,190
You're your version of it is a rehashed
version that you keep repeating to

667
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:25,490
yourself. You know,

668
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,980
if you saw something like say if you're
hiking and you saw a wolf, right?

669
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,600
If you saw that wolf, when you
try to describe that that moment,

670
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:36,580
you saw that Wolff years later, like what?

671
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:39,670
What are you actually seeing
when you go in into your memory?

672
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,860
How much do you help?

673
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,950
Accurate as it were always lying
about how accurate our memory is.

674
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,440
It's not that good. Like if you,
if you did see a wolf, I think,

675
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,480
which is an extraordinary moment,
right? You're in the fucking forest.

676
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,470
It's a fucking wall. It's off, and you
see a real wolf looking down on you,

677
00:39:56,471 --> 00:40:00,730
a wild motherfucker in the woods
of Canada. Just looking at you,

678
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,370
staring at you on a trail.
That's an extraordinary moment.

679
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:07,420
But if you try to recount that
in your mind 10 years later,

680
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,260
what do you actually see?
How much do you actually see?

681
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,700
You see this blurry,

682
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:17,701
weird fucking misty version and you got
some words that fall into place that can

683
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:23,740
describe it, but how accurate is
your fucking memory? It's terrible.

684
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,280
How accurate is your memory?
It's good with statistics.

685
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,040
Like I can tell you about fights. I can,

686
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,200
I can tell you what year someone fought.

687
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:35,170
I can tell you how this guy
won and how he beat, you know,

688
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:37,840
this many guys or the triangle
and I remember things.

689
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,580
But if I actually have to remember that
what it actually looked like in my head,

690
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:45,500
I can't really pull that up. I
barely can pull it up by seeing,

691
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,650
I'll recognize it again. You know,

692
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:52,370
I just show me Joe Schilling knocking
out Melvin Manhoef and Bella Tor aside.

693
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,210
I said, watch that chaos
so many times. The wild,

694
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:59,430
crazy slugfest and if I see it, I'll,

695
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:03,550
I'm watching it happen in a video. I
remember it. Yep. This is how it goes.

696
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:05,770
Here it goes. Boom. He kaos him.

697
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,850
But if I had to just pull that out
of my brain right now, it's not good.

698
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,100
You know what I'm
saying? Like if I had it,

699
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:17,101
like if I have to like close my eyes
and pretend I saw Mike Tyson knockout

700
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,780
Michael Spanx, I kind
of can see blue flashes.

701
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,170
I can kinda remember weird
little parts of it, you know,

702
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:28,300
I remember the final right hand, boom,

703
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,580
we just sends him flying
through the ropes. It was chaos.

704
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,350
It was just like he's the best ever.

705
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,120
But if I had to like
play it back in my head,

706
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:36,980
it wouldn't be nearly as
good as a video of it.

707
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,000
How has the memory in your life,
how have the memories of your life,

708
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:44,640
do you remember being
three, your being five? Like

709
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,830
I was fucking suffering, not suffering,

710
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,470
but I was like trying to think of my dad.

711
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,870
My Dad died when I was three and
I have two memories with him.

712
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,240
I have two memories that
I can look you in the eye.

713
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,930
I don't remember what he was wearing
or what shoes he was worrying,

714
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:07,931
but I still remember driving from the
Lincoln Tunnel from New York to Jersey and

715
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,760
then put me on my lap, no seatbelt,

716
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,120
and me holding onto the
steering wheel while,

717
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,340
and I still remember him and my mom having
a discussion and taking me with him.

718
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,020
That's it. I don't remember
nothing else. Wow. You know,

719
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:27,530
you try to go back on your memory,
then you start to write a little bit,

720
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,790
your memory gets better.

721
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,120
Hello Devon. Even when your memory gets
better. The problem is with my memory,

722
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:38,620
I'm always wondering how much
of this is accurate? You know,

723
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:39,700
how much of what am I mean?

724
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:44,420
How much of it was I really
paying attention during
the moment and really be in

725
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:45,290
a like do it.

726
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,760
Like if you have a bias perspective of
something that's happening and then you

727
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:52,810
have a memory of it. How much does
your memory of the bias perspective,

728
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:57,610
how much does your memory and the
bias perspective shape what you think

729
00:42:57,611 --> 00:42:58,444
happened?

730
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,830
You could actually kind of twist the
past in your head if you're not careful.

731
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:06,220
And you start thinking about things that
didn't really necessarily happen the

732
00:43:06,221 --> 00:43:08,860
way they like. If you got a get
fucked over at work, you know,

733
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,940
I had gum in my fucking pension
all of a sudden, and then you,

734
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,260
you look at it from that way. Wow,

735
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:16,840
this guy worked for an evil
company that fucked him over.

736
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,010
Or you go to the employers and some of
the other people that you work with go,

737
00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:25,090
no, no, no, no, no. That guy was a fucking
asshole. He made life at work. Hell,

738
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:29,080
nobody wanted him around. He didn't
get fucked over. He was so negative.

739
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:32,850
Nobody wanted to be with
him in the office. We had to
get rid of them. Like you,

740
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,350
you'd have to look at it from
their point too. You don't know.

741
00:43:35,351 --> 00:43:39,610
So the actual memory of it for that guy
might be that he got fucked over by this

742
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:40,450
evil company,

743
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,540
but the memory of the other people
is a completely different experience.

744
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:47,350
The memory of the other people is,
this guy was annoying to work with. Oh,

745
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,510
and they're both, you
know, it's both. I mean,

746
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:54,020
who the fuck knows who's who's right,

747
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:59,050
but my memory is good at some
places and completely bad in others.

748
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,670
Like right now, my memory of
30 years ago, just spot on.

749
00:44:03,671 --> 00:44:07,120
I could take conversations we had
last night where we did a year ago.

750
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,510
Like I'll sit here and go, what
did I do last for the July?

751
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,970
I have no fucking idea. But I went
home when I went home for three weeks,

752
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,620
I went to dinner with a friend of mine
and then the way back I had him in tears

753
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,040
telling them about the night
his arm got broken. You know,

754
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,000
he looked me legitimately in
the face and he goes, Joey,

755
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,850
I forgot I broke my arm. It's
amazing. Remember how the,

756
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,040
do you remember

757
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,770
that go? That was just one of
the best nights of my life.

758
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,030
I never laughed so hard. My friend,
he drove his car up. My friend,

759
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,910
you know how people go on a
coming and they drive at? Yes.

760
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:46,230
He didn't stop in time and he tapped
my friend. My friend went down.

761
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,750
It was hilarious as it is. He got up,

762
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,620
he went to take a swing at this guy and
the guy put his arm up and when he hit

763
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,050
it, he broke his arm with the punch,
the punch, and he had to wear a cast.

764
00:44:58,051 --> 00:45:01,760
And we torture them when my friend kept
threatening to sue him and it was just a

765
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,980
he and he, when I was telling
him this, his face was red.

766
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,920
He had to take his napkin down and he
was banging the table. He goes, cokes,

767
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,410
I just remembered the broken fucking arm,

768
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,870
you know, he's my age. He goes, I forgot
all about my fucking arm. You know,

769
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:21,930
before you came in, Jamie and I
were talking about Achilles tendons.

770
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,370
And I remember the time
ripping, pulling a hamstring,

771
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,380
like having to go to the hospital when I
was 15 and having the fucking doctor do

772
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,300
or something and it was bruised.

773
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,680
Blood was running from my
ass to the top of my leg.

774
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:42,000
It was fucking horrible. I just ripped
the hamstring. We were talking about, uh,

775
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,420
uh, you know, like just that
you know, and then this,

776
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:50,500
there's a theory that there's times
like you'll go back to Newark like you,

777
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,310
I don't know if there's a fire.
You're going to Newark that fight. No,

778
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:54,510
I'm not going to, I'm
not working that one.

779
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:58,050
But let's pretend you went back to Newark
and you went to see where your grandpa

780
00:45:58,051 --> 00:46:00,450
lived and you saw a corner
store that was still there.

781
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:05,460
This is interesting and you go into that
corner store and maybe you get a bag of

782
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,720
wise potato chips. Maybe you get
a bun that you went there and got,

783
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:15,110
they say by tasting that button and it
takes you back and opens up all those

784
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:20,190
fucking memories. Why, why
eating something from the
area, something something.

785
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,570
It's like sometimes a song will
trigger something fucking songs.

786
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:27,150
Really true for sure.
That's why it's important.

787
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:31,680
Sometimes when you watch a movie or a
TV shut the habit soundtrack because we

788
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:34,920
have a soundtrack. We all have
a soundtrack of our lives.

789
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,660
I had a couple of years ago,

790
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:40,080
I was on a podcast and we were talking
about something Bon Jovi and you're like,

791
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,640
aw, I remember giving some chicken
stab and listening to [inaudible],

792
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,260
something like that. You know
what I'm saying? Like you'll see,

793
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,490
you won't even say I fucked Mary Lou
Smith in the ass. Listen to the songs.

794
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,980
You know, it just brings you
back. It just brings you back.

795
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,720
But they say that examples
to bring it back. Yeah,

796
00:46:57,721 --> 00:47:02,450
it was me and my best friends were
by the lake. Nope, banging some.

797
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,930
That's what you got, man. Listen,
most guys, most guys will hear a song,

798
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,550
they'll be by themselves, they'll be
by your wife and your kids. You know,

799
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:15,330
you'll hear never say goodbye to Bon
Jovi and you're thinking of night that

800
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:19,230
drunk midget chicken, the decline
in church and you never told nobody.

801
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,460
It just comes back.

802
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,800
It comes back to haunt you for a minute.

803
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,710
You know like shit like that always call.

804
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:33,100
That was the song I sit in some prison
to like whatever. I don't fucking know.

805
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:36,790
Like when I got locked up, the big
album was appetite for destruction.

806
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,150
The Big [inaudible], the
big, when I got locked up,

807
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:42,100
the big albums for the regular people,

808
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:46,510
appetite for destruction for the brothers.
It was don't be cruel by Bobby Brown.

809
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,470
That album, he made solo when
he slipped from new edition.

810
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:55,180
So every time I hear don't be cruel.
The other one, every time I hear it,

811
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,730
especially that fucking Mr Brownstone,

812
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,260
every time I hit Mr Brownstone I want
to crash the car because all the bike is

813
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,570
the shoot heroin to that.
So you know what I'm saying?

814
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:08,050
Like it's time for Mr. Brown style.
That's all they would talk about.

815
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,210
So every time I hear those two albums,

816
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,450
I fucking think about being
locked up and what's on them.

817
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,530
Ever since guns and roses went on tour.
That's all you hear on the radio now.

818
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,710
But the radio on for five minutes
everyday you're in November.

819
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:24,350
Rain walking through the jungle.
Cause that's it. That's it. Right.

820
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:29,830
Every time I hear those jams, I think
about that stupidity. That's fun.

821
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,520
Welcome to the jungle was mine.

822
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:38,200
But there's a lot of people who
will say to you like, Oh, you know,

823
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:41,920
I make love. I used to make love to
my girlfriend, listen to that album,

824
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,450
you know, whatever. But
there's some people animals
and say, you know the truth.

825
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,170
I used to get my dick sided.
Listen for that when I was 14 yeah,

826
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:54,670
music more than anything. It's
like an imprint of the time of the,

827
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,270
of your life when you saw it. Like
if you go back and think about,

828
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:02,710
like for me it was stripes with
Bill Marine, I think I was,

829
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,750
I had to be a teenager. What
year did stripes come out?

830
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,473
What year was that?

831
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,650
81 perfect. So I was 14
years old that that was,

832
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:19,130
I was a in ninth grade, I was
a freshman in high school.

833
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:23,040
So that when I think about
that movie, like that was the,

834
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:27,140
the epic movie of our time when I
was a kid. It was like, that was,

835
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,250
I think about that time of the
year or that time of my life.

836
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:34,910
You think about who you
were, you know what you,

837
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:38,960
it brings you back to a weird place like
it's, it helps. It enhances the memory.

838
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:43,290
Fucking tremendous. That
was a great movie, man. When
he was such a funny movie.

839
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,300
Think about the Lyme.

840
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,620
He asked the fat dude why he joined
the service and the guy goes,

841
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:54,650
I want to lose a couple pounds. Look at
him. Candy was amazing. Amazing in this.

842
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,200
It's a fucking great movie, man.
It was just so good at the time.

843
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,460
You know, it's just, you had a smile
on your face through the whole movie.

844
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,480
Like even the moment moments of the
movie that weren't like hilarious when

845
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:11,710
they're setting things up. You just,
it was so well done. You just smiled.

846
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:15,580
All you guys looking at this cast, you
got the guy from Beverly Hills cop,

847
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,950
you got Zito from Miami Vice.

848
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,540
You got fucking Harold Ramis
who was a blessing in my life.

849
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:25,660
He legitimize me when I did this
movie. The movie was terrible,

850
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,090
but he was phenomenal
comedy wise. That's awesome.

851
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,170
I don't know what this brother
went on to do, but you know,

852
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,800
this is fucking great calm. But look
at Bill Murray. This is dumb now man.

853
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,870
This is the height of Bill Mary.

854
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:43,160
Now you guys gotta remember we were
just talking about another great movie a

855
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,570
couple of minutes ago. Then these both
come out the same year. Did they? Yeah.

856
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:52,010
Any one 80 this is the
shit we were going through.

857
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,010
This is why we talk
about movies and music.

858
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,000
It's not that we're old men
fucking being nostalgic.

859
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,320
I'm telling you the truth. They were
making great movies at this time.

860
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,560
There was a few great movies, a
few. There was a few. Yeah, I mean,

861
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,820
I mean quite a few, I
should say. This planes,

862
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:15,821
trains and on them bills that
come out in 83 82 84 you know,

863
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:21,430
you gotta the comedy lessons we were
getting those years 87 well let's think of

864
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:26,870
this like just cinematically. Look.
What Year did the godfather come out?

865
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,830
73 73 72 exorcist.

866
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:35,720
73 the mechanic 73 it was just too much.

867
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,320
Just those three movies
right there, the Godfather,

868
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,080
the mechanic and the exorcist.

869
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:49,250
And if you look at who was up for an
academy award in 73 you'll fucking die.

870
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,570
You'll die. You'll go out. Fuck fucking,
they pick a winner there. It's also,

871
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,720
imagine the stark contrast between
that in 53 1952 the movies were kind of

872
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:03,410
Corny. You know, even if they were
good, they were kind of corny. You know,

873
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,840
if you go any earlier than that, like
y'all try to watch them. Kong ever watch,

874
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,310
I watched it with my kids and a wife
wasn't home and they were scared.

875
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,420
They were like, I don't want to watch
a scary movie. I'm, I go, we're going,

876
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,240
we're going to, we'll laugh at a silly
scary movie. And they're like, really?

877
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:21,200
I go, you got to trust me.

878
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:25,310
This movie was from so long ago
that what they thought, it's scary.

879
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,610
You're going to think it's silly. And
they're like, are you serious? Cause they,

880
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,160
they go, okay, but if we get too
scared, just shut it off, right. I go,

881
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:33,530
definitely shut it off. They were like,

882
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,730
I think seven and five at
the time fucking movie.

883
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,390
It's so fake looking when the gorilla
comes out, they thought it was hilarious.

884
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,720
And then because we talked about it being
fun and then they were just laughing

885
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:48,140
hysterically and cracking all these
jokes about what that thing luck looked

886
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:48,471
like,

887
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:51,230
that it looked like my youngest daughter
said it looked like someone was moving

888
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:54,170
poop around that it looked like
just like it was made out of poop.

889
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,700
Cause it's all clay. It
looks so dumb. But you know,

890
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:04,550
back then that was as good as it
got. Won't look at the new Godzilla.

891
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,000
The new Godzilla has got off of people
leaving with a fucking headache.

892
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:12,680
Are they yet? Look at the old
Godzilla. It's a comedy. It is.

893
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,730
Oh my God. You see those
poor little Japanese people.
Look at this though. Yeah,

894
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,020
I'll take this looks.

895
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,180
But it just always been huge back
at these guys like, yeah buddy,

896
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:26,130
you're not in a plane. It's

897
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,970
like so fake looking. You know
like these guys flying around

898
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:36,130
and look how bad the gorilla
looks. It's so crazy.

899
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,240
But at the time this was
unbelievable. This was amazing.

900
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:44,320
So if you go from this
to like apocalypse now,

901
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:49,890
the jump in terms of like how impactful
it is and how much they nailed it.

902
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,960
Like this is, it's a fun
movie, man. Don't get me wrong.

903
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:56,020
I have a King Kong poster on my
wall at my house. I love the moon.

904
00:53:56,021 --> 00:53:58,650
I love the smoke. I live movie
poster from the nightclub.

905
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,320
I'd much rather see the old gods

906
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,370
Zos Godzilla vs Mortara [inaudible]
versus the smog in lunch.

907
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,510
The Godzillas are fun just to
see what Japanese people doing.

908
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:15,550
Yeah, they had the string on
them. They would zoom wide shot.

909
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,450
So they would show the Chinese people
running and then they would just have a

910
00:54:19,451 --> 00:54:24,040
single shot and Godzilla moving through
the air. You see, look at the Japanese.

911
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,060
I'm Japanese. Look out dopey
looks like even when it's lit up.

912
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:31,510
That is fucking fun, man. That's
fun. Look, he's gone through.

913
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:34,870
They fucking electric. Godzilla
doesn't give a fuck. They're shooting.

914
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,930
I'm fuck you. Yeah. See No,

915
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:42,100
they can't show you a behind shot of
the Japanese shooting Godzilla cause

916
00:54:42,101 --> 00:54:45,850
there's really no gun. They just shoot
into a wall. It's completely separate.

917
00:54:45,851 --> 00:54:50,410
This is like a, a real claim model. If
you look at it, he's really not 60 feet.

918
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,850
It's maybe fucking eight inches or
something. No, this is not a model.

919
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:59,280
These are men in suits. This is the
difference between King Kong and no shit.

920
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,790
Yes, these are men in suits.

921
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,910
And it was really complicated and these
guys had to be really strong because

922
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,030
they're carrying around this
gigantic rubber suit and it's heavy.

923
00:55:07,031 --> 00:55:08,620
It's fucking hot as fuck.

924
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:13,420
So the reason why it moves so fluid with
the Japanese did that was brilliant,

925
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:17,100
was they had men and they put
men in these monster suits.

926
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,700
The fucking stuff up his
mouth. Yeah, go in a Google.

927
00:55:21,701 --> 00:55:25,060
The men who wore the Godzilla suit,
it's actually a pretty fucking cool.

928
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,380
It's not easy to do.

929
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,790
These guys had a walk around and have
these fight scenes and shit and these big

930
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:34,240
giant suits. There was an
animation. That's a dude in there.

931
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,750
Isn't that crazy? And that's a,

932
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,700
that's what it really looked
like in terms of a height wise.

933
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,420
It was like the size of the person
seat. That guy go back a bit.

934
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:45,730
You see that guy getting
out of it? That right there.

935
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,550
That's what the dude looked
like. He was inside of it.

936
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,000
He was wearing them [inaudible]
it was like a claim model. No,

937
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,040
King Kong is clay model.

938
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,040
King Kong was a claymation
from Ray Harry Usan.

939
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,740
That's how um, I got onto
the subject with them.

940
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,240
I was telling them about um,

941
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,650
they love that monsters inc show and Hara
Hughes in is one of the characters or

942
00:56:08,651 --> 00:56:11,830
something about Harry. He was in
his, in the movie. I said, Huh, I go,

943
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:13,420
do you guys know that is
and they go, no. I said,

944
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:16,720
that is the guy who of course they didn't
know who this fuck am I talking about?

945
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:17,381
I said,

946
00:56:17,381 --> 00:56:22,381
that's the guy who was one of the
original monster animators for,

947
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,820
for movies like King Kong. He did all
that claymation stuff and back then,

948
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:29,080
I mean that was the state of the art.

949
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,920
You got to think 19 fucking 30 something
and I was like King Kong was what,

950
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:37,270
33 yeah, Godzilla. That was later.

951
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:39,080
That was post World War II. Yeah.

952
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:44,290
So you got 54 54 post post
World War Two was Godzilla.

953
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,960
Godzilla was after we,
we, I shouldn't say we,

954
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:51,400
somebody from the United States drop
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki when they

955
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:53,920
use nuclear weapons. The idea was that,

956
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:56,560
and all the nuclear tests that
they had done in the water,

957
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:59,740
there was no real understanding of
what the fuck was going to happen.

958
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:04,150
And so the science fiction version of
that would be that all that radiation

959
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:07,020
would create some super monster.
Okay, brilliant. Yeah, the man,

960
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,740
the Japanese give it to them.

961
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,520
They were dealing with radiation
poisoning and death on unbelievable,

962
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,720
on an unbelievable scale.

963
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:17,950
I mean hundreds of thousands of people
wiped out instantly from atomic bombs.

964
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:23,080
I mean, and so the, just the sheer
force of the power of those things,

965
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:28,390
you couldn't even imagine that there
could be anything that could do that.

966
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,120
It's one thing that falls out of
an airplane that can do that. Well,

967
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:34,810
what else can it do? You know what,
what happens if it gets in the water?

968
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:38,050
What does, how does this chicken
affect fish? How's it going to affect,

969
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,770
you know, who knows? So the, the science
fiction version was always awesome.

970
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:46,480
It would be like a Godzilla would come.
That's what the new ones about to write.

971
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:50,770
The new one is the same kind of thing.
Like a dinosaur got zapped and now the,

972
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,070
I believe the new one was all the other
dinosaurs came back and they had to

973
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:56,830
reawaken God until it, uh, cause he
was the only thing that can fight him.

974
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,930
Oh God. Oh God. So it's a
superhero monster movie.

975
00:58:01,931 --> 00:58:05,800
He's a superhero superhero then bring
him back. He's a good guy. And this one,

976
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,360
oh no, he's not a good guy.

977
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,580
At the end of the last and everyone
complaining cause there's like this weird

978
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:12,910
winky scene where like Godzilla and the
main guy like looked at each other in

979
00:58:12,911 --> 00:58:16,480
the eye or like same team grow,
you know, the real Godzillas man.

980
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,010
The Real Godzilla is services are not
Searcy. That what the fuck's her name?

981
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:25,150
The Dragon Mother of dragons,
dragon in the game of Thrones.

982
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:29,230
That fucked up that city at the end.
Like that's, that's what a like a real,

983
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,670
that's a real horrific idea
of a fire-breathing lizard.

984
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:39,280
Godzilla was always adorable. Didn't
really go after people. Even the early,

985
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:44,080
even the early Superman's the first like
six episodes. You could see the strain.

986
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,510
Really check it out. That's liberal.
Black and white. This is violet.

987
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,130
Maybe the pilot my first three episodes.
So they figured out how he could do it.

988
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,930
You could see us train. It's a weird,

989
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:01,940
the Godzilla story is a weird story,
right? Cause it's not like God's will,

990
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,100
it goes on a killing spree.

991
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,280
It just goes through Tokyo and just
starts lighting every building on fire.

992
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,360
He doesn't do that. He's like, almost
like he has almost like a good guy lizard.

993
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:16,000
And in the new movie it's more accentuated
then. So he has to help help us.

994
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,770
And Mold cloud was the fucking bird.
Martha was a moth. Multiple moth.

995
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:26,750
Yeah. And what was the smog
monster like? I wrote Dan, I wrote,

996
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,590
Dan wrote, Dan was, that was
awesome. Dan looked like,

997
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:33,650
I'm trying to remember like wings and
Shit, right? Didn't Rodin have wings.

998
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:41,830
You gotta get out of watch.
At least got to get still.

999
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:46,130
Dad looks like this is crazy.
This shit. Oh, that's right. Look,

1000
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:50,910
Rodin could fly. Look at that one.
The Blue Sky below on three. Oh,

1001
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,470
this is a three headed one. Yeah,
but this is new monsters, right?

1002
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,240
These are the new ones. What the
fuck out of here with this new shit?

1003
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,450
Give me the blue sky right there
with that. Yeah. Right there.

1004
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,150
That's kind of TV show wish

1005
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,570
was the smuggling loves to had laser
beams coming out of his fucking eyes like

1006
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:16,980
Medusa. Yes, he did. Yes he did.
One of them had fucking laser beam.

1007
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,950
Did he really? I was like, oh
my God. The three headed things.

1008
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,710
What was that called again? I forgot
about that three minute thing.

1009
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,470
Get door. I don't want to
say that. Oh, Guidara Rodin.

1010
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,920
It was Gita rough. Yeah.

1011
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,710
Just pull up a video of
a Godzilla vs Guidara

1012
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,000
it was so silly, but man, when we
were a little kids in this shit

1013
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:48,300
Saturday morning. Yeah. Lose your
mind. I used to love dishes the best.

1014
01:00:48,301 --> 01:00:50,170
When you found out Godzilla
was going to be on TV,

1015
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,400
you were so pumped from
the actual new movie. Oh,

1016
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:56,730
there's a new movie with Kitura once
out. Not this movies out right now.

1017
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:59,160
It is God's looking at the
monsters. Yeah, that's fine.

1018
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:02,220
Brought all three of these
are, let me see these bitches.

1019
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,890
Whoa. Special Effects Today. Oh God.

1020
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:13,020
Holy Shit. This is amazing. Oh my God,

1021
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:19,130
Dude. The special effects
they can do today are insane.

1022
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,860
So we're looking at, it says king g,

1023
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:26,810
H I d o r a h king. Guidara. Oh my God.

1024
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,890
To ood. The fucking
special effects are insane.

1025
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:38,110
There's Mothra. Wow.

1026
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:42,530
Is this supposed to be a good movie
though? The things with these movies is,

1027
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,220
and I really hate to say this,
how come they can't do both?

1028
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,820
How come they can't have an amazing,

1029
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,190
amazing special 40% on rotten tomatoes?

1030
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:57,110
How can they can't have amazing special
effects and a fucking killer story. No,

1031
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:02,150
I can't. They do that. That's one of the
last of the great 1009 is 10 years ago.

1032
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,860
Yeah. Which one was that one? Avatar.

1033
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:09,100
Avatar was a great story with great
special effects like it was at the end of

1034
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:15,410
it. People are Gootz Pocahontas
in space. Get over it. Okay. Yeah,

1035
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:20,010
it is. It's a classic story. Like James
Campbell always talks about classic

1036
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,000
structure of these heroes journeys.
There's a lot of that in there.

1037
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,420
It's very similar to a lot of
the stories. It's still great.

1038
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:29,460
Don't let that get in the way
of the fact that it's great.

1039
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,560
That movie was fucking awesome.

1040
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:36,860
That movie was awesome just to special
effects and the way it all went together

1041
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:41,430
and yeah, that fucking the bad
military guy was cartoonish. Yeah,

1042
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,480
of course he was. So what, why let
that get in the way with your fun?

1043
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,980
Think of it as like when a movie
like that I think of it is like,

1044
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:54,840
it's like a lot of the hyper
violent Tarantino movies.

1045
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:58,350
Like you know what you're signing up
for, you know, you know what it is.

1046
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:04,040
It's not supposed to be some detailed
analysis of the human psyche.

1047
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:10,340
You know where a guy takes his strange
slow transformation over the course of

1048
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:13,710
two hours? No, it's a fucking bad guy.
This is the bad guy. Here's a good guy.

1049
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,180
Good guy. Can't use his legs.

1050
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,220
Wouldn't it be awesome if you
could be one of those blue things?

1051
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:21,750
Papao I live in a solid fucking
fucking movies. Great. I never saw it.

1052
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:26,010
I remember one of the saying that
they put too much money into it to my,

1053
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:31,160
but you make a movie. If I give
you $600 million, it's not anybody.

1054
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,430
Any of you can make a movie. If I
give you 600 Mil. Joey's James Canton.

1055
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:40,060
James Camera's a monster. I love James
Snakes. So many amazing movies, mates,

1056
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:43,620
great movies. It's like building an ego.

1057
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:48,180
It was like fucking building a
team to put a movie together,

1058
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,450
which I understand, but 600 million,

1059
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,720
you know Casca nominated, but
I love him. They shunned them.

1060
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:58,070
They shunned them that,
Oh, Shanda at the Oscars.

1061
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,270
He walked in and he thought
he was bad to the bone.

1062
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:05,690
He was sitting there with his little new
girlfriend and his ex wife directed her

1063
01:04:05,911 --> 01:04:10,410
locker. Whoa. So they both
got the same thing. Oh.

1064
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,830
And he's sitting there looking at
Spielberg like winking at him and went,

1065
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,220
got all the other white people like what's
happening and all of a sudden they go

1066
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:22,221
to announce the winner of the best movie
and they showed up with Robert Craig

1067
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,220
Fan. Oh, once you pay her feed, you know.

1068
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:29,670
And her number is just to walk out of
the house. What's the number? Big. Big,

1069
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,900
big [inaudible] when
she does the theaters,

1070
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:37,980
like tickets are more expensive
than the fucking Laker ticket.

1071
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,080
When she did the staple center,

1072
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:45,470
cheapest ticket to rebills by the
refrigerator thousand to just sit on the

1073
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:49,030
floor. Barbara Streisand don't
fuck around somewhere. They call.

1074
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,810
It's cause she's lightened
somebody's asshole lot.

1075
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:57,240
Even James Cameron knew what he saw.
He put his head up, look at the tape,

1076
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,120
he knew what he was done and
she came out and gave it to him.

1077
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:03,120
He lost that to his
wife. Hurt locker though,

1078
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:09,050
was that was a like a culturally
significant movie at the time of a war.

1079
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,160
That was super well done. There was no
bullshit in that movie like that was a,

1080
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:17,890
that is a good fucking movie. Her locker
is one. Those moves at the end of it.

1081
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:19,880
You go, Jesus speak of a hurt locker.

1082
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:22,300
Did you see what happened in New
Jersey yesterday? What happened?

1083
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:27,580
Ice went to New Jersey to go into some
Jewish place and Jews got together and

1084
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:29,860
held hands and 36 of them got arrested.

1085
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:34,410
I've always said those Jersey Jews
don't fuck around thug, those Jews,

1086
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:36,350
all of them calling New York, Brooklyn.

1087
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,420
They held hands and went up against
eyes. Good for that little young kids.

1088
01:05:40,421 --> 01:05:43,410
They don't fuck around those jurors. I
was telling Lee last night, the lady,

1089
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:47,920
you know, they sell more like braces in
Jersey and they do it across the country

1090
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:52,450
because there's a lot of Jews in
Jersey. It just wear neck braces.

1091
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:57,340
Did you know that? Why?
Because then they're on the
lawsuit. Oh, well I grew up,

1092
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,600
I grew up here and all this.

1093
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:02,920
Every time I go to the Meadowlands that
be eight guys with neck braces on at the

1094
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:05,530
metal lands and I asked
around and what goes on you,

1095
01:06:05,531 --> 01:06:09,250
you don't know what that is down
the, they have somebody on the paper,

1096
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,430
like they have a court case
going, oh that's so fun.

1097
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:14,350
So they got to wear fucking neck braces.

1098
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:17,860
So they call them the Jewish gold
chains. You didn't know that.

1099
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,950
They call a Jewish gold chain.

1100
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:28,210
When you go get a fucking neck brace,
you got the back order them in Jersey.

1101
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:32,020
Like they fucking Jewish folks are
interesting in that it's a religion and a

1102
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:36,940
race. It's a religion and a both
kind of cause. A lot like Jewish,

1103
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:40,300
ours, Jewish. But ours is not
religious anymore at all. No.

1104
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:43,640
He went over and did the whole fucking
buddies. Jewish. He's Jewish. Yeah,

1105
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:47,440
it's a different animal. There's a lot
of Jewish atheist, you know like how,

1106
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:51,820
how the fuck, how can you do that?
How does that work? They just do it.

1107
01:06:51,821 --> 01:06:56,440
They identify with that tribe. They'll,
it's part of a tribe. It's like a tribe,

1108
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:02,250
right? Like a tribe and a religion.
And a race. It's like three things dog.

1109
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:05,260
When I was a kid, I knew what
Jersey Jew in attorney's name was.

1110
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,290
Coach this motherfucker, the smile. Wow.

1111
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:11,320
People going to them because
they call them guaranteed 30.

1112
01:07:11,321 --> 01:07:13,250
If I can get you 30,000 for anything,

1113
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,190
like people would cut that
thumb and just go down there,

1114
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:19,330
get already Jersey 30 gs and
then you take an advance from,

1115
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,960
you get hurt and you're taking an
advanced coach. Let me get 10 g's.

1116
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,430
When we been Brooklyn last time
when we were going to um, uh,

1117
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:32,460
Peter Luger's and so we drove through
these Hasidic neighborhoods and these were

1118
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:38,470
the ones like Ra, there's orthodox Jews,
there's a big comedian, Orthodox kids,

1119
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:41,440
but in, in New New York
and Brooklyn particularly,

1120
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,590
and the Ra was explaining how
they don't leave this community.

1121
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:47,350
This is where they stay.
These are all their people.

1122
01:07:47,351 --> 01:07:49,600
They don't give a fuck about what's
happening in the outside world. I'm like,

1123
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:51,350
wow. They just,

1124
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:56,080
you just see this interesting subculture
that it's one of the more cool things

1125
01:07:56,081 --> 01:08:00,130
about New York as he get to be in that
car. That's how it like a genuine man.

1126
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,380
Even though they're isolated,
they have their own neighborhood.

1127
01:08:02,381 --> 01:08:06,340
It's a genuine melting pot in that
regard. Like you could go to a Chinatown,

1128
01:08:06,341 --> 01:08:09,190
like a real Chinatown. You've
got to Chinatown New York City.

1129
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,750
That's a different animal man.

1130
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:14,480
I mean do you might as well be in some
part of Asia fucking blow hot matrix in

1131
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:17,960
this. It's what? What's the name
of it? Whoa hop. Where's that?

1132
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,750
It's in Mont Street
and it's open 24 hours.

1133
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:26,090
[inaudible] real 24 Jason, New York.
Just put the fucking menu up per Mohab.

1134
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,900
When I was in New York shooting that
movie, the one that I was starving,

1135
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:33,350
I got stoned and at one
30 I go, I can't do it.

1136
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,200
I called wall up. I go, what time
do you open though? They go home,

1137
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,920
we will open. I hung up
the phone. I went on Uber,

1138
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:44,600
it was a $10 cab ride and I go, I'm going
to go to wall hub and I chickened out.

1139
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:48,890
Joe Rogan haunted attack. He goes
to low hop at two in the morning.

1140
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:52,510
You're getting a heart attack. All that
sodium fucking killed me and doing them.

1141
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,430
I'll be up to fucking,
I'll be up for two days.

1142
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:59,060
We often went to Chinatown after playing
pool cause it was like the best thing

1143
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:02,630
you know back in my early standup
days when I didn't have obligations,

1144
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,840
we'd stay up playing pool until two three
in the morning and go and you have a

1145
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:10,060
real meal, like a really good meal.
I think I'd have odd attack that.

1146
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:10,940
Yeah.

1147
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:15,940
They get us meal at night with egg rolls
and steak on a stick and fucking just a

1148
01:09:18,141 --> 01:09:20,570
pork fried rice along.
Set you off. What's there?

1149
01:09:20,571 --> 01:09:25,430
Even diet coke back then when
did diet coke get invented now?

1150
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:29,660
There's always been, we always had,
yeah, we always had foster kids.

1151
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:33,090
My mother had a Trashcan Tab.
I drank tad. My mother had tab.

1152
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:35,130
People got Super Sad on taboo in a way.

1153
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,510
I remember like a people would
be all bummed out like wow,

1154
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:43,640
can I ain't love tat battalion girl's
drink tab. That was a grocery. Yeah, tab.

1155
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:46,250
FRESCA FRESCA was more of a girls drink,

1156
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,890
but Todd was a girl's drink
because he had a pink can, wasn't,

1157
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,650
didn't tab of like a pink gas. Yes.
1982, that's when tab went away.

1158
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,930
Coke. Oh Wow. I thought it was
older than that. Hm. Me Too.

1159
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:03,620
Yeah. I still remember in 85
when they changed the recipe,

1160
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:08,390
that was 85 and motherfuckers
went nuts. Crazy. And they really,

1161
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:11,960
they went crazy. New Coke
like what? You're on coke.

1162
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,530
Why would you fuck with the taste
of the best soda of all time?

1163
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,110
Coca-Cola was the best
tasting soda of all time.

1164
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,020
And this other stuff that's really
good. Like root beer is really good.

1165
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,913
It's interesting,

1166
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:26,330
but there's a reason why that shit sold
a billion fucking trillion gallons over

1167
01:10:26,331 --> 01:10:27,164
the past.

1168
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:32,200
So tap had Sacramento and led to
bladder cancer and found that out.

1169
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:36,230
And then the popularity declined.
Exactly. One Diet coke came out 1982. Oh,

1170
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:40,790
they got set up. Put on
your pink or your uh, yeah.

1171
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:44,540
Your pink tinfoil. Um, let me see a
picture of it with a tab can look like,

1172
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:48,890
was it pink? I'm trying to remember
it. See Again, memories. Okay.

1173
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,900
Like I was talking about, I know
that registers with me. Okay.

1174
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,930
I know that that makes sense.
Yeah. That's what tab looked like.

1175
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:57,764
That makes sense.

1176
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:02,120
But that looks like going to call
the company also so I think Coca-Cola

1177
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,470
discontinued tab put more
fucking cancer in it.

1178
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,070
Sold in this diet coke. What
I was going to say is I can't,

1179
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:14,370
I could never draw that. Like if you asked
me to draw what a tab can looks like,

1180
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:16,930
okay look I wouldn't be able to do it.

1181
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,880
Who was in that realm of that
red but it wasn't Coca Cola red.

1182
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:25,710
That's what I'm talking about with memory.
You know memories is a weird thing.

1183
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:30,060
It's very weird because my memory
with numbers is pretty good.

1184
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,720
I remember a lot of important dates
and times and things and statistics.

1185
01:11:36,271 --> 01:11:41,271
I can remember a lot of statistics and
I remember a lot of fights pretty pretty

1186
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:46,140
much tell you what the outcome was, but
how much do I remember of seeing it?

1187
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,700
How much can I pull up and watch
again? How accurate is that?

1188
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:51,540
I don't know.

1189
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:55,170
Like I was more of a sporting guy when I
was growing up and yesterday I was on a

1190
01:11:55,171 --> 01:12:00,171
plane and they had the direct TV on there
and they was showing the best time I

1191
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:05,060
was looking at the iPad. Anyway, I
was watching something on the iPad,

1192
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:09,660
but the screen was on and it was showing
the best 10 football players and they

1193
01:12:09,661 --> 01:12:14,661
showed a Joe Montana claw to Dwight Clark
in 81 and away my memories like wait a

1194
01:12:15,571 --> 01:12:17,190
second, I want 800 on that game.

1195
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:21,360
Cause I had the ova and I had San
Francisco getting the point man,

1196
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:25,440
fucking Dallas and into San Francisco.
Give it a point in those days, Jeez,

1197
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:28,620
my clock that slowly
Joey was throwing him.

1198
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:34,170
That's what snowy Joey was up this
coat throwing the fucking touchdowns up

1199
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:38,010
there. Joe Montana, I have all
like high school. Who fucked?

1200
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,480
Look at Jesus Christ.

1201
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:43,230
Although there was a cat's at
some giant made with one hand.

1202
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:47,940
I Dunno what the fuck. Oh my God,
they showed the best 10 catches.

1203
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,460
I was sitting there and I
just was looking at them,

1204
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:53,040
but the actual just one
catch. I don't know what the,

1205
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:57,240
I think this is the kid they traded.
He just reaches up the defendant.

1206
01:12:57,241 --> 01:13:01,190
He fucking pulls it in. All My, I don't
know if it's old delt back on him.

1207
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,800
I thought it was all go back. It's
like a special is doing those catches.

1208
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,800
Did you see Francis and got him
knockout junior dos Santos? Yeah.

1209
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:11,430
I didn't even think it was a real
knockout. He just blushed him. Look up.

1210
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:14,880
He hit him and he went down and helped
his head. Let them fight it out with,

1211
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,220
listen, that fight was over.
You got to listen to me.

1212
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:19,800
That fight was over cause he
hit them now. It doesn't matter.

1213
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:22,710
The scary thing is he just clipped
him. He clipped him, he clipped him,

1214
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,300
rocked him, put him down,

1215
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:27,840
pounded on his head and jr
just couldn't even move.

1216
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:29,910
He just laid there and take
it and they stopped it quick.

1217
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:33,120
That was a hundred percent legitimate
hundred percent legitimate.

1218
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,390
Between you and I that this
would go a little long.

1219
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:38,250
I thought that he was a seasoned veteran.

1220
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,060
I thought that he would go at least
take it into the third round and try to

1221
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,210
nullify his power by the third round.

1222
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:47,160
You can't keep throwing
those fucking ain't makers.

1223
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,710
I told he was with the wrestling a little
bit. It was not what I anticipated.

1224
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,020
It was not the game plan.

1225
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,280
I thought I got off stage and
it was starting because I got,

1226
01:13:55,790 --> 01:14:00,360
as I walked into the green room fucking
they were gone and I was so fucking

1227
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:02,820
happy. I'm like, let me
watch this. I go here.

1228
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:07,140
I think Judy has a shot at him fucking
as I thought that he was already on the

1229
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:08,560
floor holding his fucking boy.

1230
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,100
Junior had a good start
where was kicking the leg,

1231
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:15,730
especially the lower part of the leg.
You could really fuck someone up,

1232
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,140
knocked him off balance and
that can really fuck you up man.

1233
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:24,250
Like really mess up your movement.
And, uh, if that was the case,

1234
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,250
if we was able to mess up his moving
and get them to miss a little bit,

1235
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:27,641
you know,

1236
01:14:27,641 --> 01:14:31,330
make get him so that he was having a hard
time moving correctly and keep chewing

1237
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:34,720
on that leg, then maybe there
would be openings for him to,

1238
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:39,640
to jump in with some punches. The problem
is when their balls on the outside,

1239
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,140
Frances is bigger and the
consequences are way more grave.

1240
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:48,010
If Francis clips you, it's
99. I don't care who you are.

1241
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,080
He's so confident in it too.

1242
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:53,470
He moves forward and he's going
to throw everything full speed.

1243
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:58,680
The first round with him is extremely
dangerous because he's just trying to take

1244
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:01,660
you the fuck out. It takes
a guy like Steve Bay.

1245
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:06,690
Steve [inaudible] saw what he was doing
and what he did was just ride with it.

1246
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,580
Just moved away from it,

1247
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,900
kept his hands up when
Francis was coming after me.

1248
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:17,080
Use good defense and he kept moving
and kept pitch picking away at him,

1249
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,970
picking away at him, picking away at him,

1250
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:22,630
taking his shots when they were there
and then started wearing Frances down,

1251
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:25,930
taking him down, beating him up, and
then just dominated him. Clear cut,

1252
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,050
unanimous decision for five
rounds. It takes a guy like that,

1253
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:33,160
a guy like Steve a that has the mental
fortitude to stick to a game plan,

1254
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:37,780
not panic in the firefight cause that's
what happens with in Ghana. You're like,

1255
01:15:37,781 --> 01:15:41,080
Jesus Christ, I'm going
to see lights any second.

1256
01:15:41,081 --> 01:15:44,710
Now I'm going to see a big flash and
I'm going to be out cold any second.

1257
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,680
Now it's calming and you see
the reaction they have to them.

1258
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,570
It's they fight different.

1259
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,160
They fight different with him than
they do with anybody else because the

1260
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,760
consequences are so great.

1261
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:56,830
If you watch the way he
knocked out Allister over him,

1262
01:15:57,130 --> 01:16:01,660
the consequences are so grave, so
everyone's scared. No matter it's normal.

1263
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,980
Everyone's scared to fight, you know,

1264
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:06,970
there's at least there's going to be
some anxiety or fear or you're going to,

1265
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,400
your heart rate's going to get checked,
your adrenaline's going to be pumping,

1266
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:13,420
but it's even more so if the
consequences are more grave, right?

1267
01:16:13,421 --> 01:16:16,360
Like if you're going to fucking
take a skateboard down a small hill,

1268
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,040
you're not freaking out, right?

1269
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,630
But if you take it a skateboard
down like four Mile Canyon,

1270
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,900
what does that four mile in boulder,

1271
01:16:22,901 --> 01:16:27,070
what does that w one of those crazy
roads that goes sunshine canyon, right?

1272
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:29,920
If you're taking a skateboard
down that go on 50 miles an hour,

1273
01:16:29,921 --> 01:16:33,340
you're going to shit your fucking pants.
You're going to try to land this thing,

1274
01:16:33,341 --> 01:16:33,890
right?

1275
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,820
Try to figure out how not to die here
because the consequences are so much

1276
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:40,450
graver you're going to be more jacked.
And that's what happens to these guys.

1277
01:16:40,451 --> 01:16:44,470
And they fight Frances. The consequences
are so grave. They make mistakes.

1278
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:48,550
And then with junior, he reached for
uh, an overhand right. He just really,

1279
01:16:48,551 --> 01:16:52,050
really extended himself. You can't do
that with Francis. You just go there.

1280
01:16:52,051 --> 01:16:54,290
The scary thing is true with cro courses.

1281
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:57,520
Everybody has a game plan and they get
punched in the face. That's my Tyson,

1282
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:01,060
Mike Tyson offense.
It's some guy all that.

1283
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:04,840
Once you get that first part,
the fight, I only saw two fights.

1284
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:09,470
The funniest one was the first one
against the kid from Dallas. Props to him.

1285
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:10,130
He went

1286
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,230
up against like a lieutenant, the KKK.

1287
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:17,000
The guy drew blue on his face at the
way in and they almost got into a little

1288
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:21,320
scuffle in the way and then he
had no fucking love in his face.

1289
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:22,101
He didn't smile.

1290
01:17:22,101 --> 01:17:26,810
One time he was definitely a member of
the KKK and there's a little black dude

1291
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:30,800
from Dallas came in and he threw the
spinning back kick and that dude,

1292
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:34,490
it was all over. He hit first
fight on the column, the main card,

1293
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,950
which fucking defeated from, he's not
from the miss this plan. This series.

1294
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,320
Yeah. I didn't see that fight. First
fight on the card. He's eight. No,

1295
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:45,800
now out of Dallas. Strong guy.
Really good. He still has to,

1296
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,460
he's just got to grow a little bit. He's
going to get knocked out once before.

1297
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:52,580
He really makes that big
jump, but once he gets it,

1298
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,750
the guy kept doing spinning back
kicks on him and the second one,

1299
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,930
he was writing his back. This
guy just hates black people.

1300
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:03,110
Who's the guy that's right. No,
that's Paul Craig. Yeah. Yeah.

1301
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:06,860
That guy that Paul Craig is great now.
He's probably great. It's a fucking joke.

1302
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,850
Joke roll. But then he went in
with a tough phase, you know,

1303
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:15,770
like fucking the guy from a, he went
in there like fucking Wa Braveheart.

1304
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:19,100
He's a tough guy called Craig. He's a
good boy. You see the fucking fight.

1305
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,260
I'll see it. No, he was great. He just,

1306
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:25,820
the guy waited for the second one and
when the foot land that he was right

1307
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:28,550
behind them, not be new,
new time. Click oof.

1308
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,880
I turned around and he hit him
with a fucking dropping right hand.

1309
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:35,580
You could see his feet just go like,
you know when you come at your feet,

1310
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:39,890
just pointing. Same thing. It looked like
he came. He just went, Jamie's got it.

1311
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:44,690
Oh Geez. Jesus. It was [inaudible].
Well that's the first one.

1312
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,250
So he said right away he timed it,

1313
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:51,020
but the doc bopping got bought
by. That's it. Look at a man.

1314
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,880
The last, the last one he did while the
guy would amend this, look it up for,

1315
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:59,660
he was saying boom, boom.
There you go. Boom, boom.

1316
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:04,690
There you go. He's probably right now
reading fucking Malcolm x's biography.

1317
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:07,790
Freezers. Yeah, that was ferocious.

1318
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,920
I'm glad people wonder why
people want to spend that much.

1319
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:17,030
You know those like that. I hate
all that shit. Spinning punches.

1320
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:20,450
Why are you giving your back to
a killer? I never understood it.

1321
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:23,750
Well that's not what I'm saying. I'm
saying if you're not that good at it,

1322
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:27,920
he doesn't have like a really fast,
we didn't commit to it. Barboza okay.

1323
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:32,120
Edson Barboza wheel kicks people and
puts them on Pluto. He spin back,

1324
01:19:32,121 --> 01:19:35,390
kicks you to the body. He
mean he's a, his kicks,

1325
01:19:35,391 --> 01:19:39,020
his spinning kicks are fucking insane.
But these guys are not that good.

1326
01:19:39,021 --> 01:19:41,630
Like what I'm saying is like Paul
Craig, that's not his specialty.

1327
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:45,560
He's more of a grappler. I mean he can
strike, obviously he's a good striker,

1328
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:48,290
but I wouldn't think that he
would want to throw a spin kicks.

1329
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:51,620
He's not like a taekwondo guy. I don't
if you don't do taekwondo for 10 years,

1330
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:56,390
why you spending kicking in the UFC
against? I laugh. Full Attic Guy,

1331
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,560
you know all those things.

1332
01:19:57,561 --> 01:20:00,980
I hate when they even that reverse punch
when the guy keeps doing it and doing

1333
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:03,740
it. I'm like, you know what, Yo
come bust him in the fucking ear.

1334
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:06,170
See when you're talking about
like Edson Barboza though,

1335
01:20:06,171 --> 01:20:10,500
like [inaudible] on the Dan Hangman
kept fucking kicking his body though.

1336
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:11,280
Spinning back. Kick.

1337
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:15,180
Just fucking in gotta commit to that
spitting back and getting my commitment.

1338
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:20,250
Oh, I'm Max Holloway spilling a little
fucking cow bottle and then they got the

1339
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:22,410
guitar played. Did it?
Yeah. What's his name?

1340
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:26,640
John did so did Max Holloway invented it.

1341
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,410
I don't know how I just saw it on. Is
he the first person I saw it? Yeah.

1342
01:20:30,411 --> 01:20:33,960
Like that's amazing. That's amazing.

1343
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:39,750
Max Holloway's. He's such a fucking
cool guy. I love that guy. One place.

1344
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,330
He's a champion. He'll
go, he'll come back like,

1345
01:20:42,331 --> 01:20:43,980
who the fuck comes as better than him?

1346
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:49,340
The way he draws to Dustin Poirier
excuses all above all happiness.

1347
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:52,700
He's amazing with Jason Stadium.
What's he doing? What's going on? No,

1348
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:55,590
let me see it. Oh, he's a real
karate guy. Jason. Stay them.

1349
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:58,820
Has real striking skills.
Like, well look, look,

1350
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,730
you can tell even the way he's standing
here, like the way he's moving. No, no,

1351
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:06,680
no. He's going to spin it. But you
see, even the way he's doing it,

1352
01:21:06,681 --> 01:21:08,870
like this guy's got real
skill. Look at that.

1353
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:12,213
Okay.

1354
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,020
Kapow he um,

1355
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,940
he achieved a very high
level of a skill in karate.

1356
01:21:20,941 --> 01:21:24,080
I don't know exactly what it
was, but from people that, um,

1357
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,960
I know that have done martial arts
with him and trained with him and said,

1358
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:31,350
that guy's a bad motherfucker.
Like a legit bad-ass,

1359
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:36,510
like really knows martial
arts. I believe it. Right?

1360
01:21:36,511 --> 01:21:41,130
You see him like, I believe it. Seaman,
like snatch one of those movies. Like,

1361
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:46,010
yeah, he fucked people up.
Hey, did the mechanic, oh,

1362
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,740
I know. Bothers you. But Hey, it's a good,

1363
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:50,480
I don't want to look at your
fucking face and it tastes good.

1364
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:56,220
It's hard to shame them, but you
really should just say to them, hey,

1365
01:21:56,490 --> 01:22:00,390
let's not do that. Let's just write a
movie that's similar and homage to it.

1366
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,830
I know they didn't even do it on March.
That's what really pissed me off.

1367
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:06,630
There was no respect at any
level for Charles Brunch.

1368
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:10,470
Not even a fucking out.
Why? Why did he say that?

1369
01:22:10,471 --> 01:22:14,220
What do you mean if the, if you watch
the mechanic and study the mechanic,

1370
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:18,030
it just wasn't a white guy shooting
people. He was very calculated.

1371
01:22:18,031 --> 01:22:20,070
There was no very calculated.

1372
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:25,230
Everything was made to look like it
was an accident. A very much accent.

1373
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,700
One of the best beginnings in it.

1374
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:31,830
The only movie that starts better than
the mechanic, it's scarf. Like no,

1375
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,900
there's something that has
a better opening. I forget.

1376
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:37,680
There's no fucking dialogue
for 11 minutes, 12 minutes.

1377
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:43,370
It's him setting up a guy to make it
look like the fucking heater blew up.

1378
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:46,110
Like those type of guys.

1379
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:49,560
Like I had a friend that he used to say
is the best way to kill somebody who's

1380
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:53,040
breaking their house.
Take the fucking pipe,

1381
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,690
the gas thing out of the stove,

1382
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,340
pointed down and light a camera on
the refrigerator and then leave.

1383
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:04,410
Well give it 1520 minutes and it's late
night. Irene, what does this, Jamie,

1384
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:06,340
this is the of the whole movie actually.

1385
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,990
It's on you. This is the
beginning of the mechanics.

1386
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,020
This is the beginning of the
original one. Original? Yeah. Okay.

1387
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:16,270
When you know Jan Michael
Vinson, his father in the movie,

1388
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:18,970
Charles Bronson kills. He
gets a contract to kill him.

1389
01:23:18,971 --> 01:23:20,710
That's how Jim Michael drips to him.

1390
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,800
When he killed him and made him
look like he had a heart attack,

1391
01:23:23,801 --> 01:23:28,620
he wanted his medical file and he saw
he had a weak heart and he went to meet

1392
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:32,770
them and then he shot at the
road and he goes, run, run.

1393
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:35,540
So was the guy who was
running, he had on a tie,

1394
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:39,940
Jason straight them and whoever the fuck
made the movie make it look like he was

1395
01:23:39,941 --> 01:23:42,640
just shooting my child. But
you're saying to me, joy,

1396
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,910
what did it take so much
offense? Because it's, you know,

1397
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:50,250
it's the fucking mechanic. It was
that good of a God damn movie.

1398
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:53,180
You know that we did death
wish. No, no, no. You know,

1399
01:23:53,181 --> 01:23:57,430
you can't Redo death wish. One of the
most disturbing movies you'll ever say.

1400
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,440
Bruce Willis. Yeah. He should be
shot and then shot again. Okay.

1401
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:06,250
I mean, he did fucking listen. You
know what? That's the wish has,

1402
01:24:06,251 --> 01:24:09,640
and nobody remembers
what I saw when I was 10.

1403
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:14,620
This is why I don't play that shit as
one of the most disturbing rape scenes

1404
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:19,780
you'll ever see. And Jeff
Goldbloom Senate members,

1405
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:23,470
they knocked this daughter right,
raped us, spray painted, harass.

1406
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,280
I left that movie being 11,
like fearing for my mom. Now,

1407
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:31,180
like I left that and I became
tied with my mom at the bar.

1408
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:34,480
I tried to get a stick, a knife
like that could happen to women.

1409
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:38,020
Like that happens to women. Like
guys just ripped their pants off.

1410
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:42,560
I didn't know. I didn't know what
that shit was. So I watched the uh,

1411
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:45,970
whatever the fuck is this. That's the
way it's a different world for women.

1412
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,060
Yeah. I couldn't even believe
it when I watched that.

1413
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:51,610
Doesn't that ever talk about
how disturbing that scene?

1414
01:24:51,611 --> 01:24:56,200
Is that something that most men never
have to think about unless you're in jail?

1415
01:24:56,201 --> 01:25:00,610
Most men, most men don't have to think
about that with women have to say no.

1416
01:25:00,611 --> 01:25:02,320
What happened, right? He goes to Arizona,

1417
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:06,820
they sell him tires on it to build
the building and it becomes run to the

1418
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:11,470
redneck and the redness like, man,
that can't happen to you. He goes,

1419
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:13,030
I put a little something in your bag.

1420
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:17,620
Either take back up to those big city
folks with Charles Bronson got back to his

1421
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:20,920
house, was a fucking
white canon from Texas

1422
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:28,450
Walk Kurzy he was an architect.
He gave him a fucking cannon.

1423
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,170
So Charles Bronson said, let me go on
and have some fun and see what happens.

1424
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:36,040
First night, first night, some guy's
like, hey, old time to give me 20 bucks.

1425
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:40,210
And you could see the panic in his
face. He was an old man. He stole it.

1426
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:44,680
He stole it. He didn't take it out and
say, fuck you. No. He was panicked.

1427
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:48,850
He shot the guy in the subway
scene. You could see he scared. You.

1428
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:52,180
Remember when that fucking looking at
him looking at him. Oh, this is great.

1429
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:55,420
That's right. Right here.
Look, he's just an old man dog.

1430
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,100
53 years old. Fucking
killing it in America.

1431
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:04,250
Giving men like you and me hope he
was giving the men hope. This fucking

1432
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,030
guy, right? Yeah.

1433
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:09,260
I think he was at least 50
years old when he was lunch.

1434
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:13,960
Wow. Look what kind of
skinny is by out by pain.

1435
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,030
Got Right that you Bob, look at him.

1436
01:26:17,031 --> 01:26:20,720
He's just get better suit on shooting
these guys. Yeah. This is cute.

1437
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:21,710
Brilliant film.

1438
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:25,160
They'll never do that again because
they won't take these little fucking

1439
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:29,620
details. He was petrified. I took crazy

1440
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:33,650
in hard times. I think he
was 50 years old by then.

1441
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:38,980
I remember when he played the, that
boxer a mechanic. He was 51 I think.

1442
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,760
Hard tie. Yeah, Bro. He was,

1443
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:44,570
I think he was 51 and there was no
TRT back then son. That dude was doing

1444
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:47,110
things.

1445
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:51,650
He was going to fall Moesha I forgot what
was Formosa that for most of the cafe,

1446
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:55,580
that little bar down there, that's where
he would go like to eat or some shit.

1447
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,940
I heard he lived down there. I don't
know what the deal, where does he live?

1448
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,780
Well, when he came down like that's
where he took the name Bronson from.

1449
01:27:02,781 --> 01:27:06,740
Was that street in Hollywood?
Really? What was his real name?

1450
01:27:06,741 --> 01:27:11,420
He's a Polak Radensky something.

1451
01:27:11,421 --> 01:27:15,120
Just that they'd told him like,
you can ski. Yeah, you can't,

1452
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:19,190
but it have that name. So he probably
looked around Hollywood. Perfect.

1453
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:23,270
I said Bronson, you fucking believe
that when you hear that shit like wait,

1454
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:24,140
whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

1455
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:28,570
You were walking down the street and
it's like when you had Jamie Fox on it,

1456
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:33,170
he made his name Jamie Fox because
people would think he was a hot chick.

1457
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:36,350
That is the most bullying thing
I've ever heard in my life.

1458
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:39,740
Jamie Fox was a bad mother. Brilliant
man. Brilliant man. Brilliant.

1459
01:27:39,741 --> 01:27:43,650
That's the fact that he figured
that out. Yeah. Chicken Shit.

1460
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:46,120
Pick your name on the lineup.
They see that Jamie Fox,

1461
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:50,760
you get a chance to get up
there. So smart. You're re,

1462
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:53,030
you know like if a guy
sees that fox, whatever,

1463
01:27:53,031 --> 01:27:57,830
Jamie with an especially with
an eye. You supposed to j I. M.

1464
01:27:57,831 --> 01:28:02,510
I does. He doesn't he James
basic, my regular Jamie.

1465
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:07,040
That makes you think it's a broad
right off the fucking back is Jamie j.

1466
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:09,530
A. Y. M. I. E. I would
say it's girl. Yeah.

1467
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:13,190
You said the I before the M is a girl
spelling us a lot of those weird words

1468
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:17,630
like Shawn, but there's a lot of
hot Shawn's that are girls. Right?

1469
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,530
What else? What are the ones, it's a
guarantee. They used to be like Stacey,

1470
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:26,120
like these didn't name dude.
Stacey like Stacy Keach. They said,

1471
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:28,970
you know there's a lot of dudes,

1472
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:32,460
they're like in their sixties they to
name guys. Stacey, there's something,

1473
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,220
there's a name that a friend of mine had.

1474
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:36,980
There was a guy that can't
remember it now, wasn't there?

1475
01:28:36,981 --> 01:28:41,270
One of the weird guys in
airplane. Leslie, Leslie, Leslie.

1476
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:46,070
These name guys. Leslie. How weird.
That's a weird one. What's his name?

1477
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:50,150
Linsley the hilarious dude. Listen
hilarious. The guy was hilarious.

1478
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,580
Wasn't he in creep show too?

1479
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:55,130
Was he one of the people in
creep show that got killed?

1480
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,900
I feel like he was one of those people
that got buried on the beach or some shit

1481
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:04,830
like that. Yeah. Yeah. He's
a husband. Yeah, he, he uh,

1482
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:09,150
did something to some, some rich guy.
It got buried him up to his head.

1483
01:29:09,151 --> 01:29:12,810
I forget those fucking scary
horror movies like creep show,

1484
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:16,410
fun horror movies. They don't make
enough of those anymore either.

1485
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:20,430
Those are my favorite
moves. Anything else?

1486
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:24,750
Scream wasn't bad. Right? It wasn't
bad at all. And what year was that?

1487
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:29,710
87 97 six yeah.

1488
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:33,450
Those are the six 97 fun ass
movie. I think the Latin,

1489
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:36,810
that's the last one I watch.
But the last movie, the scare,

1490
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:41,811
the living fuck out of me was the first
nightmare on elm street with the tongue

1491
01:29:41,971 --> 01:29:46,030
coming out of the fall. Before
that, you know the people I go,

1492
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:49,980
you don't watch walking dead. You
know why? Again, I'm loyal to fucking,

1493
01:29:49,981 --> 01:29:52,980
when I was a kid, those
dawn of the dead movies,

1494
01:29:52,981 --> 01:29:55,890
what was the guy that wrote those?
George Romero. George Romero.

1495
01:29:55,891 --> 01:30:00,060
I'm loyal to him. My loyalty is with him.
I took acid and went to George Romero,

1496
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:03,210
that one dorm, the dead.
When the helicopter chops,

1497
01:30:03,211 --> 01:30:06,780
a black guy's head off when he doesn't
even know the helicopter lands.

1498
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:09,990
And he says, I'm B. Yeah. And
I think he chops his head off.

1499
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,720
I remember tripping on the ass. I
almost had a fucking heart attack.

1500
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:16,470
Walking dead was awesome for the
first few episodes. They just lost.

1501
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:21,030
They just each can't keep something like
that up forever. It just becomes too,

1502
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:25,320
too hard to keep the story going. And
it's just a good story. Got Too weird.

1503
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:29,700
But the best hard movie, Zombie horror
movie of all time. It's 28 days later.

1504
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:34,420
That's the best one. That's
that British movie. So, uh, it,

1505
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:36,930
we didn't get until like way
after it came out in this,

1506
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,540
in the theater over there. Most
people have seen it. They've seen it.

1507
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:41,650
They've seen it on cable
or DVD. Right. People.

1508
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,040
That's what it was 28 days later.
Even in the theaters out here.

1509
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:48,210
Was it the depth, the depth, the
one after that was a big deal,

1510
01:30:48,211 --> 01:30:51,750
but it was a British movie.
Right. Goddamn that movies good.

1511
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:55,860
I remember I bought a
version of it on VHS,

1512
01:30:56,190 --> 01:31:00,970
on the number of European VHS was
a different format. He was like,

1513
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:02,550
yeah, I have a different player.

1514
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:05,760
Or you had to have a player that was a
universal player that could play both.

1515
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:10,520
I had one of those just so I could get
some cool documentaries and shit that

1516
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:12,570
you'd get from Europe.
Just just to remind them.

1517
01:31:12,571 --> 01:31:15,870
Want to give props to American
Airlines for returning my luggage. Oh,

1518
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:17,040
after the whole weekend.

1519
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:20,370
And they missed that fucking half
ounce of weed in my boxing glove.

1520
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:25,130
So you're the delivery driver.
You are dumb. Fuck. That was,

1521
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:28,340
they lost my movie tie bag. They did.

1522
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:31,530
I was going to Columbus to go to the short
movie thigh and I brought in the, uh,

1523
01:31:31,531 --> 01:31:34,800
you know, my little fucking Shin
pads and my gloves. This man raps.

1524
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:38,160
He'd been doing that a lot lately. Huh?
More done. Of it. That's great. Right?

1525
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,840
I go twice a week. Well, I've had a,

1526
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:45,720
I'm 56 the targets that thing, and I
take the class with everybody else.

1527
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:47,370
I do everything else I
die. They're like, well,

1528
01:31:47,371 --> 01:31:51,090
we don't want the boxing
because Tuesday and Wednesday,

1529
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:53,340
Tuesday and Thursdays boxing. Then when
you do the class, do they have you spar?

1530
01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:00,240
I'm 56 I light no headgear.
None of that shit. Chopping pop.

1531
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:04,690
Yeah, working in a combination. Shit
like that. Saturday, Sundays I go in,

1532
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,100
there's an open mat. If I'm home,

1533
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:10,880
I go in and there's a chick that's
like an ice cop, an ice cop.

1534
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:14,890
Oh No, she's, she's a
tough chick. Yeah. Yeah.

1535
01:32:14,891 --> 01:32:16,360
She trains for Brett and the whole thing,

1536
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:19,390
so I go down and just let her beat
me up to death. Let me ask you this.

1537
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:21,400
As someone who is born in another country,

1538
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:25,600
how do you think that they should
handle the immigrations that are here?

1539
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,410
Because this is the big question. A
lot of people know people that are,

1540
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:33,760
I mean probably a lot of people listening
know someone who they love that's

1541
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:34,510
illegal.

1542
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:37,780
Whether they're illegal from Canada or
they're illegal from Europe or they're

1543
01:32:37,781 --> 01:32:38,650
illegal from Mexico.

1544
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,230
Where the fuck there's a lot of people
that get over here and stay over here

1545
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:42,310
that aren't supposed to be.

1546
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:47,890
Some of them turn out turned out to be
amazing people. So how do you decide,

1547
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:51,430
how do you decide who gets to say and to
someone coming over here trying to make

1548
01:32:51,431 --> 01:32:55,180
their life better? A better thing,
but just doing it illegally.

1549
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:59,380
Does that automatically discount them
from staying here? That seems crazy.

1550
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,273
What if their great?

1551
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,630
There's a lot of people come over here
because they were super unfortunate and

1552
01:33:04,631 --> 01:33:06,130
where they were born and they,

1553
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:09,370
they grew up in a shitty place
and they wanted to make it better,

1554
01:33:09,371 --> 01:33:10,240
but they didn't know how to do it.

1555
01:33:10,241 --> 01:33:13,270
So they came over to
America by Hook or by Crook.

1556
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,910
They figured out how to get here. They
got here and now they're kicking ass.

1557
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:19,990
Why? Why would you want to get rid of
them? As long as they're not criminals,

1558
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:22,690
as long as I'm not hurting anybody, why
would you want to get rid of them? Well,

1559
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:26,410
start is, let's do this. Let's
what's going on right now.

1560
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:31,240
Just points the finger
at a certain realm of,

1561
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:35,390
Oh, you're pointing the finger south
of the border. Yeah, it's Canadian.

1562
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:38,680
A lot of Canadian. Which, and I'm
not saying nothing bad about anybody.

1563
01:33:38,681 --> 01:33:39,990
This is the United States of America.

1564
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,270
People come here to fucking have
a dream and whatever happens, bro,

1565
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:46,480
sometimes the dream goes, could put,
you know, when I went to New York,

1566
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:51,220
I spent three weeks in New York and I
ubered and I did a little thing in my

1567
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:53,740
mind, you know, I took 20 Ubers. In fact,

1568
01:33:53,741 --> 01:33:57,730
I became Uber planning because I was
doing, you know, all these rides.

1569
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:03,580
Not One white person picked
me up. Not one time, one time.

1570
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:08,170
And guess what? I asked questions.
I asked everybody questions.

1571
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:11,650
And the most inspiring person I
met was one, not at work though.

1572
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,800
I rapped at six 30 in the morning.

1573
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:17,650
There was no way I was getting in the
van to go home. But I just called Uber.

1574
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:22,750
I was in Ridgewood, Brooklyn and
this Indian girl picked me up.

1575
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:26,170
Very cute, you know, six
in the fucking morning.

1576
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:30,940
It's still kind of dark out, you
know, five 30 whatever it was.

1577
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:36,100
And this little girl that
weighed 90 pounds picked me
up, got in the car, hello.

1578
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:39,130
We have charger in the back if you
want to charge your car and this little

1579
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:43,390
caramels in the front, you know?
And I said, where are you from?

1580
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:44,800
And she told me India and I go,

1581
01:34:44,801 --> 01:34:49,750
how long have you been a year and
a half spoke perfect English. Wow.

1582
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:52,990
I go, why do you, why did you
become an Uber driver? She goes,

1583
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:57,590
I became Uber driver because I was a
waitress in an Indian restaurant and the

1584
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:58,310
guy abused

1585
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:02,150
me and he would only pay me eight
bucks an hour and take half my tips.

1586
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:05,540
So me and my cousins got together,

1587
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:09,680
we put away money and we rent
the car. We leased a car,

1588
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:15,730
my s she drives in the daytime
and I drive with at night. Wow.

1589
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:19,660
And I drag on, why are you, aren't you
scared to go out at night? She's like,

1590
01:35:19,661 --> 01:35:23,620
no. She's like, I love it
because there's no traffic in it.

1591
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,650
I go, what do you walk with? I just
asked her creepy questions. Not Sad,

1592
01:35:28,651 --> 01:35:33,280
you know? I just watched her and it was,
I went, I gave her an extra tip like,

1593
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:35,560
can you be illegal and do that?

1594
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:42,390
I don't know what the status
was with her. I didn't ask her.

1595
01:35:42,391 --> 01:35:44,370
I didn't know [inaudible]
but what do you think?

1596
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:45,510
Do you think that you could do that?

1597
01:35:45,511 --> 01:35:46,950
Do you think like if you
came from another country,

1598
01:35:46,951 --> 01:35:48,480
you came from Guatemala illegally,

1599
01:35:48,481 --> 01:35:53,310
you were came over here though and became
an Uber driver. Could you do that? Me?

1600
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:56,040
No. Can anybody do that or do
they check your citizenship?

1601
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,000
What do you think Jamie?

1602
01:35:58,290 --> 01:36:00,180
There's yes they can do that.

1603
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:04,170
So someone definitely can come over
here and start working for Uber or or

1604
01:36:04,171 --> 01:36:05,100
another or a similar,

1605
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:08,580
I'm not saying that I'm
doing that necessarily like
through the proper ways that

1606
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:09,240
you can get,

1607
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:13,140
if you have a legal friend you can use
their license to be that like the Uber

1608
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:15,750
thing and they don't know who's behind
the car. So it happens all the time.

1609
01:36:15,751 --> 01:36:18,900
When I'm ordering food, you definitely
have to have a valid driver's license.

1610
01:36:18,901 --> 01:36:21,960
Right? So you get a valid driver's
license if you're illegal.

1611
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:25,620
Oh that's the part like
so I'm saying so like, no,

1612
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:28,500
but that doesn't stop someone from
getting behind a car if you don't have a

1613
01:36:28,501 --> 01:36:30,750
license any day. That's
sort of where I'm going,

1614
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:36,340
want to get in trouble right now is on
we on the shit list because we agreed and

1615
01:36:36,341 --> 01:36:38,420
somebody else to give illegals licenses.

1616
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:44,090
That's why I was asking does there was
a thought that popped a memory popped in

1617
01:36:44,091 --> 01:36:45,520
my head about some story like that,

1618
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:49,330
that they were going to give a
illegal aliens the a right to drive.

1619
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:53,210
I'm sort of saying like it does happen,
but not above the board basically

1620
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:55,200
because it's, yeah. But are you
sure? Could you see if they're,

1621
01:36:55,201 --> 01:36:58,280
they're trying to give illegal aliens
driver's licenses because I remember a

1622
01:36:58,281 --> 01:37:02,870
story like this too as well.
People are super upset about it.

1623
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,920
It's a weird thing. Mash
13 states that allow it.

1624
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:12,630
There you go baby. Where do you
have to move one of those states

1625
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:14,980
in d c uh,

1626
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:20,010
California was the first one as
of 2013. Colorado, Connecticut,

1627
01:37:20,011 --> 01:37:24,210
Delaware, everywhere. There's suite,
Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada,

1628
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,520
New Mexico, New York. Just everywhere.

1629
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:30,240
Their sweet Hawaiian doesn't
necessarily have wheat. Vermont

1630
01:37:31,870 --> 01:37:33,030
medicals is very close.

1631
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:37,750
Well, what business standpoint, they
work for cheaper and work harder than,

1632
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:42,670
you know, I mean, there's so many benefits
to as a business owner in different,

1633
01:37:42,671 --> 01:37:46,540
I mean, when was the last time you
saw a white laborer? You see them,

1634
01:37:46,570 --> 01:37:51,190
you go in the kitchen and at any
restaurant it's all, you know,

1635
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,540
I mean, and so now you,

1636
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:57,480
now you questioning what
rights you have as an American.

1637
01:37:57,481 --> 01:38:01,620
You come here, you get a job, you're
working hard, you stay out of trouble,

1638
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:07,410
you stay out of trouble. Your mind, your
business, you know, I mean I grew up,

1639
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,580
you and I grew up in the east coast where
you'd go to a Chinese restaurant and

1640
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:16,200
you'd see them though the husband and
wife working and the kids would be doing

1641
01:38:16,201 --> 01:38:19,710
homework at the back table and
if you came in the daytime,

1642
01:38:19,711 --> 01:38:23,700
it was a different couple, which is
telling me that two couples got together,

1643
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:28,650
they buy a home and they opened a
business together and they work together.

1644
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,720
That's what those immigrant in groups do.

1645
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:34,830
And then from there they bring a cousin
and they open the open and next thing

1646
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:38,580
you know they got three houses on the
block and now he just had a fucking

1647
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,990
immigrant family move into your
neighborhood. Not necessarily good or bad.

1648
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:46,200
You know what I'm saying? That that Nice.
We all had them in our neighborhoods.

1649
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:49,380
Sure. I remember 70 years ago,
this was your grandparents,

1650
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:51,780
so you have to think
about your grandparents.

1651
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:55,650
How would you want them to treat it?
I'm sure your grandpa father got a job,

1652
01:38:55,651 --> 01:38:58,530
lame Rick way before he
got his immigration papers.

1653
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:02,180
I don't know how they did it right.
I think they got it pretty quick.

1654
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:05,130
You get through Ellis island and
they pushed it. Boy, shoot drew.

1655
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:09,570
I mean the illegal situation, it
was a different world back then.

1656
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:12,930
You could immigrate pretty
easily. Like my grandparents did.

1657
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,530
Weren't rocket scientists when they came
over here. No, they were kids. Their,

1658
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:20,010
their, their parents weren't geniuses.
You know what's going on? Farmers.

1659
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:24,110
Do you know what's going on in South
America right now? Nicaragua and Doris,

1660
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:28,350
all those places. Pure hell, pure. Hell.

1661
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:32,490
You know, I can't be mad at you for
wanting to get the fuck out of that,

1662
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:36,660
but this other places on earth right
now will this Po fucking hell going on?

1663
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:40,470
Yeah, there's trying to come over
to, let's point everybody out.

1664
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:42,870
Let's lock all the fucking borders.

1665
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:47,460
Don't make it seem like it's just
Mexico. That's the fucking problem.

1666
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:51,150
You know, we're getting
bombarded from everywhere.

1667
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:55,590
We're getting new people in here every
day from everywhere. I ain't mad at it.

1668
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:58,050
That come in here to make better lives,

1669
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:02,250
but don't just keep pointing the fucking
water that you know offers coming

1670
01:40:02,251 --> 01:40:05,490
through that Mexican border that
nobody's talked about. Jamie,

1671
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,610
when you get a minute, if you'd
love to check it, just to verify me.

1672
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:12,150
You know how many Cubans and getting
sent back to Cuba on a daily basis from

1673
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:14,640
Mexico? Real getting back to get a shot.

1674
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:18,900
But Cubans want to come to Miami
Doma, why they're not coming through.

1675
01:40:19,110 --> 01:40:23,290
They're closed, all that type of shit.
So right now you can't come through my,

1676
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:28,200
it's easier to come go from Cuba
to Mexico and just join the walk

1677
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,800
and walk up. But once slides
here in America, we give
them asylum. Right? Right.

1678
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,950
The tag. But then it's still going.
I think robot Emma removed it.

1679
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:41,450
Did he really? Yes. Trump made
it so we can't go over there.

1680
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:44,760
You go pack Mexican shelters.

1681
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:49,350
Hope the Mexican people are going
through Mexico. And that's crazy.

1682
01:40:49,351 --> 01:40:51,660
So I think I, the number
of couple of weeks ago,

1683
01:40:51,661 --> 01:40:54,070
I think 900 Cubans getting sent back

1684
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:58,150
weekly to get shot. Does
you think that more people,

1685
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:02,020
more people are make it towards
the border since Trump was like,

1686
01:41:02,021 --> 01:41:03,490
build that wall, build that wall.

1687
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,580
Do you think more people are headed
towards the border now because it's just

1688
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:09,820
like it's a popular thing to
do. It's a part of our culture.

1689
01:41:09,821 --> 01:41:13,000
Like a part of the conversation
is the border wall, right?

1690
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:16,210
Like do you want a border wall or do you
not want to go build that wall and make

1691
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:19,330
it a fucking million feet high, bring
it right to that top of the earth.

1692
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,360
Or are you one of those people that
thinks anybody should be able to come over

1693
01:41:22,361 --> 01:41:24,180
here and have a better
life? You know, and this,

1694
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:27,760
that those two ideas of fucking
clashing left and right.

1695
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:31,270
Some people think that people
should be able to try to do better,

1696
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,470
try to better themselves.

1697
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:35,830
They should have the opportunity and
then some people think, fuck them.

1698
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:38,500
You're born somewhere else. You don't
ever get a chance to come over here,

1699
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:41,080
go in through proper channels,
which is almost impossible.

1700
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:45,070
Do something that's very valuable to us
over here. See, that's the thing. Like,

1701
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:48,940
if you are a person who has some
extraordinary skill, you know,

1702
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:52,330
you could probably get American
citizenship easier. You know, unusual.

1703
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:55,600
If you're contributing to the physics
department at Harvard or something like

1704
01:41:55,601 --> 01:41:58,600
that and your, you know, you
were born in Germany or wherever,

1705
01:41:58,601 --> 01:42:01,720
you probably get citizenship a
little bit quicker than you have.

1706
01:42:01,721 --> 01:42:04,210
Just a guy who like lives in Guatemalan,

1707
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:08,170
wants to come to America because
he thinks he can advance his life.

1708
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:11,020
You think he can get better
words where he lives? There's no,

1709
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:15,370
you can't go anywhere. You're
stuck. The, the poverty is extreme.

1710
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:19,690
The is extreme and he wants none
of that. He wants to do better.

1711
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:23,670
So he makes it over here.
I'm like [inaudible] when
you talk about immigration,

1712
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:26,620
you going to get good and bad
from every shelter. You know,

1713
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:31,621
Castro with 79 opened up this prisons
in the Mario and you got 100,000 Cubans

1714
01:42:32,410 --> 01:42:37,410
and I'm like a thousand fucking spoiled
rotten savages from Cuban prisons where

1715
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:39,280
they would no clothes in this.

1716
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:42,190
They have to shit in a hole in the
middle of the floor. This averages,

1717
01:42:42,430 --> 01:42:43,030
they're animals.

1718
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:46,480
They got no problem taking your
life from a piece of toilet paper,

1719
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:49,990
but the same one's true
from other countries.

1720
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:53,050
You get the good and the bad
from other country, you know,

1721
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:56,530
let's not beat around the bush
before Russians come here.

1722
01:42:57,190 --> 01:43:02,160
They going to course they go to a school
and to take a 12 week course and to

1723
01:43:02,161 --> 01:43:06,070
come here and get money right off the
bat. How to go to the social security.

1724
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:08,920
Check that out, Jamie.
That's a very weird one.

1725
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,760
They get taught how to come
here and scam the system.

1726
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:16,990
Whether you want to call, scan,
I'm not putting nobody down.

1727
01:43:16,991 --> 01:43:19,990
I have a tons of Russian friends. I
love him. I'm not saying them bad,

1728
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:22,900
but I've heard that's a fact.
I've heard them from them.

1729
01:43:22,901 --> 01:43:27,550
I have a friend who was married and she
told me one day that before they come

1730
01:43:27,551 --> 01:43:32,170
here, they take a course to prep them on
how to get money. As soon as they land,

1731
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:34,930
three days after they get them, they land.

1732
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:40,480
They get caching and Dola
paperwork. What to say. They coach.

1733
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:45,790
That's hilarious. This is like a service
that they offer. Some type of class,

1734
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,730
the system works. But if you want to,

1735
01:43:48,731 --> 01:43:52,130
some of the systems still tell you
how to do that. How many Armenians

1736
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,760
come over, come over and get
citizenship? Guess what they do?

1737
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:59,000
They get social security and they moved
back to our meeting and they get the

1738
01:43:59,001 --> 01:44:03,410
check sent back to Armenia. They
have a system on how to do that.

1739
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:08,420
They got a thousand loopholes now
brother. And if you learn those loopholes,

1740
01:44:08,421 --> 01:44:09,950
you get caved the fucking system.

1741
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:15,060
There's nothing wrong with having a
group of people that all agree on certain

1742
01:44:15,131 --> 01:44:17,620
rules, right? Which is what
the United States should be.

1743
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:20,190
But the problem with having
a group of people is you,

1744
01:44:20,191 --> 01:44:22,180
you don't get to pick
like who's in that group.

1745
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:27,660
So you just deciding instead of being
admitted by your merit or how how good a

1746
01:44:28,031 --> 01:44:30,460
neighbor you are or how
nice of a person you are.

1747
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:34,450
Now you just whether or not you
were born on the dirt like that,

1748
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:37,450
we born on this dirt or that dirt
cause you're born on that dirt.

1749
01:44:37,570 --> 01:44:39,340
You can't stay. But if
you're born on this dirt,

1750
01:44:39,341 --> 01:44:42,310
even if you're a shit human
being, you get to hang out,

1751
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:44,530
you get to ruin other people's
lives while you're here.

1752
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,380
As long as you don't do enough
that we need to put you in a cage.

1753
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:48,760
And then if we do,

1754
01:44:48,761 --> 01:44:51,610
we keep you for a couple years and let
you out and you do more. I mean, this is,

1755
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:53,290
we have no problem with that.

1756
01:44:53,550 --> 01:44:55,630
I Dunno what the fuck,

1757
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,360
what the percentage is. What the
fuck was I going to tell you?

1758
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:04,760
I don't know what it was.
Thought it was what you said.

1759
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:07,660
People versus bad people that come
in across the border. The thing is,

1760
01:45:07,661 --> 01:45:09,490
every time there's a bad one
that comes across the border,

1761
01:45:09,491 --> 01:45:13,120
it's highlighted as an example of why
we've got gotta keep the border closed and

1762
01:45:13,121 --> 01:45:15,730
they have a point. They all
have a point. Absolutely.

1763
01:45:15,731 --> 01:45:18,670
When you see someone who was
talking about illegal gang members,

1764
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:21,010
they're sneaking across the
border and murdering people.

1765
01:45:21,011 --> 01:45:24,970
It absolutely has happened. It's
100% of a real thing. This is not,

1766
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:28,560
not fiction questions. How
much does it happen? And, uh,

1767
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:32,050
how much better is it for those
people's lives that make it across?

1768
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:36,100
Is there a way to screen better to make
sure that the bad people don't come in

1769
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,730
and all of these questions
are legitimate? You know,

1770
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:42,280
you don't want a bunch of fucking evil
vicious people from another country in

1771
01:45:42,281 --> 01:45:43,930
your neighborhood. That's
how everybody feels.

1772
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:47,260
You don't want your children in your
family to be in danger because someone's

1773
01:45:47,261 --> 01:45:50,770
snuck across the border and they have a
long history of working for the cartel,

1774
01:45:50,771 --> 01:45:53,800
murdering people. That's a real
thing. It's a real possibility.

1775
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:56,590
So all the people that are vigilant, all
the people that are scared, you know,

1776
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:59,860
they're probably smart to be scared.
Look at fucking human history.

1777
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:03,850
People are capable of doing some awful
shit. No one's saying like, I'm not,

1778
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:07,870
I don't think there should
be no, no wall at all.

1779
01:46:07,871 --> 01:46:09,850
Nothing stopping people
from coming across.

1780
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,950
You definitely don't want pieces
of shit coming over here. Well,

1781
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:14,760
let me ask you, this
was how they find out.

1782
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:17,940
Did you ever notice that maybe
we're full. Yeah, we're probably,

1783
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:20,880
maybe we're full. Did you
notice that when you go on,

1784
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:25,650
there's homeless people on Ventura
fucking boulevard on Lankershim Boulevard

1785
01:46:25,651 --> 01:46:27,060
under bridges everywhere.

1786
01:46:27,330 --> 01:46:29,520
Has that ever come to your
mind that anywhere way you go,

1787
01:46:29,521 --> 01:46:33,840
there's cars everywhere and the between
Uber and Lyft in cabs now there's

1788
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:37,440
trafficking. Every major fucking
city. There's that lock or whatever.

1789
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:38,790
Did you ever notice that?

1790
01:46:38,791 --> 01:46:42,820
Maybe it's not that I hate Cubans and
Mexicans or Puerto Ricans or blacks with

1791
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:46,050
Germans, Irish maybe
that will fucking fall.

1792
01:46:46,051 --> 01:46:49,650
Have you ever come to that conclusion
that we're just full, right? Yeah.

1793
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:54,060
We have to take five years off. Like I
would accept that. I would accept that.

1794
01:46:54,061 --> 01:46:56,940
I would accept special circumstances.

1795
01:46:56,941 --> 01:46:59,670
Like why are you have family or so,

1796
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:03,960
but at this point right now we're
fucking full bro. Yeah. Yeah. We'll fall.

1797
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:06,200
We don't have nowhere else to put anymore.

1798
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:11,600
We really don't look at no eddies unless
we pack them all to Iowa and send them

1799
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,280
all, you know, send them all into my,

1800
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:17,280
where's the highest population
of Mexicans in the country?

1801
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:23,370
I would probably say southern California.
Wrong. Indiana. Chicago. Chicago.

1802
01:47:23,371 --> 01:47:28,030
Yeah. Hi. They farm a ton of shit up
in Chicago. I'm going to make sense.

1803
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:33,420
Illinois, you know, where's the highest
population of Puerto Ricans? The Bronx.

1804
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:37,560
You're wrong. Cleveland Clinic,
because in the 50s they shipped,

1805
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:41,500
they all the dealers were with, uh,

1806
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:44,490
taking Puerto Rican is putting
them into the Cleveland,

1807
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:49,020
Ohio area to work in the fucking Ford
plants and all those type of plants.

1808
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:51,090
And after all those places, sat down,

1809
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:53,310
all those people sitting
there holding on to that Dick.

1810
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:57,090
When you go to certain parts of Ohio,
there's a suburb outside of Cleveland.

1811
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:01,140
12 fucking Puerto Rican. Wow.
You know, interesting. But it's,

1812
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:06,330
I don't think of it as we hate
Russians or Germans or anything.

1813
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:10,080
I look at it from a different sprint
back to the times and maybe will fall.

1814
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:11,310
You know,

1815
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:16,020
it's for me to send my daughter to
the date cam cost rebills a week.

1816
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,720
I'm not complaining. That's a
great day. Kids a science camp,

1817
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:23,220
they make potions than learn about light
bulbs and electricity. My point is,

1818
01:48:23,221 --> 01:48:27,720
I did the same thing for free when I
was a kid. All I do is walk to my park.

1819
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:32,580
There's no funds left. There's
nothing left for these kids. You know?

1820
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:37,440
I don't know. When I walk into
a dodger game or an event,

1821
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,220
I go,

1822
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:42,960
I always think of the family of four in
America today that both parents have to

1823
01:48:42,961 --> 01:48:45,240
work and everybody has to work.

1824
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:47,730
If you go by my office with a
podcast in the middle of the,

1825
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:52,610
say 24 hours a day camp, and we tell
him to leave my office at midnight,

1826
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:55,460
I see parents picking
up their kids, you know,

1827
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:58,740
carrying them out over their
shoulders into that car. You know,

1828
01:48:58,741 --> 01:49:03,600
it costs a lot to control the American
family. There's not a lot of jobs. Wait,

1829
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:07,950
you see everybody's driving Uber. If you
take all this, Uber's is interesting.

1830
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,750
I'm thinking of doing a documentary.

1831
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:13,950
I'm just going Uber's and talking to
these people and ask them why they Woburn.

1832
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:19,020
Yesterday I had an engineer
engineer lost his job.

1833
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:22,830
58 years old, got to work Asian fellow.

1834
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:27,300
Very nice. I tipped him extra. He
offered me to plug the phone. I mean,

1835
01:49:27,301 --> 01:49:31,020
you know, you have to
look at that and go, wow,

1836
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:33,450
there's a lot of people in
this country without work.

1837
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:38,310
There's a lot of fucking homeless people
and we're running out of money to take

1838
01:49:38,311 --> 01:49:42,120
care of what we got here.
It's true. Like there's,

1839
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:46,260
La has an epidemic of homeless people
right now where there's so many tents on

1840
01:49:46,261 --> 01:49:48,070
the street and at the fucking dammit,

1841
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,390
they're everywhere. I mean it's
definitely, it's fucking Lankershim. Yeah.

1842
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,870
You know what they're, when
they're in Sherman oaks. Yeah.

1843
01:49:55,871 --> 01:49:59,710
The streets on Heidi on the underpasses
on their passes are stuffed with them

1844
01:49:59,711 --> 01:50:02,190
now. Something else. I mean, we have
to, what are you going to do with,

1845
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:05,230
you can't walk through those
underwear. You know what the answer is?

1846
01:50:05,231 --> 01:50:06,680
You know what they
usually do with them? Wow.

1847
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:10,900
They give them 100 bucks and they give
them a bus pass to Vegas and now Vegas

1848
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,230
has stuck with them. We talked
about that on the pocket tools.

1849
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:14,610
Every city's done that.

1850
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:17,380
Every city keeps doing you
just kidding around like shit.

1851
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:22,650
It's time to get fucking some apart
and put a 10 city and make him be

1852
01:50:23,621 --> 01:50:24,520
resourceful.

1853
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:29,710
We'll give them more than 110,000
empty rental units in Los Angeles.

1854
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:32,680
Filling those spaces won't solve the
housing or the homeless horizon. Yeah,

1855
01:50:32,681 --> 01:50:35,920
but the problem is if these fucking
things are for rent and you have these

1856
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:40,240
homeless people that are drug addicts
and probably mentally insane and you let

1857
01:50:40,241 --> 01:50:43,540
them stay in those rental
apartment, they're going to
destroy your rental place.

1858
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:46,810
Well, let's be honest, there's
110,000 on. Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

1859
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:49,330
Because all depends on what kind of
homeless person you're talking about.

1860
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:50,860
You're talking about a person
who's down on his luck.

1861
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:53,560
Are you talking about a mental
illness, mental illness,

1862
01:50:53,561 --> 01:50:56,320
drug addiction that stuck violently.

1863
01:50:56,350 --> 01:51:01,350
When I see 60 when I see a hundred when
I see 10,000 homeless people and I'm

1864
01:51:01,611 --> 01:51:02,050
like,

1865
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:07,050
I got to assume 4,000 of them are
people are down that look at me.

1866
01:51:08,201 --> 01:51:12,280
The slip, they got four
flat tires and it just get,

1867
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:15,550
you know this time people go
through shit for periods of time.

1868
01:51:15,551 --> 01:51:18,880
It could be a year. It could be.
It's like these fucking icos.

1869
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,560
Every fucking three days. A
hike against lost. Okay. Yeah.

1870
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:27,400
These hikers gets lost and they
stroll off when they get saved,

1871
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:30,850
they're all happy. You see
on my witness news happy.

1872
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:36,370
Wait till they get the bill. They get
hit with a bill. Oh yeah. Every time.

1873
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:39,280
Most went through those
helicopters calls. So they,

1874
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:41,740
there's talks and teach
groups that's volunteer.

1875
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:46,890
If every fucking Hika got paid
for, for a fucking taxpayer,

1876
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,060
we'd be broke. So like in Colorado,

1877
01:51:49,190 --> 01:51:52,180
so if you're one of those hikers that
goes and snaps her ankle and you're on on

1878
01:51:52,290 --> 01:51:56,500
a ridge somewhere, they come and
get you. That costs somebody money.

1879
01:51:56,890 --> 01:52:01,150
You gotta pay somebody. There's no
fucking tax funds. Just that cost. Well,

1880
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,260
it's going to cost a lot of
money. You get hip listening.

1881
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:06,280
If you like lady who got
stuck in Hawaii for a week,

1882
01:52:06,281 --> 01:52:09,880
wherever the fuck she was a month ago,
those helicopters caught something.

1883
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:13,220
She got stuck in Hawaii. Oh,
I lady, the lady teacher,

1884
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:18,310
you know they found her, right?
Yeah. They found them. I assume.

1885
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:21,280
I'm just saying this story just because
what happens if something like that

1886
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:25,600
happened to see it and you get hit? You
ever get involved in a lawsuit? Okay,

1887
01:52:25,601 --> 01:52:29,950
and the lawsuit I rear end Joe
Rogan, Joe Rogan's neck and the,

1888
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:33,820
God forbid his neck and his back
hurt. You can't do God's right.

1889
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:40,150
You file a claim against me while
you're going to the doctor, right?

1890
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:43,230
All those months. What is
the doctor usually Rick Bell,

1891
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:47,900
yet everything's payable
30 days. That dirty is it?

1892
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:48,830
[inaudible].

1893
01:52:48,830 --> 01:52:53,830
When you start getting those 1100 a
dollar bills from when they look in your

1894
01:52:54,591 --> 01:52:57,920
knee and then your neck, when you get 10
of those, how are you going to pay him?

1895
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:01,280
Because you can't pay it. You get the
settlement from the fucking attorney.

1896
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:04,940
A lot of times people go broke
by the time they get the money.

1897
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:08,150
The ship has sailed. It takes
seven years to get that money.

1898
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:11,530
You've been going to the doctor for three
days waiting to concurrence covers all

1899
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:14,120
this one insurance. We'll tell
everybody with the net collars,

1900
01:53:14,410 --> 01:53:18,250
is this more complicated? What's that?
Tell everybody with the neck collars.

1901
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:21,950
Oh yeah. It's more complicated.
Yeah. So all those bills add up.

1902
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:26,260
You get hit with a bunch of bills.
Joe, you're homeless, you're homeless,

1903
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:28,340
it's you and your wife,
whatever. It's homeless.

1904
01:53:28,341 --> 01:53:31,840
Unless you have parents and you know
you're homeless and you're in there.

1905
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:35,840
So when I look at the homeless situation,

1906
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:40,370
when you hit me with a 50,000 number,
which is a lie, if you go around that way,

1907
01:53:40,371 --> 01:53:40,971
it's a lie.

1908
01:53:40,971 --> 01:53:44,900
I land at the airport and hooked that
fucking thing onto the four or five north

1909
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:48,140
and look under that. There's a
hundred people just under that.

1910
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:50,390
So whatever number they tell you,

1911
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:53,720
what do you think they'd tell you as
far as like homeless population in la?

1912
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:57,530
I don't know. I know God said he was
under fire. Like I know that fuck. Yeah,

1913
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:02,030
like the people are pissed because they
gave $2 million. They gave $2 million.

1914
01:54:02,031 --> 01:54:04,550
They gave him money and they
didn't do Dick. Oh really? Yeah,

1915
01:54:04,551 --> 01:54:07,550
they gave me some type of money.
You got to put up some shelters.

1916
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:12,560
I saw that up in North Hollywood studio
is a church that on Thursdays they go

1917
01:54:12,561 --> 01:54:14,540
and take showers there. You know,

1918
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:18,530
there was a place in
Maine that was a offering.

1919
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:22,280
They were offering young couples.

1920
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:26,620
They wanted young people and young
families to move up there because uh,

1921
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:29,300
it's tough to get people to live
and some of those parts of Maine,

1922
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:33,920
so they offered incentives for young
people to move up there and a lot of

1923
01:54:33,921 --> 01:54:36,770
African folks started
moving up there. You know,

1924
01:54:36,771 --> 01:54:39,290
they found out that that
was a good place to be.

1925
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:42,310
And so they like filled up a lot of
their shelters up there. There was a,

1926
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:45,650
an article about that. See if you could
find that interesting. It's like, hey,

1927
01:54:45,651 --> 01:54:47,570
they'll, they're like, look,
I know it's cold as fuck,

1928
01:54:47,571 --> 01:54:52,190
but we'll take a chance there from
a war war torn part of the world.

1929
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:55,520
And if they could just be
cold in Maine and be at peace,

1930
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:58,610
they beggars can't be choosers. That's
why Marcus Davis lived up there.

1931
01:54:58,611 --> 01:55:02,000
I asked him, remember UFC fighter?
I asked him like, why do you,

1932
01:55:02,001 --> 01:55:05,000
why do you like it in Maine? He's like,
there's no fucking crime. He goes,

1933
01:55:05,001 --> 01:55:08,240
it's none. He's like, there's
none. He goes, everybody's nice.

1934
01:55:08,590 --> 01:55:12,470
It's cold as fuck. But everybody's
nice. There was a comedy club up there.

1935
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:18,710
Where was it? Comedy Club was on a
wharf and it floated. No, where's,

1936
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:23,630
where's that came from man of a month.
A Marley, Bob Marley's from Maine.

1937
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:27,140
It was a man came up to the club.

1938
01:55:27,410 --> 01:55:31,370
Ones that more asylum
seekers arrive in Portland,

1939
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:35,540
Maine from southern border
is city debates assistance.

1940
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:40,810
Portland's human resources
director criticizes comments
by Mayor Ethan Strimling

1941
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:44,520
welcoming the arrival of more immigrants.

1942
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:48,210
It say that they're all from Africa,
isn't to say specifically Africa,

1943
01:55:48,211 --> 01:55:52,590
but they're buying them bus tickets to
go from like San Antonio and tech other

1944
01:55:52,591 --> 01:55:57,120
parts in Texas. Oh, I think this is a
different one. This is a different thing.

1945
01:55:57,990 --> 01:56:01,650
Yeah. Um, just, just
Google it from Africa.

1946
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:05,820
Did digital main African shelter.
Damn. And this shit popped up.

1947
01:56:06,850 --> 01:56:09,330
This gym, this one, this,
that's just one person.

1948
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,980
A new migrant surge from the board
of this one from Central Africa. Wow.

1949
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:15,390
Interesting. Uh, but you know,

1950
01:56:15,391 --> 01:56:18,990
for other people in other parts of the
world going, I'll take it. I get it.

1951
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:24,150
Maine is, it is cold as fuck for
a good stretch of the winter,

1952
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:28,500
but you know, they just stay in doors
and keep the fucking heat on. Whoa.

1953
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:32,490
La Population, La county
homeless population jumps.

1954
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:37,880
So from 2011 it was 39,414 and in 2019,

1955
01:56:39,301 --> 01:56:42,120
it's 58,936.

1956
01:56:42,121 --> 01:56:46,080
So it jumped up a fucking
ton to almost 20,000.

1957
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:49,920
And that's a just over a period
of eight years. That's crazy.

1958
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:53,400
That's a lot of people cause a couple
of dudes by my house I take care of,

1959
01:56:53,730 --> 01:56:55,860
there's a couple of dudes
that live in shopping cards.

1960
01:56:55,861 --> 01:56:59,520
I always drop a little food.
There's one dude that was like,

1961
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:04,140
he's like a soldier with PTSD
and he lives in the park.

1962
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:07,470
He's gotta be six, four, two 80
big black. What do you want to do?

1963
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:09,990
Every time I see him, I pull over.

1964
01:57:09,991 --> 01:57:14,000
I give him a 20 I introduced him
to my wife and my daughter. I go,

1965
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:18,870
you see anything used to just attack,
he's just attack. You rip them apart.

1966
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:21,240
When my daughter started
going to Grandpa's school,

1967
01:57:21,241 --> 01:57:23,800
I saw them when they walk walking by
the grandmas who I pulled right up,

1968
01:57:23,801 --> 01:57:27,960
I go that you see that grandma's go right
there. Go. My daughter goes to school.

1969
01:57:27,961 --> 01:57:32,260
You shouldn't be suspicious. White people,
you just rip them apart or whatever.

1970
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:36,240
Lay there. He has a Rambo knife, Rambo,

1971
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:39,570
bigger than ramble. I love
him. I love him. Took that.

1972
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:44,190
You could see where the PTSD and
mental health, he won't take showers,

1973
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,120
but he's got a heart of gold.
Whenever he sees me, he smiles.

1974
01:57:48,121 --> 01:57:52,080
It gives me a thumbs up. I never said
I believed that neighborhood tag he is.

1975
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,800
I seen him in that park. Maybe
six. Never violent behavior.

1976
01:57:56,040 --> 01:58:00,780
He doesn't drink alcohol, so I
know he's not just a fucking drunk.

1977
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:05,280
He just can't get a job. He just mental
health. No, it's a mental health issue.

1978
01:58:06,020 --> 01:58:09,540
It's, he's a veteran. I asked him,
how you doing? What's going on?

1979
01:58:10,270 --> 01:58:13,500
They told me his whole like a little
story as much as he could without being

1980
01:58:13,501 --> 01:58:14,334
embarrassed.

1981
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:19,460
So I just do every time I seen him I just
put money in his pan and he's as happy

1982
01:58:19,591 --> 01:58:22,680
as a pig in shit, but he's
a fucking stone killer.

1983
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,080
They ain't going to be no bleed,

1984
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:27,960
no shootings at that kid's schools cause
I got them checking it out three times

1985
01:58:27,961 --> 01:58:30,450
a day. You think I'm kidding. I don't
think you think I'm kidding you.

1986
01:58:30,451 --> 01:58:33,240
I love him. I love him. Did
that. My wife waves at them.

1987
01:58:33,241 --> 01:58:35,070
We beat by them mercy waves at them.

1988
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:38,930
Everybody's happy with it just
so there's no misunderstandings.

1989
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:42,040
I got a little piece
of mind. Is there ever

1990
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:45,760
going to be a time when there's no
bad neighborhoods? Is that possible?

1991
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:49,390
Is it possible to have a
place where there's no crime
at all? What do you think?

1992
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:51,430
Does that ever really going
to be possible? I mean,

1993
01:58:51,431 --> 01:58:53,500
it's definitely better now
than it ever has been before.

1994
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:56,740
And you could think that if, if things
move in the same general direction,

1995
01:58:56,860 --> 01:59:00,490
there'd be less crime 100 years
from now than a hundred years ago.

1996
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:03,610
But do you ever think there's going
to be a time where everywhere is safe?

1997
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:05,711
You know,

1998
01:59:05,711 --> 01:59:09,550
the Internet gives you a lot of education
on what cities that have no hard time.

1999
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:12,400
They don't tell you, but they
don't really feel yet. You know,

2000
01:59:12,401 --> 01:59:15,880
every weekend you see the murder
camp in Chicago. It's crazy.

2001
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:20,250
Every weekend the murder con Chicago,
these fucking countries ain't no safer.

2002
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:22,980
Dominican Republican, Puerto
Rico a couple of years,

2003
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:25,930
but think about a year ago that
is many shootings in Puerto Rico.

2004
01:59:25,931 --> 01:59:30,160
One weekend as they do in fucking
Chicago on the weekend. You know,

2005
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:34,050
look at the shit that happens in La. We
don't hear everything. What's happening?

2006
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:37,090
Dominican Republic, all these
people are dying. I die.

2007
01:59:37,150 --> 01:59:40,420
I don't know what does that to
many bar. It's this. It's that.

2008
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:42,640
What do you think Jane? What's
it? What do you think Jamie?

2009
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:47,400
Speculation. I heard that there's lots
of deals that get made from like front,

2010
01:59:47,401 --> 01:59:50,010
like if you had a friend that was
like maybe refill in mini bars,

2011
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:55,140
your other friend would then refill the
little bottles with not actual liquor or

2012
01:59:55,141 --> 01:59:57,690
something like that and like
they just kind of refill those.

2013
01:59:57,691 --> 02:00:00,990
I've seen videos online, it's not actually
happened in the Dominican Republic,

2014
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:04,170
but where all inclusive resorts,
so that's what the video said.

2015
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:08,100
They're just refilling bottles of
Kabocha and Hennessy and all sorts of,

2016
02:00:08,101 --> 02:00:10,200
just like with Brown water, I don't
know what the fuck they're even doing.

2017
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:13,560
It's like a whole system.
They have this like 15 people.

2018
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:17,820
The little factor in the back of the
shed on the beach just filling up empty

2019
02:00:17,821 --> 02:00:20,160
bottles of shit. So
just ripping people off.

2020
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:22,560
I don't know if that's what's happening
in the Dr, but that's what I've read.

2021
02:00:22,561 --> 02:00:26,430
Speculation online says that there's
this sort of something going on online.

2022
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:30,090
Not any, it's again a speculation.
It's nowhere legit. I don't know.

2023
02:00:30,690 --> 02:00:33,680
There's, see that seems
to make sense, right?

2024
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:38,180
If someone had a scam and those little
mini bar bottles or kind of expense on a

2025
02:00:38,181 --> 02:00:40,550
bad batch and just like you
get bad batches of drugs,

2026
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:44,570
they've got to find out they got some
homemade fentanyl or whatever. Yeah, yeah.

2027
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:48,290
Maybe they got some bullshit homemade
booze that's poison that got spread

2028
02:00:48,291 --> 02:00:49,760
around. Yeah. Yeah.

2029
02:00:49,761 --> 02:00:53,900
But the whole thing is suspicious that
they're doing kinky shit at the hospital.

2030
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:58,520
Kinky Shit. Yeah. What kind of Kinky
Shit? No answering no answer. No, I blow.

2031
02:00:58,521 --> 02:01:01,910
We don't know. Oh Blah, blah,
blah. You know what it is?

2032
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:05,790
They probably overwhelmed. Imagine if
we're sitting over here talking about it,

2033
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:07,160
how many people have been calling them?

2034
02:01:07,370 --> 02:01:10,600
How many people are furious because
they lost their loved one over there.

2035
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:12,050
They don't know what the fuck is going on.

2036
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:17,710
And then someone said that it's not
necessarily really an uptick that does not

2037
02:01:18,981 --> 02:01:21,220
necessarily really an uptick of deaths.

2038
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:24,950
It's just that they're highlighting every
time someone dies and that the reality

2039
02:01:24,951 --> 02:01:29,930
is people die all the time. I don't know
if that makes sense. You know, like,

2040
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:32,870
I mean how many people, if you
were just looking at Los Angeles,

2041
02:01:33,230 --> 02:01:35,990
they come here and they visit when
I'm having a heart attack and die.

2042
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:40,310
It might be a lot, you
know, we don't know. I mean,

2043
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:44,870
how many people come over
here from another country
every day and wind up dying

2044
02:01:44,871 --> 02:01:48,710
while they're here? Is that a normal
thing that people do? Cause people do.

2045
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,220
I mean,

2046
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:53,000
if people are dying of heart attacks and
all sorts of strokes and all sorts of

2047
02:01:53,001 --> 02:01:53,690
other shit,

2048
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:57,680
is that because someone's doing something
to them or is it because 100,000

2049
02:01:57,681 --> 02:02:01,310
people a day come over here
and one of them a day dies?

2050
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:04,370
I don't know what those numbers
are. I don't know if it's legit.

2051
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:07,760
What'd he show them? People that
died. It's number grant numbers.

2052
02:02:07,761 --> 02:02:12,620
I guess this looks like only
maybe 12 to 15 people since March.

2053
02:02:12,650 --> 02:02:17,060
March. That's a lot. But is it, I
don't know. I don't know if that's it.

2054
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:21,650
Or here in California, all these people
are older than no people. 50 or older.

2055
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,110
Yeah, fit you right. Which can
happen in any point in time,

2056
02:02:24,111 --> 02:02:28,160
especially if you're on vacation doing
Viagara, drinking straight Jack Daniels,

2057
02:02:28,850 --> 02:02:29,960
fucking up a storm,

2058
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:31,333
other than

2059
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:35,330
you could have a heart attack,
bro. But all jokes aside,

2060
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:38,960
no disrespect is that, can you a Google?

2061
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:43,460
How many people is this an
uptick or are really, is it,

2062
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:46,820
what's the best way to say
this? Die Per year. Yeah. Yeah.

2063
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:48,470
What's the annual tourist rate

2064
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:53,120
towards death rate and is it any different
from what we're experiencing now?

2065
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:55,550
Because it would be weird if
we just found out that no,

2066
02:02:55,551 --> 02:02:59,330
this is just what happens and they're
just making a big deal out of this for a

2067
02:02:59,331 --> 02:03:03,440
story with this that you know, 55
year old drunk guys die every year.

2068
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:08,020
Dominican Republic and Cuba and in
Puerto Rico and people get hammered on

2069
02:03:08,021 --> 02:03:10,020
vacation. Brows don't like it.

2070
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:13,660
You know what I heard about Dominican
Republic pulled back on that.

2071
02:03:13,661 --> 02:03:17,680
I have no reason to go there. Why
they saw cocaine on the beach.

2072
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:20,830
I do not like that idea at all.

2073
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:23,860
When I heard that they sold
cocaine on the beach at a,

2074
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:27,220
what's the big Mexican resort?

2075
02:03:28,170 --> 02:03:32,680
Where the people go for spring
break. Oh, I said one, but oh yeah.

2076
02:03:32,681 --> 02:03:36,070
Tell them no, no. I told them
they can't go and can't come.

2077
02:03:36,430 --> 02:03:40,810
They sell coke on the beach. All those
times when you sell coke on the beach,

2078
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:43,960
I don't want to be on that beach and I
was at trinity. You know what I'm saying?

2079
02:03:43,961 --> 02:03:48,070
I just have this weird feeling about
that they sell coke on the beach.

2080
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:53,080
They do that in um, Costa Rica too. I
had somebody offered me some below. No.

2081
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:57,250
Yeah, yeah. I feel sexy.

2082
02:03:57,460 --> 02:03:58,540
Stab a funny joke about that.

2083
02:03:59,190 --> 02:04:02,220
But walking down the street and someone's
trying to say, I see coke, coke.

2084
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:06,510
You've got coke. We've got, we'd got
coke. The guy would see me. Heroin.

2085
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:11,220
I think it find heroin, I think goes the
fuck. Why'd you think I wanted heroin?

2086
02:04:11,221 --> 02:04:14,910
Man, I can afford coke. Very funny one.

2087
02:04:15,070 --> 02:04:19,950
About 2.7 American Americans visited
Dominican Republic last year,

2088
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:24,660
which publicly releases data on only
about natural deaths such as car crashes

2089
02:04:24,661 --> 02:04:28,470
and drowns does not release information
about deaths by natural causes such as

2090
02:04:28,471 --> 02:04:30,210
heart attacks or strokes.

2091
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:35,010
Even though it compiles reports on
Americans who die on all Americans who die

2092
02:04:35,011 --> 02:04:38,130
abroad. It's a matter of statistics
that certain number of travelers

2093
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:41,340
will, will suffer serious
illnesses, accidents,

2094
02:04:41,341 --> 02:04:43,650
and even death while
traveling internationally.

2095
02:04:43,651 --> 02:04:47,640
The death rate in the Dominican Republic
is not any higher than the death rate

2096
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:50,730
in the states official said.
That's what I'm talking about.

2097
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:53,520
When people visit other countries,

2098
02:04:53,521 --> 02:04:56,940
don't expect them to stay alive because
you don't expect them to stay alive

2099
02:04:56,941 --> 02:05:00,870
here. They die all the time. But when
you're talking about what did they say,

2100
02:05:00,871 --> 02:05:02,430
what was the hundreds of thousands?

2101
02:05:02,610 --> 02:05:05,640
How many hundred thousand people visit
the Dominican Republic every year?

2102
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:10,260
2.7 million visited last year. Americans
visited last year. Oh my God. Really?

2103
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:15,090
2.7 million. Yeah. Wow. The fucking
10 people died. 1112 people have died.

2104
02:05:15,091 --> 02:05:17,910
I guess. Why did I think it was hundreds
of thousands? It's way more last year.

2105
02:05:17,911 --> 02:05:22,460
11 people died last year. No, this
year. This year. A couple months last,

2106
02:05:22,750 --> 02:05:26,250
but 12 people. That's a lot of fucking
people going over there. Man. People die.

2107
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:29,190
But meanwhile, everybody's scared
to go to the Dominican Republic.

2108
02:05:29,191 --> 02:05:31,920
So it's like probably killing
their business and okay.

2109
02:05:31,950 --> 02:05:36,690
It was fine until we track
out the mini bar. Come on man.

2110
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:41,830
Are you sure? You know some? Some
people I'm sure are getting the,

2111
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:45,150
the scary one was the lady
who got attacked. There was
a lady who got attacked.

2112
02:05:46,710 --> 02:05:49,620
They beat her half to death.
She has no idea what happened.

2113
02:05:49,621 --> 02:05:52,860
She saw a guy with an
outfit on from the resort,

2114
02:05:53,390 --> 02:05:57,750
let go an employee's outfit and he fucking
clubbed her and beat the shit out of

2115
02:05:57,751 --> 02:05:59,010
her and she doesn't remember anything.

2116
02:05:59,330 --> 02:06:02,880
[inaudible] he left her for dead and
when they found her they thought she was

2117
02:06:02,881 --> 02:06:07,050
dead. You know, bro. Shit,
for the last 10, 20 years,

2118
02:06:07,670 --> 02:06:11,160
there ain't nowhere I really
want to go. Hawaii's awesome.

2119
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:14,660
I'm scared of all that shit. Go to
Hawaii. It's the United States. We will,

2120
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:18,780
I'm the nicest fucking people in the
world. Yeah, go ahead Joey. Or you know,

2121
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:21,510
my wife and I said, Donald, we're
like all the places you want to go.

2122
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:24,550
It's a six hour fucking
flight. It's true. You know,

2123
02:06:25,090 --> 02:06:29,760
go while doing what we do. We got some
of the best coach in the world here.

2124
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:33,270
If you stopped down by San
Diego, mix it up a little bit.

2125
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:37,950
One of the beaches go up north to Santa
Barbara. Go even up a little north,

2126
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:41,820
you know, so we're going to
do that a little bit. I mean,

2127
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:45,540
Santa Barbara is beautiful. Santa
Barbara is beautiful. Be On vacation,

2128
02:06:45,570 --> 02:06:47,130
you know, and you're an hour away.

2129
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:52,460
We take too many fucking planes to be on
six hours to go to fucking Miami or New

2130
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:54,510
York. I told about taking
it to the Jersey shore.

2131
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,960
I thought about doing a lot of shit
like that. This so what you can do too.

2132
02:06:57,961 --> 02:06:59,640
You could do a couple day trip,

2133
02:06:59,830 --> 02:07:02,790
like go to Santa Barbara
for a day to Santa Barbara.

2134
02:07:02,791 --> 02:07:05,400
Go up past the San Luis
Obispo. That's real nice.

2135
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:08,750
I don't know if you know this like
fucking eight hour days there.

2136
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,020
I hate holidays cause it's softened such
this look like guys like you and me.

2137
02:07:13,021 --> 02:07:15,570
We worked through everything
but this mother fuckers,

2138
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:18,120
the two weeks before Christmas,
they shut down on my ass.

2139
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:23,400
They start singing jingle bells or shit,
you know, a week before mother's Day,

2140
02:07:23,401 --> 02:07:26,760
a week before Memorial
Day. It fucking kills me.

2141
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:30,020
Like this memorial date
killed me. You got to figure,

2142
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:33,400
I was in New York for three weeks,
you know, walking around. I was like,

2143
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:36,220
come home in the first day. I come
back the Memorial Day weekend.

2144
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:41,500
Nobody's having a party. Nobody's doing
shit. Finally Monday I told my wife,

2145
02:07:41,501 --> 02:07:43,390
I go, fuck it. I got
tickets for the dodger game.

2146
02:07:43,391 --> 02:07:45,760
Let's go to the dodger game and
what are you doing for the fourth?

2147
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:50,410
I'm going to the beach. Nice. I'm
leaving fucking Wednesday morning.

2148
02:07:50,770 --> 02:07:54,100
When did we have a barbecue over my house
for the fourth when you brought your

2149
02:07:54,101 --> 02:07:56,890
daughter, when was the last time? That
was like three years ago. Years ago?

2150
02:07:56,891 --> 02:08:01,600
Yeah. She was two or three. She was
so, you know, she's six. She's so cute,

2151
02:08:01,601 --> 02:08:06,600
man. She pointed to me and went,
Yuck. I asked her the other day.

2152
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:10,840
I go, you don't say yuck no more.
Then she goes, Nah, I grew that.

2153
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:14,620
I came close to where you were holding
her. I came closer to say hi. I'm like,

2154
02:08:14,621 --> 02:08:19,420
how are you? Which is like Yuck.
And now if she sees you, she goes,

2155
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:22,900
I know him. Yeah, that's what she still
remembers you. She's got, you know,

2156
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:27,640
that's the door. The kids
memories are horrible.

2157
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:31,180
And I remember being a kid and going
to my mom's bar and there were certain

2158
02:08:31,181 --> 02:08:35,560
people that would walk in and my
Mama Go, before you say anything,

2159
02:08:35,970 --> 02:08:40,570
I don't want you to know that he remembers
everything. He doesn't react to you.

2160
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:43,210
He'll tell me at two in the
morning, I would think my mom,

2161
02:08:43,211 --> 02:08:45,100
shit like that dude came in, he had a gun,

2162
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:49,540
he had something on his nose and
my Mama Go, Jesus fucking Christ.

2163
02:08:49,541 --> 02:08:54,240
So my mom would, and that's what's
crazy about kids. You a little people,

2164
02:08:54,650 --> 02:08:57,270
they in another room having a
conversation with your wife.

2165
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:01,350
Three days later she'll tell me what that
conversation was and I'll just look at

2166
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:06,340
it. I don't smoke in the house
no more. She's busted me once,

2167
02:09:06,341 --> 02:09:10,200
but she never said nothing to nobody.
This is, I can tell she's a Da.

2168
02:09:10,201 --> 02:09:14,050
She keeps her mouth shut. I walked
out, she was right there and I said,

2169
02:09:14,051 --> 02:09:15,970
I was talking to, her smoke
was coming out of my mouth.

2170
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:19,870
She didn't say one word to
me and she hates smokers.

2171
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:21,580
Like she fucking eight smokers.

2172
02:09:21,970 --> 02:09:25,150
Not because it's bad for them
because they ruined the environment.

2173
02:09:25,270 --> 02:09:29,440
That's hilarious. She's nothing about
health. She's like, they know good people.

2174
02:09:30,070 --> 02:09:34,360
Smokers are no good
because they're running the
environment daddy. So I'm like,

2175
02:09:34,361 --> 02:09:38,740
okay, what are you going to do? No,
I'm thinking about the Hawaiian thing.

2176
02:09:38,741 --> 02:09:40,900
I want you to hook me up
from a to z. Let me know.

2177
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:46,120
I know it's a certain [inaudible] to
go playing. What time would he is?

2178
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:50,650
Cause I don't know what time of the
year ago. Okay. That's all bullshit.

2179
02:09:50,890 --> 02:09:53,590
Fuck yeah. For Hawaii. Okay.
I'd go to Hawaii any day.

2180
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:57,870
The air so that you don't go from like
December to February cause it ain't no

2181
02:09:57,910 --> 02:10:01,810
season or nothing like that. We
went in June before that we went,

2182
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:07,390
last time we had gone was in
January or December. Yeah. It's um,

2183
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:11,100
it's beautiful. The people are so
nice, man. It's just, it's last time.

2184
02:10:11,180 --> 02:10:13,090
I shouldn't say this, they'll
probably get getting mad.

2185
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:15,670
You're going to make more people
come over there. It's fucking,

2186
02:10:15,671 --> 02:10:19,560
it's an amazing place to live, man.
They live in paradise. They live there.

2187
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:24,520
They're on an island that's created by
a volcano in the middle of the ocean and

2188
02:10:24,521 --> 02:10:29,140
it's fucking gorgeous. It's so pretty.

2189
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:33,890
What was just crazy? They show in
the water. Uh, we saw a lot of, um,

2190
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:37,130
a lot of dolphins, man, [inaudible]
spinner spinner dolphins,

2191
02:10:37,131 --> 02:10:40,310
I guess they call them. I guess that's
what kind of dolphins they were.

2192
02:10:40,311 --> 02:10:45,170
I don't remember what kind of dolphins.
Um, but back in December we saw whales.

2193
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:47,510
That was awesome. That's amazing man.

2194
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:51,230
You see fucking whales breach
the surface of water. Like whoa,

2195
02:10:51,890 --> 02:10:56,510
Wild Ben just out there in boats and he
look for his splashes in the distance

2196
02:10:56,850 --> 02:11:00,530
and then we saw them that big schools
a dolphins, they swim under your boat.

2197
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,680
It's wild shit man. You know,

2198
02:11:03,681 --> 02:11:08,681
cause they're just these crazy sea
mammals that are super intelligent,

2199
02:11:09,650 --> 02:11:13,250
live in the water right off.
Went off the coast. I mean,

2200
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:17,780
that said it's such a paradise
because what Hawaii has it? No,

2201
02:11:17,910 --> 02:11:22,520
the place does is it's fully surrounded
by the most beautiful, pristine water.

2202
02:11:22,670 --> 02:11:24,440
There's no shit beaches on Hawaii.

2203
02:11:24,441 --> 02:11:29,240
It's all gorgeous water and then
scuba G. Yeah. No, he snorkeled.

2204
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:33,140
Okay, so when you went to no, no.
That's kids the fuck out of me though.

2205
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:36,850
I Wa that scares the fuck out of me.
Shock. Scare the fuck out. Okay guys,

2206
02:11:36,851 --> 02:11:41,600
you got killed. I love you. Thank you.
I love you too. I am fucking point.

2207
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:44,870
I am petrified. I don't
know by you shouldn't do.

2208
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:49,960
I grew up in a bar like I still remember
my mom taking me to coloniality though.

2209
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:55,400
Being a little kid, getting
a hot dog. I got both times.

2210
02:11:55,401 --> 02:11:59,750
I went to Coney island. I had drama
the first time I went to Coney island,

2211
02:11:59,751 --> 02:12:03,650
I got caught. Now. What's
the, when the undertone.

2212
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:07,570
Yeah. Yeah. Where you, you were at, you
go out and you're on your waist. Yeah.

2213
02:12:07,610 --> 02:12:09,380
I mean you were playing. Yeah.

2214
02:12:09,420 --> 02:12:12,510
We look at our parents and they're
two miles away. It's very dangerous.

2215
02:12:12,511 --> 02:12:16,250
I sold the fucking life guards. I had
to be five, maybe five, maybe four.

2216
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:20,380
I was my first experience in Coney
island. Second experience in Coney Island.

2217
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:23,510
They all, my cousins were jumping
up and down. I'll never forget it,

2218
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:27,340
how to be hot, like those hot
days. We ran in, you know,

2219
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:30,770
with swimming around and all of a sudden
we look up and there was the biggest

2220
02:12:30,771 --> 02:12:31,604
piece of shit.

2221
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:36,170
It was 1314 inches
spinning around the beach,

2222
02:12:36,410 --> 02:12:40,640
just floating past us, walking
out and telling my mom,

2223
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:41,990
I'm never going back.

2224
02:12:41,991 --> 02:12:45,290
That was the last time I went to Coney
island and then I went to Jersey and I

2225
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:46,940
went to the beach and I loved it.

2226
02:12:47,390 --> 02:12:52,390
Everything was Hunky Dory and it started
here about 2003 I went down to the

2227
02:12:53,841 --> 02:12:58,760
beach and when we got there that
got in, the lifeguard walks over,

2228
02:12:58,761 --> 02:13:01,760
you know after you smoke a fucking
joint, you got the SPF on you.

2229
02:13:02,270 --> 02:13:06,470
The guy comes over and he goes to
the beach. Isn't closed officially,

2230
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:09,650
but there's been a couple
shark sightings this morning.

2231
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:13,460
So if you go into the wall,
I just want you to know,

2232
02:13:13,461 --> 02:13:15,260
let me know and wave over at me.

2233
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:20,600
This is when you come up here and you
make the right turn down. Uh, you know,

2234
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:22,330
I don't know. Anyways,

2235
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:27,260
it's the other way of going down to the
beach after four or five way to sunset

2236
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:30,740
and you get off. It's the other way.
What Canyon did you go down? Topanga.

2237
02:13:30,810 --> 02:13:33,870
Topanga. Canyon. Do It on that?
Yeah, that time we got right there.

2238
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:38,580
As soon as we landed, had to
be 2003, 2002 the guys set up,

2239
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:42,870
it's not close, but they'd been
seeing the couple spots are tiny.

2240
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:47,700
I always try to go in the ocean. I'm
Cuban. My mother loved the beach.

2241
02:13:47,701 --> 02:13:51,030
We always went. Every time
I go to the beach, I go,

2242
02:13:51,031 --> 02:13:54,600
what the fuck is wrong
with me? And I buckle up.

2243
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:57,390
I take four steps, I dip in,

2244
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:02,490
and then I walk out a little bit.
And once I start bouncing, I go on.

2245
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:05,730
Then I take a couple of
strokes. Joe, I feel great.

2246
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:09,330
And as soon as one of those
fucking things touch my foot.

2247
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:13,830
You never see a fat motherfucker
run as quick as you see.

2248
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:16,710
I just run out straight and that's it.

2249
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:19,710
I put my SPF on and I
don't go back on the water.

2250
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:21,990
I go in just to refresh myself.

2251
02:14:22,530 --> 02:14:25,230
Did you see the fucking great wines
they saw sold the coast, the jersey,

2252
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:27,330
the one that bit the guides and
stuff, fish when he's bringing,

2253
02:14:27,490 --> 02:14:31,920
did you see that unbelief? That's not
normal brother. I grew up in Jersey.

2254
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:36,810
There's always been sharks,
but not great whites like that.

2255
02:14:37,650 --> 02:14:39,060
Great whites started.

2256
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:43,410
The first time I ever saw
a shark was in Montauk.

2257
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:47,940
Montauk is next to amity where
they really shot. George.

2258
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:51,930
Charles is supposed to be hammering
on one of those. If you look,

2259
02:14:51,950 --> 02:14:55,290
I don't know what correctly
it is when they shot George,

2260
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:57,690
it's supposed to be the
coast of fucking Long Island,

2261
02:14:58,530 --> 02:15:01,770
but if anybody knew when I was a kid,
I used to go to Montauk all the time.

2262
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:04,170
That beach was no boy, no dog.

2263
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:07,260
You'd be on the beach and a
fucking crab would walk up to you.

2264
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:12,180
They walked back with business cheese.
This is unheard of guys. Come on.

2265
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:16,380
That's just biting their bully. Is that
what that is? Is that a sack of meat?

2266
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:22,320
They're chumming it other chumming.
Why is it biting that thing then?

2267
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:26,490
Is that definitely what's going on?
What is the on that rope back there? Oh,

2268
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:28,650
it sort of ripped it apart. Oh yeah.

2269
02:15:28,651 --> 02:15:32,700
Look there's salmon filets
2000 pounds or a fish. Fish.

2270
02:15:32,701 --> 02:15:35,120
Filets they think

2271
02:15:35,130 --> 02:15:37,710
the shark was 2000 pounds.
Sorry to stop. Stop doing this.

2272
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:41,490
Cause it's hard for me to tell
what's going on. Okay. They dangled,

2273
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:45,260
so what is it biting? What is that
yellow thing? It's like that. Oh,

2274
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:48,630
buoy or something? Yeah, it looks
like it. But why would it bite a buoy?

2275
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:52,890
It's a fucking animal. But you see
how they have that piece of fish?

2276
02:15:52,891 --> 02:15:54,120
They were dangling in the water.

2277
02:15:54,150 --> 02:15:58,620
It seemed to me like they were
trying to earn that, but that would,

2278
02:15:58,621 --> 02:16:03,450
that fish, it was already filleted so
it's like the body, the head and the tail.

2279
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:07,410
It seemed to me like they're putting
that in the water to attract sharks.

2280
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:11,220
I bet they know a spot where sharks
see, see what I'm talking about? See,

2281
02:16:11,221 --> 02:16:13,080
that's the part of the fish
that you can't, you know?

2282
02:16:13,081 --> 02:16:17,670
It's like he's got it opened up like a
filet and they're dragging it through the

2283
02:16:17,671 --> 02:16:19,380
water, I think to try to attract them.

2284
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:23,110
Maybe they saw it and they're like,
let's see if we can get a close on. Yeah,

2285
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:27,720
maybe. Right? Yeah. Fuck Shit.
Nevermind. Get it away. Throw it. Yeah.

2286
02:16:27,721 --> 02:16:29,870
See they're throwing that
in the water. I don't know.

2287
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:33,850
Definitely try to bring them closer
to the boat. I don't give a fuck them.

2288
02:16:33,851 --> 02:16:35,080
They put a leg in the water,

2289
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:40,110
looked at the size of that fucking
thing off the coast of Jersey.

2290
02:16:40,950 --> 02:16:43,240
That's what makes you want
to scratch your fucking head.

2291
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:47,950
That a week later our seal attack,
the girl in the California beach,

2292
02:16:48,650 --> 02:16:49,600
a seal.

2293
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:53,860
I saw one where a seal grabbed a girl's
leg and pulled her into the water off a

2294
02:16:53,861 --> 02:16:56,980
dock. That was a different one. This
is another, this is another one,

2295
02:16:57,310 --> 02:16:59,560
and they're blaming it on
a chemical in the ocean.

2296
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:04,960
Hello knocks or something like that
that wants to seals. Uh, get that in.

2297
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:08,890
Look at this girl. How she got dragged
in. Cause look at this. Look at this.

2298
02:17:08,891 --> 02:17:09,724
My brother.

2299
02:17:11,250 --> 02:17:12,083
Oh my God.

2300
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:17,680
Oh my God. Yeah. Don't fuck that.
Why something's going on. Shit.

2301
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:23,710
Holy Shit Bro.

2302
02:17:23,770 --> 02:17:26,890
I think the climate change
is everywhere. It's all over.

2303
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:30,160
And the flag is that every
toll that thing car like wow,

2304
02:17:30,161 --> 02:17:31,870
that's crazy that they
got it on video too.

2305
02:17:31,871 --> 02:17:34,030
It just jumps up and
bites her fucking leg.

2306
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:38,930
Maybe to pay back to this week. The dogs

2307
02:17:40,670 --> 02:17:44,460
trying to get the dog. Yeah. I
don't know what's going on here now.

2308
02:17:44,490 --> 02:17:46,460
It's a big giant shark. Oh Gee.

2309
02:17:46,560 --> 02:17:50,890
And then the rest of the dogs come in to
help its buddy and it sort of stays for

2310
02:17:50,891 --> 02:17:54,550
a second. I thought maybe it had one and
they're trying to get it to release it.

2311
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:58,210
Did it. I don't believe so.
Looking at Jesus Christ,

2312
02:17:59,050 --> 02:18:02,560
that's a really crazy fucking
video. But the dogs are huge also.

2313
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:07,630
There are no other bitch ass dogs like
yes. Be too sharp. Savages like that.

2314
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:11,410
That's a fucking shark, bro. No
dog. You gotta be very careful.

2315
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:12,640
You gotta be very careful.

2316
02:18:12,641 --> 02:18:16,750
Now something's going on and you have to
do think the world's coming to an end.

2317
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:20,740
Not at all. What do you think?
How many Bravo fuck the world.

2318
02:18:20,741 --> 02:18:23,200
We got whistling and Dick
until something happens.

2319
02:18:23,201 --> 02:18:26,980
But we'll make all these shark attacks,

2320
02:18:27,310 --> 02:18:30,580
especially on the east coast the last
three weeks. Well, here's one thing,

2321
02:18:30,581 --> 02:18:34,900
especially on the east coast, one thing
could be lack of food, right? I mean,

2322
02:18:34,901 --> 02:18:36,820
they overfish the fuck out of the ocean.

2323
02:18:36,821 --> 02:18:39,160
People know for a fact
that that's a real problem.

2324
02:18:39,310 --> 02:18:42,310
That's a real problem over
fishing's a giant problem.

2325
02:18:42,311 --> 02:18:45,970
They're worried that the ocean fish in
some parts of the world will literally be

2326
02:18:45,971 --> 02:18:49,150
extinct. There'll be nothing
left and 50 60 a hundred years.

2327
02:18:49,151 --> 02:18:51,010
Who knows if they don't
clean up their act,

2328
02:18:51,011 --> 02:18:53,630
but you'll see the way they
do with commercial nets. Just,

2329
02:18:53,631 --> 02:18:56,500
just throw those fucking
things in and just insane.

2330
02:18:56,501 --> 02:19:00,130
Wide Nets just scooping up
everything and then they,

2331
02:19:00,270 --> 02:19:03,240
they get all these fish and they dump
them in the huddle of the boat and it's,

2332
02:19:04,090 --> 02:19:06,850
it's crazy how much fish they
kill. It's crazy how much,

2333
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:08,620
what a desire for fish we all have.

2334
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:14,050
But if sharks run out of shit to eat and
then the seals run out of shit to eat,

2335
02:19:14,051 --> 02:19:18,070
the sharks start running out of seals
when they start going after people.

2336
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:23,630
What do seals eat? That's a good
question. I don't imagine they eat fish.

2337
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:24,873
Yeah,

2338
02:19:26,890 --> 02:19:29,720
right. Here's goal. Yeah.
Seals up in San Francisco.

2339
02:19:29,721 --> 02:19:31,490
We're getting killed by sharks.

2340
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:37,200
We have such a eye level at such a high
level that I guy was on a surfboard and

2341
02:19:40,281 --> 02:19:42,440
I couldn't imagine why the shark bit them.

2342
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:47,520
And then they looked into it and they
said from underneath the shark just sees

2343
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:49,990
they see us. I'll see you. Yeah. Yeah.

2344
02:19:50,140 --> 02:19:53,690
Was a crazy video of a shark taking a
seal out out on this one right here.

2345
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:57,740
Right in front of all these people
on the, on the Marina, the Alcatraz,

2346
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:01,700
Alcatraz. Okay. Watch this. Back it
up a little bit. What's the splatter?

2347
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:04,670
The shark just jacks his fucking
seal right in front of everybody.

2348
02:20:04,671 --> 02:20:07,730
They're all looking out. Watch
this. Boom. Look at all that blood.

2349
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:14,240
And everybody's like, what the
fuck? So oil slick a blood.

2350
02:20:14,241 --> 02:20:18,290
The shark comes out of the
water with the seal. I mean,

2351
02:20:18,291 --> 02:20:21,170
look at that blood that is madness.

2352
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:27,170
Bright Red Blotch and a fucking huge
shark destroying a seal in front of

2353
02:20:27,171 --> 02:20:31,340
everybody just to let you
know, that's their world.

2354
02:20:32,020 --> 02:20:36,560
There is monsters right there. It's
just they can't get out of the water.

2355
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:36,861
I mean,

2356
02:20:36,861 --> 02:20:40,340
imagine if that was like right next to
the woods and you know that if he didn't

2357
02:20:40,341 --> 02:20:43,100
go into the woods, you'd be okay.
But if you did go into the woods,

2358
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:48,280
there's a giant gray thing that moves
30 miles an hour that just bite the legs

2359
02:20:48,441 --> 02:20:52,160
and arms off of everything it runs
into. Is that what the village was?

2360
02:20:52,161 --> 02:20:54,620
They scared them from going into the
woods because something's going to kill

2361
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:58,130
them if they, yeah, they,
they'll, they put on a, a costume.

2362
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:01,580
The village was about a bunch of people
that didn't know that it was like 2000

2363
02:21:01,581 --> 02:21:05,720
and [inaudible] they're going
to die by something. Yeah,

2364
02:21:05,721 --> 02:21:09,740
they scared them with some costume
or some shit. Right. Giant Shark.

2365
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:11,900
But that's what it's like when
you're sitting on the dock.

2366
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:15,560
They're looking out at that shark
fucking up, that seal in the water.

2367
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:18,230
It's right there. I mean
you could just jump in.

2368
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:21,050
I mean it is sort of like
being at the edge of the woods,

2369
02:21:21,051 --> 02:21:25,010
watching some mythical monster tear apart.

2370
02:21:25,130 --> 02:21:27,920
A creature in front of you. We
spoke when you went Hawaiian.

2371
02:21:27,921 --> 02:21:30,990
That's the first thing I said
to you though. I'm looking
out for the sharks dog.

2372
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:36,290
I'm worried about nothing happened were
fun and they got hammerheads down there.

2373
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:39,590
Well there's a lot of tiger
sharks, tiger sharks bite people.

2374
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:43,940
Bull sharks are apparently the most
dangerous and they are the weird ones

2375
02:21:43,941 --> 02:21:45,470
because they go to freshwater,

2376
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:49,190
they'll go like they found bull
sharks way up near Illinois,

2377
02:21:49,470 --> 02:21:51,380
like near Chicago on rivers,

2378
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:55,640
bull sharks getting fresh water and
swim all the way up the river. In fact,

2379
02:21:56,090 --> 02:22:00,590
Johns was actually inspired by bull
sharks that bit people over like a

2380
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:03,560
successive couple of days in New Jersey,

2381
02:22:04,100 --> 02:22:08,780
in a river in New Jersey. That's
the actual original story.

2382
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:12,920
That inspired jaws came
from shark attacks and like,

2383
02:22:14,090 --> 02:22:18,710
I want to say like maybe the 50s or some
shit like that that were near a river

2384
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:22,470
in New Jersey. Freshwater river,
speaking on the New Jersey.

2385
02:22:22,510 --> 02:22:25,100
Something I want to show you, see
if he could find that story. Jamie.

2386
02:22:25,660 --> 02:22:30,150
I know there's been sharks sippy river.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly the same.

2387
02:22:30,151 --> 02:22:33,180
Same kind of story. Yeah,
exactly. They can go way up.

2388
02:22:33,210 --> 02:22:37,980
They can survive in fresh water. The bull
sharks are a, they're a weird animal.

2389
02:22:38,490 --> 02:22:42,090
I think that monster guy that, that
television show river monsters, that dude,

2390
02:22:42,091 --> 02:22:45,660
that cool guy. I think that
guy, uh, caught one somewhere,

2391
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:47,370
if I remember correctly,

2392
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:51,180
that guy that used to hang out with
wildboys Steve-o and Chris Pontius Manny,

2393
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:55,230
he got into that water in the bay at
San Francisco with like 200 bull sharks.

2394
02:22:55,231 --> 02:22:58,960
The footage of it is fucking crazy. Oh
my God. He's like, you seem so insane.

2395
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:02,760
There's no cage and
nothing, nothing. Mama CBOE.

2396
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:05,940
How about when Steven was on that fucking
tree and the lions jumped up in the

2397
02:23:05,941 --> 02:23:08,840
tree to be with them? Like
what the fuck's on there?

2398
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:11,430
T they took his hat from him,
took his hat off his head and like

2399
02:23:11,480 --> 02:23:15,890
what? What, what, what?

2400
02:23:16,400 --> 02:23:18,200
Like he was inches from death.

2401
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:23,060
One of your fans sent me an article
for you about six months ago.

2402
02:23:23,061 --> 02:23:26,750
Really interesting. I got it
somewhere. My phone to gets on toilet.

2403
02:23:27,770 --> 02:23:31,100
So Rocky Balboa, rocky mountain more so.

2404
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:36,540
Vesta alone was a young guy and he went
into a gym in Bayonne because he wanted

2405
02:23:37,461 --> 02:23:42,350
Chuck Wepner owners trainer to
train him. But Chuck Wepner,

2406
02:23:42,530 --> 02:23:46,910
his Tryna told him to fuck off because
so investors, that alone had done porn

2407
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:53,560
social vessel salon the way out stole
chuck weapon's notebook that he wrote in

2408
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:56,700
and that's,

2409
02:23:56,700 --> 02:24:01,490
we took the idea for rocky
is a true attribute here.

2410
02:24:01,491 --> 02:24:03,330
This, I never heard that there's isn't,

2411
02:24:03,460 --> 02:24:08,050
maybe it's true despite the fact that
still Sloan was sued by Wepner in 2003 for

2412
02:24:08,051 --> 02:24:09,460
using his story for rocky.

2413
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:13,600
He ultimately settled for an undisclosed
amount of money in 2006 according to

2414
02:24:13,601 --> 02:24:14,230
Forbes,

2415
02:24:14,230 --> 02:24:18,190
seems to be in good spirit about whitners
tale being told on the big screen and

2416
02:24:18,191 --> 02:24:22,240
an interview with deadline chuck producer
Mike toll and said this Stallone was

2417
02:24:22,241 --> 02:24:26,110
supportive of everyone involved reading
the script and even showing up on set.

2418
02:24:26,410 --> 02:24:29,740
He and live had positive
dialogue during shooting.

2419
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:31,890
Totally about check about it,

2420
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:33,820
chuck. Hmm.

2421
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:38,640
Um, that's weird that he's
used his story for rocky.

2422
02:24:38,641 --> 02:24:43,641
So the idea was that he uses story when
Chuck Wepner fought Muhammad Ali based

2423
02:24:44,371 --> 02:24:47,160
on, nobody kind of makes sense
that that would be based on,

2424
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:51,630
cause Carl weathers was Kinda like a
Muhammad Ali character and rocky Balbo was

2425
02:24:51,830 --> 02:24:56,380
Kinda like chuck Webster. But if I
remember that fight correctly, I mean,

2426
02:24:56,460 --> 02:24:59,190
I remember Muhammad Ali beating
the shit out of Chuck Wepner.

2427
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:02,860
I don't remember it being like
a close fight like they made,

2428
02:25:02,861 --> 02:25:05,660
didn't they make that
fight or draw wasn't rocky.

2429
02:25:05,870 --> 02:25:10,230
He would draw the Muhammad Ali knocked
him out. Chuck weapon low down.

2430
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:13,380
He beat him. He beat him up. They
beat him up. He didn't knock him out.

2431
02:25:13,470 --> 02:25:15,980
But I think he went, I
think he went 12 round men.

2432
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:19,000
That might've been 15 rounds my thing
back when they were doing 15 rounds,

2433
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:23,980
matter of fact, I think it
did. I think if I remember

2434
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,930
correctly, it went to distance. But again,

2435
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:30,430
my boxing knowledge is not like my
MMA knowledge. It's like B level.

2436
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:32,043
What year was that?

2437
02:25:32,470 --> 02:25:36,550
1975 it was built as the
give the white guy a break

2438
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:40,773
[inaudible]

2439
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:45,730
oh my God, that's hilarious. They
should've done that in rocky.

2440
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:50,200
He's knocked out in the 15th round. Okay.
15th row. So that's what I'm saying.

2441
02:25:50,230 --> 02:25:52,900
It wasn't like rocky, rocky.

2442
02:25:52,901 --> 02:25:56,230
The story of rocky is this guy
who actually was a good fighter,

2443
02:25:56,231 --> 02:25:57,760
but you just never focused himself,

2444
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:01,720
decides to focus himself for this
preposterous opportunity to fight for the

2445
02:26:01,721 --> 02:26:04,180
title and actually hurts
them actually hurts him.

2446
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:06,730
And that's a draw at the end of the fight.

2447
02:26:06,731 --> 02:26:09,280
It's a crazy fucking war
and turns out to be a draw.

2448
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:12,520
That was not chuck Wepner story. I mean,

2449
02:26:12,521 --> 02:26:16,300
unless they use part of
Chuck Wepner his life. Yeah.

2450
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:18,220
He might have been,

2451
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:22,660
might have his may be some truth to
that fucking story maybe. And stolen.

2452
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:26,350
There's always been known to
have a sticky fingers. He stuck.

2453
02:26:26,490 --> 02:26:29,360
You're filling the expendables.
That was Eddie students. Yup.

2454
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:32,380
And that used to take them
back. There was in those days,

2455
02:26:33,070 --> 02:26:35,770
that's what they did right. For
people. But people don't know is,

2456
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:38,890
there's a couple people who do
that. They meet with a guy, Jamie,

2457
02:26:38,891 --> 02:26:42,890
I hate doing James. I got an idea. But
like I moved back to Columbus also.

2458
02:26:43,130 --> 02:26:46,280
The Lady Jamie turns the TV on
and there's this story on TV.

2459
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:49,510
Jamie takes him to court
and wins even has the notes.

2460
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:54,490
The appointment that his agent made for
him to meet Stallone Austin Long has to

2461
02:26:54,820 --> 02:26:56,440
shell him now is for the
amount of the script.

2462
02:26:56,441 --> 02:26:59,890
He doesn't have to give him
proceeds of what he made. Yeah.

2463
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:05,410
So it's a tremendous scam if you do it
and get away with it. I've listened.

2464
02:27:05,411 --> 02:27:07,720
I'm not bad mountain alone.
Let me tell you some,

2465
02:27:09,070 --> 02:27:10,620
every time those Rockies come on,

2466
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:15,630
I watch those fucking things and I am
more and more baffled that they kind of

2467
02:27:15,761 --> 02:27:16,720
still hold up.

2468
02:27:17,620 --> 02:27:21,790
And what's really baffling about
the Rockies is they keep on coming.

2469
02:27:23,230 --> 02:27:26,710
I mean, you know, they're
writing another one, creed crazy.

2470
02:27:26,711 --> 02:27:28,650
Now they've got Michael
B. Jordan. Yeah. You know,

2471
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:32,350
did you see the video of Michael
B. Jordan going through that?

2472
02:27:32,351 --> 02:27:36,250
A tactical course? It's
fucking bad ass, man.

2473
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:37,990
I don't know what movie
he's preparing for.

2474
02:27:38,230 --> 02:27:41,710
Please prepare for some fucking crazy
crazy shooting up movie. I guess.

2475
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:43,810
You know, I did the heron tactical.

2476
02:27:43,930 --> 02:27:48,930
I did this thing with our boy and I didn't
know like my boy was John Brenton was

2477
02:27:49,421 --> 02:27:51,790
telling me that after movies he does,

2478
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:54,700
you got to go there at six
months before the Joe Rogan.

2479
02:27:55,330 --> 02:27:57,700
He's going through one of these
courses like John Wick style.

2480
02:27:58,270 --> 02:28:00,880
You've got to go through
six months of this.

2481
02:28:01,270 --> 02:28:03,760
It says it's a with for Black Panther.

2482
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:06,910
So this was when he was in that movie
Black Panther. So he's preparing for it.

2483
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:11,080
She's a bunch of guns in
that movie though. So, I
don't know. Make sense? Yeah.

2484
02:28:11,081 --> 02:28:13,630
He did shoot a lot of guns in that
movie. Yeah, he was mercenary.

2485
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:15,550
Don't you remember Michael B?

2486
02:28:15,551 --> 02:28:19,120
Jordan was a killer and
that movie remember the hand
to hand fight. So I guess,

2487
02:28:19,210 --> 02:28:21,740
yeah, well there was that
too, but I'm sure there was

2488
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:26,300
some gunfights and just to be able to
handle it and look and look like this,

2489
02:28:26,301 --> 02:28:27,200
look like, I mean,

2490
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:30,680
I don't know enough about shooting
to know if this looks good.

2491
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:33,140
It looks good to me though.
You know what I'm saying?

2492
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:38,750
Or if you watch like Tom Cruise
and collateral [inaudible]
when he goes into the

2493
02:28:38,751 --> 02:28:41,780
Japanese bond in Korea
town or whatever it is,

2494
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:46,170
he's using tactical shooting. Right?
Like it's real tactical. Yeah.

2495
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:49,130
I always knew that time cruisers
and the ultimate professional, he,

2496
02:28:49,131 --> 02:28:52,640
that's why he gets 20 80
million a movie, the whole deal.

2497
02:28:52,641 --> 02:28:56,060
But when I talked to her
boy, he was telling me, Nah,

2498
02:28:56,090 --> 02:28:59,060
that all these movies now
you go over there five,

2499
02:28:59,061 --> 02:29:02,880
six months before the movie
starts and it's, you know,

2500
02:29:02,990 --> 02:29:06,620
eight hours of training. I mean you got
to give it up for your boy John Wick.

2501
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,280
Oh yeah, he's 56 he's doing
five hours a day Jujitsu.

2502
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:14,570
He's doing Jujitsu and he, there's
a bunch of scenes of him doing that,

2503
02:29:14,770 --> 02:29:18,730
so he did it with the Henry rifle, one
of those Henry old school western rifle,

2504
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:21,020
sh bang. What are those called?

2505
02:29:21,430 --> 02:29:23,780
You know those little load
them up ones where you,

2506
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:27,200
I don't let her rest down to
reload memory. When we were kids,

2507
02:29:27,201 --> 02:29:30,860
we had those in the middle. You
pumped them to strongly BB, your shot,

2508
02:29:30,861 --> 02:29:34,670
your grandmother, you pumped it
like 80 times. If you hate it,

2509
02:29:34,671 --> 02:29:38,230
the mother Fucker, you start pumping
that bitch at like six in the morning.

2510
02:29:38,350 --> 02:29:41,450
You get all full. That was
the ultimate dangerous.

2511
02:29:41,451 --> 02:29:43,970
Who happened to give to a kid a
fucking beat. We had everything.

2512
02:29:43,971 --> 02:29:47,740
We had one of the, remember
the risks rockets, rockets,

2513
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:51,790
was that what I call those
tubes? Surgical tube. Oh my God.

2514
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:56,630
I had a friend that lived on the second
floor and he would just peg off kids as

2515
02:29:56,631 --> 02:30:00,720
they were walking home from school,
Ritchie vantage checking God.

2516
02:30:00,830 --> 02:30:03,350
He was in school too. So he
would run home from school,

2517
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:06,920
go on his fucking on his
second third floor attic,

2518
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:10,550
lay on the floor like a
mercenary and just shoot kids.

2519
02:30:10,551 --> 02:30:14,750
They couldn't invest in him. My God.
How funny was he? He would put nails,

2520
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:19,040
he would put downs and like
tables like these school.

2521
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:22,130
So when people put their books
down, they get caught by the nail.

2522
02:30:22,131 --> 02:30:23,450
He was just a fucking nut.

2523
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:27,080
Now he's somewhere installing
elevators in Pennsylvania somewhere.

2524
02:30:27,110 --> 02:30:31,160
Who the fuck knows risks? Rockets are
so dangerous. We used to use marbles.

2525
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:36,410
Let's take risks. Rockets buy a bag of
marbles and get a wrist rocket. Oh yeah.

2526
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:39,080
Cause marbles. They fly consistently.

2527
02:30:39,410 --> 02:30:42,770
You can get used to where the trajectory
is gonna go. If you have a rock,

2528
02:30:42,930 --> 02:30:45,730
you know the fuck knows how much that
rock ways you know this rocks everything

2529
02:30:45,770 --> 02:30:48,680
that rock. It's hard to figure out
where the fuck things are going.

2530
02:30:48,890 --> 02:30:52,910
But when you get good with a marble,
you understand they're like right here.

2531
02:30:52,911 --> 02:30:56,750
I kind of can judge the arc of that
marble. You can start nailing things.

2532
02:30:57,140 --> 02:31:00,250
You can start nailing things. And when
you got your first marksman repeatedly,

2533
02:31:00,390 --> 02:31:02,800
you would get the marks from repeat
it. I never had one of those marks.

2534
02:31:03,220 --> 02:31:06,230
Repeat Pallets, B B's and guards.

2535
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:12,110
I had one of those and I was
about eight my mother caught me,

2536
02:31:12,111 --> 02:31:15,170
gave me a beat and I had the
fucking double o seven knife.

2537
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:20,490
That's a knife from the 70s they either
sold them in Newark or in Harlan.

2538
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:23,900
I remember several oh sevens that a
wouldn't handle, wouldn't handle big.

2539
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:27,000
I used to get the paint, the jeans.

2540
02:31:27,270 --> 02:31:29,940
Do you know when I was like
by this third grade, you know,

2541
02:31:29,941 --> 02:31:33,480
I used to shake him down on
the way out and then the way.

2542
02:31:33,481 --> 02:31:37,770
And do you know that? Because
they were worried about, yeah. Oh,

2543
02:31:39,630 --> 02:31:43,170
in the first, second grade before
my mother put me in Catholic school,

2544
02:31:43,380 --> 02:31:48,170
it was called shake down, take socks off.

2545
02:31:48,290 --> 02:31:52,490
Wow. Socks. How much money you went
out with. Does this count? No, no,

2546
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:54,740
that's a marginal repeat. Oh look at it.

2547
02:31:54,741 --> 02:31:58,380
It was BBC pallets and that's
where you put the dots up on top.

2548
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:02,930
You had a lot of fun kids got shot by
the cops. And holding that thing? None.

2549
02:32:03,410 --> 02:32:07,100
What are you talking about? None.
None. None. That's the seventies Nah.

2550
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:10,730
[inaudible] talk to you first
before they shot you in the head.

2551
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:12,920
When did they start to shoot and
they shoot you in the fucking leg?

2552
02:32:12,921 --> 02:32:16,400
Back then they were normal people
because they would neighborhood kids.

2553
02:32:16,910 --> 02:32:19,760
They knows days. The cops
in your neighborhood,

2554
02:32:20,030 --> 02:32:24,140
60% were from that neighborhood,
so they understood the person.

2555
02:32:24,141 --> 02:32:26,660
They understood the kid. They
knew he had mental health.

2556
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:30,980
Now they'll get somebody from Culver
city and put them in San Diego.

2557
02:32:31,370 --> 02:32:33,830
They don't know the area.
When we were growing up,

2558
02:32:33,831 --> 02:32:35,930
especially when you were
staying with your Grandpa,

2559
02:32:35,931 --> 02:32:40,720
newer called those cops grew up
in Newark, the road and stuff.

2560
02:32:40,721 --> 02:32:43,880
Fucking crazy. Don't worry about them.
It's when you go out over the Rogan's,

2561
02:32:44,410 --> 02:32:46,960
you take your gun out. You
don't point it out, right. Joel,

2562
02:32:46,961 --> 02:32:48,560
put the gun down when
you see what I'm saying.

2563
02:32:48,561 --> 02:32:51,800
Like the cops were members of
the community, so they knew,

2564
02:32:51,860 --> 02:32:54,230
so they knew they weren't
going into everything cold.

2565
02:32:54,290 --> 02:32:56,780
They weren't going into everything called
I think the people that have to worry,

2566
02:32:56,781 --> 02:32:59,810
the monster cops that pulled people over
because you just fucking never know.

2567
02:32:59,870 --> 02:33:01,700
You see what happened yesterday? The cop,

2568
02:33:02,090 --> 02:33:04,550
the black dude in North
Carolina or wherever he was,

2569
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:06,920
I don't know where he wasn't,
sorry if it's North Carolina,

2570
02:33:07,730 --> 02:33:11,810
he was smoking a blunt. The cop pulled
him over. He fucking dragged the cop.

2571
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:16,310
Whoa. Grabbed him by the elbow,
Jamie. I know you saw it on the news.

2572
02:33:16,311 --> 02:33:20,240
Dragged them twice. Not once, but twice.

2573
02:33:20,241 --> 02:33:23,660
The cop will try to pull the gun. Then
the cop shot him in the leg. Oh Jesus.

2574
02:33:23,661 --> 02:33:28,250
And he still dropped the cop off and
he got away. Wow. What's out there?

2575
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:30,440
The hole in his leg? Yeah.
No, they finally caught him.

2576
02:33:30,441 --> 02:33:33,200
He went into the ambulance. You
know, I won't get look at this.

2577
02:33:36,670 --> 02:33:40,750
So he's just smoking the blot. Looking
at him right in front of the cop.

2578
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:42,670
The cop said he smoked marijuana.

2579
02:33:46,020 --> 02:33:50,910
So while he's driving off, is
he holding onto them? Yeah. Oh,

2580
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:51,753
the side.

2581
02:33:57,290 --> 02:33:59,480
So the guy tried to
drive off and he hung on.

2582
02:33:59,510 --> 02:34:02,570
It looks like he hung onto
the car. Am I correct there?

2583
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:09,600
I don't know. I don't know. I
can get the audio. That's um,

2584
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:14,100
when you, uh, seeds reaching for his
gun, now look at what now look at that.

2585
02:34:15,420 --> 02:34:17,740
Those bullets. Yeah.

2586
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,280
I mean, just driving off with them in
the car. He just dumped from the edge.

2587
02:34:21,281 --> 02:34:22,960
I Rogo Shit. What?

2588
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:27,370
He just doesn't there and that
got fell over on the dirt.

2589
02:34:27,400 --> 02:34:30,550
He probably fucked himself. He
fucked himself up. That poor guy.

2590
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:35,500
So was he holding on? So it's
like when the car takes off,

2591
02:34:35,530 --> 02:34:38,530
like what is he doing? It looks like
he's holding on, said escalate Joe Rogan.

2592
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:43,240
I can't tell. So it usually has like it.
Yes. So they usually have that panel.

2593
02:34:43,320 --> 02:34:46,810
Who along the side where you put your
leg up if you see standing on it.

2594
02:34:46,840 --> 02:34:49,960
That's what I think is going on. But
he's holding onto the window too.

2595
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:51,770
It looks like he's trying to hold it.

2596
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:55,210
Let's say he's got his arm in
by this time he's got his lies.

2597
02:34:55,720 --> 02:34:59,110
He's holding onto a seatbelt
put up there. Right there.

2598
02:34:59,470 --> 02:35:02,230
He's holding onto his seatbelt.
Yeah. No it is. Look at him.

2599
02:35:02,350 --> 02:35:05,300
Look at his seatbelt. That is what he has
in his hand. Oh, that is what he said.

2600
02:35:05,350 --> 02:35:08,500
Oh yeah, that's it. That's what he
has. So he's holding the seatbelt, man.

2601
02:35:08,710 --> 02:35:12,420
She got his fucking gun out
and shoots the guy. Not yet.

2602
02:35:12,990 --> 02:35:15,730
Then he goes to grab for his gun.
It's that when he shoots him,

2603
02:35:17,330 --> 02:35:20,240
cause the dude does look like
he at one point in time, man,

2604
02:35:20,241 --> 02:35:22,760
leave me the fuck alone.
Look at his grill.

2605
02:35:22,820 --> 02:35:24,980
I'm just trying to smoke
my motherfucking blunt.

2606
02:35:25,010 --> 02:35:27,950
What is going on with his teeth? Is
that like some kind of iced out grill?

2607
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:32,810
I don't know. Now that's when he
starts out. Boom. He shoots him. Wow.

2608
02:35:33,020 --> 02:35:36,130
But Ellie, he at least he shot him in
the leg and not in the no. Right, right,

2609
02:35:36,131 --> 02:35:38,450
right. But the whole
thing seems rather crazy.

2610
02:35:41,590 --> 02:35:46,590
He's hanging on with just a gun by Dash
Cam shows Florida man driving of course

2611
02:35:48,930 --> 02:35:49,763
from Florida.

2612
02:35:49,970 --> 02:35:53,740
Draft it off for the deputy dragging
from his car after a traffic stop.

2613
02:35:53,741 --> 02:35:57,490
The man is now facing an
attempted murder charge. But okay.

2614
02:35:58,090 --> 02:36:01,960
Was he dragging the car
or was the guy hanging on?

2615
02:36:03,610 --> 02:36:07,630
He was the guy hanging on while he's
trying to drive off. Was that the same

2616
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:13,690
I guess? Yeah, but I mean, I don't know
if he told you to stop, you can't go.

2617
02:36:13,691 --> 02:36:16,600
So like he can't just drive
away and just drive away.

2618
02:36:17,320 --> 02:36:20,770
Once the car starts moving
and he's hanging onto the
door, you are dragging him?

2619
02:36:21,130 --> 02:36:24,490
Yeah, so he's hanging onto the
seatbelt and they're dragging him.

2620
02:36:25,210 --> 02:36:28,370
What should matter? You got a
hundred fucking stitches. Whether

2621
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:31,990
the guys walked around
with a bandage slate.

2622
02:36:32,140 --> 02:36:35,470
The dude who got pulled over though,
he's hilarious. Play that again.

2623
02:36:36,010 --> 02:36:38,410
His reaction, he just
keeps puffing on the blunt,

2624
02:36:41,230 --> 02:36:43,600
put them back. I look at him, he
goes, I smelled marijuana man.

2625
02:36:43,601 --> 02:36:47,200
What are you talking about? What?
Look at him. He's hilarious.

2626
02:36:47,201 --> 02:36:48,250
He's right out of a movie

2627
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:54,640
like he's just so sparkly. Are they?
Is He have a grill on? Can you tell?

2628
02:36:55,300 --> 02:36:59,530
It looks like he's got some kind of ice
step grill. Am I imagining that again?

2629
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:04,060
Tell Joe Rogan what his name is. Rocco
rakochy. He's got a wild name too.

2630
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:09,340
That is hilarious. The
whole thing is so funny.

2631
02:37:10,510 --> 02:37:11,040
Okay.

2632
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:15,180
I hope the cops, okay. Rocky money.
That's his name. His name is rocky money.

2633
02:37:15,230 --> 02:37:16,160
I told you it off.

2634
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:20,360
Yeah. Rocky money booed
off. Damn. Cops done lit up.

2635
02:37:20,361 --> 02:37:24,590
Rocky morning money. Rudolph Julia
to boot. Oh, that's hilarious.

2636
02:37:26,510 --> 02:37:28,940
The best name I've seen
in 14 years on the job.

2637
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:39,230
Yeah, that's about as good as
the name. Rocky money. Rudolph.

2638
02:37:39,231 --> 02:37:43,430
That poor cow went to work yesterday
with a positive attitude and it gets

2639
02:37:43,431 --> 02:37:44,264
fucking drag.

2640
02:37:44,550 --> 02:37:46,920
They say smoking a black and mild
in the cops. Like I smell weed news.

2641
02:37:46,930 --> 02:37:50,460
I don't have weed. I don't have
marijuana. So was it just the cigar?

2642
02:37:50,970 --> 02:37:52,560
That's what he says. He said
it's just a black and mild.

2643
02:37:53,220 --> 02:37:55,860
It's a very distinct smell between
a black and mild and marijuana.

2644
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:59,550
Well maybe if you're some
goofy cop and busy and low. No,

2645
02:37:59,551 --> 02:38:04,110
but I think it's marijuana. Pull them out
of there. What do you think it smells?

2646
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:07,070
What does, what does a black and mild
smell like? Is that what it's called?

2647
02:38:07,090 --> 02:38:10,970
Black and mild. What does
it smell actually wrong
compared to smoking, but yeah,

2648
02:38:10,980 --> 02:38:12,660
it's a very strange, the distinct smell.

2649
02:38:12,661 --> 02:38:16,200
You can tell it between any cigar and
a black and mind. You can pick it out.

2650
02:38:16,710 --> 02:38:20,460
See, I don't know that. What if I
had become a cop and I smelled that?

2651
02:38:20,960 --> 02:38:22,890
Would I have to know what a
black and mild smells like?

2652
02:38:23,370 --> 02:38:25,650
He might've thought it was drugs. I was
like, weed. What does it smell like?

2653
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:30,060
Thick cigarettes. Tobacco. A smoke?
Yeah. It doesn't smell anything.

2654
02:38:30,061 --> 02:38:31,380
Like weed smells. Great

2655
02:38:33,050 --> 02:38:36,010
pipes. I got a nice, it's close. Yeah.

2656
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:41,450
Isn't it interesting that like the
smell of tobacco from cigarettes?

2657
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:44,900
It's Kinda gross smell from a cigar.

2658
02:38:44,930 --> 02:38:47,360
Not that bad smell from a pipe.

2659
02:38:47,390 --> 02:38:51,590
A lot of people like that smell like
a lot of people like, like kids,

2660
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:56,480
like the smell of pipes smells like
some tobacco burning in a pipe actually

2661
02:38:56,481 --> 02:39:00,410
smells good. Weird. I
like the smell of weed.

2662
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:04,520
Fuck all this shit. That pipe
that bag in it. Yeah. Those,

2663
02:39:04,570 --> 02:39:08,330
the older guys used to that
smoke around them much. I know.

2664
02:39:08,331 --> 02:39:11,820
If it was nothing may not makes a real,
but what I'm saying [inaudible] drug.

2665
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:16,400
When I was younger,
when I was in my teens,

2666
02:39:16,460 --> 02:39:19,930
it felt like people were smoking
more pipes at all the schools.

2667
02:39:20,620 --> 02:39:23,840
A t there was a teacher in my
grandma's schools smoked a pipe.

2668
02:39:24,530 --> 02:39:27,830
I still remember a teacher from my
high school vividly smoking a pipe.

2669
02:39:28,490 --> 02:39:30,260
I haven't seen anybody smoke with pipe.

2670
02:39:30,261 --> 02:39:32,120
And Steven Crowder gave
me one that's right here.

2671
02:39:32,121 --> 02:39:33,370
I smoked him when he
was on the show. Yeah,

2672
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:37,260
but he gave it to you for refill
for brought tobacco and everything.

2673
02:39:38,210 --> 02:39:42,020
It's not bad. It's kind of a pain in the
ass. You got to keep it lit. You know,

2674
02:39:42,021 --> 02:39:44,990
it's not something that just
stays lit like a joint, you know,

2675
02:39:45,090 --> 02:39:49,430
you gotta Kinda keep, it wouldn't
make you feel like it's like tobacco,

2676
02:39:49,431 --> 02:39:53,090
you don't, it gives you that little high.
It's a nice little buzz like cigars.

2677
02:39:53,091 --> 02:39:57,350
I think of the best version of that cause
the cigar stays lip and you're getting

2678
02:39:57,351 --> 02:40:00,350
it from the leaf to like
cause like your tobacco,

2679
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:03,440
your saliva or rather as
breaking down the tobacco.

2680
02:40:03,441 --> 02:40:04,640
Obviously I'm not a scientist,

2681
02:40:05,060 --> 02:40:09,270
but your saliva is doing something to
the tobacco of the leaf and it may, okay.

2682
02:40:09,290 --> 02:40:10,123
These little kids smoke

2683
02:40:10,270 --> 02:40:13,680
cigarettes. He's got a pipe. This little
kid's got a pipe. Is that a, yeah,

2684
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:14,040
I was just

2685
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:16,080
looking for kids. There's the one
on the left. Have a cigarette. Yeah,

2686
02:40:16,220 --> 02:40:18,690
he's got a cigarette. That's,
this one's probably fake,

2687
02:40:18,691 --> 02:40:23,691
but I know it's got a pipe that in the
50s and forties look at that kid smoking

2688
02:40:24,391 --> 02:40:28,800
cigarettes in the lower right hand
corner. Yeah. Kids are smoking shit. Yeah.

2689
02:40:30,060 --> 02:40:32,460
Wow. Look at that. All the
kids selling newspapers,

2690
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:36,630
they were all fucking addicted to
cigarettes. Wow. Hey, do me a favor.

2691
02:40:36,690 --> 02:40:38,610
Send me that picture. I want
to try to get that picture.

2692
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:42,420
Printing it for the studio. That's
like little rascals and shit. Yeah.

2693
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:46,080
Wow. Yeah. Save. Save that picture.

2694
02:40:46,980 --> 02:40:50,890
See if we can buy a copy of that. That
was a kid and when they were growing up,

2695
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:55,710
north Bergen is named is Olson Family
Olson that it'd be like telling them like

2696
02:40:56,430 --> 02:40:58,230
Jimmy Olsen live next to a body shop

2697
02:40:59,770 --> 02:41:03,900
by 13 he had already been
smoking like fucking eight years.

2698
02:41:04,750 --> 02:41:06,840
I swear to God he had cavities,

2699
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:12,380
so he would just put the cigarette in
the tooth gap and just leave it there.

2700
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:17,210
I'll talk to you with the cigarette
in the cavity. His teeth are green.

2701
02:41:17,230 --> 02:41:19,050
He's on Facebook now
and say, I thought, Ooh,

2702
02:41:19,230 --> 02:41:21,300
from time to time and
shit that way by them,

2703
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:26,990
but that's how bad in the 70s and
sixties I think the 50s kids were fucking

2704
02:41:27,571 --> 02:41:31,350
smoking. Look at that Ad.
Give your throat to vacation,

2705
02:41:31,351 --> 02:41:35,850
smoke a fresh cigarette,
camels, Shit. It's a doctor,

2706
02:41:35,851 --> 02:41:38,940
a doctors telling you to
give your throat a vacation.

2707
02:41:38,941 --> 02:41:42,720
Chesterfield cigarettes are just
as pure as the water you drink.

2708
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:46,140
Wow. People were evil back then.

2709
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:49,090
They just lied down on that one.

2710
02:41:49,091 --> 02:41:53,190
The more doctors smoke camels when
it say than any other cigarette.

2711
02:41:54,160 --> 02:41:57,480
Well, of course I smoked camels.
I like to relax as much as anyone.

2712
02:41:58,100 --> 02:42:01,320
Your t zone will tell you
t for tastes t for throat

2713
02:42:04,050 --> 02:42:06,990
brought out from the inside. We the
first time you smoked a cigarette?

2714
02:42:07,590 --> 02:42:10,950
Probably 14 or 15 what happened to
you? I thought it was disgusting.

2715
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:14,580
I thought I was about like nine. I
thought it was a fucking horrible.

2716
02:42:14,581 --> 02:42:17,580
I got dizzy and other than
turn the cigarette out,

2717
02:42:17,581 --> 02:42:21,630
I almost put the bathroom on fire.
My mother found that no good.

2718
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:25,620
The next time I smoked one
again was many years later. Um,

2719
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:29,700
Adam Ferrara used to smoke and he gave
me some of his cigarettes cause we were,

2720
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:34,200
we were doing some sketch, I don't
remember exactly what it was about,

2721
02:42:34,201 --> 02:42:36,630
but I was supposed to be smoking
a cigarette and the sketch,

2722
02:42:37,030 --> 02:42:40,170
I was supposed to be like some
annoying poet smoking a cigarette.

2723
02:42:40,220 --> 02:42:43,580
So I kept smoking a cigarette while
we're practicing this thing and I'm just

2724
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:46,530
blasted out of my mind.
Three or four cigarettes in,

2725
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:50,640
we just smoke back to back to back and
you don't smoke. Oh my God, the nicotine.

2726
02:42:50,641 --> 02:42:53,730
I was like this is crazy. This is what
you're doing all the time. I was like,

2727
02:42:53,850 --> 02:42:55,110
you getting high all the time like this.

2728
02:42:55,340 --> 02:43:00,340
A fact science advances new data that
may completely change your idea of

2729
02:43:00,541 --> 02:43:01,470
cigarettes.

2730
02:43:01,770 --> 02:43:06,770
The experiences of camel smokers confirmed
camels can literally relieve fatigue

2731
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:13,150
and irritability. That doesn't
naturally too. It says it's all good.

2732
02:43:13,180 --> 02:43:17,740
Does it naturally? Yeah,
man. People just get sick.

2733
02:43:18,180 --> 02:43:18,940
Crazy.

2734
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:23,800
Millions and millions of
people got sick from smoking.

2735
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:24,753
Just

2736
02:43:26,870 --> 02:43:30,140
taken it a big drag of chemicals
mixed with tobacco. I didn't,

2737
02:43:30,370 --> 02:43:32,290
they probably didn't mix the
chemicals with them back then.

2738
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:34,570
Back then it was probably
just actual tobacco. These,

2739
02:43:34,571 --> 02:43:38,170
all of these ads are really good
smoke after you strenuous exercise.

2740
02:43:39,910 --> 02:43:44,770
Smoke after strenuous exercise. That's
hilarious. Asthmatic cigarettes.

2741
02:43:44,950 --> 02:43:48,310
Imagine you've got asthma. Someone
gives you a pack of cools here.

2742
02:43:48,620 --> 02:43:51,760
This'll help you. Hey, what you need,
what you need is camel. No filters.

2743
02:43:52,210 --> 02:43:55,720
How about a lucky strike?
Hilarious. How crazy is this?

2744
02:43:55,721 --> 02:43:58,120
How crazy would it be if
you took one of these ads?

2745
02:43:58,930 --> 02:44:03,930
Like if you knew your grandfather died
of cancer and you took one of these eyes

2746
02:44:05,050 --> 02:44:09,040
and fucking took it to the cigarette
companies. Got some bad ass attorneys.

2747
02:44:09,041 --> 02:44:12,720
I said, you know what, man, look at
what you guys were putting out in

2748
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:18,690
the fifties and sixties doctors favorite
cigarette is Campbell cigarettes.

2749
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:23,340
Are you fucking crazy?
If I think about the ad,

2750
02:44:23,710 --> 02:44:28,710
think about how outrageous with what
we know today that added outrageous.

2751
02:44:28,900 --> 02:44:32,320
It's fucking outrageous ranges. So evil,

2752
02:44:33,190 --> 02:44:35,350
my doctor's favorite cigarette.

2753
02:44:35,770 --> 02:44:38,380
Cause they're telling you
doctors and not saying like, no,

2754
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:40,840
they did not say like my
accountant's favorite cigarette.

2755
02:44:41,020 --> 02:44:43,630
They're not saying my my police
officer's favorite cigarettes.

2756
02:44:43,750 --> 02:44:47,410
They're saying doctors to let you know
it's going to be okay because they know

2757
02:44:47,411 --> 02:44:49,600
it's not going to be okay and you
know it's not going to be okay.

2758
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:52,650
You don't know. You don't
know. You really don't know.

2759
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:55,750
I know you really don't know.
You went to the movies, you tote,

2760
02:44:55,960 --> 02:44:58,030
you're 10 years old, your
father gave you a nickel,

2761
02:44:58,270 --> 02:45:01,720
you went to the movies and Marlon Brando
was smoking a cigarette in the wild one

2762
02:45:02,260 --> 02:45:06,040
and all of a sudden you go home and you're
like, and you tell your friend, wow,

2763
02:45:06,041 --> 02:45:09,430
that looks so cool and your friend
goes, smoking is bad for you.

2764
02:45:10,030 --> 02:45:12,010
And you're like, no,
I just saw an article.

2765
02:45:13,210 --> 02:45:18,210
Four out of five doctors surveyed smoked
camel fucking cigarettes and they look

2766
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:21,490
today. The actually, it's not bad for you.

2767
02:45:21,491 --> 02:45:26,200
It can literally remove
irritability, nose, throat,

2768
02:45:26,230 --> 02:45:29,770
and accessory organs not
adversely affected by smoking.

2769
02:45:29,770 --> 02:45:34,390
Chesterfields they did a six month study
and they said nothing was first such

2770
02:45:34,391 --> 02:45:37,390
report ever published
about any cigarette. Oh,

2771
02:45:37,391 --> 02:45:40,060
so it's chesterfields you
just get them and you're okay.

2772
02:45:40,570 --> 02:45:43,120
Imagine if there was one cigarette.
I just had it nailed dog.

2773
02:45:43,150 --> 02:45:45,520
I used to date a girl that
worked at a crazy house.

2774
02:45:46,940 --> 02:45:50,350
Like when people go on that crazy
[inaudible] that she used to print it out.

2775
02:45:50,351 --> 02:45:53,150
I was a broke comic. She used
to bring me home cigarettes.

2776
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:57,470
I would smoke those cigarettes
and go off the reservation. Oh.

2777
02:45:57,920 --> 02:46:00,050
Like they will like low end cigarettes.

2778
02:46:00,170 --> 02:46:04,060
You guys see this shit
they put in there. I mean,

2779
02:46:04,061 --> 02:46:06,880
I could tell a visible
difference from what I smoked.

2780
02:46:06,881 --> 02:46:11,450
A camel or a Marlboro light. Did
you ever smoke sherm? What's charm?

2781
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:15,160
Sherm. You don't chairman's?
No. Sharon was a,

2782
02:46:15,170 --> 02:46:18,380
something they were doing where
certain cigarettes they would dip in.

2783
02:46:18,381 --> 02:46:21,740
Formaldehyde. I smoked
weed with formaldehyde.

2784
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:27,440
What's that like? Tremendous.
Just fucking traumatic.

2785
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:33,740
But I was into that shit at that time
that Sherman supposedly turns people into

2786
02:46:33,741 --> 02:46:37,670
a Zombie. You take the joint, you'd
dip pad the formaldehyde or coat it.

2787
02:46:37,730 --> 02:46:41,870
My friend would coat it, let it
dry with it, get hard. So crazy.

2788
02:46:41,871 --> 02:46:45,740
You smoke that shit and it
be it. It'd be 10 hours.

2789
02:46:47,670 --> 02:46:51,300
Jamie, this says that it was, if
it, when people were doing it,

2790
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:54,900
they would say it was embalming fluid
because it would make you turn into a

2791
02:46:54,901 --> 02:46:56,490
Zombie, but it was really just PCP.

2792
02:46:58,030 --> 02:46:58,540
Whew.

2793
02:46:58,540 --> 02:47:00,460
Really? They would call
it embalming fluid.

2794
02:47:00,461 --> 02:47:02,260
That's what the like urban
dictionary and some things,

2795
02:47:02,261 --> 02:47:04,660
and I'm looking up now calling
like what? What it actually was,

2796
02:47:04,690 --> 02:47:07,260
but did you look up sherm? Yeah, yeah,
yeah. That's fine. That's what it says.

2797
02:47:07,270 --> 02:47:09,280
So it's a, it's a hoax. I
don't know that it's up.

2798
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:12,460
I'm sure some idiots probably did find
some formaldehyde or and bombing Flynn

2799
02:47:12,490 --> 02:47:15,820
dip it in. But well, after all
the bad press that PCP got,

2800
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:20,970
I could imagine that people would
eventually be like, all right, listen the,

2801
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:24,170
we've got to stop smoking PCP.
So they had to sneak it in things

2802
02:47:25,710 --> 02:47:30,710
he had a good PCP experience and
other things. I had 50 good ones,

2803
02:47:31,250 --> 02:47:34,420
good PCP experiences. But
guys, to be honest, you,

2804
02:47:34,421 --> 02:47:36,440
I didn't know I was doing PCP. Oh,

2805
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:41,240
they called it THC crystal THC
crystals. That's what it was called.

2806
02:47:42,290 --> 02:47:43,520
THC Crystal. How do you know it was PCP?

2807
02:47:44,090 --> 02:47:48,800
Because years later I found that
the crystal didn't fucking exist.

2808
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:51,510
Well, THC crystals is like
the crystals off of weeks.

2809
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:52,970
So what they tell you at that time,

2810
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:54,930
you asked the dealer like
where'd you get this from?

2811
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:57,410
Word on the street was you took stems,

2812
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:02,810
you threw them in an in a pot with boiling
water. And when it comes to a head,

2813
02:48:02,811 --> 02:48:04,610
the stuff that stays to the edge,

2814
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:09,800
you scrape that off and you put it into
a powder form and that's what you snot,

2815
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:12,530
that was the word on the street.

2816
02:48:13,190 --> 02:48:17,660
But what it really was was PC fucking
pee. It was animal tranquilizer.

2817
02:48:17,750 --> 02:48:21,320
Oh, so they were just saying that so
they could sell it so they could sell it.

2818
02:48:21,350 --> 02:48:24,470
And then when you go into
New York City in the 80s,

2819
02:48:24,710 --> 02:48:27,950
when you went to the weed spots,
yeah, they sold two types of weed,

2820
02:48:28,430 --> 02:48:33,200
but they all felt called a thing. So
the thing called trays, trays, trays,

2821
02:48:33,201 --> 02:48:38,030
that's a $3 bag. So when you
paid, they would sell you an uh,

2822
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:42,080
a $10 bag. A sense to me. You
got five joints or something,

2823
02:48:42,590 --> 02:48:45,590
then they would have like a
special $20 from Buddha, Tai,

2824
02:48:46,250 --> 02:48:49,220
and you would get three joints, two
and a half joints, tight joints.

2825
02:48:49,640 --> 02:48:54,140
And then for the tray you get a tight
joint in is white powder that look like a

2826
02:48:54,141 --> 02:48:56,060
line of coke when you put it on the table.

2827
02:48:56,480 --> 02:48:59,750
So what you did was you rolled your
joint and you took that white line.

2828
02:48:59,751 --> 02:49:04,010
You sprinkled in the joint.
You smoked it. Bye Bye Irene.

2829
02:49:06,290 --> 02:49:08,130
Bye Bye Irene. And they always
gave it a weird name, like

2830
02:49:08,150 --> 02:49:12,090
a Jim Jones. Oh Gee. The time after
he drunk. You know what I'm saying?

2831
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:16,980
After kill those people. So they would
give it, we had weird names. Jim Jones.

2832
02:49:17,460 --> 02:49:21,210
How crazy was that? Suicide. They
would give it to all these weird names.

2833
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:26,830
Jimmy Jones named the town Jonestown
cause he know that's when the cops moving.

2834
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:29,580
When you name a town after
yourself, like what are you doing?

2835
02:49:29,810 --> 02:49:34,500
I'm just running Vernon Ville and
not just the town but in Ghana. Yeah.

2836
02:49:34,770 --> 02:49:38,880
And made people sell everything and move
that. That's just a horrific fucking,

2837
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:41,820
you know, he's been the guy and
a bunch of times, Steve Rinella.

2838
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:43,830
You know who he is? That
guy from that? Yeah,

2839
02:49:43,831 --> 02:49:46,680
he's been on my podcast to
from the show mediator. Yeah.

2840
02:49:46,681 --> 02:49:49,320
He's a recorded a bunch
of episodes in Guyana,

2841
02:49:49,350 --> 02:49:53,760
living with the people that live in the
jungle. Fascinating Shit. Fascinating.

2842
02:49:53,790 --> 02:49:56,940
Watching all those people live and he's
interacting with them and hanging out

2843
02:49:56,941 --> 02:50:00,030
with them, both fishing with
them and shit. Just wild man.

2844
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:03,360
They found pictographs on
a rock that's on a river.

2845
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:06,300
They have no idea who made them knowing
that how old they are just sitting there

2846
02:50:06,630 --> 02:50:08,100
just probably a thousand years old.

2847
02:50:08,390 --> 02:50:12,030
They don't know what they mean to some
people from an ancient time ago in Ghana,

2848
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:14,820
I wrote the Shit on a rock and
you can still see it today.

2849
02:50:15,990 --> 02:50:18,900
I want to see what that fucking
place looks like that Jim Jones had.

2850
02:50:19,170 --> 02:50:22,050
Now they just did a whatever, but no,

2851
02:50:22,051 --> 02:50:25,000
it's just a jungle that at
just grew up. Just rolled over.

2852
02:50:25,110 --> 02:50:28,710
They went back and they
read, dug up the old stage.

2853
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:33,120
He had a landing strip too, right?
Yeah. That's where he shot that dog.

2854
02:50:33,180 --> 02:50:37,410
I still remember being a little kid and
I'm showing, uh, the guy getting shot.

2855
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:40,020
The federal agent at camera falling? No.

2856
02:50:40,021 --> 02:50:42,690
The governor or the senator they showed,

2857
02:50:42,691 --> 02:50:46,140
they always showed this shot
of the camera going down there.

2858
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:50,760
The reporters are about to get on the
plane and then a truck pulled up and guys

2859
02:50:50,761 --> 02:50:55,590
just opened fire on them. I think I
found with the camera rolling. Wow.

2860
02:50:55,650 --> 02:50:59,510
The lady still alive. The
senator, the woman did.

2861
02:51:00,150 --> 02:51:04,700
She got shot, woman got shot. The
congressman, whoever the congressman,

2862
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:05,730
the son of the love of God,

2863
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:10,680
he died but her assistant lived and
somebody else left and they just got

2864
02:51:10,681 --> 02:51:15,330
interviewed. It was either
the anniversary or some shit.

2865
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:19,770
I hate all that shit. I can't see the
people he took down there. He just,

2866
02:51:19,950 --> 02:51:22,170
I don't know, culture dangerous.

2867
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:27,320
It's very dangerous when one person
wants to be the only one to talk and tell

2868
02:51:28,111 --> 02:51:31,290
you what to do and make
the rules and be special.

2869
02:51:31,530 --> 02:51:34,980
When you got that one person that gathers
a group of people and has all those

2870
02:51:34,981 --> 02:51:39,480
people listened to him without question
and tries to say that he has the answers

2871
02:51:39,540 --> 02:51:43,680
for whatever reason that's appealing
to people. It's very weird,

2872
02:51:43,681 --> 02:51:46,200
but people fall into that trap
over and over and over again.

2873
02:51:46,201 --> 02:51:50,430
When you have a strong confident man who
is telling you what you know and then

2874
02:51:50,431 --> 02:51:54,330
you see them giving into the
power and for whatever reason,

2875
02:51:54,331 --> 02:51:57,480
it makes it even more attractive to
a certain segment of the population.

2876
02:51:57,630 --> 02:52:02,100
When you see someone reveling in the
power of being a cult leader, like a,

2877
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:06,170
I guarantee you, when that guy in Waco,
what the fuck was his name, correct,

2878
02:52:06,430 --> 02:52:08,800
correct. David Koresh.
I guarantee you when,

2879
02:52:08,801 --> 02:52:11,950
when he was on the news and talking
about how they'll never give up.

2880
02:52:11,951 --> 02:52:15,700
I kid girls, we're probably beaten down
his door trying to get in that cult.

2881
02:52:15,970 --> 02:52:17,970
The crazier and the nuttier and the,

2882
02:52:17,971 --> 02:52:21,940
the more more apocalyptic your message,

2883
02:52:22,120 --> 02:52:25,390
the more people that want to join.
It's weird and they, they, they,

2884
02:52:25,570 --> 02:52:27,580
they're just, they just don't
have the ability to discern, oh,

2885
02:52:27,581 --> 02:52:30,790
this is not a good idea. This guy really
doesn't have his head on straight.

2886
02:52:30,791 --> 02:52:32,950
This guy might be
fucking completely crazy.

2887
02:52:32,951 --> 02:52:36,130
They've always realized those
things. That fuck fest anyway. Oh,

2888
02:52:36,131 --> 02:52:38,020
I got a 10 that guy slinging deck.

2889
02:52:38,021 --> 02:52:42,400
He's arrested that crushed
bang everybody's wife.
Yeah. You got it. Yeah. Yup.

2890
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:46,390
The friend. I had a friend who grew up
in a coat and the stories real, oh yeah,

2891
02:52:46,660 --> 02:52:49,750
horrific. I know the friend. I know what
you're talking about. Yeah. Horrific.

2892
02:52:50,130 --> 02:52:53,680
You know, so you look at this shit and
you're like, I don't fucking dangerous.

2893
02:52:54,220 --> 02:52:59,220
And anytime someone is running any kind
of thing where they got to separate you

2894
02:52:59,951 --> 02:53:02,110
from everybody else come to us,

2895
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:06,010
we're going to get you away from all
those people. It never goes well.

2896
02:53:06,370 --> 02:53:09,190
It fucking never goes
well. It never goes well.

2897
02:53:10,510 --> 02:53:13,900
They want control, they want
control and control of you.

2898
02:53:13,901 --> 02:53:16,720
And the best way to do that is get you
away from all these other pesky people

2899
02:53:16,930 --> 02:53:20,590
with all their questions.
They don't know. But we know,

2900
02:53:21,100 --> 02:53:25,450
we know what's really going on. We
know what this is really all about.

2901
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:27,230
Next thing you know
you're going to call it,

2902
02:53:29,110 --> 02:53:33,100
how many cults are going on right now
that we don't know about is like a gang of

2903
02:53:33,101 --> 02:53:35,140
them that are just like
bubbling under the surface.

2904
02:53:35,141 --> 02:53:37,870
That one they found out about last
year. Right, and I was a Sexual York.

2905
02:53:39,640 --> 02:53:42,790
That's a real, they throw them
motherfuckers in jail over that one. Yeah.

2906
02:53:42,791 --> 02:53:45,730
That next one, one is a weird one,
right? Because I was like, motherfucker,

2907
02:53:45,790 --> 02:53:49,180
actors and actors and actresses,
which does a sex caught, right?

2908
02:53:50,050 --> 02:53:52,900
They're all sex calls. Then she
stopped saying sex calls. Right.

2909
02:53:54,610 --> 02:53:59,380
Is there a no sex cult? No sex calls. It
just, it's like Buddhist, like they go,

2910
02:53:59,381 --> 02:54:02,180
okay, you got six, whatever
you got. Just think about that.

2911
02:54:02,181 --> 02:54:07,130
A Guy who tells you he's God,
go blah blah, blah. Okay.

2912
02:54:07,480 --> 02:54:07,900
Wife,

2913
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:12,160
crazy girl away in the middle of night
as she comes back the next day smelling

2914
02:54:12,161 --> 02:54:15,790
like cocking God knows what
else and you have to store,

2915
02:54:15,791 --> 02:54:19,960
respect the guy and call him
God. Yeah, they do. Yeah.

2916
02:54:19,961 --> 02:54:22,540
They such a sick, sick, fucking mind.

2917
02:54:22,870 --> 02:54:27,310
It sick and you have to be in such
a weak state as a human being.

2918
02:54:27,310 --> 02:54:30,880
They're really buying into that.
You can't call them, you know,

2919
02:54:31,510 --> 02:54:34,550
you can't call him. They
just fucked up. We had state,

2920
02:54:36,040 --> 02:54:38,460
maybe they had avoided
them live somewhere.

2921
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:41,920
This is the way by filling
it and just, I don't see it.

2922
02:54:42,340 --> 02:54:43,570
I can never join a Co.

2923
02:54:43,960 --> 02:54:47,150
Well there's a bunch of different things
could have gone with the leader and you

2924
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:51,060
got to give me your money. You got to
do all, you got to sell your house.

2925
02:54:51,230 --> 02:54:54,760
All those people that went to Jonestown
and sell their home whenever they add

2926
02:54:54,761 --> 02:54:58,930
and give them money to, hey, did you see
why? Wild country, wild, wild country.

2927
02:54:58,931 --> 02:55:02,890
Now, what is it? It's a
Netflix documentary about the

2928
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:05,263
Pacific Northwest Colts

2929
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:09,620
rock niche guy. The guy that
eventually went on to um,

2930
02:55:10,940 --> 02:55:15,140
he found this, this crazy cult. They
went on to buy this town up there.

2931
02:55:16,040 --> 02:55:19,190
I heard about it. It's
fucking amazing. I did listen.

2932
02:55:19,370 --> 02:55:24,020
We live around so much stupidity. Why
watching one sit down. Watch it on TV.

2933
02:55:24,320 --> 02:55:28,280
It's really good though. The documentary
is incredible. It's so well done.

2934
02:55:28,610 --> 02:55:32,270
And this Sheila lady who is running
things, she's poisoning people and shit.

2935
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:36,740
It's crazy. They, they poison people.
She did all kinds of crazy stuff.

2936
02:55:37,610 --> 02:55:39,540
It was a, it's wild.

2937
02:55:39,541 --> 02:55:42,350
They shipped homeless people in to
vote so they could take over the town.

2938
02:55:42,680 --> 02:55:45,560
They just brought homeless people in
from everywhere. You just picked him up,

2939
02:55:45,561 --> 02:55:47,120
come in the homeless people like Yay.

2940
02:55:47,121 --> 02:55:50,480
We found a home and some of them were
like really into it and then they're like,

2941
02:55:50,550 --> 02:55:51,950
all right, we're done with
you. Get the fuck Outta here.

2942
02:55:52,970 --> 02:55:55,340
Kicked him out after
he took over the home.

2943
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:59,260
Everyone in the town that lived there
before them was fucking hated them. They,

2944
02:55:59,261 --> 02:56:02,720
they, they, they had their
own police force armed guards.

2945
02:56:02,960 --> 02:56:07,070
I mean guys armed to the Dick. Okay.
Just carrying machine guns and shit.

2946
02:56:07,680 --> 02:56:11,260
Fuck. How the fuck is a
tool clock? Cause we uh,

2947
02:56:11,261 --> 02:56:12,310
that's what always happens with us.

2948
02:56:12,620 --> 02:56:16,420
[inaudible] how the fuck I told it was
like one o'clock and that'd be 1230 till

2949
02:56:16,421 --> 02:56:21,070
we, we have fun. I've known this
is crazy. I'm dealing you for,

2950
02:56:21,400 --> 02:56:26,140
I've known you for 23
years, man. Maybe more 22.

2951
02:56:27,310 --> 02:56:31,330
When did you get there? What
year? 97 was it? 97 yeah. Yeah.

2952
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:33,540
22 years. It's a long time geography.

2953
02:56:33,541 --> 02:56:37,040
I used to go to the store and see
what we are walking around the round.

2954
02:56:37,960 --> 02:56:41,020
How long we've been there for.
Every time I go down there,

2955
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:46,300
I got a fucking anxiety attack.
Really? Yeah. I get anxiety.

2956
02:56:46,301 --> 02:56:50,020
I can't believe I'm still there. It's
still so fun. I got up, I got a home.

2957
02:56:50,021 --> 02:56:54,130
Sometimes I just sit back by the
ice cube machine and look and go.

2958
02:56:54,131 --> 02:56:58,450
How lucky am I? I got a
fucking home. I got a buggy.

2959
02:56:58,960 --> 02:57:02,550
I know you do. I got up. Let's wrap
this pitch at a boogie add. Fucking pee.

2960
02:57:03,240 --> 02:57:06,520
All right. Oh man, both. Uh, I
love to see you. Love you too.

2961
02:57:06,521 --> 02:57:10,900
Happy for the July. They, everybody.
Charlotte next week. You dirty bitches.

2962
02:57:10,901 --> 02:57:11,734
I'm excited.

2963
02:57:11,770 --> 02:57:15,130
Thank you to everybody that came in
Atlantic city and Brando to Columbus.

2964
02:57:15,131 --> 02:57:16,540
We didn't talk about Baltimore.

2965
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:21,670
The both got all the food in Baltimore
in Borgata or John Rollo. Yeah.

2966
02:57:21,700 --> 02:57:25,960
Shout out to John Rollo. Uh, alright.
Fuck. I love you guys. Love you. Bye.

2967
02:57:32,510 --> 02:57:33,343
[inaudible].

2968
02:57:40,270 --> 02:57:40,270
[inaudible].
