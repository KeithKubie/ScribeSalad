everything else but at the same time I

over-reliant on financial services is
not that terrific and then I do think

not that terrific and then I do think
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.240
not that terrific and then I do think
that there is another really contentious

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
that there is another really contentious
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.470
that there is another really contentious
issue at the moment which is to what

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
issue at the moment which is to what
 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.870
issue at the moment which is to what
extent is the collective good served by

working in financial services firms and
 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.820
working in financial services firms and
I think it's obvious why that should be

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830
I think it's obvious why that should be
 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.730
I think it's obvious why that should be
such a politically contentious point

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740
such a politically contentious point
 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.250
such a politically contentious point
right now because taxpayers who in

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260
right now because taxpayers who in
 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.110

becoming unemployed and yet they're
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.170
becoming unemployed and yet they're
seeing the return of really hefty

certain cognitive dissonance there i
 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.730

think the best way to think about those

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740
think the best way to think about those
 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.520
think the best way to think about those
questions though is not through the

questions though is not through the
 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.370
questions though is not through the
prism of compensation but through the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
prism of compensation but through the
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.950
prism of compensation but through the
prism of what does the system need what

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960

from an implicit or even explicit state
 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.440
from an implicit or even explicit state

that's what happened in the fall of 2008
 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.580
that's what happened in the fall of 2008

a way that you were too big to fail
 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.880
a way that you were too big to fail

because it meant that we bailed you out
 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.810
because it meant that we bailed you out

through that sort of a process i think

through that sort of a process i think
it's important also to bear in mind that

it's important also to bear in mind that

risk to the economy to the financial
system and that wasn't a crazy thing to

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080
system and that wasn't a crazy thing to
 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.929
system and that wasn't a crazy thing to
say and in fact we had seen the example

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:11.939
say and in fact we had seen the example
 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.019
say and in fact we had seen the example
of ltcm in the 1990s as it turned out

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:15.029
of ltcm in the 1990s as it turned out

hedge funds did not pose a tremendous
 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.989
hedge funds did not pose a tremendous
systemic risk and what we saw was a

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:20.999
systemic risk and what we saw was a
 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.239
systemic risk and what we saw was a
really healthy operation of market

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:34.249
 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:36.549
the question of whether banks should be

the question of whether banks should be
 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.009
the question of whether banks should be
allowed to fail or not it really

allowed to fail or not it really
 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:43.079
allowed to fail or not it really
ultimately has to be about is this Bank

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.089
ultimately has to be about is this Bank
 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:47.019
ultimately has to be about is this Bank

to fail and regulators need to be very

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:52.549
to fail and regulators need to be very
 

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:55.209
to fail and regulators need to be very
very thoughtful at that moment of crisis

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219
very thoughtful at that moment of crisis
 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.179
very thoughtful at that moment of crisis
about if we let this institution go will

00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:58.189
about if we let this institution go will
 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.429
about if we let this institution go will
everybody else suffer or will it just be

the institution that suffers for markets

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909
the institution that suffers for markets
 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.179
the institution that suffers for markets
to function properly we should allow

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:07.189
to function properly we should allow
 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:09.879
to function properly we should allow
institutions to fail and we should be

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889
institutions to fail and we should be
 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.459
institutions to fail and we should be
certain that the shareholders and bought

institutions which fail suffer that's
 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.600
institutions which fail suffer that's
how a market economy works people who

how a market economy works people who

make the right decisions prosper but to
enforce that discipline you have to have

enforce that discipline you have to have
 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.659

out of business what was really

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979
out of business what was really
 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.989
out of business what was really
problematic about this crisis was we

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:31.999
problematic about this crisis was we
 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:33.609
problematic about this crisis was we
collectively were not in a situation

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:33.619
collectively were not in a situation
 

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:35.829
collectively were not in a situation

where that could be allowed to happen
 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:41.619
where that could be allowed to happen
and collectively it became apparent as

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:41.629
and collectively it became apparent as
 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.389
and collectively it became apparent as
the crisis went on and and we do need to

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:43.399
the crisis went on and and we do need to
 

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.149
the crisis went on and and we do need to
remember that Lehman was allowed to fail

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:45.159
remember that Lehman was allowed to fail
 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:49.529
remember that Lehman was allowed to fail
with really painful and instant

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539
with really painful and instant
 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:54.909
with really painful and instant
implications so at that moment and it

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919
implications so at that moment and it
 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.909
implications so at that moment and it
really was a post Lehman moment there

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919
really was a post Lehman moment there
 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.759
really was a post Lehman moment there
was a belief which I think was right

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:00.769
was a belief which I think was right
 

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:02.469
was a belief which I think was right
that you couldn't let the whole system

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479
that you couldn't let the whole system
 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:08.049
that you couldn't let the whole system
fail the consequences of that should be

00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:08.059
fail the consequences of that should be
 

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:12.459
fail the consequences of that should be
that regulators and lawmakers act now in

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:12.469
that regulators and lawmakers act now in
 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:16.600
that regulators and lawmakers act now in

this lull after the storm to limit the
 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.799
this lull after the storm to limit the
number of institutions and the size of

00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:20.809
number of institutions and the size of
 

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:22.899
number of institutions and the size of

and if there is a decision which may be

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:26.029
and if there is a decision which may be

the case that it's good to have really

the case that it's good to have really
big banks that a national economy or

big banks that a national economy or
 

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:33.669
big banks that a national economy or
global economy is best served by the

existence of bank universal banks I

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599
existence of bank universal banks I
 

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:37.929
existence of bank universal banks I
think that's a legitimate outcome but

00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:37.939
think that's a legitimate outcome but
 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:41.079
think that's a legitimate outcome but
those banks then need to be subject to

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:41.089
those banks then need to be subject to
 

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:44.499
those banks then need to be subject to
much stricter regulation than before so

00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:44.509
much stricter regulation than before so
 

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:46.989
much stricter regulation than before so
that it's much less likely that they

00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:46.999
that it's much less likely that they
 

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.220
that it's much less likely that they
should fail

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.230
should fail
 

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.190
should fail
the right outcome is going to be some

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:51.200
the right outcome is going to be some
 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.900
the right outcome is going to be some
sort of a greater move towards

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:54.910
sort of a greater move towards
 

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.490
sort of a greater move towards
intellectually separating the utility

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:57.500
intellectually separating the utility
 

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.040
intellectually separating the utility

the casino function and we do need banks

the casino function and we do need banks
 

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.450
the casino function and we do need banks
to perform the utility function those

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:04.460
to perform the utility function those
 

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.340
to perform the utility function those
banks should be really really strictly

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.350
banks should be really really strictly
 

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.670
banks should be really really strictly
regulated and very careful thoughtful

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680
regulated and very careful thoughtful
 

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.250
regulated and very careful thoughtful
policies should be in place about how to

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:12.260
policies should be in place about how to
 

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.890
policies should be in place about how to
handle the failure of those banks as we

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:14.900
handle the failure of those banks as we
 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.010
handle the failure of those banks as we
have in the example of the FDIC and the

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:18.020
have in the example of the FDIC and the
 

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.060

the other side of the divide we should
 

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.060

a dirty word I think speculation is a
 

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.010
a dirty word I think speculation is a
really essential part of capitalism but

really essential part of capitalism but
 

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.070

speculation by nature will fail a lot it
