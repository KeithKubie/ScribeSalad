it because that we unless that happens
 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.510
it because that we unless that happens
we certainly are not going to see

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
we certainly are not going to see
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.250
we certainly are not going to see
sustainable development as we look ahead

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260
 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.380
I think basically when you look at all

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390
I think basically when you look at all
 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.259
I think basically when you look at all
the elements that are on the table and

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269
the elements that are on the table and
 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.069
the elements that are on the table and
in the discussion even linked up to the

in the discussion even linked up to the
 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.729
in the discussion even linked up to the
climate change discussion all the key

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739

development concept itself are part of
 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.200
development concept itself are part of
that discussion so it's not as if

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210
that discussion so it's not as if
 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.260
that discussion so it's not as if
something has been completely lost as we

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270
something has been completely lost as we
 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.290
something has been completely lost as we
focus on climate because in the whole

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300

reducing the impact upon our climate we
 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.730
reducing the impact upon our climate we
touch most issues which are relevant in

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740
touch most issues which are relevant in
 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.240

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160
question of the way our democracies most
 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.670
