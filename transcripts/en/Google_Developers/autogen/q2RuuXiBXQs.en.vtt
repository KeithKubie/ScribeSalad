like you know the next three years or so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
like you know the next three years or so
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.430
like you know the next three years or so
we'll have something like potentially

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440
we'll have something like potentially
 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.380
we'll have something like potentially
ninety percent of web traffic we'll

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390
ninety percent of web traffic we'll
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.130

communication and so on but you know

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940
communication and so on but you know
 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.400

people are doing on the web right and
 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.390
people are doing on the web right and
that means we need to evolve the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
that means we need to evolve the
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.160
that means we need to evolve the
standards and as part of that the web

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
standards and as part of that the web

what I love at the moment what I just
I've seen amazing stuff with using the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830
I've seen amazing stuff with using the
 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.920
I've seen amazing stuff with using the
other side of web RTC which is the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930
other side of web RTC which is the
 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.410
other side of web RTC which is the
ability to exchange arbitrary data and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420
ability to exchange arbitrary data and
 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.090
ability to exchange arbitrary data and
so not just audio and video but

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100
so not just audio and video but
 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.510
so not just audio and video but
arbitrary binary data or just text and

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520
arbitrary binary data or just text and
 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.800
arbitrary binary data or just text and
we've seen a couple of things with that

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810
we've seen a couple of things with that
 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.800
we've seen a couple of things with that
something called chef s which enables

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810
something called chef s which enables
 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.949
something called chef s which enables
you to share files between peers in a

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
you to share files between peers in a
 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.750
you to share files between peers in a
completely peer-to-peer way you know

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760
completely peer-to-peer way you know
 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.250
completely peer-to-peer way you know
it's not going via some intermediary

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260
it's not going via some intermediary
 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.190
it's not going via some intermediary
server okay and that's yeah working very

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
server okay and that's yeah working very
 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.190
server okay and that's yeah working very
well another similar application it's

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200
well another similar application it's
 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.140
well another similar application it's
got a prototype really called peer CDN

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
got a prototype really called peer CDN
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.360
got a prototype really called peer CDN
and you all you have to do is

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
and you all you have to do is
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.030
and you all you have to do is
incorporate like add the pier CD and

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
incorporate like add the pier CD and
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.280
incorporate like add the pier CD and
JavaScript top of your web page and then

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290
JavaScript top of your web page and then
 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.170
JavaScript top of your web page and then
what it will do is try to get the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180
what it will do is try to get the
 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.500
what it will do is try to get the
content on the web page from a peer that

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510
content on the web page from a peer that
 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.740
content on the web page from a peer that
has the same stuff so the same images or

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750
has the same stuff so the same images or
 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.870
has the same stuff so the same images or
the same video or whatever so in other

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880
the same video or whatever so in other
 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.960
the same video or whatever so in other
words it's a peer-to-peer file

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970
words it's a peer-to-peer file
 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.170
words it's a peer-to-peer file
distribution setup using WebRTC so kind

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180
distribution setup using WebRTC so kind
 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.590
distribution setup using WebRTC so kind
of CDN via web RTC face that's pretty

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600
of CDN via web RTC face that's pretty
 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.320
of CDN via web RTC face that's pretty
cool that's pretty cool indeed so you

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330
cool that's pretty cool indeed so you
 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.420
cool that's pretty cool indeed so you
mentioned mobile devices

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430
mentioned mobile devices
 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.340
mentioned mobile devices
how real is WebRTC on those mobile

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350
how real is WebRTC on those mobile
 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.650
how real is WebRTC on those mobile
devices I mean there with usually the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660
devices I mean there with usually the
 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.090
devices I mean there with usually the
mobile in terms of supporting the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100
mobile in terms of supporting the
 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.580
mobile in terms of supporting the
standards and the advanced HTML file

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590
standards and the advanced HTML file
 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.710
standards and the advanced HTML file
female fighter yeah yeah it's kind of

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720
female fighter yeah yeah it's kind of
 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.810
female fighter yeah yeah it's kind of
trailing a bit yeah so when we stand

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820
trailing a bit yeah so when we stand
 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.940
trailing a bit yeah so when we stand
there it's looking good with web RTC so

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950
there it's looking good with web RTC so
 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.670
there it's looking good with web RTC so
all the api's implemented in chrome and

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680
all the api's implemented in chrome and
 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.820
all the api's implemented in chrome and
in firefox on mobile okay we've got

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830
in firefox on mobile okay we've got
 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.060
in firefox on mobile okay we've got
WebRTC bindings in fact for Java and for

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070
WebRTC bindings in fact for Java and for
 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.070
WebRTC bindings in fact for Java and for
iOS still work being done on the iOS

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080
iOS still work being done on the iOS
 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.480
iOS still work being done on the iOS
stuff but that's coming and yes so we've

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490
stuff but that's coming and yes so we've
 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.250
stuff but that's coming and yes so we've
got the ability to do that stuff on

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260
got the ability to do that stuff on
 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.650
got the ability to do that stuff on
mobile but also I think you know one of

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660
mobile but also I think you know one of
 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.050
mobile but also I think you know one of
the main concerns for us is that is

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060
the main concerns for us is that is
 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.050
the main concerns for us is that is
battery life as power consumption and

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060
battery life as power consumption and
 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.530
battery life as power consumption and
what we're seeing now is the integration

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540
what we're seeing now is the integration
 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.530
what we're seeing now is the integration
of hardware encoding so encoding and

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540
of hardware encoding so encoding and
 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.530
of hardware encoding so encoding and
decoding done in Hardware much much more

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540
decoding done in Hardware much much more
 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.440
decoding done in Hardware much much more
efficient much less power consumption so

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450
efficient much less power consumption so
 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.350
efficient much less power consumption so
that is a really huge you know focus of

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360
that is a really huge you know focus of
 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.720
that is a really huge you know focus of
the WebRTC team at the moment is making

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730
the WebRTC team at the moment is making
 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.270
the WebRTC team at the moment is making
that power consumption very very

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280
that power consumption very very
 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.730
that power consumption very very
efficient and working on hardware good

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740
efficient and working on hardware good
 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.720
efficient and working on hardware good
so um WebRTC just like many other fields

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730
so um WebRTC just like many other fields
 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.330
so um WebRTC just like many other fields
are filled with acronyms yeah so you

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340
are filled with acronyms yeah so you
 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.040
are filled with acronyms yeah so you
want to walk me through I like up I

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050
want to walk me through I like up I

what's interesting about that is that it

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310
what's interesting about that is that it
 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.640
what's interesting about that is that it
enables you to do

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650
enables you to do
 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.189
enables you to do
things like adaptive streaming so

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199
things like adaptive streaming so

richness to video the web so how is

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210
richness to video the web so how is
 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.409
richness to video the web so how is
google using web RTC today yes so

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419
google using web RTC today yes so
 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.219
google using web RTC today yes so
obviously the movies for google hangouts

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229
obviously the movies for google hangouts
 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.640
obviously the movies for google hangouts
to be using web RTC right and yeah

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650
to be using web RTC right and yeah
 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.700
to be using web RTC right and yeah
that's of course gives us you know

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710
that's of course gives us you know
 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.460
that's of course gives us you know
better quality and the ability to do HD

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470
better quality and the ability to do HD
 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.219
better quality and the ability to do HD
between we hope you know more reliable

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:18.229
between we hope you know more reliable

between we hope you know more reliable
connections so that's that's of course a

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110
connections so that's that's of course a
 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.290
connections so that's that's of course a
huge push at the moment so we talked

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300
huge push at the moment so we talked
 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.570
huge push at the moment so we talked
about mobile how about accessibility i

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580

you know there is something called the
 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.879
you know there is something called the
track element that you can use inside of

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:39.889
track element that you can use inside of
 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:43.450
track element that you can use inside of
video elements in html5 and it's really

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460
video elements in html5 and it's really
 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.070
video elements in html5 and it's really
simple it's just a text file with

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080
simple it's just a text file with
 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.200

that in a video element link it to the
 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.250
that in a video element link it to the
text file it has that data and then

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:54.260
text file it has that data and then
 

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.770
text file it has that data and then
rendered over the video captions or

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:56.780
rendered over the video captions or
 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.640

accessibility of course but you can also
 

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:08.050
accessibility of course but you can also
use that by adding data in there instead

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.060
use that by adding data in there instead
 

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.540
