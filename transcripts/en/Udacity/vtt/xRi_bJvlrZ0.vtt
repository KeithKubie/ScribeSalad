00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.000
We can think of a spectrum of similarity. At one end of the spectrum,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.470
the target problem and the source case are identical.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.000
At the other extreme end of the similarity spectrum, the target problem and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.820
the source case have nothing in common. We can evaluate the similarity between

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.750
the target problem and source case in similar dimensions. In terms of

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.050
the relationships occurring in the source case and the target problem.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.173
In terms of the objects occurring between the two. In terms of the features of

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:31.470
the objects and in terms of the values that the features of the objects take.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.150
At the end of the spectrum, where the target problem and

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.750
the source case are very similar, with relationships, objects, features, and

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.750
values are all similar. At the other end the values, features and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.640
objects may be different, but the relationships are similar.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.330
If the relationships too are different, then there'll be nothing in common with

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.930
the target problem in the source case. When the relationships, objects,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.600
features and values are all similar, then that is an example of recording cases,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.500
and we have come across it. An example of that was from the colored blocks in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.750
the blocks world. When the similarity between the target problem and

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.170
the source case is along the dimension to relationships and objects, but not

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.315
along the dimensions of values or values and features, then that's an example of

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:17.390
case-based reasoning. We discuss this method in the domain of navigation and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.320
urban areas. The objects of the concept between the target problem and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.400
the source case being the same means that the domains are the same.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.930
So cased-based reasoning is within domain analogy. An analogical reasoning in

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.730
general, objects in the target column and the source case too,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.762
might be different. We saw an example of analogical reasoning in the Dunker

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:41.160
radiation problem, when we were talking about cross-domain analogical transfer.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.200
Actually recording cases in case based reasoning are also examples of

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.110
analogical reasoning, except that they occur in the same domain.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.690
The target firm and the source cases in the same domain,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.906
which is why we consider them earlier. By analogical reasoning here,

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:58.190
we mean cross domain analogical transfer. As in the Dunker radiation problem.
