&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washing, DC.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.370
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.670
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.860
Welcome back to the Green Stage.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.780
I am here to introduce
the next program,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.870
which will honor student finalists
and winners of the Library

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.830
of Congress A Book That Shaped Me:

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.880
Letters About Literature
Summer Writing Contest.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.240
We are delighted that today's
contest program will be emceed

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.590
by Eun Yang, who is no stranger
to the National Book Festival.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.910
Miss Yang is an Emmy
award-winning television anchor

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.140
for NBC4 Washington.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.520
In addition to anchoring
news for today,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.940
she files compelling
community stories about people

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.400
and organizations important
to the Washington area,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.740
and has been an author
introducer at the book festival

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.420
for the past seven years.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.730
She's also the mother of
three and a proponent of books

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.110
and reading for young people.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.100
So let's put our hands
together for Miss.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.400
Eun Yang [applause].

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.700
&gt;&gt; Eun Yang: Thank you so much.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.550
Thank you.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.910
Thank you so much for that
wonderful introduction.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.210
Hi, everyone.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.750
It's great to be here
and great to see you.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.390
I love all the bean bags
they set up, making it nice

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.800
and comfy for a great event today.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.630
The National Book Festival
is, indeed,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.950
one of my most favorite
events every single year.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.780
And I am delighted to
host this essay contest

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.080
for the second year in a row.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.510
You know, writing is really hard.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.810
I know it.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.110
But let me tell you, it
will take you places.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.070 position:56%
In every profession you do, whatever
you pursue, writing is critical.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.420
It is critical in my job.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.720
And I tell my kids.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.690
I have two kids who would
prefer math and science.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.840
I say, listen, you're going
to have to do research papers,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.140
you're going to have
to go to college.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.670
So you have to write
and be a good writer.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.760
So the fact that you spent your
summer doing this is so impressive,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.660
and I'm so proud of each and every
one of you who've submitted essays

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.480
to this contest this year.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.080
I am joined on the stage
today by David Rubenstein.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.250
And, you know, the host said
that I do a lot of stories

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.320
about the community, and he
is definitely someone we talk

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.600
about a lot because of
all the charitable work

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.320
and all the contributions
he makes to this great city

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.210
to keep it running and to
really support arts and culture

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.260
and the sort of creative juices
that are flowing in this area.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.630
And so, we really want to
thank him for being here.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.960
He is the lead benefactor
and cochairman

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.380
of the National Book Festival.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.280
We have Fred Bowen who
is here again this year.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.970
He's a sports writer
for the KidsPost.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.650
What a cool job that is too, right?

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.690
Awesome. Lola Pyne, my friend.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.890
We went to high school
together years ago.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.190
Longer for me.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.200
And Bryonna Head, who works
for the Library of Congress

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.310
to manage this wonderful contest.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.210
A Book That Shaped Me was launched
by the Library of Congress in 2012

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.950
with DC Public Library and has

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.180
since expanded throughout
the mid-Atlantic region.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.070
The contest asks rising 5th and
6th graders, I have one of those,

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.880
to reflect on a book that
has shaped their life,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.600
influencing the way they see
themselves, their community

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.020 position:56%
or their world, and students
entered by writing a one-page letter

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.180
to their librarian that
they then submit in person

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.720 position:56%
to a participating public library in
Washington, DC, Maryland, Virginia,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.590
Delaware, Pennsylvania
or West Virginia.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.040
It's a really a wide-reaching group
of really talented individuals.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.190
So over the years, we've had
more than a thousand essays

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.410
that have been submitted to
more than 350 public libraries

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.160
that have signed up to
administer this contest as part

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.110
of their summer reading programs.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.730
No summer slide here, right.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.540
The reading is so important.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.170
And we love reading, so it's easy.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.500
Then the essays are judged by
members of the American Association

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.610
of School Librarians and later
by a grand prize panel of judges

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.440
that are selected by
the Library of Congress

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.870
that included children's authors,
educators and library staff.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.700
Fred Bowen is one of the authors

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.320
who has written 21 sports-themed
books for children, 21.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.010
That's a lot of writing
and a lot of reading.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.420
It goes together.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.070
He's also been involved
in this essay contest,

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.430
A Book That Shaped
Me, six years ago.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.350
And he is here today to
introduce the 2017 finalists

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.650
and state winners.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.510
So ladies and gentlemen, a warm
welcome for Fred Bowen please.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.890
[ Applause ]

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.190
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: All right.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.640
Good morning.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.770
Yeah. I've been here since the
very beginning, six years ago.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.380
And I love the contest
really for few reasons.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.390
And the first reason is
it gets kids to read.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.240
And school is starting now, and
everybody's wondering, well, gee,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.210
how do we get kids
smarter and more educated.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.170 position:56%
It seems to me that if kids just
read more and schools took more time

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.200
for reading, the kids
would get better.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.790
Thank you.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.950
All the other theories, there
much be such a strong correlation

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.960
between reading and
academic achievement.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.640
The second thing I like about the
contest is it gets kids writing.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.090
And maybe it's just
because I'm a writer.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.800
And yes, I've written
all those books

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.840
and I write a weekly kids sports
column for the Washington Post.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.520
But I don't think you can really
understand something unless you're

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.030
able to write about it.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.190
And practicing writing is
such an important thing.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.840
And the final thing that I love

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.690
about this contest is
it gets kids thinking.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.760
The reading and the writing leads
to thinking, which is what did I

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.880
like about this book, how did this
book change me, how am I going

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.170
to be different because
I read this book.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.770
And it seems to me, as I look
around, we need more thinking.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.360
We need a lot more
thinking by everybody.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.790
And the final thing I like
about this essay contest,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.590
every essay had more
than 140 characters.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.790
We need more essays.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.430
We need less Twitter.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.730
All right.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.180
So now, I'm going to read the
names of the finalists by state.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.280
And Lola and Bryonna
-- Oh, one more thing.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.580
I almost forgot this.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.940
And I did it a couple of years
ago and they never forgave me.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.760
Do we have the other
judges in the house?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.280
Maria Salvador, are you
here and can you stand up?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.630
Rachel Walker, and then
Dana, are you here?

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.510
Give them a round of applause.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.250
[ Applause ]

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.550
All right.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.250
Now, I will read the names of
the finalists by state, and Lola

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.140
and Bryonna will hand them
their certificates and awards

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.690
as they come up on the stage.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.710
And please, if I pronounce
your name wrong, forgive me.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:02.370 position:56%
I have been introduced as Fred Brown
more times than I can tell you.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.670

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.550
All right.

Here we go.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:26.170
[ Applause ]

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.810
You may want to say
hi to her down there.

And now the finalists from
West Virginia: Kathryn Bell,

Cabell County Public Library.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:54.940
Actually, Kathryn lives in
Ohio, but made the effort to go

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.690
in person to West Virginia.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.100
All right.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.220
She kind of furthest
to the party I guess.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.080
Brooke Hayden Carey,
Cabell County Library.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:15.250
Alivia Harley, Kaylee J. Polk.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:21.150
And the West Virginia
winner, Alexander Irby.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.240
All right.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.110
Now let's give all the finalists
and state winners a big round

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.910
of applause and everyone.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:36.370
[ Applause ]

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.180
I hope everyone who is up on
the stage will keep reading

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.770
and keep writing and, most
of all, keep thinking.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.570
All right, thank you.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.650
&gt;&gt; Eun Yang: Thank you.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.950
Thank you so much.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.650
And I really love what
you said, Fred,

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:55.440 position:56%
about really understanding something
until you've written about it.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.110
And I think that is a big
connection for what we do early

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.950
on in our education and later on.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.130
So what he said, keep reading
and writing and thinking.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.430
It's so important.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.070
I really also want to give another
shout out to all the students

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.280
who took time out of their summer.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.890
I know summer is a time
for having fun and enjoying

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.770
with your family, which
is so awesome.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.180
But to spend time writing about
a topic that is so near and dear,

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.440
to be introspective, to think about
who you are and who you want to be,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.710
not just what you want
to be when you grow up.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.500
So big kudos to everyone
who's been recognized.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.780
And I love this contest
because it does reward you

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.080
for all your great efforts.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.220 position:56%
Thank you to all the families who've
made the trip, to the little sisters

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.890
and brothers who were
shouting out the names.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.260
I love to see all that.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.560
So thank you again.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.860
Next up, we're going to hear

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.310
from the National Book Festivals
Cochairman, Mr. David Rubenstein,

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.660
to introduce the grand
prize winners.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.050
A warm welcome [applause].

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.670
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Thank you.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.760
So how many of the young adults

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.320
or children here actually
want to be here?

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.390 position:56%
Okay. How many really wanted to give

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.050
up their Labor Day
weekend to be here?

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.580
Be honest.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.880
All right.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.660
How many people here of you can
name the librarian of Congress?

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.550
Anybody can name the
librarian of Congress?

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.020 position:56%
Who? Who? The librarian of Congress,
anybody, for a special prize?

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.800
Anybody can name the
librarian of Congress?

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.470
Who? Okay, come here.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.770
You got it?

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.680
&gt;&gt; She got it.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.990
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.990
[ Applause ]

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.770
All right, here's a
hundred-dollar bill.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.070
&gt;&gt; What?

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.920
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Librarian of Congress.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.430
Remember that name, okay?

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.730
Congratulations.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.030
All right.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.330
All right.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.740
Carla Hayden, remember that.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.040
Librarian of Congress.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.440
&gt;&gt; Are you giving out prizes?

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.330
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: More.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.010
Okay. Maybe we'll have
another prize.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.880
Okay. Pay attention.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.540
Okay. So my job is to call
up the grand prize winners

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.650 position:56%
and have them read their essays,
and I'll ask them a question or two.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:25.580
So first, I'd like to ask the
third-place grand prize winner

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.480
and the Pennsylvania state winner,
Megan Garrabrant, to come up

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.820
and to read the essay
Courage to Soar.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.620
Okay.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:43.420
[ Applause ]

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.310
Okay. Go ahead.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.920
Read it loud, loud and clear.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:57.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Megan Garrabrant: Dear librarian,
do you watch the summer Olympics?

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:03.770
I do, especially when the
gymnastics is televised.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:14.740
My favorite gymnasts in the
2016 Olympics was Simone Biles.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:24.340
So when my mom told me
about the book "Courage

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.740
to Soar," I had to read it.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:35.470
Here is why Simone's autobiography
is a book that shaped me.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.550
First of all, in both
gymnastics and school,

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.850
Simone gave an A plus effort.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:48.080
I try to do that as often as I can,
but instead of being a gymnast,

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:54.120
I am a swimmer on a
competitive swim team.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:00.600
Just like Simone, I am much shorter
and smaller in size than so many

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.420
of the others in my
swimming age group.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.860
But that doesn't discourage me.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:20.140
Every time I'm standing on the
block, waiting for the sound

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:28.290
of the bullhorn signaling
to dive into the pool,

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:36.190 position:56%
I think of Simone's words: "Maybe
because I was always so much smaller

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:45.060
than everyone around me, I had
this fierce drive to prove myself."

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:51.180
Next, Simone writes that her
accomplishments are the result

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.690
of her faith and her
family's support.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:02.610
She was raised by her grandparents
and knew them as mom and dad.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:12.080
They encourage her to pray and
ask for God's help when needed.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.200
When Simone's gymnastics'
coach, Amy, suddenly quit,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.050
Simone was stunned and panicked.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.390
And she went directly
to her church to pray.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.910
This has often inspired
me to turn to God

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.630
when I am feeling blue,
scared, or nervous.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.470
Last of all, Simone
believed in herself even

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.770
when her gymnastics routines
didn't go as well as she had hoped.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.590
She tells young athletes that
if you truly believe in yourself

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.090
and are willing to put in the
effort, you can achieve anything.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.830
When my swim meet times aren't as
fast as I would like them to be,

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.130
I think of these words
and they encourage me

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.430
to push myself harder
at upcoming practices.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.090
Simone Biles stood on the
2016 Olympic medal podium

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.390
in Rio de Janeiro not
once, but five times.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.690
Her A plus effort, faith
in God, family support,

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.990
and belief in herself all
contributed to her success.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.290
As I dive deeper into
the world of swimming,

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.660
I will always remember how hard
she worked to reach that podium.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.960
Like Simone, I am being
shaped by her words.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.260
Whatever happened, as
long as I do my best,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.560
I will get up the next
morning still smiling.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.860
Sincerely, Megan Garrabrant.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.160
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.460
That was good.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.760
Stay right there.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.060 position:56%
So my question to you is, how long
did it take you to write this essay?

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.360
&gt;&gt; Megan Garrabrant:
I'm not really sure.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.660
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: How long?

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.960
Speak into the mic.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.260
&gt;&gt; Megan Garrabrant: A day I think.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.560
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: A day, think.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.860
Okay. And did you write
it many times,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.160
or did you just do one
draft and that was it?

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.460
&gt;&gt; Megan Garrabrant:
I'm not really sure.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.760
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
You're not sure, okay.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.060
And what grade are you in now?

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.360
&gt;&gt; Megan Garrabrant: Sixth.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And do you
want to go to the Olympics yourself?

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.960
No, yes?

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.260
&gt;&gt; Megan Garrabrant: I'm not sure.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Not sure, okay.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.860
And do you want to be a gymnast
like the person you wrote about?

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.160
&gt;&gt; Megan Garrabrant: I'm a swimmer,
so I want to go there for swimming.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.460
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right,
you want to be a swimmer.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.760
And you want to be Olympics
swimmer or not really sure?

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.060
&gt;&gt; Megan Garrabrant:
I'm not really sure.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.360
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.660
All right.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.960
Well, let me give you your prize.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.260
And here it is.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.560
Here it is.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.860
Come on over.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.160
Put this on you.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.460
[ Applause ]

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.760
Thank you very much.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.060
[ Applause ]

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.360
Okay. Now which young person
here can name the building,

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.530
the main building of the
Library of Congress is named

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.990
after somebody, a very
famous person?

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.440
Which young person here can name
the person it's named after?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.710
Who? That's right.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.010
Come on up.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.810
I'll give you a prize.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:06.360
[ Applause ]

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.890
Okay. How'd you know that?

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.810
All right, here you
go, a hundred dollars.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.140
Thank you.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.440
Okay, next.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:23.960
The second grand prize
winner is Isla Rodriguez.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.090
She wrote about "Hidden
Figures," by Margot Lee Shetterly.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.510
Would she come up and
read her essay?

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.500
[ Applause ]

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.490
Okay. Go ahead.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:54.310
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: Hidden
Figures, now we know their names.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:59.600
On February 20th, 1962, the
signals for Friendship 7,

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:05.600
a spacecraft that NASA launched
into the stars, went seismic.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.930
The safety of the ship's
passenger, Colonel John Glenn,

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:14.060 position:56%
rested on the shoulders of Katherine
Johnson, a colored computer

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.350
who worked at Langley Memorial
Aeronautical Laboratory.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.400
She did the calculations
for his return to Earth.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.470
If she got them right, Colonel
Glenn would come back safely.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.090
If she did not, he would
burn up on reentry.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.840
The national held its breath.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.990
Katherine is one of four wonder
women featured in the book

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.990
"Hidden Figures" by
Margot Lee Shetterly.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.230
Reading about Mrs. Johnson and the
other three women, Dorothy Vaughan,

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.020
Mary Jackson, and Dr.
Christine Darden, inspired me

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.650
and made me feel proud
of their work.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.310
For many years, their
work was unknown,

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.030
and reading the book
helped me see areas

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.980
where I may have been discriminated

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.660
against if they had
not worked so hard.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.980
Reading about these hidden figures
raised my bar of expectation

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:08.090
for myself in my career, in my
education and future career.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.770
I met Christine after
hearing her speak

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.910
at Ebenezer Baptist Church
in Richmond, Virginia.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.420
She was not in the movie,
so unless you read the book,

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.830
Dr. Darden is the one hidden
figure who stays hidden.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.900
She talked about how kids today
don't usually strive their best

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.200
in school.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.100
She said math and science
may be difficult,

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:36.480
but studying both will
pay off in the future.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.790 position:56%
One similarity Dr. Darden and I have
is we both set educational goals

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.290
for ourselves and met them.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.930
Dr. Darden decided to get a
PhD in mechanical engineering.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.150
I decided to get scholar roll
for the last marking period

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.010
of my 5th grade school year.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.860
Reading the book, I was amazed
that American's could work

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.210
so hard and not be known.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.730
I felt angry that Katherine didn't
get credit for her own work.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.310
I felt ashamed that
America discriminated

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.950
against African Americans
because of their skin color.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:16.270
I was also proud of Katherine,
Dorothy and Mary and Christine

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.670
because they worked extremely hard

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.700
so America could explore
outer space.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.800
Also, I felt strong because I felt
maybe someday I could help continue

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.070
the greatness of NASA.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.740
I am a woman of color,
just like them.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.450
They are inspiring and
exceptional at math,

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:38.900
but I personally am
not great at math.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.110
Yet I know I should do my best

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.660
because that's what these
ladies would want for me.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.560
When I got a C in math for the
second to last marking period,

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.680
I thought, Katherine Johnson
wouldn't want this for me.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.930
I should get an A. And in the
last marking period of 5th grade,

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.380
pulled that sucker up to an A.
I felt like I could do anything.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.400 position:56%
My mom and I read the book together.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.130
We started a Facebook live group
called the Hidden Figure Sisterhood

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:14.230 position:56%
and held a Facebook live event to
talk about our opinions on the book.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.560
We talked about hidden figures
that we know in our family.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.480
My great grandmother, Annabel
Fay Brown [assumed spelling],

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.090
worked in a lab for
more than 25 years

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.320
for the United States
Department of Agriculture.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.230
My great aunt Murielle Anne Brown
Nichols [assumed spelling] has

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:35.150 position:56%
worked at Central Virginia Community
College for more than 40 years.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.330 position:56%
Today, she is vice president of
academic and student services there.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.830
I feel proud of these two women who
may be hidden figures of the world,

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.580
but they're not hidden from me.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.740
On that day, in 1962,
after 14 minutes of agony,

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.710
the nation breathed
a huge sigh of relief

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.570
when Colonel Glenn's voice was
heard again at mission control.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.350
He splashed down to Earth safely,
and the world knew his name.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:04.210
Thanks to Margot Lee Shetterly, the
world now knows the work and names

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:07.280
of Katherine Johnson,
Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Johnson,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.280
and Dr. Christine Darden.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.800
Last year, I wanted to be
a civil rights attorney

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.720
because if people don't protect our
civil rights, they will deplete.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.710
After reading "Hidden Figures," I
might want to become an astronaut

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.930
and do something to change history.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.230
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay, great.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.530
So let me ask you a question.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.630
How long did it take
you to write that essay?

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.930
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: About two weeks.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.230
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Two weeks.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.570 position:56%
And did you rewrite it over and
over again, or was it a first draft?

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.200
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: My
mom edited it for me.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.500
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: I see.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.030
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: And she was at
work and she was extremely busy.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.350
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
is she a good editor?

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.620
Does she know how to edit?

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.920
She's a good editor?

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.220
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: Yes.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.520
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.820 position:56%
And whatever happened to John Glenn?

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.330
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: He --
I actually can't remember.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.630
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.510
And do you want to be an attorney?

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.810
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: I did.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.180
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And do you
have to go to law school to do that

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.850
or you want to go to law school?

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.150
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: I did.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.410
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And you
want to go to law school?

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:09.710
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: I don't know.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You don't know.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.310
Okay. Well, if you're going to
be an attorney, it helps to go

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.610
to law school usually, but okay.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.510
So why don't you come over
and I'll give you your prize.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:23.500
[ Applause ]

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:31.830
There you go.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.130
&gt;&gt; Isla Rodriguez: Thank you.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.430
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: There you go.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.230
Okay, congratulations.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:40.560
[ Applause ]

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:47.680
Okay. So now we're ready for
the first grand prize winner,

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.280
and that person is Suzahn Vollstad,

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.110
who wrote about "A Dog's
Purpose" by Bruce Cameron.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.510
Can Suzahn please come up?

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:03.500
[ Applause ]

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.830
&gt;&gt; Suzahn Vollstad: Dear
Librarian, this spring,

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.450
I read a book that made me
see the purpose of my life,

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.280
my brother's life and
a therapy dog's life.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.140
Ever since I heard the movie

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.070
"A Dog's Purpose" was coming
out, I wanted to see it.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.870
But then I heard that
there was a book.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.700
And I knew you should read the
book before you watch the movie.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.440
So that is exactly what I did.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.730
I have never read a book
so fast in my whole life.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.030
I couldn't put it down.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.500
And when it ended, I felt like
it should have never ended.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.870
It is one of my all-time
favorite books.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.610
"A Dog's Purpose" is about a dog
that keeps on being reincarnated.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.910
Throughout each of his lives,

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:48.130
he/she went through difficult
circumstances and experiences.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.820
Although he didn't see the
greater purpose at the time,

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.170 position:56%
he later realized that each of those
different difficulties prepared him

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:58.810
for something important in
the next life or this life.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:03.290
So far, in my 11 years, I have had
some very difficult experiences

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.050
that have felt sad and unfair.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.880
This book got me to thinking that
there must be a greater purpose

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.500
to my experiences as well.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.870
For example, I watched my
brother almost die three times.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.150
With my own two eyes, I watched him
suffer through multiple strokes,

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.410
nonstop seizures, and more.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.510
Why should a 7-year-old
witness a 3-year-old boy go

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:25.810
through all of this?

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.370
After reading "A Dog's
Purpose," I can now see

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:32.010
that there must have been a
greater purpose to it all.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:37.680
And I've spent some time trying
to piece it all together.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.340
Of course, a dog is involved
with the brightest part

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.130
of my brother's story as well.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:47.110
After about two months in the
hospital with nonstop seizures,

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.900
a life-changing moment occurred.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.220
We had been given the worst
news possible about my brother.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.980
My whole family from Norway
flew in to say goodbye

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.230
because we didn't think
my brother would make it.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.750
But two therapy dogs
had another idea.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.530
Almost as soon as those magical
little dogs passed my brother's

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.210
room, he stopped seizing.

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:09.450
The whole time he was with them,
he didn't have a single seizure.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.200
He cuddled with the dogs and
almost spoke a whole sentence

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.730
in the first time in ages.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.370
Maybe the purpose of those
dogs was to save my brother.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.440
Living at Children's
National Medical Center

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.620
for five months watching
my brother, my best friend,

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:27.490
deteriorate beside me in the
hospital bed scarred me for life.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.050
But now as I look back on it,

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.850 position:56%
I realize that the entire experience
could have actually had a greater

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.450
purpose in my life
and my brother's life.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:39.990
Maybe I'm supposed to inspire or
help other kids who have siblings

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.590
with special needs, seizures
or mitochondrial disease.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.350
This got me to thinking
that I should go

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.510
to the children's support
group for seizures or volunteer

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.300
at the Children's National
Medical Center.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.010
I once went to a seizure
support group when I was 7.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.310
I was terrified.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.910 position:56%
I've come out on the other side now
of my brother's strokes and seizures

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.480
and I've accepted his diagnosis.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.150
As awful as it all had been,
well, there was a bigger purpose

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:11.920
in the difficulties my
brother and I went through.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.080
I can now help other
terrified siblings.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.410
Reading "A Dog's Purpose"
helped me to start thinking

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:23.370
of the greater purpose in my
life difficulties and experiences

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.460
and start to be more
accepting of them.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.430
I believe that those therapy
dogs made a huge impact

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.080
on the outcome of my brother.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.610
And this book helped me to see the
event from a different perspective,

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:37.580
through the perspective
of a therapy dog's life.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.940
Moreover, I've finally found a
different perspective and purpose

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.100
for my own life situations
that have been painful.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.240 position:56%
I will help other siblings with this
disease, and I hope to someday buy

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.680
and train a therapy
dog who can always be

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.610
with my brother and protect him.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.830
Sincerely, Suzahn Vollstad.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.130
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.430
Great. Let me ask her questions.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.580
So what grade are you in?

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.880
&gt;&gt; Suzahn Vollstad:
I'm going into sixth.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.180
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
You're going into sixth.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.730
And how long did it take
you to write this essay?

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.030
&gt;&gt; Suzahn Vollstad:
About two days maybe.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:10.330
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Two days.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.790
Okay. And what do you want
to be when you grow up?

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:17.060
&gt;&gt; Suzahn Vollstad: I want to be a
veterinarian or a PA like my mom.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.360
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.660
Is your brother here?

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.420
&gt;&gt; Suzahn Vollstad: Yes, he is, in
the wheelchair right over there.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.520
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.820
All right.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.770
Well, congratulations
to both of you.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.970
And come on over and
I'll give you your prize.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.770
Congratulations.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.680
&gt;&gt; Suzahn Vollstad: Thank you.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.230
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.530
Thank you.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.830
Back to you.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.130
Thank you.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.720
&gt;&gt; Eun Yang: Thank you so
much and congratulations

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.510
to all the essay winners
and everyone who wrote

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.330
and spent time this summer writing.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.210
And what a fun surprise
for those people

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.880
who knew the answers
to those two questions.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.210
Congratulations to you, too.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.930
That's terrific.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.670
These are such powerful
essays, and they make you think

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.320 position:56%
about what Suzahn wrote about, your
purpose in life, the greater purpose

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.620
in what we do every single day.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.440
I think reading and
writing helps you get closer

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.830
to figuring those things out.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.540
And I think that's why
books are so magical.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.640
They provide you with adventures.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.980
They provide you with insight.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.860
And you get to meet people
from around the world

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.570
without ever having
to leave your home.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.050
And that is one of the reasons
why I truly love reading.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.350
I have three kids.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.860
I don't get to do it as
much as I'd like to anymore,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.500
but still at the top of my
list of one of my passions.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.560
And I love the book festival
for supporting those endeavors

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.210
and supporting the
writing part of it.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.010
The writing is hard, I know it.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.870
But it's such an important
part of your learning process

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.910
and a growing process
as an individual.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:59.140
So once again, thank you
so much to Mr. Rubenstein,

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.220
Mr. Bowen, Lola, Bryonna.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.040
Thank you so much for being here.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.510
Another round of applause to all
the talented student writers.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.600
[ Applause ]

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.900
Thank you so much.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.490
And to all of you here this
afternoon, including the students

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.120
and the families, the
teachers, the librarians,

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.780
all who make this program possible.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.080
Thank you for being here.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.460
Thank you for supporting and
joining the Library of Congress

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:30.050
in nurturing this wonderful
culture of reading and writing.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.560
We honor you and your
accomplishments,

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.770
and we are so grateful
for your commitment

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.890
to scholarship and to education.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.190
Thank you, everyone.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.390
Continue to enjoy this
wonderful event.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.690
And we'll see you next year.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.610
Have a great day.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.460

of the Library of Congress.
