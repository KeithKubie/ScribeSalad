00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.313
(downbeat music)

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.974
- I want to remind everybody

00:00:22.974 --> 00:00:26.600
of the importance of
giving us little questions.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.550
We have a few, and I think I
first am to summarize briefly

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.160
or at least to wrap up,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.330
we covered scales in space and time,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.857
you saw a great number of
technology developments

00:00:43.857 --> 00:00:46.920
for imaging, constructing.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.680
There are questions you should be asking

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.530
about how do you put it all together,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.980
and a lot of questions about how

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.499
does a lot of the technology
that you saw developed

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.120
make it beyond these laboratories

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.172
where the pioneering is going on,

00:01:02.172 --> 00:01:04.060
to a greater number of sites.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.230
You saw a little bit of that,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.230
so that the community can use
these things, extensively.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.190
I think that's enough,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.430
Jennifer can now take the
questions that we've heard

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.200
and get the speakers one
by one to answer questions.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.480
Jennifer.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.111
So the way we're gonna do this is,

00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:29.097
I'm gonna be sort of asking questions

00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:31.882
that I've gotten from people

00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:36.480
related to the first
part of the symposium,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.230
and Mark will query the second group.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.230
So actually let's start
with Daniel Colon-Ramos,

00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:46.570
if you could come up here,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.320
there's a couple questions for you.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.500
So the first question is,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.280
how does architecture and development

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.420
of the C. elegans brain emerge?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.850
Are there fundamental principles

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.850
that you've been able to see?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.550
- Right, so, for the most
part it's still a mystery,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.040
we don't know all the
organizing principles.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.380
We do know some that we have
uncovered over the years.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.520
A surprising result that we had early on

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.362
was the discovery that, usually
when you form a synapse,

00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:23.240
the synapse is formed
by a presynaptic cell

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.730
contacting a postsynaptic cell,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.930
and that's in every textbook

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.062
and in every cartoon
diagram you can imagine.

00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:31.920
And we discovered that
there's a third cell,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.120
which is a glia cell, that
is acting as a matchmaker.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.660
So the presynaptic cell is not talking

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.930
to the postsynaptic
cell until the very end.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.411
Instead, the glia cell
talks to a presynaptic cell

00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:45.310
and tells it to form synapses.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.130
It also, at the same time,
talks to the postsynaptic cell

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.668
and tells it to come to where
the presynaptic cell is,

00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:53.860
and then it matches them.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.880
So that's an organizing principle

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.790
that we think is gonna be conserved,

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.845
actually has been shown to be conserved,

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.250
and might be important.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.690
- And one other question relates to,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.260
how could you get better imaging?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.990
What are the limitation,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.420
could you image all movements of the worm?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.280
- Right, so, I'll answer
that question by saying,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.430
in today's talk including Jennifer's talk

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.880
and the talks we just saw,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.710
there are different levels of imaging.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.960
You can image activity,
you can image the tissue,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.210
you can image single cells,
you can image subcellularly.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.590
And I think that that
level of understanding

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.153
is gonna be necessary.

00:03:35.153 --> 00:03:39.000
We are limited by the number of colors

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.395
that we have available,
which I love your talk,

00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:43.510
talking about the spectral imaging,

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.371
I'm gonna go back and look into that.

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:50.371
We are also limited by the temporal scale,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.480
I mean we can image for
prolonged periods of time,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.730
which is very enabling, right now,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.440
but being able also to image
for prolonged periods of times

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.670
at even higher resolution

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.999
and multiple things at the
same time will be fantastic.

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:06.480
- And that is, come on over,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.110
what are the cyclical shape
changes in the dendritic spines,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.000
that you had mentioned?

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.206
And what is the purpose of these changes?

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:19.990
What are the correlated with?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.720
- So, there are a number of
changes that have been described

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.410
that are associated with
development of spines.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.410
So as I showed you, one
shot of the fragile X mouse,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.900
where there's a specific protein

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.260
associated with chaperoning
messenger RNA that is mutated,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.380
and the spines seem to keep
trying to find a partner,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.930
and never mature into what's
the typical mushroom shape.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.680
So part of the variation
that you saw in those images

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.690
has to do with whether or
not you're in the process

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.830
of partnering up, and you
complete the partnering up.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.980
Then there are activities
related to spine enlargement

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.050
that have been described,

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.350
associated with long-term potentiation,

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.500
which are well documented.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.430
Some people believe,

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.150
and there's some evidence
in the literature,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.920
that there are actomyosin interactions

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.830
closer to the top of the neck,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.590
before you get into the
bulb part of the spine.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.840
So the spine has some actin modulation.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.810
Then, there are studies
just recently published,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.600
we participated in these
in February, in Science,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.600
showing that if, and this
is from Chiara Cirelli,

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.930
and Tononi, I think I got the name right,

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.910
showing that dendritic
spines, the majority of them,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.910
shrink by 20% if you've been
sleeping about three hours,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.020
or at least if a mouse has been sleeping

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.020
at the time that you harvest the tissue.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.070
So, predict, and I guess
I'm allowed to do that,

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.500
that spines go through a cycle, day night.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.940
And that when you're learning something

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.030
and your postsynaptic
process has been facilitated,

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.399
it holds that state for a while.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:28.990
But then somehow you have to transfer

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.410
whatever that information is

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.437
that's been encoded in the
dendrite to stabilize that neuron

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:39.280
in a way that that information is stored

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.350
in that region of the brain.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.500
So that so-called
downscaling of the response,

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.390
the LTP response, has to
be translated, perhaps,

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.380
into differences in the
connectivity between those neurons.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.380
Probably their inhibition, by
activating synapse formation

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.130
by the inhibitory interneurons.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.610
So that's the kind of state
of thinking at this point.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.800
- The question for Na is,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.770
do you see calcium being released

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.690
from astrocytes in addition to neurons?

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.730
If so, how are they different?

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.650
- That's a great question.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.100
The technology we have

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.500
can definitely be applied to astrocyces

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.397
but we haven't tried that yet.

00:07:28.397 --> 00:07:30.940
But there is a big community of people

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.030
who are doing calcium
imaging in astrocytes.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.040
So I would imagine there
must be some difference.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.480
I think in general the time
transient is much smaller,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.939
and it doesn't have this stereotypical

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:46.810
kind of impulse function shape.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.840
And actually the Brain Initiative

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.240
has a new call for proposals

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.400
where they would like
people to develop probes

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.770
as well as data analysis
methods for astrocytes,

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.800
because they are behaving
quite differently from neurons.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.610
But I don't have personal
experience with it.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.994
- Okay, next is Erik Jorgensen.

00:08:10.994 --> 00:08:15.994
Can you speculate on what
controls ultra-fast endocytosis?

00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:18.730
At the different temperatures.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.899
Is it ATP, or enzymes, what do you think

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:27.420
is causing that switch in
the mode of endocytosis?

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.757
- Right, so we think that
the most likely change

00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:34.600
is in the lipid, the nature of the lipid.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.480
So as you cool lipids,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.288
they will eventually go
into a gel-like state,

00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:43.860
which will disallow the
sort of shape changes

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.640
that we think are going on.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.810
In particular PIP2 shows some
very bizarre interactions

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.530
between moving between room
temperature and 37 degrees,

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.960
so the fluidity increases.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.550
And so that has something
to do with the head group.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.408
The second thing we think that is going on

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:02.892
is that the fatty acid tails

00:09:02.892 --> 00:09:04.720
that are anchored in the membrane

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.550
also are having a strong effect,

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.550
and so particularly for, so
nematodes live at 20 degrees,

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.140
that's not a problem.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.680
But if you raise an animal at 25 degrees

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.870
and you drop it to 20 degrees
it can't move anymore.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.330
If you raise an animal at
15 degrees, it moves fine.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.330
And so what we are finding is
that fatty acid desaturases

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.710
are what allows these animals
to move better at 15 degrees.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.540
So in the end we think it's going to be

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.200
the head groups of the lipids
and the fatty acid tails.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.993
- Don't go anywhere,

00:09:41.993 --> 00:09:44.190
because you got a couple more questions.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.530
Have you attempted electrical
stimulation of the synapse

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:52.530
that mimics actual action
potentials in the axon?

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.350
If accurate, exocytosis would not occur

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.797
with every stimulation,

00:09:57.797 --> 00:10:00.120
the number of fused
vesicles might be different

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.630
under these circumstances.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.470
- Yeah so, what we'd
love to do is to drive

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.300
to clamp the cell with a real

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.760
honest to God action potential.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.750
We've of course not been able to do that,

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.117
this is just simply an
electrical field stimulation.

00:10:16.117 --> 00:10:18.590
And it's absolutely possible

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.530
that the shape of the action
potential will have an effect.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.310
Certainly the temperature
of an action potential

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.845
will cause it to widen,

00:10:26.845 --> 00:10:30.630
and also causes calcium
channels to open slowly.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.989
So, these are things that we know happen,

00:10:32.989 --> 00:10:35.700
and we're not able to
do that in our system,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.930
we really need to be able to
voltage clamp those cells,

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.970
and then you can only do
that in the calyx of Held,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.450
or some other of these cells

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.290
that have large presynaptic terminals.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.730
- One last question. (laughs)

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.972
If you calculate the depletion of vesicles

00:10:51.972 --> 00:10:54.171
and the renewal rate,

00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:59.171
is the 30-second endocytosis
number that you came up with

00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:01.620
at the low temperature significant?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.250
- I think the question is,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.950
can you actually replenish vesicles

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.170
using clathrin mediated endocytosis

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.660
given that there's 200 synaptic vesicles

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.148
at a hippocampal synapse.

00:11:16.148 --> 00:11:20.140
And the answer is no,
but we don't really know,

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.210
and it may be worse than that

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.240
because we're not convinced that all

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.840
of the vesicles we see by EM
are actually synaptic vesicles

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.170
but rather may be storage depot,

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.120
the reserve pools maybe, not actually,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.780
even though they look
like synaptic vesicles,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.410
may not be synaptic vesicles.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.810
- Okay, I'm gonna turn
it over to Mark now,

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.730
who's got questions for the
second group of speakers.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.810
- Jennifer, does organelle interaction

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.810
estimated by light microscopy
match with EM studies?

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.610
What's the resolution
obtained by light microscopy?

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.410
- That's a really great question.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.134
Basically, when we created
the organelle interactome,

00:12:03.134 --> 00:12:06.820
we counted as a contact,

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.540
when two organelles share the same pixel,

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.640
which was 160 nanometers.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.640
And that's fairly big, so
there could be some overlap

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.830
that was not relevant,

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.801
but I should emphasize
that the tethering proteins

00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:29.050
that are known to tether
two organelles together,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.872
like the VAP protein that I showed,

00:12:31.872 --> 00:12:34.640
extend about 100 nanometers or more

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.438
off from the surface of
the organelle of interest.

00:12:37.438 --> 00:12:40.473
But really to that point,

00:12:40.473 --> 00:12:45.473
one of the projects in our lab
is, we've created fret probes

00:12:45.689 --> 00:12:50.120
to look at fret interactions,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.770
which take you down into
the nanometric level

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:57.680
that would be approximating
electron microscopy resolution,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.260
to map out frequency of interactions

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.640
between different sets of organelles.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.230
But we're just doing that two by two.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.090
We've yet to calculate
the extent of interaction

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.781
from the electron micrograph images,

00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:17.960
just because of the time that is required

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.530
to segment all of those organelles,

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.840
and to do that in a whole cell
is still quite challenging.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.600
- So one more while Jennifer's here.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.520
What machine learning framework is used

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.900
to train and evaluate
an imaging segmentation

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.070
in order to build the 3D model?

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.980
- Well we didn't use any

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.670
machine learning system at this point,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.078
because some of these
organelles, like the ER,

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:49.770
although we tried to work
with different people

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.050
to see whether there'd be a way

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:55.250
that we could train a computational system

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.580
to learn how to call an
ER in a particular slice,

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.680
it just didn't work.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.280
So we did everything
by hand at this point.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.420
And this is a big area that
I think needs further work

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.310
from the machine learning crowd.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.560
- So this is a related question,
not directed to anybody.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.010
So, are machine learning and
deep learning used already

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.690
to analyze the brain, map
imaging functionality,

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.820
with what research labs, Kavli, et cetera,

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.440
plan to collaborate to apply
deep learning algorithms.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.850
So does anybody want to address that?

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.120
I can make some comments,
and Harold can probably.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.390
I can start it with, at least my group

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.840
has worked extensively
with different groups,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.120
Tolga Tasdizen in Utah, to do
deep learning for organelles,

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.880
successfully at this point.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.300
Many of these approaches,
when they're first cooked,

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.500
require considerable knowledge,

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.020
so you have to make a template,

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.210
you have to do the work first by hand

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.500
in order to have a training data set

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.680
in order to let computational processes

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.460
and algorithms that are being
cooked up quite effectively

00:15:29.704 --> 00:15:33.012
to find at least a solution
that's as good as yours.

00:15:33.012 --> 00:15:36.900
And that's the way the
judgments are being done.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.740
So, most of the labs that are doing this

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.700
still are employing
teams of undergraduates,

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.712
supervised by the most effective

00:15:47.712 --> 00:15:51.160
graduate student or postdoc,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.591
who manages people kinda like
a McDonald's crew or whatever,

00:15:55.591 --> 00:16:00.510
to actually get the ground truth.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.920
Then it involves, usually,
using big computers.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.250
Expensive, cycle supercomputers.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:13.250
So all the ER in a single Purkinje cell,

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.470
done that way, initially
for us, which I didn't show,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.220
was a million CPU hours,

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.980
between the training the algorithm

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.640
and then executing on it.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.610
That, with computer graphics cards, GPUs,

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.730
once the software that
you've decided works,

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.140
is shown to work properly, is ported,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.891
and then it can be made available

00:16:40.891 --> 00:16:44.430
on a small group of machines

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.370
that might cost a laboratory
10, $15,000 to put together.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.690
So I think that's the
direction that it goes.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.680
But right now, for example,
Jenalia is relying on Google

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.950
to do them a big favor.

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:04.728
Okay, so, that's the
machine learning question.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.070
Now, this one is for Philipp.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.770
Do you think you could
add 4Pi capabilities

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.030
to your four-sided light sheet system?

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.030
First you have to explain
to them what that means.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.720
- Sure, so, the short answer
is yes you can do that,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.270
but it wouldn't make any
sense for our experiments.

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:30.950
And it's not an obvious
thing, so let me explain.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.440
I mean basically, the 4Pi approach

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.830
just means that you have
two opposing objectives

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.780
aimed at the sample, and so,

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.370
actually one of the slides I showed today

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.920
relates to the interest you
might have in that arrangement,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.601
which is that usually you
don't collect all of the light

00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:49.910
with a conventional objective

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.640
with a limited collection angle,

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.540
a limited numerical aperture.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.520
So ideally you want the aperture
to be as big as possible,

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.994
and ideally you want to
completely envelope your sample.

00:17:59.994 --> 00:18:01.700
With your detection system

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.873
you can really grab all of the photons

00:18:04.873 --> 00:18:08.380
you can get out of the specimen.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.940
Which relates to signal
collection efficiency,

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.350
but also directly to spatial resolution.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.690
And so with the 4Pi approach,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.940
you just have the 4Pi spatial angle,

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.230
you have full access to the sample,

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.840
and you can combine it
with other principles,

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.280
such as standing structured
patterned illumination,

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.470
where you can go to
sub-wavelength resolution

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.260
by just having counter-propagating waves

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.800
set from multiple objectives
that are facing each other.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.344
So there's a lot of potential

00:18:38.344 --> 00:18:40.730
in having these more complex arrangements,

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.910
but all of them rely on the concept

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.950
of very precise wavefront control.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.380
So you're assuming that you will get,

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.850
for example you do the
structured illumination approach,

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.430
that you can get very
precise interference pattern

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.900
inside the sample, so that
you're making an assumption

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.830
about what happens to the
light inside the sample.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.410
And so all of the
specimens we're looking at,

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.540
the drosophila larvae, the
zebrafish, the zebrafish brains,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.820
zebrafish brain might
be probably the closest

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.310
to making this possible, but even there,

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.830
we are really perturbing the beams,

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:12.663
we are perturbing the wavefront.

00:19:12.663 --> 00:19:15.740
And the errors that we
accumulate in the wavefront

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.440
are a much larger order of magnitude

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.880
than what level of precise
spatial control you would need

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.846
in order to get the resolution
enhancing effects to work.

00:19:25.846 --> 00:19:27.870
And so for the most part
we just don't really have

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.870
enough penetration and control
to use these approaches.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.018
So in the future you could
potentially improve this

00:19:35.018 --> 00:19:37.236
with adaptive optics techniques.

00:19:37.236 --> 00:19:39.568
So you can sort of bend
the light back into shape

00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:42.035
to some extent by mapping this out.

00:19:42.035 --> 00:19:44.390
But then there's still the
problem of light scattering

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.620
and so on that is much harder to resolve,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.350
so I think it's an interesting
direction for the future

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.730
but right now sort of like
not the most obvious thing

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.480
that we would want to push forward.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.810
- Have you looked at axons in the vicinity

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.610
of different types of plaques
in the Alzheimer brains?

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.680
- Okay, well, I'm not the
person in Alzheimer disease,

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:10.840
so we didn't go into,
very much, the plaques,

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.240
so there's controversy whether or not,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.810
which, axon or dendrites
have more neuritis.

00:20:26.129 --> 00:20:28.700
I like that debate.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.440
So, yes, actually I have to confess,

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.540
we tried to look at the axon,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.400
so the involvement of the
axon in the plaque formation,

00:20:40.914 --> 00:20:45.914
but we didn't do that very much yet.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.310
But I'm glad somebody asked me.

00:20:53.698 --> 00:20:54.531
(audience laughing)

00:20:54.531 --> 00:20:55.770
We hope to do it.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.888
- I asked. (laughing)

00:20:59.888 --> 00:21:02.888
(audience laughing)

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.220
- So, we tried to distinguish
the axon and the dendrites

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:19.220
by some ways, and we didn't
get any good, the antibodies,

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.890
but we need that, you can do it.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.170
- So, to turn this into
a brief discussion,

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.593
so part of the problem is that the axons

00:21:30.593 --> 00:21:33.910
that go to the vicinity
of the neuritic plaques,

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.870
this is from analyzing biopsy samples

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.150
that we did 35 years ago,

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:44.910
is that of course the
microtubules have depolymerized,

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.470
and tau is now stuck in the soma,

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.070
so the markers that you'd normally use

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.150
to say that's an axon are not there,

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.820
but if you look ultrastructurally,

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:01.820
the plaque area is toxic to the axons.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.380
And then you have retrograde degeneration.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.480
So, if there were another marker,

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.400
rather than the traditional markers,

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.190
or if you could do it with an animal

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.790
that had some sort of labeled
lipids of the membrane,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.280
you might see it in a more effective way

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.610
than the small samples that we did in the,

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.380
I would call it the dark ages.

00:22:27.318 --> 00:22:29.710
- So maybe I add one more thing.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:33.430
So we are now more interested
in the diffused plaques

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.990
than the cored plaques.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.450
So the cored plaques have
very nice, clear boundaries,

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:44.450
so maybe proximity can
be analyzed in depth.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:51.260
But diffuse plaques have
very ambiguous boundaries,

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.109
it's more of a challenge

00:22:53.109 --> 00:22:57.860
concerning the interaction
with other objects.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:02.300
So, yep, cored plaques
are maybe a good target.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.800
- Yeah, longer discussion,
maybe, with Dai I or something.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.290
So this, I think this
is the last question,

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.390
and it's for Alipasha.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.510
I love this question, I didn't ask it.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.920
Please comment on the
relationship of your finding

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.610
to the field of mathematical
modeling of neuronal dynamics.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.445
Good luck.

00:23:32.445 --> 00:23:35.290
(audience laughing)

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.700
- Well, I think, I don't know exactly

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.380
how to answer this question
because it is quite broad,

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.840
so what I can say is that,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.660
we hope that our methods provide at least,

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.420
within some constraints, the information

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.020
that can be then used for
various modeling approaches.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.105
So one thing I can say is that,

00:23:56.105 --> 00:23:58.616
one thing that we are trying to do,

00:23:58.616 --> 00:24:01.170
is relate it to cortical computation.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.687
So there is an ongoing project

00:24:02.687 --> 00:24:07.687
that is aimed at recording
the entire cortical column,

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.370
map it, map the dynamic onto
the structural information

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.218
that we can get via electron microscopy,

00:24:14.218 --> 00:24:18.230
to confine a model, and then try to build

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.230
generative computational models

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.860
that would be describing the dynamic,

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.110
and thereby work towards the algorithms

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.530
that are for instance underlying

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.830
as that animal has been engaged

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.881
in an object recognition task,

00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:34.780
and trying to see whether
we can work backwards.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.450
But, this is all I can say at this moment.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.309
- So, I think with that,
unless someone wants

00:24:43.309 --> 00:24:46.040
to make an airplane out of a card

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.930
and send it up here pretty fast,

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.810
we've gotten through all the
questions that came from cards,

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.620
which puts Nick Spitzer on

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:58.090
for an in-depth summary
of the meeting. (laughing)

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.210
(audience laughing)

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.080
- Well, we are approaching
the end of our day,

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.120
and a very exciting day it's been.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.750
You put it very well earlier, Mark,

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:13.000
characterizing this as a
very illuminating experience,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
and I think that's an understatement.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.994
Illuminating across scales of
time, across scales of space,

00:25:19.994 --> 00:25:24.994
and Alipasha, I liked your
response to that last question

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.440
because I think that with new tools,

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:33.440
we see an ever more expanded scope,

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.640
the way in which neurons and other cells

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.110
that some claim have an important role,

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:43.930
are interacting in the brain.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.090
And this then leads us, as it led you,

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.700
to suggest that there
may be reorganization

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.560
on different time scales and
spatial scales of activity

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.350
that we did not guess at

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:59.400
without actually being able to
see the larger scale of data.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.184
So there are many people to thank here.

00:26:02.184 --> 00:26:07.184
I want to thank, particularly,
Jennifer and Mark

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.360
for bringing us together here
and organizing the symposium.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:17.160
I want to particularly
thank the featured speakers,

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.260
all of them, spectacular,
and really exciting data

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.450
that is fun to watch.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.790
And I do want to take a quick moment

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.210
to thank again the KIBM staff,

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.870
I think they're probably
no longer with us,

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.870
but they have done a fantastic
job behind the scenes,

00:26:38.098 --> 00:26:41.020
and in front of the scenes,
putting this together for us.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.214
And finally, I want to thank
all of you in the audience

00:26:43.214 --> 00:26:48.214
for attending, for your
interest, and for your questions.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.310
It's been a great day, thanks very much.

00:26:52.724 --> 00:26:56.240
(audience applauding)

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.270
And we hope that you'll
be back in the future

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:04.270
for a series of future KIBM symposia.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.830
Thanks again.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.247
