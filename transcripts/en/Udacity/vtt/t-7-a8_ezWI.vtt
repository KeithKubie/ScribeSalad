00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.794
Let's try putting all these properties of powers together to answer this

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:07.801
question. What would be this in simplified form? Write your bases and your

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:11.843
exponents. This time, for the numbers, I actually want you to multiply them

00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:16.591
together. For example, if 2 squared times 3 squared was in your answer, I would

00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:20.582
want you to write that as 4 times 9, or 36. 36 should be the coefficient in

00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:24.856
front of the box. Don't use the powers. This is a pretty tough problem, so take

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:29.086
your time with it. I don't expect you to get it right on the first time, but I

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:33.608
do want you to play around with the exponents. Try expanding this, and see what

00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:34.091
you get.
