Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. What's the benefit of grass fed beef over regular beef? I know there is a benefit but I don't, I don't, I never can recall correctly. It's something to do with the small central fatty acid ratios. Yeah, cause grain you're gonna, you're gonna have more of the omega six fatty acids which have been unfairly vilified meaning that a lot of people are just like don't eat any Omega sixes. Don't have any arachidonic acid. Like don't, don't overdo your seeds or nuts. Your nut butter. Kind of like the the orthorexic health world as a whole. You know like when you read nutrition magazines and stuff, they're like do your Omega threes but be careful. Americans have a 20 to one omega six to Omega three ratio, but the problem is that Omega six is, that's a lot of those are derived from what are called parent essential oils.

Speaker 1:          00:46          And your cell membranes need a certain amount of omega six fatty acids from seeds and nuts and plants and even to a certain extent grains. And when you have an excess of Omega threes and not enough, we'll mega six is because you're going so far into the fish oil category than it actually damages is a component of your, your mitochondrial membrane called Cardio Liben. You actually make less of that interfere with normal cellular activity. What seeds are most beneficial? Uh, uh, I would imagine the most nutrient dense ones, so specific Wiseman's Macadamia. I mean what I is like almonds, macadamia nuts, Brazil nuts. I just don't eat the quasi nuts like peanuts, which are, you know, they're not as high in nutrient density. They're more of a legume than a nut. Um, I, a lot of my nuts either raw or lightly roasted, you always look at the label to make sure they didn't put a lot of vegetable oil.

Speaker 1:          01:42          And Canola oil in them a little, you know, I'm a fan of nuts in in moderate my nuts. Like you're nuts if you are going to have to shell them. Right? Like if you've ever had to shell a walnut, you're not going to eat 30 walnuts cause that'd be exhausting, right? [inaudible] like yeah. [inaudible] shell. It's annoying as hell but keeps you from eating too many of them. I buy them shelled and I eat fistfuls of them. Yeah. Like last night I like a half a bag of pistachios are great for your microbiome to, yeah. I actually had a couple of research studies on that last year that showed an improvement in the diversity of the bacteria in your gut with pistachios. That's one of the nuts as good for your by probably because of the fiber content in pistachios, but grass fed versus grain fed is primarily the omega three fatty acids may have less of the arachidonic acid, less of the potentially inflammatory omega six fatty acids.

Speaker 1:          02:35          There's probably part of it being that grass fed grass finished beef is generally raised on a farm that's using less herbicides, less pesticides, raising their meat and more sustainable fashion. You know, giving it less hormones, giving less antibiotics. That's painting with a broad brush. But generally grass fed, there's more to it than just the fatty acid composition. It's just a better meat overall. In my, well better health wise grain fed beef, I will not lie like you can, you can have a pretty damn tasty fatty cut of grain fed beef. Certainly can. But I honestly prefer the taste of grass fed. I liked the denser meet, the darker meat, I liked it better. It's just, to me it just, it just tastes healthier. I just, my, I crave it more, you know? And when I go back and forth between the two of them, when I eat grain fed, it feels like, like a lazy cow.

Speaker 1:          03:24          Like it's mushy and it's got like, it's good, it's delicious. Don't get me wrong, but there's a difference. It's kind of funny cause I, I've gone over to Dubai a few times and tall like fitness conferences over there and they advertise grain fed like they want everybody to, like when you go to the restaurant is like, this beef is the finest grain fed beef, fat Peter Luger's, which a lot of grain pretty widely recognized as the greatest steakhouse in the world that places all graces that trip. I actually, I didn't like my steak is how fucking dare you. I know you're going to get, I'm going to get killed. Some rude Brooklyn waiter's going to take me out. But uh, I didn't like it. What would you like it just something about like, the meat just tasted, it tasted like it was drenched in vegetable oil. Like something about it just didn't taste right and maybe I had a poor Peter Luger's experience that doesn't even make sense. I did not enjoy it that much. Food. I ate there and afterwards I'm like, I don't think it gets better, I don't think. Yeah.
