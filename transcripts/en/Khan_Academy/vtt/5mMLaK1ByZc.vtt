00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:02.793
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:04.881
So this is what I might
call a more optional video.

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:06.891
In the last couple videos, I talked about

00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:08.601
this multivariable chain rule,

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.805
and I give some justification.

00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:11.779
And it might have been considered

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.477
a little bit hand-wavy by some.

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:14.768
I was doing a lot of things

00:00:14.768 --> 00:00:17.040
that looked kind of
like taking a derivative

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.430
with respect to t, and
then multiplying that

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.193
by an infinitesimal quantity, dt,

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:23.092
and thinking of canceling those out.

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:24.705
And some people might say, "Ah!

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:25.755
"But this isn't really a fraction.

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.152
"That's a derivative, that's
a differential operator,

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:29.931
"and you're treating it incorrectly."

00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:31.740
And while that's true,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.781
the intuitions underlying a lot of this

00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:35.710
actually matches with the
formal argument pretty well.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.572
So what I wanna do here is just talk about

00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:40.155
what the formal argument behind

00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:42.937
the multivariable chain rule is,

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:46.345
and just to remind ourselves
of the setup of where we are.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.515
You're thinking of v as
a vector-valued function,

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.377
so this is something that
takes as an input, t,

00:00:51.377 --> 00:00:52.774
that lives on a number line,

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:56.941
and then v maps this to some
kind of high-dimensional space.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.697
In the simplest case, you
might just think of that

00:01:00.697 --> 00:01:01.860
as a two-dimensional space,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.012
maybe it's three-dimensional space.

00:01:04.012 --> 00:01:05.454
Or it could be 100-dimensional.

00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:06.917
You don't have to literally
be visualizing it.

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:09.381
And then f, our function f,

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.621
somehow takes that 100-dimensional space,

00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:13.333
or two-dimensional, or three-dimensional,

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.584
whatever it is,

00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:16.665
and then maps it onto the number line.

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:19.264
So the overall effect of
the composition function

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:21.884
is to just take a real
number to a real number

00:01:21.884 --> 00:01:23.164
so it's a single-variable function.

00:01:23.164 --> 00:01:25.616
So that's where we're taking
this ordinary derivative,

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:27.754
rather than a partial
derivative, or gradient,

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.236
or anything like that.

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:31.374
But because it goes through
a multi-dimensional space,

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:34.337
and you have this intermediary,
multivariable nature to it,

00:01:34.337 --> 00:01:36.014
that's why you have a gradient,

00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:37.221
and a vector-value derivative.

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:39.339
With the formal argument,
the first thing you might do

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:42.890
is just write out the formal
definition of a derivative.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.580
And in this case,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.893
it's a limit.

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:48.145
Definitions of derivatives
are always gonna be

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:50.577
some kind of limit as a
variable goes to zero.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.831
And here, you're loosely
thinking about h as being dt.

00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:55.270
And you could write delta t,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.350
but it's common to use h
just because that can be used

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.919
for whatever your
differential quantity is.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.527
So that's on the denominator,

00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:02.725
'cause you're thinking of it as dt.

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:05.774
And the top is whatever the change

00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:07.347
to this whole function is

00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:09.770
when you nudge that input by t.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.631
And what I mean by that
is you'll take f of v,

00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:16.131
not of t, but of t plus h,

00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:18.545
that kind of nudged output value,

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:20.826
and you're wondering how different that is

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:24.576
from f of v of t, the
original value, v of t.

00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:28.656
So this is what happens
when you just apply

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:30.485
the formal definition of the derivative,

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:34.529
the ordinary derivative, to
your composition function.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.188
And now, what do you do

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:38.816
as you're trying to reason
about what this should equal?

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:40.003
And a good place to start, actually,

00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:41.957
is to look back to the
intuition that I was giving

00:02:41.957 --> 00:02:44.187
for the multivariable chain
rule in the first place.

00:02:44.187 --> 00:02:47.376
You imagine nudging your input by some dt,

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:49.235
some tiny change, and I was saying,

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.443
oh, so that causes a change

00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:53.128
in the intermediary space

00:02:53.128 --> 00:02:55.295
of some kind of, you know,

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:58.479
you could call it dv,
a change in the vector.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.356
And the way that you're thinking that,

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:00.873
that as you take the
vector value derivative

00:03:00.873 --> 00:03:05.136
and multiply it by dt, it's
the proportionality constant

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:07.866
between the size of your nudge
and the resulting vector.

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:10.689
And loosely, you might imagine
those dt's crossing out

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.146
as if they were fractions.

00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:13.379
It doesn't really matter.

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.899
And then you say, "What does this change?"

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.506
This change by a dv cause for f,

00:03:17.506 --> 00:03:20.662
and by definition, the resulting nudge

00:03:20.662 --> 00:03:23.030
to the output space of f

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.525
is the directional
derivative in the direction

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:29.211
of whatever your vector
nudge is of the function f.

00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:30.794
So this is the loose intuition,

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.162
and where does that
carry over to formality?

00:03:33.162 --> 00:03:36.093
You say, "Well, in this
intermediary space,

00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:38.304
"we have to deal with the
vector value derivative of v."

00:03:38.304 --> 00:03:39.873
So it might be a good thing to just

00:03:39.873 --> 00:03:41.878
write down that definition, right?

00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:42.900
Write down the fact

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.369
that the definition for the
vector value derivative of v,

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:48.910
again, it looks almost identical.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.304
All these derivative definitions

00:03:50.304 --> 00:03:52.704
really do look kind of the same

00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:56.243
'cause what you're doing
is you're taking the limit

00:03:56.243 --> 00:03:57.852
as h goes to zero,

00:03:57.852 --> 00:04:00.974
h we're still thinking of as being dt.

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:02.298
So that kind of sits on the bottom.

00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:05.095
But here you're just wondering
how your vector changes.

00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:07.561
And the difference, even though
we're kind of writing this

00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:09.867
the same way, and it looks
almost identical notationally,

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:14.204
what's on the numerator
here, this v of t plus h,

00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:16.568
and this v of t, these are vectors.

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:18.509
So this is kind of a
vector minus a vector.

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:19.554
When you take the limit,

00:04:19.554 --> 00:04:21.159
you're getting a limiting vector,

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.899
something in your high-dimensional space.

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:24.229
It's not just a number.

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.878
And now, another way to write this,

00:04:25.878 --> 00:04:27.571
one that's more helpful,

00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:29.271
more conducive to manipulation,

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:32.080
is to say not that it equals
the limit of this value,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.479
and I'm gonna go ahead and
just copy this value here,

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.810
kind of down here, and say,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.176
the value of our derivative

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:43.509
actually equals this, subject
to some kind of error,

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.527
which I'll just write as E of h,

00:04:45.527 --> 00:04:47.830
like an error function of h.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.894
And what you should be thinking is that

00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:51.877
that error function goes
to zero as h goes to zero.

00:04:51.877 --> 00:04:53.641
This is just writing
things so that we're able

00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:55.858
to manipulate it a little bit more easily.

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:58.669
So I'll give ourselves some room here.

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.324
And what you can do with this

00:05:00.324 --> 00:05:02.211
is multiply all sides by h.

00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:05.720
So this is our vector value derivative,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.220
just rewriting it.

00:05:08.177 --> 00:05:10.381
Multiply it by h.

00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:11.929
And you're thinking of this h as a dt,

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:13.021
so maybe in the back of your mind,

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.207
you're kind of thinking of
canceling this dt with the h.

00:05:15.207 --> 00:05:18.736
And what it equals is this
top, this numerator here,

00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:20.653
which was v of t plus h

00:05:23.407 --> 00:05:24.490
minus v of t.

00:05:26.103 --> 00:05:27.355
And in the back of your mind,

00:05:27.355 --> 00:05:30.710
you might be thinking,
this whole thing represents

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.856
dv, a change in v.

00:05:32.856 --> 00:05:35.126
So the idea of canceling
out that dt with the h

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.456
really does kind of come through here.

00:05:36.456 --> 00:05:37.904
But the difference between the more

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.874
hand-waving argument before
of canceling those out

00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:41.341
and what we're doing here

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:45.693
is now we're accounting
for that error function.

00:05:45.693 --> 00:05:47.214
In this case it's now multiplied by h

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:51.007
'cause everything was
multiplied by h error function.

00:05:51.007 --> 00:05:53.857
And there's actually another
way that I'm gonna write this.

00:05:53.857 --> 00:05:56.981
There's a very useful
convention in analysis

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.751
where I'll take something like this

00:05:58.751 --> 00:05:59.739
and instead I'll write it

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:01.156
as little o of h.

00:06:02.508 --> 00:06:04.189
And this isn't literally a function.

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:06.544
It's just a stand-in to
say whatever this is,

00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:07.832
whatever function that represents,

00:06:07.832 --> 00:06:11.884
it satisfies the property that
when we take that function

00:06:11.884 --> 00:06:13.540
and divide it by h,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.367
that will go to zero as
h goes to zero, right?

00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:18.842
Which is true here because
you imagine taking this

00:06:18.842 --> 00:06:20.597
and dividing by h, and that would be,

00:06:20.597 --> 00:06:23.154
this h cancels out and you
just have your error function

00:06:23.154 --> 00:06:24.205
is gonna go to zero.

00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:27.663
So now what I do is I use
this entire expression

00:06:27.663 --> 00:06:29.996
to write this v of t plus h.

00:06:31.134 --> 00:06:32.110
And the reason I wanna do that

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.886
if we kind of scroll back up

00:06:33.886 --> 00:06:36.700
is because we see v of t plus h showing up

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.739
in the original definition we care about.

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:42.051
So this is just a way of
starting to get a grapple on that

00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:44.778
a little bit more firmly.

00:06:44.778 --> 00:06:48.945
So what I'd write, I'd say
that that v of t plus h,

00:06:49.898 --> 00:06:53.172
v of t plus h, that nudged output value,

00:06:53.172 --> 00:06:56.823
is equal to the original
value that I have, v of t

00:06:56.823 --> 00:07:00.257
plus, and it's gonna be
plus this derivative term,

00:07:00.257 --> 00:07:01.966
and you can kind of think that it's almost

00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:04.218
like a Taylor polynomial,

00:07:04.218 --> 00:07:06.497
where this is our first order term.

00:07:06.497 --> 00:07:08.854
We're evaluating it at whatever that t is,

00:07:08.854 --> 00:07:11.229
but we're multiplying it
by the value of that nudge,

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.370
that linear term.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.930
And then the rest of the stuff
is just some little o of h.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.564
And maybe you'd say,
"Shouldn't you be subtracting

00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:19.602
"off that little o of h?"

00:07:19.602 --> 00:07:20.869
And it's not an actual function.

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:22.749
It just represents anything that shrinks.

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:25.215
And maybe I should say
it's the absolute value,

00:07:25.215 --> 00:07:27.485
like the magnitude, 'cause in this case,

00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:29.324
this is a vector-valued quantity.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.739
You know, that error is a vector.

00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:33.056
So it's the size of that vector

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:36.223
divided by the size of h goes to zero.

00:07:37.584 --> 00:07:39.313
So this is the main tool that
we're gonna end up using.

00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:41.646
This is the way to represent

00:07:42.573 --> 00:07:44.366
v of t plus h.

00:07:44.366 --> 00:07:47.065
And now if we go back up
to the original definition

00:07:47.065 --> 00:07:48.714
of the vector value derivative,

00:07:48.714 --> 00:07:52.025
and I'll go ahead and copy that,

00:07:52.025 --> 00:07:54.275
go ahead and copy that guy.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.620
Little bit of debris.

00:08:04.303 --> 00:08:06.150
So copy that original definition

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.045
for the ordinary derivative
of the composition function,

00:08:10.045 --> 00:08:11.650
and now when I write things in according

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.307
to all the manipulations that we just did,

00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:17.320
this is really, it's still a limit,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.153
'cause h goes to zero,

00:08:20.137 --> 00:08:22.892
but what we put on the inside here

00:08:22.892 --> 00:08:23.975
is it's f of,

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:27.443
now instead of writing v of t plus h,

00:08:27.443 --> 00:08:29.596
I'm gonna use everything
that I did up there.

00:08:29.596 --> 00:08:32.064
It's the value of v of t

00:08:32.064 --> 00:08:33.647
plus the derivative

00:08:36.674 --> 00:08:39.473
at our point times the size of h.

00:08:39.473 --> 00:08:40.970
So again, it's kind of
like a Taylor polynomial.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.390
This is your linear term,

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.613
and then it's plus something
that we don't care about,

00:08:44.613 --> 00:08:46.145
something that's gonna get really small

00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:47.151
as h goes small,

00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:49.995
and really small in comparison
to h, more importantly.

00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:52.292
And from that you subtract off

00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:53.292
f of v of t.

00:08:56.817 --> 00:08:57.650
Kind of running off the edge.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.159
I always keep running off the edge.

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:01.360
And all of that is divided by h.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.752
Now, the point here is

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.801
when you look at this limit,
because we're taking it

00:09:05.801 --> 00:09:07.366
as h goes to zero,

00:09:07.366 --> 00:09:10.987
we'll basically be able to
ignore this o of h component

00:09:10.987 --> 00:09:12.451
because as h goes to zero,

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.793
this gets very, very
small in comparison to h.

00:09:14.793 --> 00:09:17.969
So everything that's on the inside here

00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:20.246
is basically just the v of t

00:09:20.246 --> 00:09:22.746
plus this vector value, right?

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.887
And this is h times some kind of vector.

00:09:26.887 --> 00:09:28.288
But if you think back, I made a video

00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:31.576
on the formal definition of
the directional derivative.

00:09:31.576 --> 00:09:33.013
And if you remembered,
or if you kind of go back

00:09:33.013 --> 00:09:36.658
and take a look now, this is
exactly the formal definition

00:09:36.658 --> 00:09:38.284
of the directional derivative.

00:09:38.284 --> 00:09:40.076
We're taking h to go to zero,

00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:41.808
the thing we're multiplying it by

00:09:41.808 --> 00:09:43.252
is a certain vector quantity.

00:09:43.252 --> 00:09:46.994
That vector is the nudge
to your original value,

00:09:46.994 --> 00:09:49.276
and then we're dividing everything by h.

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:51.266
So by definition, this entire thing

00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:55.276
is the directional derivative
in the direction of

00:09:55.276 --> 00:09:58.345
the derivative of the function of t.

00:09:58.345 --> 00:10:00.382
I'm writing v prime t
instead of getting the whole

00:10:00.382 --> 00:10:01.882
dv, dt down there.

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.274
All of that of f evaluated at where?

00:10:05.274 --> 00:10:06.395
Well, the place that we're starting

00:10:06.395 --> 00:10:09.145
is just v of t, so that's v of t.

00:10:12.703 --> 00:10:14.332
And that's it, that's the answer.

00:10:14.332 --> 00:10:16.266
'Cause when you evaluate
the directional derivative,

00:10:16.266 --> 00:10:19.943
the way that you do that,
you take the gradient of f,

00:10:19.943 --> 00:10:22.321
evaluate it at whatever
point you're starting at,

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.099
in this case it's the output of v of t,

00:10:25.099 --> 00:10:27.223
and you take the dot product between that

00:10:27.223 --> 00:10:30.178
and the vector value derivative.

00:10:30.178 --> 00:10:31.447
Well, I mean (chuckles),

00:10:31.447 --> 00:10:33.508
the dot product between that
and whatever your vector is,

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.258
which, in this case, is
the vector-value derivative

00:10:35.258 --> 00:10:38.455
of v, and that's the
multivariable chain rule.

00:10:38.455 --> 00:10:41.453
And if you look back through
the line of reasoning,

00:10:41.453 --> 00:10:43.200
it all really did match

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.241
the thoughts of kind of nudging, nudging,

00:10:46.241 --> 00:10:47.851
and seeing how that nudged, right?

00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:49.808
Because the reason we thought to use

00:10:49.808 --> 00:10:50.891
the vector-value derivative

00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:52.688
was because of that intuition.

00:10:52.688 --> 00:10:54.809
And the reason for all the
manipulation that I did

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:59.022
is just because I wanted
to be able to express

00:10:59.022 --> 00:11:01.579
what a nudge to the input of v looks like.

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:03.112
And what that looks like
is the original value

00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:05.758
plus a certain vector here.

00:11:05.758 --> 00:11:08.431
This was the resulting nudge
in the intermediary space.

00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:10.098
I wanted to express that in a formal way.

00:11:10.098 --> 00:11:12.151
And sure, we have this kind of o of h term

00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:15.685
that expresses something
that shrinks really fast,

00:11:15.685 --> 00:11:17.531
but once you express it like that,

00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:20.656
you just end up plopping out

00:11:20.656 --> 00:11:23.928
the definition of the
directional derivative.

00:11:23.928 --> 00:11:26.621
So I hope that gives kind
of a satisfying reason

00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:29.811
for those of you who are a
little bit more rigor-inclined

00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:32.593
for why the multivariable
chain rule works.

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:35.071
I should also maybe mention
there's a more general

00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:37.358
multivariable chain rule
for vector-valued functions.

00:11:37.358 --> 00:11:38.560
I'll get to that at another point

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.056
when I talk about the connections

00:11:40.056 --> 00:11:43.139
between multivariable
calculus and linear algebra.

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:47.008
But for now, that's pretty
much all you need to know

00:11:47.008 --> 00:11:48.256
on the multivariable chain rule

00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:50.710
when the ultimate composition is,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.192
you know, just a real
number to a real number.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:54.706
And I'll see you next video.
