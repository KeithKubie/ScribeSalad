00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.410
As arguably the most anticipated film of all-time,
Star Wars: The Force Awakens was analyzed

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.039
under a microscope every step of its journey
to the big screen.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.860
Fans followed the rumor mill on a daily basis
and broke down each frame from the trailers

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.020
as they counted down the days to its release.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.730
With all the headlines the movie made, it
would seem like everything about it is common

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.699
knowledge, but that is hardly the case.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.759
Here’s our list of the 10 most shocking
secrets in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.600
Luke’s Larger Role

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.440
Jedi Master Luke Skywalker was curiously absent
from all the movie’s marketing materials.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.000
When the film premiered, viewers quickly learned
why.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.370
The original trilogy hero is only in Episode
7’s final scene.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.280
Originally, he was intended to have a larger
part, but screenwriter Michael Arndt could

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.350
not find a way to include him without overshadowing
the new characters he wanted to focus on.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.420
In the end, making the plot a quest to find
Luke proved to be the best and gave Disney

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.760
another nostalgia card to play when it’s
time to promote Episode 8.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.940
The Other Chewbacca

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.830
Peter Mayhew has played the lovable Wookie
from the beginning, and of course reprised

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.170
the role in Episode 7.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.340
It was great to see the actor involved with
the franchise again, but his advancing age

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.060
limited what he could do in the suit.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.189
Enter Finnish thespian Joonas Suotamo.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.979
He spent five months working with Mayhew to
perfect Chewie’s movements and then filmed

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.149
some scenes for the movie.

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.920
Suotamo won’t reveal which ones he’s in,
but it’s safe to assume he handled Chewie’s

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.920
action bits.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.469
With the Wookie presumably back for Episode
8, it looks like the role is in good hands

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.920
even if Mayhew doesn’t return.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.740
RIP Poe Dameron

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.900
Oscar Isaac’s charming and charismatic Poe
Dameron established himself as the Han Solo

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.140
for a new generation, and his chemistry with
John Boyega’s Finn is a big reason why Episode

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.509
8 is so anticipated.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.380
But things could have been very different.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.310
Initially, J.J. Abrams was going to kill the
pilot off in the beginning of the film, something

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.090
that made Isaac somewhat hesitant to take
the role.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.320
After their meeting, Abrams thought it over
some more, and rewrote the script so that

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.869
Poe was alive for the whole movie.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.770
He enthusiastically sent Isaac an email, and
the rest is history.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.939
More Poe Dameron is always a good thing.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.560
TR-8R

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.009
Attacking Finn with an electric melee weapon
on Takodana, the stormtrooper dubbed “TR-8R”

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.680
by fans quickly became an Internet sensation
and a viral meme.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.870
He was so popular with viewers that Lucasfilm
gave him a backstory in the canon material.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.730
As revealed in the book Before the Awakening,
his call signal is FN-2199 – leading to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.860
the nickname “Nines.”

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.670
He trained with Finn, which is why he feels
so betrayed.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.110
Unfortunately, Nines is blasted away by Han
Solo, so his 15 seconds of fame is all he’ll

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.190
get in the series.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.390
Still, TR-8R has become a part of Star Wars
history and left a big impact.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.040
Finn: Space Pirate

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.209
A big reason why The Force Awakens was so
successful was its script, and veteran scribe

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.000
Lawrence Kasdan deserves a ton of credit.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.840
Not only did he help the franchise find its
old voice, he suggested one of the key elements

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.210
of protagonist Finn.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.210
The character was first thought of as a space
pirate or merchant marine, before Kasdan said

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.260
he should be a stormtrooper that defected
from the First Order.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.409
A novel idea for the films, that angle gave
Force Awakens something that made it stand

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.269
out and an interesting concept to explore.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.230
A space pirate would be too similar to Han
Solo.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.810
A Male Captain Phasma

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.190
Stormtrooper leader Captain Phasma was billed
as the first female Star Wars villain, which

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.819
was an exciting prospect.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.469
The character was first conceived as a traditional
male captain and was later changed.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.930
When the now-famous image of the Episode 7
cast gathered hit the web, many writers complained

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.780
about there being only one new female face:
Daisy Ridley.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.860
In response, the team decided to gender-flip
Phasma and make her a woman.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.230
Unfortunately, the character wasn’t so memorable,
so hopefully the sequels put her to better

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.230
use.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.189
It’d be a shame if Gwendoline Christie was
wasted for an entire trilogy.

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.830
Anakin’s Force Ghost
Force ghosts are a big part of Star Wars mythology,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.950
but they do not appear in The Force Awakens.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.489
It was an idea Lucasfilm toyed with, though,
and they went as far as to design concept

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.200
art of an Anakin Skywalker spirit that was
torn between the Dark and Light sides of the

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.260
Force.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.730
The idea was to have prequel star Hayden Christensen
return and play the part, but it was ultimately

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.730
scrapped.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.050
Force ghosts could still be a part of the
sequel trilogy, but Anakin probably won’t

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.050
be one of them.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.969
Christensen’s recent comments about his
career suggest he wouldn’t be interested

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.939
in snagging a quick paycheck, so it sounds
like he’s done.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:12.939
More Maz Kanata

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.820
Alien Maz Kanata plays a brief, yet important
role in The Force Awakens, helping the heroes

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.450
out of a tight spot and providing words of
wisdom.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.420
She’s returning for Episode 8, but she could
have had a larger part in Episode 7.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.370
Maz is shown to be in possession of Luke’s
original lightsaber, and the script originally

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.970
called for her to steal the weapon from Kylo
Ren’s crew and relay that information to

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.800
the group in a flashback sequence.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.530
Instead, Maz says how she acquired the lightsaber
is a question for another day, so hopefully

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.510
it’ll be answered in the sequels.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.360
C-3PO’s Red Arm

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.620
The usually golden protocol droid featured
a new red arm in The Force Awakens, with its

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.169
origins unexplained.

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.650
Even more puzzling is that in his final shot;
C-3PO is shown waving at the Millennium Falcon

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.460
with his standard golden arm brought back.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.800
That’s because the robot’s changing limb
was a subject actor Anthony Daniels and Abrams

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.430
disagreed over, and they found a way to compromise.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.139
While Threepio had the red arm initially,
Abrams restored the old look for Daniels by

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.620
the end of the film, finding a nice compromise
between the two.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.889
It would appear the golden rod won’t have
red anymore.

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.490
Kylo Ren’s Table of Ashes

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.710
When interrogating Rey after the invasion
at Takodana, villain Kylo Ren removes his

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.810
helmet on-camera for the first time and places
it on a table of ashes.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.770
Many fans have wondered why Kylo has that
and what exactly the ashes are from.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.110
In an interview, Abrams revealed that they
are the remains of the enemies Kylo Ren has

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.330
killed, adding a creepy new layer to a character
that was already somewhat disturbing.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.560
It’s unnerving to imagine Kylo collecting
the ashes and storing them for safe keeping,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.080
so we’re happy he wasn’t able to do this
with Han Solo.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.080
Those are our picks for the biggest secrets
of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.030
