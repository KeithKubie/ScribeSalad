00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:01.375
- What's up, guys, we're back in the lab

00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:04.123
with an experiment you were
told never to try at home.

00:00:04.123 --> 00:00:06.003
Today we're experimenting with water

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.253
and high voltage electricity.

00:00:08.253 --> 00:00:09.554
Now we're told all the time

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:12.176
never to get electricity
even close to water, but why?

00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:14.218
What exactly would
happen, if we accidentally

00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:16.609
dipped electrical cables
into a glass of water?

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.875
The purpose of this video
today is to find out.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:20.257
Now, for our first experiment,

00:00:20.257 --> 00:00:21.975
I've rigged up this very unsafe device,

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:24.144
which basically takes the
electrical power out of my house

00:00:24.144 --> 00:00:26.142
and splits it into these two wires.

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:28.094
If I touch these two wires together now,

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.253
you can see the light flickers behind me.

00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:32.270
When they're disconnected,
the light is off,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.086
but if the wires touch,
the light turns back on.

00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:35.919
Now for this first test,

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:37.956
I've filled up this glass
with distilled water.

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:40.037
Now, distilled water has nothing in it.

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:41.895
It should be pure and non-conductive,

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.504
meaning electricity should not
be able to flow through it.

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:46.011
Let's see if that's really the case.

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:46.986
Here we go.

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:50.086
(funky pop music)

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:51.448
Absolutely nothing.

00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:53.440
So, you can see that both
wires are completely submerged

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.777
in the water here and nothing
is happening to the light.

00:00:55.777 --> 00:00:57.130
It's not even flickering,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.216
but let's try touching the
wires underneath the water

00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:00.633
and see what happens.

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:01.945
(pinging)

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:03.675
Wow, it made this little pop

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:05.788
and I saw a little flash of electricity

00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:07.681
and the light turned on behind me.

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:10.283
(pinging)

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:11.443
It's actually pretty cool

00:01:11.443 --> 00:01:14.591
and I can see little bubbles
coming off the electrodes.

00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:16.829
It makes me wonder if those
are little hydrogen bubbles.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.824
I think we've got a little mini
electrolysis generator here.

00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:22.274
So update, guys, we have confirmed

00:01:22.274 --> 00:01:24.080
that distilled water is non-conductive.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.548
We had absolutely no reaction.

00:01:25.548 --> 00:01:27.149
So I've gone ahead and filled our glass up

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.461
with tap water now to see
if there's any difference.

00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:31.669
Electricity versus tap water, here we go.

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:34.833
(funky pop music)

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.133
Oh, interesting, look at that.

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.008
It looks like the light is
actually turning on a little bit.

00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:40.988
It's not like brightening right up,

00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:43.499
but they're definitely
is some electrical flow.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.428
If I pull the wires further
apart, it gets dimmer

00:01:45.428 --> 00:01:47.876
and if I bring them closer together,

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.138
it gets a little bit brighter.

00:01:49.138 --> 00:01:50.765
That is interesting.

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:52.858
Look at that, if I move the wires,

00:01:52.858 --> 00:01:53.983
the light kind of flickers

00:01:53.983 --> 00:01:55.123
and these wires aren't touching,

00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:57.130
they're just submerged
in the water itself.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.160
So apparently, tap water
is slightly conductive.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.064
I mean, it won't run the
full current through it,

00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:02.897
but you can see there definitely

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:04.376
is some kind of electrical connection,

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:06.208
because these wires are not touching

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:07.823
and of course, if you
touch the wires together,

00:02:07.823 --> 00:02:10.004
then it goes to full bright.

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.391
That's amazing.

00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:13.697
So, obviously we're not
getting the full current flow

00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:15.803
through the water, but
we are getting something.

00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:17.456
That's very interesting.

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:18.962
Now, I think the original concerns

00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:20.344
of electricity mixing with water

00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:22.143
stem back to when people
had portable heaters

00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:23.316
falling into their bathtub,

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:24.976
or dropping their
hairdryer into the bathtub.

00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:27.901
We have to remember that
bathtubs are not just tap water.

00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.189
They have soaps and shampoos in them.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.200
So for this next experiment,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.209
let's try mixing in a little
bath soap to the water

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.182
and seeing how that changes things up.

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:40.671
Making a little bathtub martini (laughs).

00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.314
If it's not dirty yet, it will be.

00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:44.678
Voila!

00:02:44.678 --> 00:02:46.778
OK, our wires are live, here we go.

00:02:46.778 --> 00:02:50.322
(funky pop music)

00:02:50.322 --> 00:02:54.682
And you can see things
are a little bit brighter.

00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:58.011
Oh yeah, that light is
quite a bit brighter.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:58.844
I wouldn't say it's full bright.

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:01.356
Those are the wires touching
and that's disconnected.

00:03:01.356 --> 00:03:04.134
I'd say we're maybe 50
to 75% of the power,

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:06.999
but that's quite enough, that's
enough to give you a tingle,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:07.832
if you're sitting in a bathtub

00:03:07.832 --> 00:03:10.356
with a high current
device like a hairdryer.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.719
So yeah, bath soap and water

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.192
definitely increases the conductivity.

00:03:14.192 --> 00:03:15.843
Interesting.

00:03:15.843 --> 00:03:16.676
So that was pretty cool.

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:19.697
We saw exactly what house
power does in soapy water,

00:03:19.697 --> 00:03:22.785
so I think its time to level
it up now to high voltage.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:23.885
Now you guys remember this thing,

00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:26.336
this is a big, old bulky
neon sign transformer.

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:28.370
It pumps out 12,000 volts of electricity,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.727
but it's current limited to 30 milli amps.

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:31.627
These are the kind of things,

00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:33.455
that used to power those big neon signs,

00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:35.467
that you see around the city.

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:36.616
Now in contrast, if you ever get out

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:37.750
to a fast food restaurant,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.454
or any kind of business for that matter,

00:03:39.454 --> 00:03:42.022
you'll probably see a neon sign like this.

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:44.204
These are still powered by
a neon sign transformer,

00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:45.453
but because of newer technology,

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:47.996
they can deliver the same power
at a fraction of the weight.

00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:49.728
Now I want to give a shout
out to my friend, Jerome,

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:51.869
he's the one that gave me this neon sign.

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.505
Unfortunately, it's
broken, so there's probably

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.790
not much use for it, except
for the power pack on the back.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.749
Now, to salvage a precious
power pack like this,

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:01.005
all we have to do is
disconnect it from the sign,

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:02.967
clip the wires as far up as we can go

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:04.465
and then strip the cable back

00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:06.218
to expose the small wire inside.

00:04:06.218 --> 00:04:07.265
Now, the voltage we are using

00:04:07.265 --> 00:04:09.434
out of our house power was 120 volts.

00:04:09.434 --> 00:04:12.677
In contrast, these are 10 to 12,000 volts,

00:04:12.677 --> 00:04:15.273
exponentially higher and
that's why high voltage signs

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:17.350
have such a thick casing
of rubber around them.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.275
So for this last experiment today,

00:04:18.275 --> 00:04:21.452
I wanna demonstrate the power
of high voltage electricity.

00:04:21.452 --> 00:04:22.846
I've cleaned and dried
this glass completely,

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:25.293
'cause we're gonna go back
to using distilled water,

00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:28.094
which theoretically is
non-conductive, right.

00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:29.508
So how will high voltage electricity

00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:30.947
work with distilled water?

00:04:30.947 --> 00:04:31.780
We're about to find out.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.641
Now, there are a couple
of really important things

00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.475
to understand about high
voltage electricity.

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:37.031
Number one, it's so powerful,

00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:39.063
it can actually jump through the air.

00:04:39.063 --> 00:04:40.680
A normal electric
circuit, you have to touch

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.045
the wires together, but
not with high voltage.

00:04:43.045 --> 00:04:44.796
High voltage can jump the gap

00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:47.050
and form its own electrical bridge,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.931
which means flimsy little gloves like this

00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:50.951
aren't gonna save you, so
even if you're wearing gloves,

00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.947
high voltage electricity can
still surge through your body.

00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:55.922
Now luckily 30 milli amps isn't enough

00:04:55.922 --> 00:04:57.835
to stop your heart theoretically,

00:04:57.835 --> 00:04:58.668
but we never really
wanna take that chance,

00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:00.696
so whenever you're dealing
with high voltage electricity,

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:03.585
a good rule of thumb is to
put one hand behind your back

00:05:03.585 --> 00:05:05.919
and operate everything
else with the other hand.

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.241
We wanna avoid the electricity
crossing through our heart

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.495
as much as possible.

00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:10.902
High voltage electricity
versus distilled water.

00:05:10.902 --> 00:05:13.054
Let's power it up and see what happens.

00:05:13.054 --> 00:05:15.033
I'm actually gonna put the tip of this one

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:16.333
down into the water first

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:20.500
and then we'll try this second
one and see what happens.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:23.127
Woah, look at that!

00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:25.260
Not only does distilled
water conduct electricity,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.696
but the electricity
actually jumps to the water,

00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:28.486
before it even makes contact.

00:05:28.486 --> 00:05:29.602
Look at this.

00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:31.136
When I start bringing
this second one down,

00:05:31.136 --> 00:05:32.836
you'll start hearing it buzzing

00:05:32.836 --> 00:05:34.660
(buzzing)

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.673
and if I go a little bit further,

00:05:37.673 --> 00:05:39.059
it's like little, purple lightning bolts

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:40.905
jumping down to the water.

00:05:40.905 --> 00:05:42.507
That's so cool!

00:05:42.507 --> 00:05:44.397
If we go right into the water,
it completely disappears,

00:05:44.397 --> 00:05:46.583
but I can still feel this thing buzzing.

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:49.068
Bring it out slowly.

00:05:49.068 --> 00:05:53.068
Oh wow, did you see the
water get stuck to that?

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:57.171
That is bizarre, that is really cool.

00:05:57.171 --> 00:05:59.295
I was not expecting that.

00:05:59.295 --> 00:06:01.207
So this isn't something
I was expecting to see,

00:06:01.207 --> 00:06:03.498
but as I start pulling the
electrodes out of the water,

00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:06.412
it seems like the water
connects to the electricity,

00:06:06.412 --> 00:06:08.189
at least it gets about
three-quarters of an inch

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.080
off the surface and then
drops back down into the dish.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.080
Look at this, I can do both at once.

00:06:15.612 --> 00:06:17.357
That is crazy.

00:06:17.357 --> 00:06:21.327
It feels like I'm pulling
the surface of the water up.

00:06:21.327 --> 00:06:25.494
Wow, what happens if I
bring them closer together?

00:06:26.504 --> 00:06:27.337
Wow!

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:30.175
So apparently the water
is even more conductive

00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:32.194
than the air, because if
I hold the two together

00:06:32.194 --> 00:06:33.529
close to the surface of the water,

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:35.341
it will choose to go through the water,

00:06:35.341 --> 00:06:36.577
rather than through the air.

00:06:36.577 --> 00:06:37.441
That's very interesting

00:06:37.441 --> 00:06:41.930
and these little water bridges,
that we're making are nuts.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.294
It doesn't seem to matter where

00:06:43.294 --> 00:06:44.931
I place the electrode in the dish,

00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.625
the electrical pattern
doesn't change much.

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:50.562
OK, bring them far apart, close together,

00:06:50.562 --> 00:06:53.035
it's exactly the same.

00:06:53.035 --> 00:06:56.868
(funky pop music and buzzing)

00:07:05.493 --> 00:07:08.493
I see like tinges of green in there.

00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.219
That's kinda cool, huh?

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:15.969
Let me do that again.

00:07:18.511 --> 00:07:20.883
OK, we're probably having too much fun,

00:07:20.883 --> 00:07:22.741
we'd better stop (laughs).

00:07:22.741 --> 00:07:24.274
Very, very cool experiment, guys

00:07:24.274 --> 00:07:25.923
and very unexpected with
the water sucking up

00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:28.070
onto that high voltage electricity.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.903
Of course, the real question is

00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:30.788
what does distilled water taste like

00:07:30.788 --> 00:07:33.121
after it's been electrified?

00:07:35.327 --> 00:07:37.974
Mm, it's very, very warm.

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:42.066
I think there's bits of
wire floating in there.

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:43.884
Mmm, it's very interesting.

00:07:43.884 --> 00:07:45.917
It's like warm on the
top, cold on the bottom,

00:07:45.917 --> 00:07:47.063
it tastes electric.

00:07:47.063 --> 00:07:49.538
So let's summarize what we've
just learned here today.

00:07:49.538 --> 00:07:51.710
There's nothing in distilled
water, except water itself,

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.746
and by nature, it won't
conduct electricity.

00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:55.882
So we tried using tap water next and found

00:07:55.882 --> 00:07:58.063
that it will conduct a
small amount of electricity.

00:07:58.063 --> 00:07:59.909
We tried adding bath soap and
stirring it into the water

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:02.094
and found that it made a
substantial difference.

00:08:02.094 --> 00:08:04.215
And finally we went back
to using distilled water

00:08:04.215 --> 00:08:05.650
and high voltage
electricity, where we found

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.177
that even though the
water's non-conductive,

00:08:08.177 --> 00:08:11.833
if the voltage is high enough,
it'll still jump through it.

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:14.412
Thanks for joining me for
this set of experiments today

00:08:14.412 --> 00:08:15.836
and a big shout out to my friend, Jerome,

00:08:15.836 --> 00:08:18.215
for donating his neon
sign to our cause today.

00:08:18.215 --> 00:08:19.784
I'll be looking for you
guys in the next video.

00:08:19.784 --> 00:08:20.850
Talk to you then.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.017
(buzzing)

00:08:25.366 --> 00:08:26.199
Electric.

00:08:28.693 --> 00:08:31.526
