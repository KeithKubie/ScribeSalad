00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The correct answer is the third choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What the client needs to do to know that it's talking with the correct server--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it needs to know that it's talking with server S and knows that that's a public key owned by S.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If that's correct, then S owns the corresponding private key

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and only that server can decrypt this message and obtain the right session key.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is the problem the certificate is designed to solve.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Number one would work if we had a way to always know the public key beforehand.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That would be great. We wouldn't need any other solution.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is not going to work for websites.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This would only work if we could pre-load the public key

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of all the websites we might ever communicate with into the browser.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's not realistic.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We need some other way of getting new public keys for new sites as we visit them.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Verifying the certificate using KUS doesn't make any sense,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because KUS was provided by the server, so if we use the server's public key

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to verify the certificate, that would be a self-signed certificate.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It wouldn't prove anything since the signature is being verified

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with the key provided by the person claiming the signature.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That's why we need the third solution, which uses some other key

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that the client already trusts to verify the certificate and then the information

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in the certificate to know that it's the right server and to know the server's public key.
