has a rather different answer and it has
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.359
has a rather different answer and it has
to do with the kinds of causes we look

to do with the kinds of causes we look
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.920
to do with the kinds of causes we look
for in science so you have proximate

ultimate answer is because foods that

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
ultimate answer is because foods that
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090
ultimate answer is because foods that
taste sweet are more likely to be

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
taste sweet are more likely to be
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.010
taste sweet are more likely to be
consumed and those in our natural

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
consumed and those in our natural
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.420
consumed and those in our natural
environment are the kinds of foods that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
environment are the kinds of foods that
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.470
environment are the kinds of foods that
are both rare and nutritious and so the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480
are both rare and nutritious and so the
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450
are both rare and nutritious and so the
more of them you eat the better and and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
more of them you eat the better and and
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150
more of them you eat the better and and

because the universe will eventually die

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
because the universe will eventually die
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.620
because the universe will eventually die
in a heat death so and then second is

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
in a heat death so and then second is
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.289
in a heat death so and then second is
the principle of natural selection that

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299
the principle of natural selection that
 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510
the principle of natural selection that
drives evolution and it has to do with

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520
drives evolution and it has to do with
 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.420
drives evolution and it has to do with
the cost-benefit analysis of how many

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
the cost-benefit analysis of how many
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.179
the cost-benefit analysis of how many
limited resources you put into organisms

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
limited resources you put into organisms
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.609
limited resources you put into organisms
so obviously natural selection is going

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
so obviously natural selection is going
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.219
so obviously natural selection is going
to select for infants and toddlers and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
to select for infants and toddlers and
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.389
to select for infants and toddlers and
babies to be well cared for have super

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
babies to be well cared for have super
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.429
babies to be well cared for have super
regenerative powers to keep their bodies

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
regenerative powers to keep their bodies
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.770
regenerative powers to keep their bodies
going in order to get the genes into the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
going in order to get the genes into the
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.149
going in order to get the genes into the
next generation get them up to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
next generation get them up to
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.270
next generation get them up to
reproductive age and so on so we see

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
reproductive age and so on so we see
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340
reproductive age and so on so we see
cells that divide very rapidly in

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
cells that divide very rapidly in
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.770
cells that divide very rapidly in
infants and babies you know a little cut

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
infants and babies you know a little cut
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.960
infants and babies you know a little cut
you can practically watch it heal it's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
you can practically watch it heal it's
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.440
you can practically watch it heal it's
incredible whereas someone

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
incredible whereas someone
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.870
incredible whereas someone
when I get cut it takes much longer to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880
when I get cut it takes much longer to
 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.460
when I get cut it takes much longer to
heal and and so the question is why why

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470
heal and and so the question is why why
 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.870
heal and and so the question is why why
wouldn't evolution just make it so that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880
wouldn't evolution just make it so that
 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.240
wouldn't evolution just make it so that
I now in my early sixties can't just

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250
I now in my early sixties can't just
 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.699
I now in my early sixties can't just
keep going to 200 300 and the answer is

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709
keep going to 200 300 and the answer is
 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.500
keep going to 200 300 and the answer is
there's no no reason for it because

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510
there's no no reason for it because
 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.170
there's no no reason for it because
after I've brought my own offspring into

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180
after I've brought my own offspring into
 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.090
after I've brought my own offspring into
reproductive age and then they've

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100
reproductive age and then they've
 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.380
reproductive age and then they've
brought their offspring into

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390
brought their offspring into
 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.110
brought their offspring into
reproductive age I'm really of no use

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120
reproductive age I'm really of no use
 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.050
reproductive age I'm really of no use
anymore I can serve a useful purpose as

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
anymore I can serve a useful purpose as
 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.180
anymore I can serve a useful purpose as
a parent of course bringing my genes up

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
a parent of course bringing my genes up
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.130
a parent of course bringing my genes up
and then the useful purpose is a

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140
and then the useful purpose is a
 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.199
and then the useful purpose is a
grandparent to help my offspring bring

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209
grandparent to help my offspring bring
 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.960
grandparent to help my offspring bring
their offspring up to reproductive age

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970
their offspring up to reproductive age
 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.090
their offspring up to reproductive age
but beyond that really there's no sense

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100
but beyond that really there's no sense
 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.210
but beyond that really there's no sense
and pouring any more resources into

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220

grandparents because the genes and the
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.789
grandparents because the genes and the
little infant are already going to be

little infant are already going to be
 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.920
little infant are already going to be
well taken care of so it's sort of a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930
well taken care of so it's sort of a
 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.509
well taken care of so it's sort of a
weird way to think about it but in a way

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519
weird way to think about it but in a way
 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.820
weird way to think about it but in a way
the nature operates because of entropy

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830
the nature operates because of entropy
 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.160
the nature operates because of entropy
nature asked to select and choose and

kind of a triage where are we going to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120
kind of a triage where are we going to
 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.449
kind of a triage where are we going to
put the resources now I'm saying it like

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459
put the resources now I'm saying it like
 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.380
put the resources now I'm saying it like
there's somebody up there

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390
there's somebody up there
 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.240
there's somebody up there
you know allocating resources there's

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250
you know allocating resources there's
 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.759
you know allocating resources there's
you know the the government's doling out

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769
you know the the government's doling out
 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.890
you know the the government's doling out
checks to organisms no there's nothing

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900
checks to organisms no there's nothing
 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.270
checks to organisms no there's nothing
like that of course this is just how

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280
like that of course this is just how
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.449
like that of course this is just how
natural selection operates so in short

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459
natural selection operates so in short

we die so that our future generations

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160
we die so that our future generations
