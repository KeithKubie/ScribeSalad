00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.710
September 22, 1926.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.380
Howard Carter and his team begin
their fifth excavation season

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.210
at the tomb of King Tutankhamun.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.040
The focus of their work
is an unwalled room

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.040
on the far end of the burial
chamber called the treasury.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.000
When they enter, the
first thing they come upon

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.080
is a fifth so-called
magic brick.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.710
This fifth brick has
a harrowing inscription

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.330
that reads, it is I who
hindered the sand from choking

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.920
the secret chamber.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.210
And who repel that
one who would repel

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.420
him with the desert flame.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.670
I have set aflame the desert.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.330
I have caused the
path to be mistaken.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.080
I am for the protection
of the deceased.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.210
And we have to wonder,
why was this brick

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.080
placed in the tomb Tutankhamun?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.080
While other pharaoh's
tombs were found

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.540
to contain four magic
cursed bricks, only

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.750
King Tut's includes a fifth.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.620
But why?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.460
That fifth brick may
be a clue, a sort of X

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.460
marks the spot treasure
map that shows us

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460
that something very
significant that perhaps

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.120
we still don't understand
was hidden in that tomb.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.880
On September 28, 2015, British
Egyptologist, Nicholas Reeves,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.380
made a remarkable discovery
while examining high resolution

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.250
scans of King Tut's tomb--

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.880
the possibility
of hidden cavities

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.250
within the burial chamber.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.290
Dr. Reeves looked at high
resolution images of this wall

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.120
and he noticed a crack
that looks like it

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.500
should have been a door.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
And it was right about here.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.250
They brought
thermal scanners in

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.000
and scanned behind this wall.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.500
And they believe
they found cavities

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.500
behind this specific area.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.500
He took a permission to
go inside the north room

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.920
and dig through to discover
what's behind this wall.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.000
Just a couple of months
before the mission took place,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.330
it was stopped for
unknown reasons.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.960
Who or what maybe hidden
in this secret chamber

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.120
is hotly debated.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.830
But some researchers believe
it is possible that it contains

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.380
the remains of Egypt's
most controversial

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.710
pharaoh, Akhenaten,
who also happens

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.540
to be the father of King Tut.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.000
Ancient Egypt had always
been polytheistic, many gods.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.380
And then there as a new leader,
a new pharaoh with a new idea.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.710
Akhenaten announces
there will be one god.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.040
They will be a
monotheistic people.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.000
Aten, the sun god, would be the
one deity they all worshipped.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.210
The image is the sun disk.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.880
It shook the empire in
really terrible ways.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.920
What could have
inspired Akhenaten

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.540
to make such drastic
changes during a time

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.880
of tremendous prosperity?

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.000
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest there may have

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.580
been an otherworldly influence.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.710
And as evidence, point to
the way he was depicted

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.750
by artists of the time.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.420
Akhenaten cannot introduce
the idea that every

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.330
time his artisans
would carve something,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.170
it had to be lifelike.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.880
So it had to be represented
exactly the way it was seen.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.830
Which is interesting
because if you

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.500
look at the likenesses
of Akhenaten,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.920
he looks very strange.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.290
Akhenaten had himself depicted
in the most peculiar way.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.420
He had this elongated face.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.960
He had this protruding belly.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.120
He had these almost like,
chicken leg type legs.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.420
Very peculiar.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.040
With this elongated
skull at the back.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.120
Now all of the pharaohs
have themselves

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.420
depicted looking
as, shall we say,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.460
majestic and
muscular as possible.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.210
One has to wonder if
Akhenaten may have been

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.540
some type of an
extraterrestrial hybrid,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.210
and that is why he
introduced this one god rule.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.170
Perhaps that sun disk Aten
that Akhenaten prayed to

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.500
wasn't a sun in the
sky at all, but it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.620
could have been an
extraterrestrial

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.580
that's instructed Akhenaten.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.580
The texts say it's
a winged disk.
