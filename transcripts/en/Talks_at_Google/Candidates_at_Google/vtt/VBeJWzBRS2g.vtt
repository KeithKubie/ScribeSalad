00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.610
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Good morning Google Chicago.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.679
[speaking in background]

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.750
My name is David Lieber. I'm with the State
and Local Public Policy Team here. We're obviously

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.900
thrilled to have Rahm Emanuel, Mayoral Candidate
for Chicago here today for a fireside chat

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.890
with Jim Lecinski, the unofficial mayor of
the Chicago office.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.380
[laughter]

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.810
So this is a continuation of our fireside
campaign chats which is a program we inaugurated

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.430
in 2008. Today, however, represents the first
time that we are doing an event outside of

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.480
Mountain View, and obviously there's no better
place to do that than the City of Chicago.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.070
Our guest today, Rahm Emanuel, is a veteran
of two presidential administrations. He served

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.739
in the Clinton Administration from 1992 to
1998, rising to the position of Senior Advisor;

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.350
also served, as many of you know, as the Chief
of Staff to current President Barack Obama

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.000
from 2008 to 2010.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.680
Before that, he served three terms in the
U.S. Congress representing the Fifth Congressional

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.670
District. In 2007, he became the Chair of
the House Democratic Caucus and in 2006 he

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.490
was the Chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, the year that the Democrats

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.189
took over the House of Representatives.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.639
If you look around, you'll notice that there
are no media present here today. We did, however,

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:27.619
extend an invite to @Mayor Emanuel to live
Tweet the event. Unfortunately he's holed

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.539
up in the igloo with Carl the intern, but
he does send his very saucy, saucy regrets

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:35.740
on not being able to make it.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.810
But at this time, without further ado, I wanna
introduce Rahm Emanuel. Let's give him a warm

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.810
applause.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.810
[applause]

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.469
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Thank you.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:49.749
[applause]

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:59.259
What's this thing? Do you guys think I have
a kidney problem or something?

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.259
[laughter]

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.259
What is that?

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.259
[laughter]

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.259
Geez.

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.259
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Just in case you're thirsty.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.689
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: [laughs] Yeah. I didn't know
I was gonna sweat through the interview.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.689
[laughter]

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.780
&gt;David Lieber: Good. Well, well welcome Rahm.
We're very thrilled to have you here.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.780
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Um-hum.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.829
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: And we know you've got a very
busy day today including the big Urban League

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.700
event debate on Fox tonight --

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.700
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Um-hum.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.700
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: so we're happy to be your
warm up act.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.700
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: [laughs]

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.700
[laughter]

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.420
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: So. Well let's get started.
Speaking of Fox, I don't know if you watched

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.140
the Super Bowl this weekend but they had during
the Super Bowl on Fox incessant, everybody

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.849
here by the way was rooting against the Packers
--

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:32.849
[laughter]

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.629
just 'cause that's the Chicago thing to do.
But they had promos for a new Fox show on

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.180
called the "The Chicago Code" --

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.180
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Um-hum.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.210
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: in between the game. And it's
a fictitious new police commissioner played

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.010
by Jessica Biel. And in the promo that they
played, maybe you guys saw, very dramatically

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.430
one of the assistant's said to her, "What
makes you think you can change the way Chicago

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.030
works?" Right, remember this spot that ran
over and over in the football game?

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.920
So you've talked quite a bit about no bid
contract system, pay to play, you're running

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.120
a great TV spot right now talking about actually
getting city workers to do city work for us.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.010
Alright, so I guess in the spirit of that
question posed on the Fox promo, we could

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.469
ask you the same question to get started.
What makes you, sir, think you can change

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:21.520
the way Chicago works?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.859
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well first of all, I believe,
I mean I don't think it's a novel idea, but

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.519
that if you're gettin' a paycheck paid by
the taxpayers, the taxpayer are the people

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.489
you are beholden to. I don't think that should
be up for debate, but if we'll have that debate,

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.489
I'm ready.

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:49.060
I also want you to know I include the mayor,
I include anybody I would appoint, I include

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.409
the aldermen, I include anybody who gets paid
by the taxpayer is that we're gonna have a

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.930
mindset that we're beholden to taxpayers to
deliver a service for what they pay for.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.430
Now you should know, my uncle's a former police
officer in the City of Chicago. You have a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.680
lot of good workers in the city. I've visited
them during the blizzard out at O'Hare. They

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.779
moved that snow -- we had one of the worst
in a century. How you feelin', good?

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:16.779
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [chuckles]

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.779
[laughter]

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:18.779
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay? That's the pediatrician
son of me asks.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:19.779
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:20.779
[laughter]

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:21.779
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I just wanna make sure everything's
okay 'cause you're holdin' it. I'm gettin'

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:22.779
nervous here man.

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:23.779
[laughter]

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.410
Now that does not go in the doctor's training
here, okay?

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.850
[laughter]

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.169
Let's get to that issue ?

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.169
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.169
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emaneual: it's more important than
what I --

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.169
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.849
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: okay here's the deal. They
did an incredible job during the blizzard.

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:34.849
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [sighs]

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:38.771
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: And they do an incredible
job in our classrooms in very adverse `conditions.

00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:39.771
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:44.930
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: They do an incredible job
on our streets and when we need 'em, for God

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.490
forbid, if somethin' happens at your home
for a fire or whatever, they are there. They

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.389
do an incredible job every day.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:58.050
But we gotta also be honest over the years,
stories about no show jobs, corruption, people

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.729
in middle management who've been convicted
here going to get another job here even though

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:08.009
they're convicted over here, and that has
created a basis for a show to talk about,

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.620
accept it as if it's built into the archaic
discussion, the Chicago Code.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.660
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Hum.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.350
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Now I want you to know I think
that the mayor, as I did when I was Chief

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.341
of Staff, as I did when I was a Congressman
or when I was Senior Advisor to President

00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:27.750
Clinton, you get paid by the taxpayers, your
perspective regardless of where your position

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.770
is -- mayor, department head, beat officer,
and a lot of 'em as I said already have this

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.729
position, they already have this perspective
-- they are there to deliver a service whether

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.240
it's protecting, educating, cleaning snow
to the public and a lot of people already

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.750
have that mindset. There's a number of people
that did not -- we all know that -- and I'm

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.330
gonna change that perspective.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.849
You guys talk here at Google about a view,
a perspective that helps you kinda is your,

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.831
it's your modus operandi.

00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:00.831
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:05.520
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I want the modus operandi
in Chicago, and a lot of people have it and

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.910
they get hurt when other people they work
with don't have it, and it's usually at the

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:18.880
top, let's be also frank, that we work for
the taxpayers and the taxpayers expect to

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.960
get a good delivery of service for the dollars
that they pay. That should not be open for

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.960
discussion.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.960
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.970
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: But if we'll have that discussion,
I stand shoulder to shoulder with the taxpayers.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.849
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Absolutely. Okay.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.470
Well let's move on. In advance of your visit,
we used a tool that we've built here at Google

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.800
called Google Moderator and it's a way to
have people submit questions and then you

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.360
can put a thumbs up, thumbs down, plus one,
minus one to raise the important questions

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.720
to the top and lower the less important questions.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.240
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: What happens if the thumb
is like this?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.920
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: We've [laughs]

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.920
[laughter]

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.199
we've used that with the President and others
and we used it for your visit here today.

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.199
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: [laughs]

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.580
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: And not surprisingly, you
mentioned it in your comments there, the most

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.449
popular number one topic that these folks
wanted to hear you talk about was education

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:06.889
and the Chicago Public Schools.

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.759
Can you talk a little bit about your plan
for the schools? There was lots of questions,

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.389
I live in Hyde Park. How do you plan to make
sure every child in the city has access to

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:20.740
a school as prestigious and high standard
with a free education that's as good as the

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.849
Ray and Bret Harte Elementary School in Hyde
Park?

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:31.389
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay. Well, first of all,
while I think all the issues that I talk about:

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:37.430
economic development and reforming city government,
bringing safety to our streets and strength

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.599
to our schools, those are I think the building
blocks. The point of this spirit is without

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:48.620
a doubt education, without a doubt.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.289
Now you don't know this, but in a former life
I had a scholarship once to the Joffrey Ballet;

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:59.659
didn't take it, purposely to make my mother
miserable.

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:01.800
[laughter]

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:09.851
But my wife, when I met her, we'd gotten a
master's in art history at University of Chicago

00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:13.330
and I met her when she was working at the
Art Institute.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:19.289
You can have a world class ballet company
in a city, and we do, you can have a world

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:25.620
class opera in a city, and we do. But if half
your kids aren't graduating from high school,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.770
you're not gonna be a world class city much
longer. And that's my perspective and I say

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.600
that with the utmost passion for the arts
and culture. And because it's not only it's

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.230
important to your development but important
to the city's development.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:44.070
Now we have two expecting mothers here, but
here's the deal. One of the most significant

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:50.420
thing I did as a Congressman was I used to
do my office hours at grocery stores and I

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.350
would just meet people. I didn't wanna do
town halls, I wanted to just meet people,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.850
regular people wherever they were in their
lives. I was at the Lincoln and Column Jewel

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.850
--

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.850
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.070
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: and a young man came up [clears
throat] could have been in this room, but

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.400
he happened to a lawyer, his wife was in advertising
or accounting. He had a four year old. Thursday

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.700
night he's runnin' off to the Jewel --

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.700
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.240
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: and he's says, "If I don't
have a good local school, my wife and I are

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.360
gonna move to the suburbs.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.360
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yep.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.600
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: He says, "I don't wanna pay
property taxes and then a private tuition."

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.750
Okay, for those who don't have kids, you'll
be facing this one day. For these two ladies,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.290
they'll be facing this sooner than you if
you're not facing it today.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.690
Now my view is, on education, and I say this
as a person who's gotten two things from his

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:42.460
parents and both are essential: their love
and education. That is why I have been able

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.680
to achieve what I've been able to achieve
in my life. That's what really what I view

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.920
as. And I view it also as a parent who's very
involved in his own kids' education.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.910
Now first I wanna make every school in the
City of Chicago, we'd be the first school

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:02.560
system in the country, where every school
will have a five year performance contract.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.550
So I can evaluate year by year or over a two
year period whether that principal, who ultimately

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:14.330
is the CEO for that school, is on the way
to making the improvements in that school

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.390
and are they being managed, the teachers as
well as the principal, towards those goals

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:27.920
we've measured? The successful charters do
it. I want the whole school system to do it.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.330
Second, beyond the principal is the teacher.
Everything I'm investing in is proven over

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:41.610
a period of time. It's not the fad of the
day in education. Teachers, now this is gonna

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.700
take a while and I wanna spend on a lot of
time on this, since it's the number one issue

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.700
--

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.700
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yep.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.080
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: and it's my number one passion.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.650
Second the teachers. We have very good teachers
working in adverse conditions, you should

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:57.830
know that. But I wanna raise the quality of
all of the teachers in the schools. And I

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.270
say that because you can have a small classroom
which is once in the late 90s the big fad,

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.740
but if you don't have a quality teacher in
a small classroom, you're no closer; so teachers,

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.700
not size of class, teachers in the class is
where I'm at.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.851
In my old congressional district I created
the first teaching academy high school.

00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:16.490
[pause]

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.020
Do you guys know about the Golden Apple?

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.040
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.770
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: AUSL. I want ya to if you
don't --

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.310
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: We can search for it.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.310
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: you can search for it.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.310
[laughter]

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.550
Hey, don't steal my punch lines, okay?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.550
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.550
[laughter]

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.560
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Dude, work on your own punch
lines. I was workin' on my own okay?

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560
[laughter]

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.460
We've not gonna be doin' this much longer
if you steal my punch lines, okay?

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.460
[laughter]

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.800
Okay, okay, I've lost my train of thought
-- no.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.161
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Golden Apple.

00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:42.210
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Got it.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:47.120
I want you to look it up, AUSL Program, okay?
Golden Apple here in Chicago. Anyway I created

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:53.391
the first high school in the old Wright Community
College. It's a master teacher, two people

00:11:53.391 --> 00:12:00.280
in second career getting a master's in education
in the classroom, a neighborhood school.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.180
Those teachers, when they graduate, have a
master's degree in education, signed a contract.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.250
They will be in the Chicago Public School
System for five years. That's significant

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.920
because in the first five years every teacher
in our public school system, 50 percent of

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.850
them quit, not every, 50 percent quit. It's
too hard.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.620
These teachers are trained for urban education.
They commit for five years minimum. Eighty

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.880
percent of 'em stay beyond the five years.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.850
I wanna take us from seven schools to 15.
We'll graduate two high schools and six elementary

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:36.450
schools worth of teachers every year. After
four years Chicago will have the largest population

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:42.320
of teachers with a master's degree in education
and we will convert the school system, classroom

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.180
by classroom, school by school.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.880
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Can I ask, can I just interrupt
and ask? It would seem that you would need

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.090
the teacher's union cooperation for such an
accountability plan and they've --

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.090
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I've --

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.030
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: heretofore not been willing
to commit to accountability.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.740
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well on this thing, I worked
it out when I was running for Congress, they

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.340
support this actual program.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.340
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.530
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Eventually I wanna take it
up to 20, but the first year I'll do 15.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:10.200
Now here's how I'll pay for it and after everything
I've announced, I've paid for. We spend $100

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.491
million a year at the CPS, Chicago Public
Schools, on teacher training. For $10 million,

00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:20.360
I get these eight schools. And the reason
I'm not only for it because I get 10 out of

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.540
that for these 8 schools, I'm training teachers
who stay longer in our schools. Why do I have

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.380
to train somebody who moves to the suburbs?
I'm gettin' a better bang for our buck usin'

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.380
the same money.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.470
You can see I get emotional about that.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.670
Lastly, parents.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.860
[pause]

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:47.300
You cannot educate kids without parents being
involved in their education. The front door

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:52.310
to that house or that apartment is more significant
to a child's education than the school and

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.330
then when the two of 'em are workin', they'll
be taking your job.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.330
[laughter]

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.330
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: That is.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.700
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: And they'll be takin' my job
and they're gonna be taking your job.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.700
A good parent or parents involved in a kid's
education with a good school, that kid is

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.141
unstoppable. It's been proven and that's why
I said I don't get in fads. What are the three

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:14.050
things you gotta have? Principals that wanna
be accountable, quality teachers in a room,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:19.330
and two parents who are involved. Now this
is why I love this job. I'm gonna tell you

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.330
this story.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.330
[pause]

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:27.310
I told ya I used to do grocery stores and
I met probably a number of you at El stops.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.310
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Hum.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:34.310
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay? And I'm gonna continue
as mayor doin' somethin' retailish as a way

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:39.010
to always make sure I'm in touch with folks
and they're in touch with their mayor.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:45.190
I was at 79th and Dan Ryan about three or
four weeks ago and I say hello to all these

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:50.620
high school kids regardless, not that they're
voters but one day they may be. No.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.680
[laughter]

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:59.250
And this kid, Jeremy, walks, I don't know
he's Jeremy, shake hands and he goes past

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:05.200
me. He comes back, I don't know about 30 seconds
later whatever, and says, "Can I show you

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.670
somethin'?" And anytime a kid shows initiative
like that, you wanna be obviously responsive.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.700
I'd be that responsive for an adult, especially
for a high school kid.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.700
[laughter]

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.950
And he get his backpack off and is pullin'
out a piece of paper and I said, "What's this

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:27.360
about?" And he says, "I started an after school
program in my school." Sixteen. I said, "Really."

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.230
I go, "What does it do?" He goes, "Photography."

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.690
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:35.600
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: And he also -- in respect
to this kid, he lives up near Loyola, takes

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.730
a train all the way down 79th and gets on
a bus and goes over to Simeon; hour and twenty

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.240
transportation. So next time you're really
upset about somethin', put Jeremy in your

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:49.010
head for a second. He's a high schooler kid
and there's thousands of 'em out there.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:53.610
I said, "Really, you run this?" He goes, "Yeah,
I develop it with a friend and I administer

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:58.890
it with my assistant principal." He started
his own after school program. And I said,

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:04.940
"Well what's this form for?" Now I'm big into
parent contracts as a way to kinda induce

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.350
responsibility. I've announced it when I announced
my education policy.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:14.930
He says, "I don't let a kid into my after
school program whose parent does not sign

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:21.010
this." And I said, "Well what does it make
'em do?" "Pick up the report card, attend

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.900
parent-teacher conferences, and review their
homework with 'em."

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.010
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.630
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I've announced a comprehensive
after school program for the city. We're adopting

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.530
Jeremy's contract when I'm mayor.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.530
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Ahh.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.990
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: And it's not defer motion,
although there is that. And I do want people

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.350
to know that if they have an idea the mayor
or the city government will respond in the

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:46.710
same way that I did for the young man at the
Jewel, helped get Coonley that was on the

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.750
closed list, to now a gifted program that's
bustin' at the seams.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:54.860
I introduced an elder justice bill 'cause
some lady told me how her father got beat

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.140
up at a nursing home and President Obama signed
it.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:05.769
These aren't gonna solve Newtonian physics
or macroeconomics, but people give you stories

00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:10.679
and some way you can make their lives a tad
easier or solve a problem for others.

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:15.409
But Jeremy came up with an idea that figured
out in my view somethin' that President Clinton

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:22.360
taught me very importantly. With opportunity,
after school program, comes responsibility

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:28.260
and accountability. And what was the other
piece of it? And at 16, Jeremy had figured

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.950
this out. And I just want you to know -- get
used to it because Jeremy's gonna be head

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:32.950
of the building department --

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:33.950
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Umm-umm.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:34.950
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: when I'm done.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:35.950
[laughter]

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:36.950
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: There you go.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:37.950
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: This kid you'd bet long on
'em. He travels an hour and 20 minutes by

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:44.230
himself twice a day. He developed an after
school program and knew that he had somethin'

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.990
special kids wanted or their parents wanted
for their kids, and he knew that the best

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.889
way to deduce it was to require somethin'
of the parents that wasn't happening.

00:17:52.889 --> 00:17:53.889
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um.

00:17:53.889 --> 00:17:56.460
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I really do, I mean I mean
this is in the most fundamental way. So my

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.090
package on education is based on investing
in principals --

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.120
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:08.210
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: raising the quality of teachers
who already a number of 'em are good, and

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.789
then making parents get off the sidelines
and involved in their kids' education.

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:19.140
Now to your question on the teacher's union.
They are representing their members.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.760
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.760
[pause]

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.070
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: They have in all fairness
been big advocates of parental involvement.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.070
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:31.400
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: No person running for office
has tried what I'm about to go try in parental

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.910
involvement. I'm gonna be a partner with them
'cause a lot of our teachers, good teachers,

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:42.590
work in a really tough situations. You give
'em a partner in the home, they'll be better

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.549
teachers because they finally got somebody
helpin' out with 'em --

00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:46.549
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:51.850
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: okay. There are places I will
disagree with the leadership. I'm a big supporter

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:55.230
of charters, not because I think charters
are the end all and be all. There are bad

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.420
charters and there are good charters and you
gotta be as tough on the bad charters as you

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.840
are on neighborhood schools that aren't achieving
their goal, but I'm also for neighborhood

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.799
schools that are achieving goal. I'm for all
of the above.

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:07.799
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:11.080
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel. A lot of people who support
charters think they're the end. No. They're

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:21.210
a means towards an end. They're not the end.
And so on that topic I will disagree, but

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.299
I'll disagree from a perspective of also data.

00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:35.700
If you take the self selective high schools
like, not limited to, Payton, Whitney on north

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.990
side, not limited to those, all the self select
is out, the seven best performing high schools

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:45.549
in our city are charter schools. There are
also charters that aren't doin' their job,

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:46.710
but I do believe in competition ?

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:47.710
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.610
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I do believe in choice, and
charters are a way to give parents choice

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.090
in a public school system and I'm committed
to public education.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:58.230
David Lieber: And we have a principle here
at Google called, "Data beats opinion" so

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.230
--

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.750
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well don't be so there's the
data.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.750
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Data beats itself.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.750
[laughter]

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.750
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I used to say about people
in Washington --

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.750
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.909
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: if they're firm in their opinion
it's their principles they're flexible on.

00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:06.909
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:07.909
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: [laughs]

00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:08.909
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: There you go.

00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:09.909
[laughter]

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:13.070
You reference Newtonian physics and we actually
had some questions around that.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.070
[laughter]

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:18.370
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well I'd better call my older
brother who's the smart one in the family.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.799
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:24.350
Seriously though, one particular aspect of
education that's very important to us is the

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.159
so-called STEM curriculum: science, technology,
engineering --

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:28.159
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Um-hum.

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:30.470
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: and mathematics because that's
what we do here and we need people coming

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.419
out of the school systems especially proficient
in those areas.

00:20:34.419 --> 00:20:40.080
So you've outlined sort of the overall comprehensive
education vision. Is there anything specific

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080
thoughts that you ?

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.080
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Yeah.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.230
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: can share regarding those
STEM type curriculum that matter to the future

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.740
of companies like Google in Chicago?

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.539
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well let's also, it's not
just matters of the future of Google. It matters

00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:50.539
to the future of the country.

00:20:50.539 --> 00:20:51.539
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:20:51.539 --> 00:20:53.799
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: While you happen to get swept
into it, no disrespect, I'm more interested

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:56.131
in the country than I am in Google. And I
say that to you --

00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:57.131
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Sure.

00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:58.131
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I wish you all the well --

00:20:58.131 --> 00:20:59.131
[laughter]

00:20:59.131 --> 00:21:00.131
especially these two ladies --

00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:01.131
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: And we're outta time.

00:21:01.131 --> 00:21:02.131
[laughter]

00:21:02.131 --> 00:21:03.269
Just go ahead.

00:21:03.269 --> 00:21:05.580
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I'll stay later. You go ahead.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.580
[laughter]

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.100
I'm havin' fun actually and we'll handle this
without you. We just actually figured out

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.799
a way to take you out of this whole equation.

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:13.799
[laughter]

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:14.799
Here's the deal.

00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:15.990
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah. [clears throat]

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:21.990
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: State of Illinois has adopted
the common standards: 39 I think or 41 other

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:27.420
states adopted it, but you have to have a
new curriculum to teach to the common standards.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.559
I've already talked to a number of foundations
around the country and Chicago will be the

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:36.350
first city to develop the new curriculum to
teach those common standards. And those common

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.840
standards aren't for tests, but they're for
graduation and then career development and

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.970
college education. And that's the way I'm
gonna get to it.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:47.559
Now let's be honest, so I don't want anybody
by the time that kid's ready to go to school,

00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:51.889
we'll have it done in the first four years.
So Chicago will be the first city in the country

00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:54.731
to adopt the new curriculum that goes with
the common standards.

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:55.789
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:21:55.789 --> 00:22:02.049
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: We also need -- part of this
whole reason I'm into my AUSL program -- is

00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:06.990
these teachers are trained not just to get
a master's in education but specialty for

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.990
the type --

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.990
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.990
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: of education you're looking
at.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.990
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum. Yep. Great.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:15.909
Next most popular topic area was around taxes.
There've been a lot of -- I guess kerfuffle

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:20.860
is the word -- over the past week of this
tax plan and that tax plan and disinformation

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.230
and counter information, can you just clear
the air --

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.049
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: We got you right where we
want you.

00:22:25.049 --> 00:22:27.730
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: In ahh. In plain English,
what's your tax plan?

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.810
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Oh, with that burden, plain
English? Okay here it is.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.030
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [clears throat]

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:43.049
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I believe that we deserve
a 20 percent tax cut in the sales tax. City

00:22:43.049 --> 00:22:48.460
of Chicago has one of the highest sales tax
in the country.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:49.460
[pause]

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.360
Now I've proposed three separate tax cuts.
The other two -- the elimination of the head

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.360
tax --

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.360
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: which is you wanna add employees
--

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yep.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.309
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: would help you. I also proposed
a sales -- tax reform in the utility and natural

00:23:03.309 --> 00:23:08.040
gas tax so right now it's structured as the
price goes up, you pay more. I want it to

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.059
be on a per unit basis so your usage is what
drives it which makes you more energy conservation

00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:15.850
and it saves the consumer money.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:24.570
Now in the sales tax I propose a 20 percent
reduction. We tax only a few items, so a single

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.769
mother who's trying to buy school supplies
is bearing that burden. Now I'm only sayin'

00:23:28.769 --> 00:23:30.480
it right here to you so just get ready.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.520
[pause]

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.440
You charter a private jet -- you're not paying
anything now. I don't want that single mother

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:44.629
to bear that burden alone. A lot of your clients
rent limos comin' in from the airport -- they

00:23:44.629 --> 00:23:50.159
don't pay anything right now. I'm gonna extend
it there. I'm telling you this up front. I

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:55.539
do not think a single mother should be bearing
this burden alone; she's tryin' to raise kids;

00:23:55.539 --> 00:24:01.950
she's tryin' to get 'em to school; she deserves
a tax cut; she's workin'.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:07.149
Now my whole life was about tax fairness.
That's why I got on the Ways and Means as

00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:11.750
a member of the House in Congress. And workin'
for President Clinton, President Obama, I

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.030
doubled the earned income tax credit. And
not only doubled it and fought Republican's

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:20.919
attempts to fight it, in my office we used
it with the tax assistance program to fill

00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:28.980
out tax forms for working poor 'cause I fundamentally
in the marrow of my bones believe if you're

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.779
working, your kid does not deserve to grow
up in poverty.

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:37.480
So I not only passed that legislation and
protected it, I helped people in my district

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.130
get $2 million worth of tax cuts. They would
get --

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.130
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Hum.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:47.420
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: $3200, $2800, $1800 back.
And for a single mother or a family, that's

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.369
Christmas and the entire year's worth of savings.

00:24:49.369 --> 00:24:51.799
[pause]

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:56.370
And not only that, you couple it with a children's
health care bill that made sure that, usually

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.140
those single mothers are young working poor
families that didn't have health care at the

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:04.049
place of employment, made sure that their
kids got health care. I made sure that the

00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:08.139
minimum wage, I said in Congress -- I led
the effort -- there'll be no pay raise in

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:10.970
Congress until we raise the minimum wage.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:16.620
Now I gotta tell you somethin'. My grandfather
was a union man. He used to sing a song to

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.940
us, "Which Side Are You On?". I'm gonna stand
with that single mother. I got no problem

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.940
with that.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.940
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.259
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: And if you rent a corporate
jet and you're comin' to Chicago, we're gonna

00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:31.470
make that single mother make sure she can
get that from paycheck to paycheck just a

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:38.149
little more. You rent a limo, you're gonna
carry some of that burden so she gets a tax

00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:43.119
cut. You wanna join Saddle and Cycle private,
exclusive club -- I don't have a problem with

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:47.240
any of these activities, but the reason we
have one of the highest sales taxes in the

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.860
country is working people are bearin' the
burden alone. And folks, that ain't right.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:59.169
And also it won't solve Newtonian physics
but people in this city are gettin' nickeled

00:25:59.169 --> 00:26:06.429
and dimed by taxes all the time. And one of
the reasons is because we got this thing turned

00:26:06.429 --> 00:26:12.890
upside down. We're puttin' too few people
paying on too few items when a lot of other

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.799
people are gettin' a break.

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:18.770
And if workin' for President Obama, President
Clinton, and working for the people of 5th

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:25.679
District taught me that on taxes we have to
be fair, we have to be equitable. And it is

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:31.320
wrong that a single mother is now paying a
bigger share of their taxes than people renting

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.980
corporate jets, limousines, or joining private
clubs. And I'm tellin' this to you for some

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:42.990
of your people that are comin' in here that
will change for them. But that is a bare sensible

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.360
fairness and it's good economics because if
we can lower the rate, Chicago will be a better

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.249
city. Fortune just rated one of the reasons
Chicago was difficult to live in for the sales

00:26:52.249 --> 00:26:53.249
tax.

00:26:53.249 --> 00:26:54.249
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:26:54.249 --> 00:26:55.249
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well let's get it cut.

00:26:55.249 --> 00:26:59.309
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: So when you frame that issue
as the single mom versus the private corporate

00:26:59.309 --> 00:27:01.380
jet, it's very compelling.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.380
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Um-hum.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.059
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: The counter argument has been
though that the economic health of the city

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:13.940
depends on small businesses and the individual
massage, masseuse tryin' to work, earn a living,

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:19.450
start a small business, the gym, those people
will actually be bearing the burden, not the

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.450
corporate jets.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:21.450
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well okay first of all --

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.450
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: So how do you respond to that?

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:25.249
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Two things: civic federations
endorse what I said.

00:27:25.249 --> 00:27:26.249
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:31.900
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: The Chicago Sun Times has
endorsed my proposal, the Chicago Retail Merchants

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.900
--

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.900
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:39.529
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: representing the small businesses
endorsed my proposal. All have said that because

00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:40.909
small business is the engine --

00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:41.909
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yep.

00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:44.659
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: and making sure. The other
thing is I said we'll have to work out the

00:27:44.659 --> 00:27:49.350
details with Springfield. That's where this
is decided and I will accept nothing that

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.389
violates the principle of a tax cut for working
families.

00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:52.389
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:53.389
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: That's number one.

00:27:53.389 --> 00:28:01.190
Number two, in a similar format, in a debate
at WTTW with a bunch of high school students,

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:06.960
the reason this became an issue is a high
school student asked me and one of my opponents

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.610
that the sales taxes were too high. The specific
question by a 16 year old and I said I supported

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:20.279
gettin' a cut in the sales tax. One of my
opponents said he agreed with me. Two weeks

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:22.270
before an election, all of a sudden, he disagrees.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.270
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.990
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I don't think that's really
fair to the 16 year old who you told eye to

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.519
eye you agreed on somethin'.

00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:30.519
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:28:30.519 --> 00:28:35.110
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Now the retail merchants who
represent the small businesses in Chicago

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:38.159
that drive the economy support this idea.

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:40.059
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yep. Okay.

00:28:40.059 --> 00:28:43.309
We had some other fiscal questions. One was
around privatization.

00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:44.309
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Um.

00:28:44.309 --> 00:28:47.779
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: So the question says, "We
sold off the Skyway Bridge then the parking

00:28:47.779 --> 00:28:52.419
meters. Now there's talk of privatizing the
Taste of Chicago and other festivals. These

00:28:52.419 --> 00:28:57.259
kinds of fiscal initiatives are generally
or universally unliked by Chicagoans." What

00:28:57.259 --> 00:28:58.350
do you think here?

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:03.270
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well two things: one I'm against
privatization --

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.270
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.230
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: it's run its -- folks aren't
for it. I don't think the capital markets

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.230
are for it --

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.230
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.279
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: you can't do it. I will say
usually we're a city known that divides over

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:16.580
education and crime. I give the mayor credit
for bringing the city together. People all

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.580
across --

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.580
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [chuckles]

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.580
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: the city hate the parking
deal.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.580
[laughter]

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.610
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: I let ya have that punch line.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:22.770
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: That's right.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:23.770
[laughter]

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.770
I didn't know Christmas was comin' early.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.110
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.240
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: So that has made --

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.240
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:34.480
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: folks are against it and I'm
against it. Here's the other thing though,

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.150
we have to figure out how to monetize certain
assets. That doesn't mean selling 'em or gettin'

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:44.580
rid of 'em. I'm against that. I said that
clearly, unambiguously. But a way to get some

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.649
value out of them so we can invest in what
I think is a key priority.

00:29:47.649 --> 00:29:53.529
One of the things I wanna get to -- you haven't
asked, I'm just gonna go there. I am big into

00:29:53.529 --> 00:29:59.759
our investment in our mass transit system,
okay. No other city outside of New York has

00:29:59.759 --> 00:30:04.240
more people use their mass transit to get
to and from work. In a Fortune study, not

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.780
Fortune, a study done by, I forgot who, that's
bad. But people in Chicago have rated both

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.929
our night life, our restaurants, our culture,
and our mass transit system with the quality

00:30:13.929 --> 00:30:15.120
of life of what they love about the city.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.120
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.799
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I -- when I first got to Congress
-- got the funding to expand the Brown Line.

00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:25.039
It used to be six cars; it's now eight cars,
Brown Line, modern stations. It makes getting

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:31.111
to and from work, the whole experience, much
better, quicker. We have to invest in our

00:30:31.111 --> 00:30:35.739
mass transit system. There are other infrastructure
needs. I'm telling you before the election

00:30:35.739 --> 00:30:41.980
what numero uno is for me. You need to know
that. And of the people that take the mass

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:47.960
transit, the Red Line is used by 40 percent
of 'em and it's been the least invested in.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:53.540
Now there's differences. On the north side
and the south side, but we gotta modernize

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:59.090
it. So the same type of stations, the same
type of capacity. On the south side, it's

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:03.850
gotta be taken from 95th to 130th. You can't
ask people to participate in an economy if

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:04.850
they can't get there.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:05.850
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:13.529
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: It artificially stops at 95th.
People live all the way to 130th. How do you

00:31:13.529 --> 00:31:16.009
get to work?

00:31:16.009 --> 00:31:18.600
I know I see a number of you on bicycles.
That's how I know you get to work.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.600
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.600
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emaneual: Okay?

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.600
[laughter]

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:29.080
Which is my second point. I've announced a
plan to -- we do eight miles a year -- I'm

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:34.489
gonna do 25 miles a year of new bike lanes
in the city. I want it to become a major,

00:31:34.489 --> 00:31:39.960
for folks who wanna do it, means of getting
to and from work, not just dodgin' in and

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:45.179
out of traffic. And we're gonna make dedicated
lanes that are safe. I'm gonna add 25 miles

00:31:45.179 --> 00:31:49.690
so by the end of my term, if I'm elected,
100 miles of new bike lanes in the city.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:54.470
I'm also gonna look to change the ordinance
so buildings like this will give people the

00:31:54.470 --> 00:32:00.850
space and the capacity to both park their
bikes securely and be able to change and get

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:06.600
to work if they bike to work. And I will say
this not just for the Googles but actually

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.669
for the new Googles of the world, that's gonna
be a big piece of economic development because

00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:15.109
it's gonna attract a work force that's sees
a city that allows them to get to and from

00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:16.860
work and the quality of life that they want.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.860
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:22.989
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: The bulk will use mass transit.
That's what I did when I was both a Congressman

00:32:22.989 --> 00:32:23.989
and worked in the private sector.

00:32:23.989 --> 00:32:25.179
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um.

00:32:25.179 --> 00:32:31.059
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: There's no doubt that my kids
when they grow up will probably bike. Their

00:32:31.059 --> 00:32:35.419
mother will yell at them to wear a helmet,
okay. But I want that, that's two pieces,

00:32:35.419 --> 00:32:39.700
I want that investment strategy I think it's
key to who we're gonna be as a city and it's

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.501
one of our advantages compared to other cities
when companies are lookin' at that you can

00:32:43.501 --> 00:32:49.239
get to and from work with relative convenience
is a big selling point besides your education

00:32:49.239 --> 00:32:50.450
and your caliber as employees.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:54.120
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: And as you may know these
Googlers in this room are responsible for

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.120
getting --

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.120
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I've never heard that. Are
you guys actually called Googlers?

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.120
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Googlers, yeah.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.120
[laughter]

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.120
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: God, I'm empathetic to you.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.120
[laughter]

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.019
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: But these folks were responsible
for getting the city's existing bike lane

00:33:05.019 --> 00:33:08.929
routes up and findable on Google Maps so it's
not just --

00:33:08.929 --> 00:33:09.929
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Oh.

00:33:09.929 --> 00:33:14.159
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: maps of mass transit or maps
of roads or cars. It's for bike lanes --

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:15.840
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I just pointed to my policy
guy. Well that's good.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.389
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: And Chicago, by the way, was
the very first major city to have its bike

00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:22.180
maps on Google Maps. So we look forward to
partnering with you --

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.980
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well, get ready 'cause were
adding 25 a year, man.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.980
[laughter]

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.980
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: There you go.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.980
So you mentioned Google on the --

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.980
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Googlers?

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:28.980
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Googlers.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.980
[laughter]

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.749
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I'm gonna have to try and
throw a line tonight at a debate for you,

00:33:31.749 --> 00:33:32.749
Matt.

00:33:32.749 --> 00:33:33.749
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Alright.

00:33:33.749 --> 00:33:34.749
[laughter]

00:33:34.749 --> 00:33:35.749
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Googlers? That's really --

00:33:35.749 --> 00:33:37.190
[laughter]

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:42.450
There's a line there but it's being videoed.
And I'm not touchin' it.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.450
[laughter]

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.450
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Alright.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.450
[laughter]

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.450
Then we'll move on.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:47.450
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:48.450
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: So you mentioned for the Googlers
--

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:49.450
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: It's the first time we've
ever had a seven second delay on the Google

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.450
video.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:51.450
[laughter]

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:52.450
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: There you go.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:54.149
You mentioned for the Googles of the world
and the future Googles -- one of your recent

00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:58.499
policy talks, you cited Groupon, BrightTag,
Threadless Google -- we thank you for that

00:33:58.499 --> 00:34:03.179
as examples sort of leaders in Chicago's tech
community coming from different perspectives

00:34:03.179 --> 00:34:09.070
and whatnot. What's your plan to attract companies
like these? You've talked about a biomedical

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.120
campus at Michael Reese. How do you see the
tech community playing in your plans?

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.160
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well let's be clear on a couple
things.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.480
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: One is I do actually think
what I talked about transportation's --

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.480
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.480
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: a key piece.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.480
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yep.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.740
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I announced in my speech that
we're gonna build a campus like situation

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:32.040
for like Google use out in California, I wanna
do that here. I wanna work with some of the

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.510
high tech startup companies about that type
of space, but as you mentioned as we were

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:41.970
walkin' through here. One of the reasons you
obviously provide food as a company --

00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:42.970
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:45.270
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: but if you guys can solve
a problem here, it's more efficient that way.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:51.770
I want that sense of innovation, creativity
where then two young people are talkin' and

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:52.770
it may become a company --

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:53.770
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.179
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: of the future. We don't know
but that campus like environment environmentally

00:34:56.179 --> 00:35:01.300
is clearly key not just culturally but economically.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.560
But young startups that are doing Web type
companies --

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.560
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.620
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: are different than people
that are going to be doing pharmaceutical

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:13.360
and new health care companies. The University
of Chicago is investing in a new bioengineering

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.320
center which is unbelievably important for
the city and for the country. I wanna create

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:23.230
a campus that allows new health care companies
to feed off that, but that's a different culture

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.010
-- let's be clear -- than the people that
would be ?

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.010
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.510
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: in the startup companies.
It's a total different kind of mindset, lifestyle,

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:33.850
instincts. Not a lot of 'em will be riding
bikes to work, but that we have to kinda do

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:41.041
that. We are a home to 13 separate wind companies,
fitting for the windy city.

00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:42.041
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Hum.

00:35:42.041 --> 00:35:43.041
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: But --

00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:44.730
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: But that's probably not widely
known.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.800
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Thirteen, actually more than
any other city in the country, Chicago.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.800
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Hum.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.580
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Wind, wind, I'm sorry. I know
it's hard for the Googlers to hear, okay?

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.580
[laughter]

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.370
I'm going to go for the whole week off that
one.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.250
[laughter]

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.310
So those are some of the things. The other
thing, and I mention this to you as though

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:04.310
--

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.310
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:10.480
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: maybe that was a slow pitch
off the center for me, is we are going to

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:17.970
have, if I'm mayor, I'm gonna pick kind of
a long weekend, a Thursday through Sunday,

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:24.500
music, food, etcetera, but a weekend where
we recruit the juniors and seniors from around

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.790
the 10 state area and also Illinois in the
math and science and engineering departments

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.310
to come see Chicago.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:39.530
I'm gonna get all the companies, the Googles
and the Googlers to the pharmaceutical companies,

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:45.880
to other tech companies, to the startup companies,
to the established, to the financial companies,

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:51.780
but I want these people not just from Purdue
and the University of Illinois but I'm including

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:56.990
northern Illinois, I'm including the schools
here, I'm including our community colleges,

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:04.110
but I'm gonna go to Lansing, I'm goin' to
Madison, I'm gonna go to Des Moines, I'm gonna

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:09.940
go down to St. Louis, and I'm gonna recruit
those juniors and seniors and I said I'm gonna

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:15.320
sell Chicago. And you are going to be a partner
in selling it. They'll probably be staying

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.540
at an apartment near you.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.540
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Hum.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.540
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: In your apartment. Not you
because --

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.540
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.540
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: you, I wouldn't let 'em near
it.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.540
[laughter]

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.110
Okay? But I'm serious about that. But I really
want -- here's the deal when I first helped

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:32.150
Mayor Daley get elected, we had to just run
the city. You still gotta do that which gets

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.360
to the first question that we talked about
--

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.360
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yep.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.080
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: delivering services to the
taxpayers.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:43.090
But today you're an ambassador to the world
at large about your city. That's a new part

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:48.780
of the job. It's developed over the last 10
years. San Antonio is a competitor, so is

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.780
Shanghai.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.780
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:56.380
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Louisville is a competitor,
so is London. I wanna sell Chicago and our

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:03.010
quality of life, our companies, our structures.
So as you told me, you're trying hire 100,

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.010
200 people.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:05.010
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yep.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.560
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I wanna make sure that there's
five applicants for those openings of quality.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.260
I did mention Groupon. They hire 180 a week
?

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.210
[pause]

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:20.500
400 a month, five applicants per opening.
And they've told me, Eric's told me. They

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.250
got people everyone of those five are capable
of hiring, taking that position, and they

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:30.050
have tough choices. I'm hopin' that's true
for you. I did talk to another company, Deloitte

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:36.050
Touche, they're gonna hire 500. They are actually
finding it difficult to find the full talent;

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:43.080
that's a high class problem we should solve.
And I also gotta be clear to you

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080
[pause]

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.510
I want people throughout the city to participate
in that. That just can't be an opportunity

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.510
for part of the city.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.540
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:56.740
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: We gotta be frank and honest
with ourselves in this room. Right now Google,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:03.390
Groupon, it's great, it's promising, I'm happy,
I want you to grow, I want you to grow in

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:07.760
Chicago, I want Chicago to be a bigger presence
for Google than it is today.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.010
But I want everybody who's growing in all
parts of this city to have an opportunity

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:16.060
to see Google in their future and we gotta
be frank and honest with ourselves. That's

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.910
just not true. And that's not the city we
want either. So I want you to make Google

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:25.551
on Google and all you Googlers feel at home
in Chicago, I want you to grow, I want you

00:39:25.551 --> 00:39:34.290
to prosper, but I want everybody, I want Jeremy
who's going to Simeon on the west side, I

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.760
want him to think Google's in his future.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.660
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: But we'd be and -- this one
I don't want you to interrupt for a second

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.660
and I love you.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.960
[laughter]

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.110
Not that much to let you interrupt.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:48.110
[laughter]

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:54.650
Part of being mayor and part of being a chief
executive and given the level of our difficulties

00:39:54.650 --> 00:40:00.260
as a city and our challenges is leveling with
people. And part of running for mayor is you

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.940
get big experiences that are wider than what
you'd normally do.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.370
[pause]

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:12.010
Google, I don't mean to pick on Jeremy, but
you've gotta be honest you know that in large

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:16.670
parts of our city, Google's just not part
of people's world views of what they think

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:24.520
they can be part of. And I want that. We're
known as a city that builds big things ?

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.080
[pause]

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:33.310
big airports, big mass transits, Millennium
Park; those are good things to be known for.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:39.470
The biggest thing we can build is the vision
of our children and I want Google to be part

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.540
of that vision.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.540
[pause]

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.520
You got somethin' you wanna add.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.520
[laughter]

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.850
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: We'd be pleased and proud
to be part of it.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.870
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Good. That's one of the kind
of corporation I want to be part of this city

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:52.240
and all the rest of the Googlers. I just had
to work that in one more time.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.240
[laughter]

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.920
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: We'll take some live questions,
but line up at the mics guys go ahead.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.360
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: How do you guys call live
questions? Is there a special word for that

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.360
too?

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.360
[laughter]

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.360
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: As opposed to dead questions,
okay?

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.540
But let's do a quick speed round.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.501
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: This is unfair to my former
-- never mind, I won't do that.

00:41:06.501 --> 00:41:07.501
[laughter]

00:41:07.501 --> 00:41:11.240
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Let's do a quick speed round
while the Googlers are lining up.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.630
Fast lightning round. Another Olympia bid,
yes or no?

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:18.680
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I'm fine with it but I'm not
gonna become a one trick pony on economic

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:24.560
development. That is I'm for it, but I'm not
gonna pin the entire city's future economically

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:29.460
on a one trick pony 'cause I don't believe
in lettin' people, that's just A the simple

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:33.100
answer yes, but it's not the ticket to our
economic future alone.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.310
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Cubs or Sox?

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.150
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Cubs.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:38.150
[cheering]

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.660
But I will go, no --

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.830
[laughter]

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:45.480
Cubs, but I'm gonna go obviously go down to
Comiskey Park and watch the game.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.490
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Last YouTube video you watched?

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.270
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Alright.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.270
[laughter]

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.270
Okay I'm gonna tell this story.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.390
[laughter]

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.440
We get to see this video before it goes out
right, no.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:04.640
This is a true story. Now you gotta understand,
I'm runnin' for office, okay --

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.640
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:12.170
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I got a lot on my plate, guys.
I don't remember. It's earlier than summer.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:20.549
Have you ever seen the video, you'll understand
this why I'm takin' time buildin' up the confidence

00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:21.549
--

00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:22.549
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:23.549
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: to tell this story.

00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:24.549
[laughter]

00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:26.420
Have you ever seen the video of our soldiers
in Afghanistan done to Lady Gaga?

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.420
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.420
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay the telephone.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.420
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:35.800
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay. That, I'm gonna protect
the innocence of one of my children. Early,

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:44.060
early before this thing went really went viral,
one of my kids said, "Dad have you seen this?"

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.550
This is the parts of parenting you're gonna
just love.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:47.550
[laughter]

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:53.010
I'm serious about this. I said, "No." So that's
a sign for Googleing.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.230
[laughter]

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:59.911
So we look it up, we do find it, and I watch
this video. If you haven't seen it you can

00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:07.080
look it up Afghanistan, soldiers, Lady Gaga,
the telephone. So I watch this video, I'm

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.330
laughin' hysterical, also admirable as a former
dancer their quality.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:12.330
[laughter]

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:19.830
They got their lines and sense of music unbelievably
well. So I forgot. Well anyway it was like

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:28.500
within the first week it came out. So Monday,
it's in the week so the next day the President

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.630
often has, once a week he has a meeting with
Secretary Gates of Defense and Head of Joint

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:40.920
Chiefs Mike Mullen. So as we're waiting to
go into the Oval, I said to Secretary Gates,

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.880
I said, "Hey have you seen this video --

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.880
[laughter]

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.890
on Afghanistan I call Lady Gaga you know the
telephone?" Now you can imagine Gates and

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:52.839
Mullen, I mean if it ain't in my world view,
and I'm just a notch cooler, not much okay

00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:53.839
--

00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:54.839
[laughter]

00:43:54.839 --> 00:43:55.839
it ain't in their world view.

00:43:55.839 --> 00:43:56.839
[laughter]

00:43:56.839 --> 00:44:00.630
So I said, "Don't worry about repealing Don't
ask, don't tell. The soldiers in Kandahar

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:01.630
already did it for ya."

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:02.630
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:03.630
[laughter]

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:06.300
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: [laughs] So they went and
watched it and Gates called, and Mullen and

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:11.430
Gates individually called, I'm sorry Secretary
Gates and Head of Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.350
Mullen called back and says, "Oh my God."

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.350
[laughter]

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.330
And they were all, it became a good laugh
for us.

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:17.330
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.480
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: So that was the last time
I can say -- that's a long story. A lot more

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.780
serious work got done in the White House --

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.780
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [laughs]

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:24.780
[laughter]

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.810
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: But I will tell you that was
the last time I really could say I saw a good

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:29.720
video and I said Secretary, "I'm just tellin'
ya --

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.720
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.720
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: the troops are ahead of you,
man.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.720
[laughter]

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.990
Get with it. As I always note you wanted to
lead your troops. Get in front man that is

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.750
some good dancers who understand music.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:38.750
[laughter]

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:39.750
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: There you go.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:40.750
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: And it's, have some people
seen this video?

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:41.750
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Yeah, sure.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:42.750
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay, it's a great video.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:43.750
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Good. Alright.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:44.750
With that, go ahead.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:45.750
&gt;&gt;Brian Benedict: Hi.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.040
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Your question's gonna look
so small now compared to that great story

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.040
--

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.520
&gt;&gt;Brian Benedict I don't know, I don't know.
I'm just, that actually kinda segues into

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.880
my question. My name is Brian Benedict and
I head up the Gay-glers which is another name

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.780
for you. It's LGBT Googlers here within the
office.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.960
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I got that part.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.500
&gt;&gt;Brian Benedict: There we go.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.500
[laughter]

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.500
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay, okay.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.180
&gt;&gt;Brian Benedict: You know Google has been
--

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.930
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I'll refer to you as Mr. Gay-gler
--

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:07.930
&gt;&gt;Brian Benedict: That works.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:11.020
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: okay? And everyone of you
behind are Mr. and Mrs. Googler, okay.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.230
&gt;&gt;Brian Benedict: So my question is, well
Google has been great. They pay for the taxes

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:16.500
for same sex marriages --

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.500
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Um-hum.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.250
&gt;&gt;Brian Benedict: in regards to health benefits
and whatnot and we've recently approved civil

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:27.660
unions. So I kinda wanna get your perspective
on the LGBT community and same sex marriages

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.660
basically.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.934
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Thumbs up, for it, big time
for it.

00:45:31.934 --> 00:45:32.934
&gt;&gt;Brian Benedict: Right. Well, that was easy.

00:45:32.934 --> 00:45:37.910
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay, no, but no, here's the
deal. Go right back to that microphone one

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:38.910
second.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:39.910
[laughter]

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:40.910
No I'm, here's the deal.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:45.300
[pause]

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:52.100
First when I was a congressman I had secured
the funding for the Halsted Street Center.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.410
At that point it was the largest federal support
ever given to a gay or lesbian organization

00:45:56.410 --> 00:46:03.010
in the country. And it's an incredibly great
community center for the gay and lesbian community

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:07.850
in our city throughout the city, not just
people in Boystown or Andersonville; that's

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:13.230
key to remember because they are our teachers,
they are our fellow colleagues and they live

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:17.200
throughout the city, not just in part of the
city.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:24.240
Two, I cannot be happier that I was Chief
of Staff when we finally passed and President

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.690
Obama signed into law the hate crimes law
and ran the process to get that done in the

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.430
name of Matthew Shepard.

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:37.960
And then three, this is about, part of life
is also being able to learn. Okay I was once

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:45.590
in my life in a hospital for seven weeks,
nearly died. Family came to visit, etcetera.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:51.440
David Buell, who's a dear friend of mine and
Amy and our kids -- travel together, vacation

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:57.000
together and Tom his partner. They happened
to be in D.C., David who has been the treasurer

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.090
of my campaign for Congress. He's the treasurer
now for me running for Mayor, David and Tom.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:05.330
David told me about a story and I've been
around health care 'cause my dad's a pediatrician,

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:10.720
my mother's a nurse, my brother's an oncologist,
told me about a woman in Florida who'd been

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:15.420
written up in the gay papers down there who
was kicked out of the room of a hospital because

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.540
her partner was dying but was not a family
member.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.540
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Hum.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:24.390
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Now okay I just got, again
I wanna level, that's not in my world view.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:29.250
It wasn't in my world experience in the same
way that dealing with the issue of food deserts

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:32.480
and we haven't discussed, wasn't in my world
view.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:39.250
And I looked into it and I went to the President
and I said, "This is wrong." And with his

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:45.390
direction worked through both the White House
Council, Health and Human Services, the Justice

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:49.180
Department under Eric Holder, and the President.
We developed it for six months -- an executive

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:54.910
order. If any hospitals receiving any federal
money they can no longer ban loved ones who

00:47:54.910 --> 00:48:01.520
are partners from being by the bedside of
their loved ones.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:09.530
And while part of civil union and marriage
is all about-- let's get real here -- it's

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:14.610
all about not -- it's about love, but it's
also about what we all in this room who are

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:20.700
straight take for granted and making sure
that that's available for gay couples: visiting

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.050
a hospital, sharing health care benefits,
getting a retirement and sharing it.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:32.560
Things that if you are gay are accepted, or
rather that if you are straight that are accepted

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.950
that you have to struggle to get to a level
playing field if you're gay or lesbian and

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:40.880
that is not true today. Now it is, now that
we have civil union, it is because we had

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.660
a President that had the courage on hate crimes,
had signed an executive order and repealed

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:50.710
Don't Ask Don't Tell and a Governor and a
state legislature who passed civil unions

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:55.460
here. It levels the playing field of equity,
fairness, and full citizenship.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.171
&gt;&gt;Brian Benedict: Thank you.

00:48:57.171 --> 00:48:58.171
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Thank you for askin'.

00:48:58.171 --> 00:48:59.400
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Okay.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.030
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Ladies and gentlemen, Ms.
Google.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.450
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs]

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:07.220
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Her. I am going to take this
all the way through the weekend I decided.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.220
[laughter]

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.220
Go ahead.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:14.070
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hello. So I don't have a problem
saying that the Hyde Park question is my question.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:15.070
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Right.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:19.120
&gt;&gt;female #1: I live in Hyde Park. We live
about two blocks from the Ray Elementary School.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:24.520
So when my baby was in my belly like hers
is I wasn't thinkin' about this. But now my

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:30.390
daughter is four and kindergarten is the next
step and we're lookin' around. So I understand

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:36.101
the suggestion of your plan to have it so
that the schools, the teachers in the schools

00:49:36.101 --> 00:49:39.960
are well and they come home and the parents
interact with the students well that's great.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:46.750
However, what if it seems like those schools
that are doing really great are miraculously

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.530
somehow outside of your district?

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:49.530
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emaneul: Hum.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:54.350
&gt;&gt;female #1: You can -- you either have to
move into the district and if it's a small,

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:58.930
I mean you know about Hyde Park. You can barely
move your elbow before you're touching somebody

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:04.310
next to you. So if you've got a really tight
residency in that district, then you need

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:08.890
to go to the school in your district, but
what if that school is not up to par with

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.620
the standards you like for your own child?

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.690
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Well that's -- A that's why
I wanna have these five year performance contracts

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:22.030
so I can start improving. B what I haven't
mentioned -- two other things --

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:23.030
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:29.630
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I am a firm believer, having
worked with President Obama and Arne Duncan,

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:34.440
I'm a firm believer in Race to the Top as
a model to spur innovation. We're gonna create

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:40.050
a Race to the Top just for Chicago so I can
spur local school innovation that improves

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:44.910
teacher quality, improves test scores, improves
parental participation. I'm gonna invest in

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:48.830
the things that I know produce success.

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:53.730
Third I wanna be the first city to adopt the
parent trigger. Okay, California did it. Parent

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:59.520
trigger -- your school's rated, I pick three
years but we could do two years, three years

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.740
in a row it's failing -- I'm gonna give the
parents six months; you get 51 percent of

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:09.440
the parents that sign a petition; I'm shuttin'
the schools down and I'm workin' with the

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.460
parents on what they want and replace.

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.460
&gt;&gt;female #1: Um-hum.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:17.780
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emaneul: That's how I'm gonna do this.
Okay I'm not now, up front, year one I ain't

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:23.110
turnin' the whole thing around. It's a big
institution of a lot of years. I gotta build,

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:28.240
which I why I wanna invest in the fundamentals
to move this thing to a place that every neighborhood

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:32.510
school and schools that you wanna go have
the capacity. The only way I know how to do

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:37.130
that is spend the money smart, invest in the
things that have proven over history, and

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:40.980
after study after study to work: parents,
teachers, and principals.

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.820
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.160
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Thank you. And thanks for
askin'. And you, trust me, both of you this

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.440
is gonna be your concern in no time.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.440
&gt;&gt;female #1: [ ].

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.440
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Yeah.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.440
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Let's take the last couple
of --

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.010
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Coming to a theater near you.
Go ahead.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:57.220
&gt;&gt;Stasha Hello, my name is Stasha and as a
dancer myself I think you may have won me

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.220
over with your comment about Joffrey.

00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.220
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Um.

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.220
&gt;&gt;female #2: Um.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.220
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: What kind of dance did you
do?

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:06.570
&gt;&gt;female #2: I still do, I, well I did, I
was a dance major in college and I currently

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:10.870
dance the Chicago Bulls so kinda just the
background of like ballet and a lot and --

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:11.870
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Jazz?

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.770
&gt;&gt;female #2: All types of dance, yeah.

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:14.900
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.360
Welcome to our conversation on dance, guys.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.360
[laughter]

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:23.120
&gt;&gt;Stasha: Well my question is about the Sweet
Home Chicago campaign proposal to possibly

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:28.200
set aside 20 percent of all TIF funds to affordable
housing and I just wanted to know your take

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.631
on that and, yeah, what your thoughts were
on that.

00:52:30.631 --> 00:52:36.250
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: One is -- look we have to
deal with affordable housing. Second, we have

00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:42.650
to reform TIF's so before I put more mandates
on TIF's, I gotta a lot of reforms we gotta

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:46.980
make. TIF's are the fastest growing part of
the city's budget and they're not in the city's

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:50.070
budget. Get them in the budget.

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:54.030
Two, bring full transparency to them.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:53:02.410
Three, even after 20 plus years or 30 years
of TIF's being around we still don't have

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:08.350
a standard that is this TIF reaching its economic
development goals, its job goals? Develop

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:13.060
that standard so we can measure the progress
of the TIF.

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:19.400
Third, in some communities, economic development
is gonna be affordable housing. In other communities

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:26.730
it's gonna be the retail type of commercial
work. Mandating something before I've made

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:32.461
all the necessary reforms to a TIF process
would be a mistake in my view. In addition

00:53:32.461 --> 00:53:38.030
to that, TIF's are for blighted economic communities
that are struggling. We have to shut down

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:41.240
the number of the TIF's that are in high rent
areas right now.

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.330
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:47.320
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: There's $950 million of unused
TIF funds; some of them have lived past their

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:52.420
value. And if I shut them down because they're
no longer there and they have surplus, guess

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:57.180
what -- who wins? The schools win because
the money will go from there back into the

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.880
property taxes to pay for schools.

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:06.000
So I'm okay with some of them being used for
affordable housing, but not until I get the

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:15.430
whole TIF process and TIF system reformed.
And also if I mandate a new mandate those,

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:19.450
what happens to the ones that are doing really
well and making progress in economic development

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:20.800
-- merely on the commercial side?

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.800
&gt;&gt;female #2: Um.

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:25.920
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: So that's why, let's reform
the TIF's, let's get 'em on the budget, let's

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.620
bring a level of transparency, let's set up
a standard for economic progress to measure

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:36.470
before we offer a new mandate. And some are
already doing that and that doesn't mean that

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:42.540
TIF's are the only way to achieve our goals
on affordable housing. Okay?

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:43.540
&gt;&gt;female #2: Alright. Thank you.

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.880
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: And we are gonna talk dance
later.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.880
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: [chuckles]

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:46.880
&gt;&gt;female #2: Alright.

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.880
[laughter]

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.880
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: You wanna do --

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.880
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Shall we take the final question
here?

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.880
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Final, I'm okay on time?

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.880
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Final question.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.880
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Final question. Last round.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.010
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Hi. Okay, no pressure. So my names
Tiffany and I was born and raised in Chicago

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:59.110
up on the West Side in the Austin area, north
Lawndale --

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:00.110
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Um-hum.

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:03.190
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: and I currently live in Humboldt
Park and I really wanted to ask you what your

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:07.760
plan is for what can only be called epidemic
of violence in our city particularly in the

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:13.360
poor neighborhoods, and what your plan is
in your first 100 days as mayor and long term

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.600
as mayor to really curb --

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.600
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Hum.

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.600
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: an epidemic of violence --

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.600
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Oh, okay.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:18.600
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: because I was overseas and --

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.750
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I thought you said what was
my plan for the 100 days across the board

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:22.750
of issues.

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:23.750
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: [laughs] No, no.

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:24.750
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Okay. Alright.

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:30.860
Well that is a good question. First of all
I wanna just before I get to crime can I say

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:36.440
somethin' about North Lawndale? There is,
where I gave my education speech was at the

00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:40.220
Bethune School in North Lawndale. It is now
one of the teaching academies that I told

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:46.280
you about. The principal there, Ms. Hightower,
is co-chair of my campaign. In one year they've

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:52.300
raised their reading scores 20 percent. Same
kids from the neighborhood, same building,

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:58.991
different principal, different teachers, scores
are up. All graduates of this teaching academy

00:55:58.991 --> 00:56:00.540
model.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.840
Now what I'm very impressed also one of the
things I wanna get to I can't do it overnight

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:10.040
again, there's Bethune, there's Johnson, and
there's a Collins High School not too far

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:15.740
and they're all part this. I wanna create
those campuses where a family knows from kindergarten

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.310
to high school, they got an excellent program.

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:19.310
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um.

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:23.690
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: I do not wanna see these parents
on ninth grade goin' into a cliff. I'm gonna

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:27.340
get you cryin' but I want you to know in your
old neighborhood, North Lawndale, there's

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:32.630
a beacon of hope and it's got a heartbeat
and it's beating bright.

00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:42.170
Two: crime. For President Clinton, I was his
point person on crime in the White House.

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:47.200
We passed the assault weapon ban, the Brady
Bill which is a five day waiting period for

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:53.730
hand guns, the 100,000 community police officers
program, the Violence Against Women Act, Megan's

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:54.730
Law --

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:55.730
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Um-hum.

00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:58.190
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Sexual predator moves into
a neighborhood out of prison, the community's

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:03.280
notified. And when I was a congressman, Elder
Justice Act which I told you came from a lady

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:07.370
at a grocery store tellin' me about it which
is the first time in five years, first time

00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:15.570
that the federal law recognized crimes again
seniors, be they financial or physical.

00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:22.320
I've outlined a very specific plan based on
the '94 crime bill. A thousand additional

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:28.900
police on the street and getting kids and
guns off the street. It has to be comprehensive.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:34.020
The police doing community policing, backing
up the beat officers are the backbone of the

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.020
police department.

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:40.480
The after school program, I already told you
about Jeremy. Two-thirds of all juvenile crime

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:46.171
the hours of three to six. School is out,
mom or mom and dad aren't home. Get these

00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:51.340
kids into the adult supervised activities
so they're not victims of crime.

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:57.620
And then third, prosecution of our gun laws.
Would I like more gun laws? I'm gonna fight

00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:01.560
for it. Do I think if we're not gettin' new
gun laws after what happened in Tucson, Arizona

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:07.420
-- I'm not pinnin' my hopes on either Springfield
or Washington wakin' up.

00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:12.370
Now our State's Attorneys you've seen in the
news, Scott Cutt's coming. They prosecute

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:16.310
our gun crimes. That's why I've called for
the U.S. Attorney to start supporting what

00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:23.010
we're doing on prosecuting gun crimes. I don't
see them laying off any lawyers.

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:29.810
So more cops on the beat, kids, guns, and
drugs off the street. That's the strategy;

00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:34.420
you add a thousand additional officers, do
the reforms, and everything I just told you

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:41.170
on my website, I know you know how to Google
and go there and you can find exactly how

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:43.180
I pay for it and how I accomplish it.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:49.470
And I'm also gonna, and where we started,
I wanna change the philosophy and that philosophy

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:53.820
in the police department is that the bureaucracy
is not the backbone, the beat officer is the

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.360
backbone. Everything we do is to back up that
beat officer.

00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:02.710
I can't thank you enough and I look around
here and I see the promise of Chicago. I will

00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:06.910
come back as mayor if I'm elected and do this
and I expect another 100 people hired by Google,

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:07.910
if not 200.

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:08.910
[applause]

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:11.010
Thank you.

00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:14.670
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: Thank you. We have a bike
shirt for you.

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:15.670
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: [laughs]

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:16.670
[applause]

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:18.581
&gt;&gt;David Lieber: This is our Google Chicago
logo. Here you are.

00:59:18.581 --> 00:59:19.581
&gt;&gt;Rahm Emanuel: Thank you so much. Thank you
guys. Thank you very much.

00:59:19.581 --> 00:59:19.582
[applause]
