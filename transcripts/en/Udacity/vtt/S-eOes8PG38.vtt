00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.650
Why is this an important application class to consider? Well,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.450
obviously the Internet has just opened up so many different opportunities for

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.030
applications. That means, not only more applications but more customers,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.150
heavier load, increasing demand on the resources. Hence,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.260
performance and resource consumptions considerations, nonfunctional constraints.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.750
Also, the hardware resources themselves have become more specialized.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.220
Think about ATM machines or card readers at gas stations, or

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.680
mobile phones, or square card readers.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.260
Just all kinds of devices that have their own peculiarities.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.640
Also we've seen increasingly powerful applications, okay, that involve

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.280
integrations of existing components, and sometimes even negotiation among them.
