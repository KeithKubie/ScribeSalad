00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.760
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster: Good morning.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.060
I'm Jennifer Harbster.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.410
I'm a research and
reference specialist

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.950 position:56%
with the science technology division
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.420
I'd like to welcome you
to today's program; Dawn:

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.890
A Journey to the Beginning
of the Solar System.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.380
This program is part of a
series of programs or series

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.280
of lectures presented through
partnership between my division

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.440
and NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.510
I'm also happy to report
that this is the ninth year

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.630 position:56%
that the Library has been partnering
with Goddard and I also want

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.500
to remind you of our last program
of the year and it certainly is not

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.650
to be missed if you're into Pluto.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.340
Tuesday December 8 from 11:30 to
12:30 right here in the Pickford.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.890
Dennis Rioter, he's
an astrophysicist

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.500
and an instrument scientist for
the NASA's New Horizon mission.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.230
He's going to be highlighting some

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.540
of those first close
up images of Pluto.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.610
So it's going to be a
highly illustrated lecture

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.360
and I hope you can attend.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.400
But today we are learning
about the Dawn mission,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.220
to the giant asteroid Vesta
and the dwarf planet Ceres.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.160
It's my pleasure today
and an honor today

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.190 position:56%
to introduce today's speaker Dr
Lucy McFadden, a planetary scientist

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.300
who investigates the surface
composition of asteroids, comets,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.640
meteorites, as well as our own
satellite, which is our moon

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.360
and of those moons of Jupiter.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.180
Dr McFadden is currently a
co-investigator on the Dawn mission

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.280
which seeks to unlock some of the
mysteries of planetary formation

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.590
by studying Vesta and Ceres.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.540
She also leads Goddard's higher
education and university programs,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.900
facilitating the training
of the next generation

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.000
of stem professionals
for the sciences

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.110 position:56%
and exploration director at Goddard.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.440
Dr McFadden received
her undergraduate degree

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.750 position:56%
at Hampshire College in Amherst
Massachusetts where she took a class

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.060
on optical and radio astronomy
that changed her life.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.670
She received her master's degree in
earth and planetary science at MIT

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.960
and a doctorate in
geology and geophysics

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.820
from the University of Hawaii.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.510
So when I was writing this
introduction I had a really hard

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.270
time picking out all these
accomplishments to highlight

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.280
that Dr McFadden has done so
far in her amazing career.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.270
So I thought I would
do some Cliff Notes.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.610
So one of her accomplishments is
she is a founding and past director

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.770
of the College Parks
Scholars program,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.880
science discovery in the universe.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.040
She also is the co-editor of the
Encyclopedia of the Solar System,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.890
the first and second editions,

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.610
which we have in the
science reference collection.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.140
She also was a research professor
from the department of astronomy

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.080
at the University of Maryland.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.070 position:56%
She was a member of the science team

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.600
for the NEAR Earth Asteroid
Rendezvous mission which orbited

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.390 position:56%
and landed on the asteroid 433 Eros.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.220
She's a co-investigator
on the Deep Impact mission

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.760
that investigated comets.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.330
She's also collected
meteorites in Antarctica

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.430
and she has an asteroid
named after her;

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.720
asteroid 3066 is named McFadden.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.950
So please now join me in
welcoming Dr Lucy McFadden

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.750
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.420
[ Applause ]

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.720
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Thank
you Jennifer.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.020
It's a pleasure to be here
and an honor to be invited

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.200
to give this lecture today and I
just hope you'll share the journey

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.920 position:56%
and the excitement of discovery that
my team members and I have engaged

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.320
in in the past numerous years.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.100
It's actually has been
a 15 year journey.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.040
I was sitting here staring at
my cover slide and want to point

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.130
out that the Dawn mission
is a partnership.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.700
It's a NASA mission,
but it's a partnership

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.050
with scientific leadership
at UCLA and I'm going

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.370
to read across from the bottom.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.190
It is managed by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory at Cal Tech.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.190
Our spacecraft, our
little spacecraft that can

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.990
and favorite was built by
Orbital, which was merged a couple

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.290
of months ago and is
now Orbital ATK.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.650
We have instruments provided
by the Italian Space Agency

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:08.410 position:56%
and the German Space Agency, DLR and
those are, and the camera is managed

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.450
by the Max Planck Institute,
which is MPS and Veer is managed

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.770
by Institut Nasional for
astrophysical in Rome.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.670
So I'm part of a team and
I'm here to share what we've,

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.110
what are team has done
so far with you.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.420
Because it's a tough time out
in the world, I want to set,

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.040
give us some cosmic relief.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.950
Let's go out beyond Ceres and look
back toward the sun and I'm going

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.280
to work my way out so,
from the sun working

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.680
out you can see the inter planets,
the terrestrial planets; Mercury,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.090
Venus, Earth with its moons,
and Mars and the orbits.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.710
Their orbits are drawn in here
in this artist rendition just

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.310
to remind us that everything

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.950
in the solar system orbits
the sun and elliptical paths.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.220
And then we have the
asteroid belt, which the,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.460 position:56%
which our artist here has designated

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.990
and so you can see all these
fragments of the asteroid belt

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:18.030
that were growing into planets, but
that planet growth was disrupted

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.180
when Jupiter migrated in
toward the sun and resulted

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.640
in gravitational disruption
that caused a lot of collisions

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.620
of which many and most of
the asteroids are fragments

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.390
from those collisions, but there
are a couple of larger asteroids

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.040
that have remained intact since
the beginning of the solar system

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.580
over four and a half
billion years ago.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.750
So here in the fore ground in the
lower right is a representation

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.020
of Ceres as we knew
it before we arrived.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.040
You can see it has some
fuzzy little lobes around it.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:01.010
Sort of looks like lungs and the
Herschel, the Herschel observatory,

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.080
European observatory
has observed and couple

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.080
of years ago some evidence
of out gassing

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.960
of water associated with Ceres.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.830
So we were eager to get to Ceres

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:20.330
and see what the Dawn mission
could, could reveal to us.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.280
Prior to getting there, we had
used the Hubble space telescope.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.640
So again, a partnership of
all the resources available

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.940
around the world.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:35.390
We studied, we imaged both Vesta
and Ceres with the Hubble telescope

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:41.500
and observed it as, it over time
and observed changes with its,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.110
as it rotated and you can see
here slight, subtle changes

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.740
in the color for each object.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.040
And you should see first off
that Ceres is more or less round

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.830
and Vesta is more or less
not round and it sort

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.690
of has a bite taken
out of the bottom.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.600
And it's for this reason
that the IAU

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.370
in 2006 deemed Ceres a dwarf
planet because it's round

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:17.550
and gravitationally relaxed and
has cleared its region around it

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.640
and Vesta is still an asteroid.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.740
It's not gravitationally relaxed.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.800
It's not round and we figured
out why with the Dawn mission.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:36.230
So next I want to give, pay tribute
to our satellite, the spacecraft.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.320
We call it the Dawn spacecraft.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.220
It is powered by ion propulsion.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:48.820
Ions, it has a tank full of
Zenon, which is an inert gas

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:55.160
and the Zenon pushes out,
thrusts out the ions behind it

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.380
and it gives the spacecraft
and equal and opposite force

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.770
in the other direction
and it thrusts

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.570
and moves the spacecraft
through space.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:10.870
We couldn't have done what we have
done without this ion propulsion.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:17.000
Every thrust sort of gives the
force of a piece of paper sitting

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.540
in your hand, but that force
is added up to the spacecraft.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.350 position:56%
It keeps moving and you get a little
bit of change in velocity as it goes

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:35.600
and so over the seven years of
its time in space, it has thrusts

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:42.980 position:56%
over 50,000 times for, I'm sorry
thrusts for 50,000 hours, I'm sorry,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:51.060 position:56%
for a total of about 5.7 years and
that has resulted in a high velocity

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.880
that is allowed the spacecraft
to get out to where we're going.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.000
With only using the
mass of the Zenon

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.130
in the tank as a propulsion device.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:07.500 position:56%
If we had used conventional chemical
propulsion called hydrazine it

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.930
would've weighed too much and
we would have not been able

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.840
to launch it at the cost
of the Discovery mission.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:20.330
So our ion, our ion engines got
the spacecraft to where it's going,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.470
but it took us seven
years to get there.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.630
So we traded off cost for time,
but hey it gave me a great,

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.910
you know I was, it happened
at the right time in my career

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.410
so I was able to see it at the end.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.670
So while it's in space,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.170
the spacecraft is powered
by solar panels.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:45.620
We've, the spacecraft has travelled
to over three times the distance

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.450
from the, three times the
distance of the earth to the sun.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.960
So it's far away.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.610
It needed large solar panels
to collect enough sunlight

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.230
to get enough energy to
power the instruments.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.080
So the solar panels
are 65 feet long.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.860
To put that to scale, when
I moved from Baltimore

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.080
to California many years ago,
I put my family's furniture

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.230
in a moving van that
was 70 feet long.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.350
It carried three families
worth of junk or furniture,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:27.430
but to scale that's like a long
semi, 16 wheeler semi-trailer.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:34.330
Our instruments are the eyes and
ears and nose of the spacecraft.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.030
Include a camera, a framing
camera that was provided

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.930
by our German colleagues and led

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:46.100
by Andres Natuse at
Max Planck Institute.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.900
Our gamma ray and neutron
spectrometers are American made

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:56.570
and headed up by Thomas Prettyman
who, he built the spectrometers

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:01.310
at Los Alamos National Laboratory
and he's now operating it

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.520
from the Planetary Science
Institute in Tucson Arizona.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.990
And then our visible and infrared
mapping spectrometers built

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.570
by our Italian colleagues is
led by Christina Desanktus

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:21.340
and they had it built with
Italian, by an Italian company

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.650
under Christina's direction
and they are now operating it.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.230
we also consider the antenna on
the spacecraft as an instrument

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.740
because the antenna sends back
signals that give us the location,

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.960
the precise location of
the spacecraft and from

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.100
that information we derive
gravitational maps and information

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.640
about the gravity field
of our targets and so

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.490
that allows us to study
the interior.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:51.210
So the antennas are sort
of forth instrument.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.700
We launched, okay so our spacecraft
was launched on a Delta-2 rocket

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.880
from Cape Canaveral and have
any of you had the opportunity

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.290
to see a spacecraft launch?

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.770
Do any of you think of, okay good.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.000
Have, what is better than
watching a spacecraft launch?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.510
[Laughter] Never mind, we
better not answer that.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.640
[Laughter] So, but if you
even have a chance to,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.280 position:56%
you know go to see a spacecraft
launch, it's really pretty exciting.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.540
And this is a photograph of the
launch at the launch pad at night.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.690
Okay, this is not, this is not
a model, even though I have one

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.130
on my desk at home, but this is,

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.210
this was it the night
before we launched.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.560
All lite up.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.870
We went out to the, we
went out to check on it

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:41.210
and the mosquitos were horrific
so take DEAT when you go

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.370
and then the next morning
we were fortunate

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.620
to have the weather conditions
such that we could launch.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.110
And we launched at dawn
on September 27, 2007.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:57.130
Okay so here we are in
2015, eight years later.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.120
Let me show you our path.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.940
So let's see, Dawn launches in
at the earth and we spiraled

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:16.770
out past Mars a year later and
then had a three year cruise

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.040
to Vesta and arrived in 2011.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.620
Spent a year orbiting Vesta
and I'll tell you about that

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:33.360 position:56%
and while Vesta itself moved in its
orbit around the sun, so we spiraled

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.520
around it and left for another
three year cruise and arrived

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.950
at Ceres in March of 2015.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.890
Yes so we're, so my
story will not end

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.310
yet because we haven't ended
the mission and we're still

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.180
in this interpretation phase,
which you'll hear about shortly.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.810
So Dawn is the first mission
to orbit a main belt asteroid.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:04.690
We had orbited a smaller near
earth asteroid back in 2000,

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:09.780
but this was the first main
belt asteroid and I think,

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.140
I just want to let
this, here's summation

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.980
of our observations of Vesta.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.120
So the spacecraft, I'm
sorry the asteroid is orbit,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:27.280
is rotating on its axis one day on
Vesta is five hours and 20 minutes.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.840
So we're lucky we don't
live on Vesta.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.400
[Laughter] We'd never feel
like we got anything done.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.340
So I almost want to say
well what do you see

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.040
as the spacecraft is rotating?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.490
&gt;&gt; It's shaped like a mountain.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.140
&gt;&gt; Shaped like a lemon, good.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.120
There are mountains.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.230
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.480
There's streak down the center.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.920
There's something going across,
I can play it one more time.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.620
I think I have time to
play it one more time.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.780
There's streaks going around
the equator or at an angle.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.910
Those are compressional
tectonic features.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.830
Here's another set of
lineations at the equator.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.470
We do see a lot of craters to
begin with and that mountain

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.100
at the southern hemisphere,
that mountain is a big basin.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.950
Oh there are those three,

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.240
three craters that sort
of look like a snowman.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.830
We had a Christmas card
and we put a snowman on it.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.320
[Laughter] Okay so let's take a
look at some of these features.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.220
I'm going to go down to the
southern basin to that mountain,

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.220
which is really the central
peak of a large crater.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.790
It's, okay.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.090
There we go, okay.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:44.830
So now, now we've taken our images
with a digital terrain model

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:52.250 position:56%
that we derived from all the images
and laid, lay the, we color coded it

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.360
for the altitude from the
center of Vesta, okay?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.490
So the blue is the
deepest part of this basin

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:09.560
and it's 14 miles below the mean,
you know sea level on the asteroid,

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.670
they don't call it sea
level, but the mean geoid.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.280
So it's 14 miles deep and the peak

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.940
of the mountain in
red is 12 miles high.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.660
So this peak is more than
twice as high as Mount Everest.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.640
Well that's not surprising
because there's not

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.020
as much gravity on Vesta.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:33.090
Vesta is 250 kilometers across.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.910
If I were to lay that onto
a map of the United States,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.750
it would sort of fit across
the state of Texas, okay.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.870
So this is a small body.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.860
So there's not much gravity.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.260
So if you have an impact
and you have an impact

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.830
and something rebounds without much
gravity it's going to get very big.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.010
But still, this is pretty,
this was pretty spectacular.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:18:01.130
We saw evidence of it from
Hubble and when you think

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.550
about it you say wow, it's
amazing that Vesta is still intact.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.590
You know, that it's still a whole
body and not total fragments.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:14.740
Well it turns out it was formed
by these, by huge impacts

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:19.920
in the southern hemisphere, in
the southern hemisphere and debris

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:26.360
from that impact created a
family of Vesta asteroids

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.100
and there are hundreds of
smaller asteroids that are

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.360
about 50 kilometers across.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.600
One-fifth or smaller the diameter
of Vesta that are in orbits

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.640
that are close, similar to Vesta.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.790
And in fact, throughout the
age of the solar system,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.690
this probably happened four,
three or four billion years ago.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.660
Some people say maybe
it, a billion years ago.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:58.480
Smaller debris has been
scattered across the solar system

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.810
under gravitational influences
from other planets like Mars

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:09.700 position:56%
and other asteroids and in fact
there have been many pieces of Vesta

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.320
like asteroid fragments
that have landed on earth.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.120
And in fact, one in every
seven meteorites that we have

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.360
in our meteorite collection
is from Vesta.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.210
&gt;&gt; How do you know that?

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:30.830
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: We know
that from, we know that from,

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:35.790 position:56%
we take the meteorites in here that
we have in our hand and in our labs.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:41.020
We shine a simulated sun on it
and look at the reflected light

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.790
that gives us spectral signature.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.080
It's like the finger print
from these meteorites.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.170
They're called basaltic
achondrite meteorites.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:55.230
We also, we also name them HEDs
because they have names based

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:59.660
on the first type, that's
probably extraneous information.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.120
But then, so we have
the reflected signature.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.260
This is my, the thumb print of
these meteorites and we look

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.800
at the reflected sunlight
from Vesta itself

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:16.540 position:56%
and it has the diagnostic signatures
of these reflectance spectra.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.840
So they are identical.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.140
That's the first reason.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:24.420
The second reason is that
we have dynamical models.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.790
We can predict the
gravitational changes,

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:32.760
pushes and shoves throughout the
age of the solar system that show

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.280
that fragments from Vesta
can migrate into a region

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.450
of the asteroid belt, a
resonance that will sent them

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.450
on a direct path to earth.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:48.330
So that's the second and then
the third aspect is that we see,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:58.620
that we see trace amounts of
fragments within these meteorites

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.930
that we also see evidence
for from the Dawn mission.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.740
So we're pretty certain
and there are no other,

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.070
there are no other large objects
in the asteroid belt besides Vesta

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:15.240
and the Vestoids family that have
these same spectral signatures.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:21.230
So then my colleagues, my geologist
colleagues took, got their hands

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.480
on all the images from Vesta and
they start making geological maps.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.740
So they take, based on the surface
features and the relationships

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.360
of various flows and the
density of the craters.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.400
So here's a geological map of
Vesta with a time sequence.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.970
I'm going to start in the
upper left, the green,

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.020
the Marcia crater material
is the most recent.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.320
It's young.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.900
There are very few
craters on top of it.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.920
So it's the youngest material.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:02.290
Then the yellow and red to the
blue is material from Rhea Silvia,

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.270
which was that, the southern
hemisphere formation.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:13.210
I'm sorry I didn't bring a
pointer and, oh no here's a gavel.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.410
[ Laughter ]

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:19.120
So there's the Rhea Silvia material
from that impact that was spread

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.090 position:56%
and you can see it covered most of
the southern hemisphere because most

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.650
of it that's blue material
that covers part

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.210
of the southern hemisphere.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.640
And then the Venenata,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.590
there's another basin
beneath the Rhea Silvia basin.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.050
There are actually two basins.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.350
Oh thank you.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.590
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: There's a
formation beneath Rhea Silvia

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:49.730
that is the oldest material.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.720
So we have --

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.020
&gt;&gt; It's not working.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.320
It doesn't --

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.620
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: There we go.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.920
There we go.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.070
So this is the oldest material
is in the purple and the brown,

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:06.600
which is cratered highlands
and we've also marked some

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.140
of the tectonic features that
are caused by the giant impact.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.170
Here's, here are tectonic features

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.940
from the older Venenata
impact that go here.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:21.670
So we have the geologist who, you
know we now have a time sequence

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.570
and we have special resolution
that we couldn't see before.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:31.040 position:56%
Another, I'm going to give you two
other, two other significant results

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.270
from Vesta before we
move onto Ceres.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:42.430 position:56%
Here's the map of reflectance beyond
the region where our eye can see.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:48.050
Out beyond one micron and this
reflectance shows variations

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.580
in brightness across the surface.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.150
Part of it is brighter and here's
a dark region in the center

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.090
and another bright region here.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.470
We could see this from our
ground based telescopes,

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.950
but we didn't know
what it was caused by.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:05.520
So from the Dawn mission, I
think we have a good idea.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:14.280
This dark material here also has
a, is correlated with the presence

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.400
of an absorption feature
in the spectrum

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.750
that is due to OH bearing species.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:27.030
So hydrated species, not water
itself, but hydrated species.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.890
That's, so we got evidence
from our spectrometer

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:36.660 position:56%
that this darker stuff has an
absorption due to hydrated minerals.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.150
We also found correlation
with a certain type

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.800
of those basaltic achondrites

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.260
because they come in
different flavors.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.560
Those meteorites that come from
Vesta come in different flavors.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.330
Basically three, three
different flavors; blue, green,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.230
and red, but they have names.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:02.710
Eucrites, Howardites, and
Diogenites, but this region here

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:08.730 position:56%
of the Eucrites is the ancient crust
and has more of this dark material

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.610
in it and these meteorites, when
we look at them here on earth,

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:15.880
they also have small
amounts of this dark material

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.150
from carbonation chondrites
that are dark and hydrated.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.680
And then our third evidence
that supports this is our,

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.990
from our gamma ray neutron maps.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:30.310
I'm sorry I don't have them at the
same scale, however, the foot print

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:35.280
of these, of this neutron
spectrometer is much larger.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.100
So I can't give it the same
detail, but you can certainly see

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:44.330
in this region between about 60
and about 120 degrees longitude

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.800
that this region has
an overabundance

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.030
of hydrogen bearing material.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:55.730
So that's two instruments that
give us this evidence of water,

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.920
water bearing species in it.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:08.380 position:56%
and then my third set, so in summary
we have the giant basin forming

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.890
impacts, redistributed
material all over Vesta.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.900
We have evidence of dark, hydrated,
carbonatious material remnant

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:22.130
from the earlier Venenata
impact that has located,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:27.520
concentrated between 60
and 120 degrees longitude

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.860
and the spacecraft itself, while it
was orbiting Vesta for over a year,

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.400
from its gravitational
model was able to determine

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.240
that Vesta itself has
a metallic core.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.700
And that's also consistent
with the formation

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.600
of these basaltic achondrite
meteorites that we have

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.050
because they have had all their
metallic iron removed from them.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.440
So in many cases, after, you know

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.690
in many cases Vesta has
many similarities to a very,

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.060
small, tiny terrestrial planet.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.120
It has an iron core like the earth.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.020
It's way tinier than the earth.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.270
It has evidence of
basaltic volcanism,

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:16.680
silicate rich material has been
heated during the life of Vesta,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.280 position:56%
heated and float out on the surface.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.600
Just like volcanic
flows here on earth.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.660
And then the impacting that
occurred throughout the earlier

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.070
or the older times of the solar
system has redistributed the

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:38.390
material and sent some of
it here towards us on earth.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.340
So Vesta is very similar,
has similarities

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.280 position:56%
to a terrestrial, earth like planet.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:50.020
We just finished publishing that
work and it came out last spring

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:55.560 position:56%
and that took us, it took us a
couple of years and we made good use

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.180
of the time while the spacecraft
was cruising onto Ceres.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.970
So let's go onto Ceres.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.320
So it's the first,
the first spacecraft,

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.020
our second first of
the Dawn mission.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:16.040
Arriving at Ceres, we went
into orbit on March 6.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.850
The first thing we did and
this was a project that I led,

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.790
was to look for moons around Ceres.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.940
We also looked for
moons around Vesta.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.150
We didn't find anything down
to about 30 meters on Vesta,

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.900
so there's nothing orbiting
like a moon around our earth

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.380 position:56%
or around Mars, which has two moons.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:46.420
So at Ceres we looked and here on
the left is a night sky projected

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.130
at the same scale as our
camera on the Dawn spacecraft.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:57.560
So our, and we've highlighted
a couple of stars here

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:04.760 position:56%
and you cannot see Ceres, but here
on the right is an image on approach

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.910
to Ceres taken by our camera and
it's not pretty because I want

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.900
to look at all the flaws
and everything and make sure

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.420
that I know what I'm looking
at and make sure I'm looking

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:22.400
for a tiny object that's
moving around Ceres.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.990
So I'm looking at everything and
checking everything that we see

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:32.710
and make sure it's either an
artifact on my camera or something

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:37.240
or an object, a star, or
something with motion.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.060
Now if I just look at one, so I've
highlighted some of the objects.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.570
This is an artifact of
the readout on the camera.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.960 position:56%
It's a CCD camera and we just can't,

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.190
there's so much signal here it
doesn't get read out clearly.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:56.210
Here's, this is, circled in red
is an artifact on the image.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:02.080
It would take, we took hundreds
of images and we devised a method

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:08.950
where we add the images that
in time focusing on Ceres.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.290
Here we've got Ceres
off at the edge.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:16.330
We're not interested in Ceres,
but here we've added 64 images

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.690
that are registered on Ceres and
since the spacecraft is moving

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:26.850
in space, these background
stars will move themselves

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.420
and so they form trails.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:35.670
So then with this image we're set
with looking for things that are,

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.170
that are moving in a
different direction,

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:43.280
but have the same pattern
as the background stars.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.810
So then we scan these
registered images looking

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.020
for something going
in another direction.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.130
Does anyone see anything
that's moving, that's a skewed

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.510
from all of those others?

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.870
There's maybe that one,
but what's wrong with that?

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.070
That's only one dash.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:06.510
There's no, there has to be
four of them to be, to be real.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.900
Well, we've looked,
we scan it completely.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.580
Here's another, these
are cosmic rays.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.580
Here's a single spot
that's a hot pixel.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.910
So we scan these and these
unfortunately we haven't found

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.870
anything, but then we say
well how deep can we see?

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.140
And so we calculate the
faintest, the brightness

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.680
of the faintest asteroid, assume
it has the albedo of Ceres

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.890
and we determine that we have
searched the space around Ceres

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.670
down to between 20 and
300 meters in diameter.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.280
So there are no, unfortunately
there are no moons around,

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.420
around Ceres either.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:45.180
So here's some basics,
things to know about Ceres.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.480
It rotates.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.490
It rotates more slowly than Vesta.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.550
It rotates about once
every 10 hours.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:56.890
It's about 590 miles across, oh
and now I have to correct myself.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.220
On a map of the United States,

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:03.670
it's Ceres that's almost a 1,000
kilometers that is the width of,

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.770
that's the width of Texas
and Vesta is the width

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.260
of the States of Arizona.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.440
Okay so sorry about that.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:20.040
The surface temperature at Ceres
is between 130 and 200 Kelvin,

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.730
where 300 Kelvin is
temperature at earth.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.790
Okay so it's cold.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:29.160
That's important because if you had
water ice sitting on the surface

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.470
of Ceres, it would sublimate.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.590
It's not stable.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:42.260
However, Ceres as a whole
has about 25% water.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.010
Someone please ask me
how do I know that.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.310
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.610
How do I know that?

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:49.910
Thank you.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:55.070
That was determined from the
relationship between its density

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.770
and its shape derived
from Hubble observations.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.620
It is basically round.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.660
You are looking at it here
as basically round, however,

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:09.000
when you carefully measure
the, its axis of the equatorial

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.620
to the polar axis, it's
not perfectly round.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.950
It's, the earth is oblique, but
Ceres is a little bit inflated.

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:21.290
It's a little bit inflated and
that combined with knowledge

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:30.440
of its density, which is 2.1 grams
per cubic centimeter whereas the

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.960
earth's crust has a density of
3.3 grams per cubic centimeter.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.270
That density being less than
three tells us that there has

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.730
to be a significant amount of water

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:46.320
in the whole bulk composition
of Ceres.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.500
Yet, if water were on the
surface it wouldn't stay.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.120
It wouldn't remain.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.510
So from our thermal models
that my colleagues Tom McCord

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:02.710
and Julie Casteo have done, it's,
it may have some liquid water

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:07.960
in its interior, but
not on its surface

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.030
and the surface reflects only
about 10% of incident sunlight.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.860
It's basically dark.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:21.510
Vesta, in contrast, reflected
36% of the sunlight that hits it.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:25.700
Many of you may have seen we
did make the papers last spring

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.100
for these two bright headlights.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.960
So those are, they will,
I will talk about those.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.050
There were a couple of other
bright spots that we see.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:37.300
There's some smooth plains,
but it is a cratered surface,

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:43.890
but still very different,
very different from Vesta.

00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:46.390
So let's what we've learned.

00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:50.810
So our geologist, our
mappers have created our map

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.760 position:56%
and I'm sorry this one doesn't
have, this is zero degrees longitude

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.410
over here and 360 over here.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.620
There is a big, bright feature
that is right on the edge.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.970
So sometimes we project
it differently.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:08.800
Here's the bright crater that has
bright material in the center,

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.420
but also ejecta bright material
that has been ejected from it.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:17.550
looking at this, you know
is this something that was,

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.600
came from outside and
hit, when it hit it splat

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.630
and it's bright material?

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.860
Or is it something from
inside of Vesta, I'm sorry,

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:31.360
Ceres when it was brought up from
beneath the surface and spread out?

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.350
So that's a question that
you may have and a question

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:39.630
that the scientists too are having.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:46.990
Then we have, looking at the
edge as Ceres rotates around.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:51.280
We saw this little lonely mountain.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:59.480
This is three kilometers above the
sphere and we're, that was another,

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.140 position:56%
it was initially called the pyramid.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:08.590
We quickly got to talk to the
International Astronomical Union

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:14.270 position:56%
who controls, who approves our names
and we gave it a name of Ahuna Mons

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:19.680
and all of the features on, all
of the craters on Ceres are named

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:25.890
after the Goddesses or Gods and
Goddesses related to the harvest

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:30.050
because Ceres is the
Goddess of the harvest.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.130
So we're now in the process,

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:39.070
my post-doc is modeling the
distribution of the height

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:45.440
with respect to this mountain
to try and determine what type

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.600
of mechanisms could produce this.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.140
We see that the top here,
the top flattened part

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:55.680
of the mountain is similar to
the surrounding cratered terrain

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:02.490
and these are very steep slopes and
so it looks like it's an extrusion.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:07.060
Something that pushed up from
beneath the surface and did

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.760 position:56%
so relatively recently because this,

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.740
all these steep slopes are
pretty fresh, but we're working

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:21.110
on an interpretation of
that formation mechanism.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:27.230
Then here's our close up of
the bright spots, which were,

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:31.230
which exist inside the
crater named Occator

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:35.120
and so this is quite a
nice high resolution image.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.480
The two bright spots resolved into
about eight other smaller spots

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.280
with debris spread around it.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.430
When I look on my screen, I can
see in the center here there seems

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:53.210
to be something that's dome
like right in the middle

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:57.440
and we have determined the
brightness, this material is,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.860
reflects 50% of the
light that hits it.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.230
Whereas the surrounding reflects
nine to 10% of the light.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.840
It's clearly inside of this crater.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.610
These crater walls are interesting.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:18.000
They're not quite, most craters
are circular, but this has a lot

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.940
of structure in it and that
tells us that the surface

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:27.170
of Ceres has some strength,
but it's not a lot of strength

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:31.460
because you get collapse
and things falling.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:36.490
There's also some, at least on
my screen, I can see cracks,

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:41.220
well maybe they're here and we're,
so the science team is really

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.800
in the process of trying to figure
out what this means and coming

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.110
up with a good story that fits
with the physical mechanisms.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.410
Yes.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.290
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.970
Well, yeah we have general
theories it could be something

00:38:55.970 --> 00:39:01.510
from outside that, you know that or
it could be something from beneath

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:05.230
and help me, what do you think of?

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.530
What are the first things you think

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.040
of because guaranteed those are
the same things that we think of.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.340
&gt;&gt; Sulfur.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.760
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Sulfur,
okay because that's bright.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.860
We, you know we know it's bright.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.350
That's certainly one possibility.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.650
Anything else?

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:18.950
What else is bright?

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.460
I mean the ice, ice, we first,

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:25.320
we look at the ice even though
our thermal dynamic models tell us

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.330
that ice is not likely to be there.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:28.630
We're certainly going to look

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.750
for the spectral signature
of ice, of water ice.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.710
Maybe some other ices.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.080
There's some, yes.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:42.630
&gt;&gt; Do you get any information of
what, you know the material is

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.510
by shooting, you know
getting spectral --

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.810
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Right,
we do have the spectra,

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.200
but we are in the process
of interpreting that

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.540
and the science team right
now is having discussions

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.140
about the interpretations.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.490
So there's one other thing.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.010
So think about on earth
there's a place on earth --

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.310
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:00.610
&gt;&gt; Salt.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:01.910
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Salt, yes.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:03.210
&gt;&gt; Carbonated.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.510
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Salt
carbonates, that's a good one too.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.030
Those are good too
and so the silicates,

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.640
I think the silicates give
the whole body the strength,

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.940
but again they could be different.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.340
There are many different
kinds of silicates.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.190
So it could be something unique.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.470
And so the science team literally

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:25.520
as I'm speaking now is having a
mineralogy working group discussion

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.990
about the possible interpretations.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:34.380
So I don't, I don't have an answer
and it's not an easy problem.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:42.170
Our spectrometer has, does have
spectra of these, but we're still,

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.330
we, there's no point in
releasing the spectra

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.730
until we have an interpretation
to go with it.

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:54.270 position:56%
So I'm going to have to ask for your
patience and you know we're having,

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:55.880
they're under discussion.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:03.740
Now, what we have released today is
the, our mosaics of both the north

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.400
and south polar regions on Ceres.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.160
So these are mosaics
that were put together

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:12.720
from our high altitude mapping
orbit and I guess I should've said

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.890
that we have, we have
mission phases.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:22.310
We have the survey where
we're at 4,700 kilometers,

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:23.610
no we were more than that.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.260
We were 12,000 kilometers
at survey and then we went

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.860
down to high altitude orbit.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:32.420
We literally spiral down
and in, these are mosaics

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.780
from our high altitude orbit,

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:39.340
which is about 2,700 kilometers,
if I remember correctly.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.350
And at, in the North Pole,

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.950
in the North Pole we
found one more mountain.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:52.730
We've named it Usolo Mons and
so Ceres now has two mountains

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.520
and we weren't expecting
any, but there are two.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.260
But why only two?

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:05.340
And then here, and I stare at this,
the more you stare at it I see sort

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:12.860
of some large, maybe large basin
edges, rims of basins, but again,

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.600
our geological mappers
will be looking at these

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.470
and building geological maps.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:22.540
In the southern hemisphere,
okay here's this large,

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:28.720
large crater that may be called a
basin and then some other ridges

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.970
and it will all be large craters
with smaller craters in the middle,

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:38.570
with peaks on them, and then this
is a region with no data at all

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.860
because of the viewing geometry.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.460
Now, an interesting thing,

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:49.160
so this is now it's
winter at this South Pole.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.430 position:56%
So these were taken at Ceres summer.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:57.770
So interesting thing, I think
I have a minute to do this is

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.370
on the earth our seasons
are controlled by the axis

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:04.910
at which the earth
tilts, the 23.5 degrees.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.270
Ceres tilts only four
degrees on its axis.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:12.920
So we shouldn't get many, much
of a season except that the orbit

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:18.250
of Ceres itself has a 10
degree inclination with respect

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.530 position:56%
to the earth, with the respect to
the plain and the sun and the earth.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:26.900
So this 10 degrees tilt
and the fact that Ceres is

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.040
down here now prevents
the sunlight from getting

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.960
to the whole southern hemisphere.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.900
That it would change
if we were up here.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:43.450
So that's, here I do have
some of my spectral imaging.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:49.540
Again, no spectra, but our spectral
imaging spectrometer has 800

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:54.250
channels of data and in each
channel you get an image of Ceres.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:57.540
Now this was Ceres on approach,
okay so we were far away,

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:02.760
but look at this sequence of
visible, infrared, and thermal.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.330
These are two different spots.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:09.770
Here you can see a bright spot
here and this is actually Occator

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:13.510
and in some displays you can see

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:17.950
that the infrared is a little
bit brighter in Occator.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:22.450
It's a little bit red and then here
it's clearly dark in the thermal.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.530
So that means that's it's colder

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.420
in this thermal image
than everything else.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.060 position:56%
So it's reflecting much of its light

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.770
such that it's cooler
than the surroundings.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:38.680
Now, down here at this bright spot,
which I believe is Halani crater,

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.830
it's bright in the visible,
it's bright in the infrared,

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:45.940
but it's also bright in
the thermal infrared.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:50.960
So it's bright and hot whereas
Occator is bright and cold.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.260
Now that's a clue too.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.810
That's going to, when we untangle
our interpretations we have to take

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.740
into account that not
all the bright spots

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.010
on Ceres are the same
composition of the same material.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:03.760
So there's things going on,

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.940
but unfortunately we
just sort of say huh?

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.790
We're not quite sure yet and
in fact, I was just last week

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.680
at a meeting in, down
at National Harbor

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.680
and someone Tweeted
saying I just looked at a,

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.100
someone who had heard the
results of, from Ceres

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:25.100
and they were staring blankly
and they said I don't get it

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.070
and the science team in
is in the same situation.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:32.430
We'll just have to argue back and
forth and arrive at something.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:38.360
So Ceres on the interior, we do,
I'm mentioning there is evidence

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.530
that some of, instead
of water we may have,

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:44.490
well we know we have water,
but there may also be ammonia.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:49.600
Ammoniated species,
ammoniated silicates

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:56.760
and our thermal models give a
possible internal structure that's

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:02.060
similar to this with an
icy mantel and a rocky core

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.940
and there may be some
liquid water present,

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.230 position:56%
but we won't be able to detect that.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:15.060
Now with the fact, with
the fact that we're trying

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:20.630 position:56%
to create a coherent story about the
surface composition, the processes,

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:26.630
the active processes that form
the surface of Ceres here,

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:33.690
we're questioning now whether with
the fact that we don't have a lot

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.790
of icy material on
it, on the surface

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:42.980
and that we find ammoniated species
that come from farther away from,

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:46.770
that are stable at the outer
parts of the solar system.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:51.440
We're asking ourselves was Ceres
formed here in the asteroid belt.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.130
If it was formed in the asteroid
belt and it picked up some

00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.910 position:56%
of these colder, ammoniated
species from the outer solar system,

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:07.470
was that material deposited onto
Ceres in the early solar system

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:13.620
or was Ceres itself formed far out
beyond, in the outer solar system

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.090
and migrated in as a complete body?

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:20.070
We hope we'll have some answers,

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:23.220
but those are our fundamental
questions right now.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Where is Pluto on this depiction?

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:27.040
[ Laughter ]

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.340
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Over there.

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:38.210
Okay so today, today the Dawn
spacecraft is in the process of,

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:44.160
these are orbits of the Dawn
spacecraft as it spirals down.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.520
So at the end of October,
we began our descent

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.360 position:56%
into our low altitude mapping orbit.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:55.090
We're probably down maybe around
here and we will continue spiraling

00:47:55.090 --> 00:48:02.850
down to an orbit of 850 kilometers
and in mid-December we'll get our,

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:08.590
we'll get our highest resolution
images, but we'll also get results

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:11.570
from our gamma ray
and neutron detector

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:14.880
which will give us some
compositional information,

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.320 position:56%
elemental compositional information.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.820
We'll know about the
distribution of hydrogen

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:23.080
to see whether these
species are hydrated.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.950
Hopefully we'll be able to get
some ratios that will allow us

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.100
to disentangle the carbonates.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.550
There are some signatures
due to carbonates.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:34.380
There are also signatures
due to ammoniated silicates

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.340
or clays with ammonia in them.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:43.920
So we do have more data coming
back to us until the end of,

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:48.360
until the end of June and we
have an opportunity in the spring

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.130
to write a proposal to
NASA headquarters to ask

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:56.260
for an extended mission where we
would plan to see what we can do

00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:00.200
if we stay longer and if
we can target certain areas

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.050
with certain sets of
instrumental observations to try

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:07.080 position:56%
and resolve some of our ambiguities.

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.820
What's holding us, what's
keeping us going are the engineers

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:18.210
who have been keeping
track of our fuel levels.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:22.010
We had, throughout the
course of the mission, there,

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.490
we've had some breakdowns.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:28.920
They haven't been catastrophic, but
we had reaction wheels that failed

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.220
so that the stability

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.620
of the spacecraft is
not what it used to be.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:36.430
So we're operating on two
reaction wheels instead of four

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:43.830
and the navigation team devised a
method to save our hydrazine fuel

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.180
and so at LAMO we're going to
start using the hydrazine fuel

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:52.750
to stabilize us so that we can
get clear, clear stable pictures.

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:54.530
So here's our fuel tank.

00:49:54.530 --> 00:50:00.580 position:56%
We've got, we're at half, we're half
full and we're going to us it all

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.160
up before the mission ends.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.980
As I said, I just want to give
a shout out to my team mates.

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.170
This was definitely a team effort.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.800
We meet, we're from all over
the world, we meet a couple

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.560
of times a year in person.

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.520
We spend time on the phone every
week and then sometimes some

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:25.690 position:56%
of us will, some of us dress up
pretty well, especially when the Air

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:30.560
and Space Museum gives them an
award for achievement in space

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:35.630
and this is our project and
navigation team a couple

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.840
of years ago, 2014 when
they received an award

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.040
for their efforts at Vesta.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.960
So thank you for your
attention and we have materials

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.510 position:56%
on the website for your information.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:52.510
[ Applause ]

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:57.040
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.340
Sure.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:59.770
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster:
A question, sure.

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:02.280
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: In the back,

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.690
the gentlemen in the back have
their hands up first and I'd

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:06.650
like to alternate between
taking questions

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:10.090
from men and women, if possible.

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:15.320
&gt;&gt; In Vesta, you've got the
real steep crater at the bottom,

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.570
but you've got a big huge
crater up at the top.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:22.450
Could it be that, the mountain
on the bottom is a push

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:24.610
out from the bottom from
the hit from that top?

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:25.910
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Right.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:27.210
We've thought about that.

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:28.510
Is it antipodal?

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:34.860
The opposite and I
think the gravity,

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.250
the gravity models
do not support that,

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:39.400
but we definitely looked into that.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.980
But we didn't see evidence of that.

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.280
&gt;&gt; Okay thank you.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.580
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Oh and I
should have reported the,

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:49.110 position:56%
repeated the question which was
[laughter], which was is it possible

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:54.010
that the, that there could be
an effect from the giant impact

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:58.770
in the southern hemisphere that's
observable 180 degrees opposite it

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:00.610
in the northern hemisphere?

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:04.700
Okay so I'll follow directions.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.450
Okay gentlemen, who was left
and then I'll come down here.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:13.610
&gt;&gt; You said that propulsion
is it just releasing pressure

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:18.690
out of the tank or does
it actually burn the fuel?

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:19.990
I think [inaudible] --

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:21.440
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: The
propulsion, okay the question --

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Then how did it slow when you got
to the point of it actually orbited?

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.960
Because I know when Pluto
was a fly by [inaudible].

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.260
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Right, okay.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:37.500
So the question was about the fuel
and how, what the mechanism is

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:43.440
of producing the thrust on the
spacecraft and then following,

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.390
the second part was how
did we slow it down.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:52.810
So the fuel is sending the ions,

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:58.110
the Zenon is ionized
and forced out the back.

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:03.490
It's forced out through the
nozzle of the ion engine

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:09.190
as a charged Zenon
particle and Zenon is heavy.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:13.750
It has mass and it's accelerated
through magnetic fields

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:16.380
and that gives it a force.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:21.000
So there's no chemical reaction
that produces the energy.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.810
It's produced by magnetic
fields and the direction

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:33.010
in which the thruster points and
that causes the spacecraft to go

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:34.870
in the opposite direction.

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:39.460
And what we do is match the orbit.

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:44.280
So we are, we are thrusting
away and thrusting away

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:49.940
from the gravitational force of
the sun and so we're spiraling

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:55.920
out the whole time and then we
match orbits with our targets.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:59.220
So and the thing is, the
thing that's hard to grasp is

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:03.220
that this is just tiny, little
changes with every little puff,

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:07.580
you know every little
ejection of the Zenon ions.

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:12.510
And it's just that it took seven
years and so we didn't really have

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:15.070
to slow it down, we
just matched the orbit.

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:19.510
We get there and then also
we changed directions.

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:22.830
You have to change the vector, so
you move the, you move the engines

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:24.740
and point them in a
different direction.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.450
So that's actually how we do it.

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:30.510
It's pointing the direction,
but it's always a thrust.

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:33.040
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.780
Well when we got there it, in
fact we had a hard time saying

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.670
when do we go into orbit.

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:39.720
We have to declare it
because everybody wanted

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.910
to say okay now we're in orbit,
but Ceres is moving around the sun

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:46.510
and we sort of caught up to it.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:52.810
So it's more like a
dance than driving there.

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:54.640
Yes sir.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.370
&gt;&gt; You mentioned trying to get
money to extend the mission

00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:00.200
and I heard the same thing on
the news about the Pluto --

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.500
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Yes.

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:06.020
&gt;&gt; Is it really an option at
NASA not to get every benefit

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:09.470
of these expensive and
rare assets in space?

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:12.700
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Well the fact
is we're going to be competing.

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.600
There's a number of
missions that are competing

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:18.690
and they have this senior
review where we write a proposal

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:20.810
and we have to have
compelling science

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:24.720
because it's your tax payer
dollars and my tax payer dollars

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.850
and it's a finite budget.

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:33.560
So we can think of a lot of
things to do, but if we do,

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:37.480
if we do an extended mission
on something then we have

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.610
to delay starting something
else or not do something else.

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:43.430
So it's all a matter of
balancing the budget.

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:46.120
Is that correct according
to the people

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.010
from NASA headquarters
in the audience?

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:49.310
[ Laughter ]

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:50.610
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:52.610
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Thank you
and the, oh shoot I forgot

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:55.120
to repeat the question again.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.950
We'll play Jeopardy on those

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:59.670
of you doing the webcast
will play Jeopardy.

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:00.970
Yes mam.

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:04.260
&gt;&gt; I was intrigued by what you
said the difference in reflectivity

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.960
between Vesta and Ceres was
and just from reflectivity

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.530
of all the stuff in
the asteroid belt.

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:18.300
Is Ceres an anomaly or can you
tell what the basic composition

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.560
of the crust is on these bodies?

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:23.780
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Okay so the
question was about the differences

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:28.390
in the reflectivity of
Vesta and Ceres and things

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:31.600
in the asteroid belt
and can we tell,

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.020
does that tell us anything
about the composition?

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:38.650
So the reflectivity
or the brightness,

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:42.700
it's also called the
albedo, how white it is

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.860
because albedo is the
Greek word for white.

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.740
So it tells, it constrains
the composition,

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:55.570
but there are many things that are
bright that reflect 50% of sunlight

00:56:55.570 --> 00:57:02.570
and so, you know salts,
sulfates, and ice,

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:08.700
but you know we need other
instruments and other information

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.520
to constrain those differences.

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:16.850 position:56%
So we're very much waiting for the
interpretation from the spectrometer

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:21.940
to see whether there are spectral
signatures of ice or sulfates

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:27.590
or water frost on the surface.

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:32.040
And then the difference
between Vesta and Ceres,

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:36.510
most of the asteroids
are dark like Ceres.

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:39.300
In fact, many of the
asteroids are darker.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.540
They reflect about 3% of
the light and that's less

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:46.410
than a charcoal briquette reflects.

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:50.660
So Ceres is dark, but Vesta
is very bright and again,

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:54.500
the difference, I forgot to tie in.

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:58.290
You know I said that Vesta
was like a terrestrial planet,

00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:04.810
a small terrestrial planet, but
Ceres has a lot of volatiles

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:09.520
and unusual species that are
stable at colder temperatures.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.760
So there's the big, there's a
temperature regimen difference

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:16.710
in these different parts of the
asteroid belt that plays a big role

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:19.600
in determining the
nature of the surface

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.980 position:56%
and the composition of the material.

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.390
So temperature is a big difference.

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:27.040
Yes mam, in the back.

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.230
&gt;&gt; For those who are interested in
looking at the relevant data sets

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:36.750
for these two sites, is it easy to
find the data sets within those?

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:38.960
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Okay the question
was for those of us interested

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:44.810
in seeing the relevant data
sets, is it easy to find them?

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:51.670
These two websites are education
and public outreach websites.

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:57.300
So there's images available that
have been released to the public

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:01.680
and educational material that's
been designed by educators

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.310
for various levels, grade levels.

00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:11.840
There is a process of placing
the data in an archive,

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:17.430
the National Planetary Data System
archive and that takes time.

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:19.850
We deliver it within six
months of receiving it.

00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:23.650
So some of it is delivered and
that's a different website,

00:59:23.650 --> 00:59:28.840
the Planetary Data System website
which has the archived data,

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:35.060
the raw images and the spectra
and documentation that explains it

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.360
and those are available

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.970
for scientists worldwide
or amateur scientist.

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:44.910 position:56%
They're available for anyone to use.

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:47.650
Thank you for asking.

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.210
Yes sir.

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:51.410
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:56.480
No. Iron core in Vesta
because it's bulk density is

00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.300
about 3.5 grams per
cubic centimeter.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.120
More like the crust of the earth,

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.580
but the core of Ceres
has to be silicate rich.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.730
There's not a lot of iron in it.

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:15.160
Just because its density it
lower, its bulk density is lower.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.070
So we don't anticipate a
metallic core in Ceres.

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.850
Yeah and that's a good
question, where did the iron go?

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:27.580
Maybe all the dark stuff, maybe
the iron particles bring the

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:31.040
albedo down.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.830
It's a, thank you for
asking that question.

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:36.970
That made me, the question
was what's the composition

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:39.810
of the cores of the two objects.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:42.170
Okay in the back sir.

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:47.530
&gt;&gt; You said that Ceres had a skew
from [inaudible] by 10 degrees?

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:48.830
Is it alone in that?

01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:51.520
Is the rest of the
asteroid belt skewed at all?

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.680
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: No, the
question was about the inclination

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.310
of the orbit of Ceres with
respect to the earth's sun plain.

01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:00.540
The main asteroid belt,

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:04.650
the asteroids have a
range of inclinations.

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:09.150
So Ceres is not unusual
in that regard.

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:14.340
They do vary and they've
been scattered,

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.870
there are inclinations
are a result of collisions

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:21.970
and scattering during
the formation process.

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:25.300
So it's not that unusual,
but most of,

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:26.790
you know most of the main belt is

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:29.030
within maybe plus or
minus 10 degrees.

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:32.370
Although there are some with
a 40 degree inclination.

01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:34.660
The gentleman down
here with the question.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.450
&gt;&gt; It may be a little early
in your time of the mission,

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:38.750
but have you learned things

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:41.920 position:56%
that would suggest you might do
things differently the next time you

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.640
do something like this?

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.290
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: The
question is have I learned,

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:49.530
are there things I've wished we had
done that we haven't done in terms

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:52.020
of having instrumentation on board.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.460
I rephrased your question,
is that adequate?

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.560
So absolutely.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:04.830
We wished we had a magnetometer on
board especially at Vesta to see

01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:06.480
if it has a magnetic field

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.610
because that would confirm our
interior modeling that suggests

01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:14.490
that the core is iron rich.

01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:20.260
We could, we would look for a
magnetic field associated with it.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:30.940
I wish we had another, I wish I
could detect defuse material where,

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:34.040
that would come off the limb.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.450
Defuse gaseous material
because we wanted to see

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:42.840
if Ceres is outgassing
is giving off water

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.740
because there's water
in the interior.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.840
If it comes up to the
surface and sublimates,

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.210
it would be nice to see it.

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:52.270
I'd like to see if those bright
spots are like a geyser on Ceres,

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:57.430 position:56%
but our instrumentation doesn't have
the right optics to detect that.

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:02.500
So those are the main things
and of course, I'd want to land

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:08.370
and have a laboratory like the
Mars sample laboratory on Ceres.

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:09.720
Thanks for asking.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.020
Yes mam.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:15.040
&gt;&gt; Are there are theories about
where the water in the center

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.590 position:56%
of [inaudible] under the crust
comes from or how it is [inaudible]?

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:20.180
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: The
question was are there theories

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.550
about where the water
beneath the crust comes

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:25.660
from and how it was created.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:32.230
So the, we generally wave our hands
about this, but when material is,

01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:39.290
the nebular, the solar nebula 4.5
billion years ago was rotating gas

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:43.940
and dust and things were colliding
and they started sticking together

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:48.430 position:56%
and then you get something nucleated
and then they collide and stick more

01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:53.410 position:56%
and they grow and they grow and grow
and then, and so this is a material

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:58.230
of gas and dust and the water was
there with other gases and then

01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:02.070
if it gets big enough, then
you're also collecting radioactive

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:07.230
materials, I mean, all
rocky material contains some

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:08.740
radioactive elements.

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:14.770
And so that radioactive
material heats up

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:18.330
and you get something big enough
and then you heat it and it melts

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:20.690
and then the heavy stuff
sinks to the center

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.240
and the light stiff
floats to the top.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.900
So it's that sort of hand wavy
process of planet formation

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:32.970
that we think results
in what we see today.

01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:36.370
So when --

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:37.670
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster: Yeah we
only have time for like one more.

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:38.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: One more question.

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:41.590
&gt;&gt; Just since there isn't a fuel
station out there to refuel with,

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:42.890
how do you extend the mission?

01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:44.660
Do you just slow down?

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.070
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Okay since
there's no fuel station to refuel,

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:48.620
how do we extend the mission?

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:52.230
So our extended mission will
go until we run out of fuel.

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:56.980
So we've planned to use some
fuel in the low altitude orbit

01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.610
and the engineers did such a
good job that I think we're going

01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:03.830
to have left over fuel, but
we're not going to leave Vesta,

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:05.130
we're not going to leave Ceres.

01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:09.110
We'll do something else in
Ceres orbit and we have to,

01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:12.070
for planetary protection
because there is water,

01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:17.210
because Ceres is a watery body,
we do have to park the spacecraft

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:21.340
in a safe orbit that will
stable for hundreds of years

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:24.340
so that we don't contaminate
the surface of Ceres.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.640
&gt;&gt; Doctor, doctor.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.940
The [inaudible].

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:31.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Of the spacecraft,
what's the weight of the spacecraft?

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:39.110
Hundreds of kilograms.

01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:40.410
I'm not really sure.

01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:41.710
I'd have to look that up.

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:44.560
So I'm sorry I don't
have that answer.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.200
&gt;&gt; It's listed on a
fact sheet [inaudible].

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.050
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Yeah if
you can find the fact sheet,

01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:53.050
it will list it, but I know
that 100 kilograms of fuel

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:57.060
and that's going away, so the
mass is continually getting,

01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:00.510
decreasing as we use up the fuel.

01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:06.040
[ Inaudible Response ]

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.040
Kilometers, no it's going
to be in a stable orbit.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.060
[ Inaudible Response ]

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.360
Put it in a stable orbit.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.010
Yes. One last question.

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:15.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah we'll do one more.

01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:19.040
[ Inaudible Response ]

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.340
&gt;&gt; Lucy McFadden: Oh
how long does it take

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:23.080
to send the signal and get it back?

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.860
Well I didn't do that
calculation either.

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.730
Those guys at Goldstone
take care of that for me.

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:34.850
I'd say, I think it's
about 20 minutes,

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:37.220
but you know what we
better calculate

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:40.420
that because we're
three times the distance

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:44.630
and this is how I did
it, but please check me.

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:48.250
The earth is seven minutes
from the sun, light travel time

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:52.960
and then Ceres is about three times
that distance from the sun where,

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.040
so the spacecraft is at 3AU,
so I said seven times three,

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.440
about 20 minutes, but
I'd really appreciate it

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.510
if someone checks my erythematic.
