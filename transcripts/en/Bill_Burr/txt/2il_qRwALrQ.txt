Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr is time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. What's going on? How I yeah, I am once again, this is like all of a sudden I never have fucking guests and then all of a sudden they all come out of the woodwork almost at the same time on all musicians. And once again, we have a very special guest, a Ms Tal Wilkenfeld how are you? I'm good. You got a new album coming out. Yup. Right. It just can't, you know, I didn't even want to start with that. Cause I know you've fucking been talking about all kinds of music I had asked you, cause we were over your place right now. Well, how are you liking the Vitamix? I love the Vitamix because I got into like the, I'm an old man now. I don't know if he can tell.

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       I use a lot of lotion, right? They can still in my twenties but I'm about to turn 51 here in June. And uh, I, I've started to do like for breakfast. I like to just have like a smoothie. Yeah. His phone. He's, that sounds to everybody doesn't live in, it's the fucking greatest thing ever. Right? You just drink it. You full. Yeah. You know, rather than doing the Denny's grand slam breakfast, you feel like a tub of shit, which makes you eat something else bad. So people been telling me about the Vitamix and this is where I am in my life where I'm like, like that was the thing. You have all these amazing instruments and shit. And the thing that stuck out was like, Ooh, Vitamix. I wonder if that one mashes up the fucking spinach and Kale a little bit better. The best recipe to you do cause I got it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       I got two really good ones that I stand by. What are they trade? Uh, I got one that uh, I substituted the Kale for spinach. Spinach tastes better. All it is, it's just that. So if a Dandelion Greens, just Fyi you with, I need the landline Greens now. What do you do to sweeten that up so it's not bitter as shit? I used some honey just a little bit. Just a little bit. Yeah, man. One time my wife took me to some restaurant. We ended up eating like Dan the lines like a damn light. We both trying it, not like, hey man, let's be healthy. We both looked at each other. It's like, oh, it was one of the worst things I ever tasted it. So when you grind that up, what do you have almond milk in there too? Or Center? It's actually a juice really.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       It's not like a smoothie. Um, but it's quite thick, which is why I still call it a smoothie, but mine has dandelion Greens, Cilantro, a little bit of black pepper. Oh my God. Tumeric and ginger. Like fresh ginger, which Richard, call me. What you stand by that it's this sounds, it sounds. What else do I put it in their water? There's obviously water and then I get hungry. An hour and a half later. Where do you buy? Danny was go in your backyard and yanked them out of the fucking grass. What do you, what do you get your dental, ENT. Any health food store? Wholefoods or I've never said, I gotta be honest with you. And I've been to a few of those little health food places. I've never, I've never seen that. But uh, all right. Mine. Mine is just simple. It's just a almond. It's a almond milk with some almonds just in case there's not enough almond in there that some spinach, uh, to fuck is a banana.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       A little bit of ice. And I know I'm forgetting something says cinnamon blueberries ever use blueberries? No, I gotta get a couple of goals cause I, I basically have to go to smoothies and I'm getting sick of them. And then I have like this Greek yogurt parfait and I just sort of rotate that on a three thing. I'm just, I've had it, you know, you don't like when you've been jamming with people too long, you're like, we need some new blood or something. That's where I am assuming you're trying to steer it back to the music here. So let's at least say the name of your incredible album that I only heard three tracks of, cause I couldn't figure out how to download it. Um, for those of you not familiar with Tal, she's, uh, she's basically played with everybody and I promised her I wasn't going to bring up all the past like, hey man, what was it like playing with this person? But she's, you know, I MDB or she's played with literally everybody and you've basically been known as this monster Bass player that can just play with anybody. And, uh, your hidden talent of an unbelievable singing voice is finally displayed. That that's what killed me when I listened to you. Just played those three tracks for me. Aside from, of course, how upfront, you know, the basis and all the mics, which I'm loving. Um, I, yeah, I had no idea you could sing like that.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       I kind of, um, I, I've kept it quiet for awhile. Like I started as a singer songwriter when I first picked up guitar and then, um, sort of started focusing just on guitar when I moved to America because I left home when I was 16, and I moved to America and I went to this music school for a little while and, uh, I went from like,

Speaker 1:          00:04:18       I hope you went to a nice place, all this crap about the Michael Jackson documentary, which I refuse to fucking watch. Why would you do that? Why would you put all those that those horrible stories in your head? It's like, I get it. All right. The guy was a creep, but now he's dead. So what are we doing? I guess you got list. Somebody going, someone was telling me going, you, how will you have to watch it? So then you, you as a parent, it's like, I'm not going to let some fucking guy sleep with my kid behind nine doors anyway, so you've got this album coming out. So I went to, um,

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       I went to this, this school and I went from being allowed to play like half an hour a day to wanting to practice for like six hours

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       day. Was that torture for you considering the way you took? I remember hearing, I watched that interview, you said the first time you actually played a chord, you got emotional, you cried. Yeah. So you love something that much and then all of a sudden you go into, you're going to school in Australia. So they were teaching about Columbus and all the great stuff that happened here in America of course. Right. Whatever it was, how you guys, you got dropped off by the English and so what happened? Something like that where a bunch of convicts apparently. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So then all of a sudden, was that torture for you in school?

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       It was just, it was hard because, um, you know, academia was the focus. Especially like, um, where I, with who I grew up with, you know, um, my mom just like really wanted me to, uh, you know, do all my head. Yeah. I do all my schoolwork and stuff. I mean, she's probably just being a responsible parent, but like I just was not into geography and history I was into.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       So did you ever just like to pick up the bass and be like, mom, listen to this. I mean, listen to this and then look at my grades in math and you tell me which direction I'm supposed to go in.

Speaker 2:          00:06:08       I mean, uh, I was just, I was a guitarist at that point. Like I only switched to bass when I was 17, which I already moved to America at that point. But yeah, I mean, she hugged me play. I just, I think that like, you know, uh, the music business is a tough place and she probably just thought like, ah, maybe, maybe that's not the best thing for you to do, to be in the music industry. It's so uncertain. Um, so, but I wasn't going to listen to what anyone was going to say. Like that's all I knew that I had to be a musician and I didn't care if I was going to be homeless and, and be a musician. I just, I knew that that's what I had to do. So

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       I ever wonder how many this, how many musicians are out there? Because that story is like, you had that inner drive and like I always wondered like, how many like Jimi Hendrix or like working at home depot because their parents or, or some something, you know, they just didn't have that thing to be like, no, no, no, fuck that. I'm doing it. Right. Um, really important people that basically taught you how to walk and talk and all of that stuff start telling you, you know, you shouldn't go in that direction. That's just something that you, is, was that something that developed? Was it the love that you had when you started playing guitar that you will like, no, I literally have to do this? Or do you feel you always had sort of that, that, uh, that drive?

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       Well, I actually think, um, as a kid, especially as a teenager, like if your parents tell you not to do something, you're gonna want to do it more. Like 99% of teenagers. I dread those days when my daughter. Okay. Yeah. So it probably worked, uh, out in the right way that she didn't really want me to focus on music because that just made me want to do it more. Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean I'm kind of, I mean, I wouldn't even say I was necessarily rebellious, but if you want something in that bad and someone's telling you no, you're like, well, I'll prove to you that, that I really deserve this and I'm gonna work my ass off. And I did, like, I was so focused, like my rebellion as a teenager was to succeed as a musician. It wasn't like to go off and do drugs or whatever else. Like that was my rebellion was, was success.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       You know, I went to, I was looking at schools to see which one to take, you know, put my daughter and you know, all the public schools are shit out here, I guess. So you're going to send them to private school and spend like a zillion dollars by the time I'm like eight. It's so fucking stupid. So he went to this one and it was like a French speaking one. Right. So all the kids, it was amazing. The kids were super smart as a great school and, and, but the lady given like the tour, right? She goes, uh, the hell did she say? I asked her, I said, hey, you know, uh, to the parents kind of learned French along the way. She's like, no, we, we encourage you to speak the perfect English at home and blah, blah. I said, well, what if I want to learn it too?

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       When she looked at me, she goes, yes, it's too late. I was just like, God damn, I actually respected it, but you know what? I'm so happy she said that to me because now I've got this thing like, God, I'll show you. Yeah. And I got flashcards. I would have flash cards and I'm like looking at, I'm trying to put together phrases and stuff. I listened to the back of my head. I know she's probably right and I love the school and I'm actually excited that the potential to go there. But like I do relate to that as far as, um, when somebody says that, but there was a period of my life where I wasn't that guy. Oh yeah. Like if somebody said that to me, I'd be like, okay, forget it. Oh really? So yeah, I've probably had that since I was really young, like, uh, like just determination to do whatever I want to do.

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       Cause like I remember being super focused on, um, running before I was a guitar player and I was like obsessed with long distance running. Like, and, and in my head I'm like, I have to be the best, I have to be the best runner gold from Australia. One girl that was better than me and it pissed me off so much. And I remember like, there was this one race that was, I dunno, it was like a 10 mile race. It was really long and, and I just, I just had to beat this, go. And I did beat the girl you did. But I did this like, um, like still a Vittori dance afterwards because I was so excited and I threw my back out and know. Yeah. So then I, I kind of was like hobbling around for a little while and couldn't run like a couple of weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       And then that's actually when I walked past that guitar and started playing get this out. Right. Yeah. Wow. She got mad when you did that dance. I mean, I don't think she saw it. She was that far behind me. Wow. That's like a feel good movie except they always run credits before you blow out your back. Then you became like a musician. So you know, the, the few tracks that I heard that through, the three that I listened to was definitely, you know, this is really like a very personal album as far as like, you know, talking to yourself though, that one you just played. What was the name of the haunted heart? Love haunted love. The one that's just the base and voice with the orchestra. Yeah. That was some pretty, uh, heavy lyrics that may be sort start thinking about my parents. I went on a little trip there.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       One of those. Yeah. Yeah. Thinking about my whole life and um, I fo people listening here, I can't recommend like the level of quality of, of the music that you've, you've done with other people now to actually hear, hey these are my ideas with your voice on top of it. Uh, the second I heard you a few of these, I was like, oh this is one of these, these albums I'm just going to put in back in the day when you had a CD, just stick it in there until the thing just uh, started skipping on you. But um, you mean how your iTunes that skipping on you right now, he like had money second. I know I am the worst. I'm the worst before all you can download it. You got Spotify is like I don't have Spotify. I, I'm, I'm this idiot who I still buy music and then it fills up your computer and now cause right now I need a new, I need a new laptop. I need a new phone and I need new iPod, iPad, the whole thing. Shit in the bet on me at the same time. And uh, yeah, I

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       can I buy it on vinyl? I yeah, I have a record player. Yes. I'll even give it to you on vine. They don't need to do that. You already got me a Burrito here from coming over so I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll throw some money towards that. But um, what was I gonna say? So you also mentioned that you're actually going to be doing a whole tour in this thing too, Huh? Yeah. Now headline in tour, you open and what are you doing? Headlining headline in. Nice. I'm excited. And I got to Boston. Is this your first like big headlining tour? Cause you've always been like the hired gun as far as I know, this is your first like, um, well I I actually I was opening for the who with my band and we played the Boston Garden and some really cool, is it called the bus and garden?

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       They called the TD bank. North side guiding Qi. How'd you like that? That was fine. And you do that recently? Yeah, I did some stand up there and I did jam before with my brothers. So cool. Uh, we had a good, yeah, we definitely had a, you know what's so funny is we a ever, no one was paying attention at all and we were playing or whatever they thought was kind of funny that we were doing it. And this is comedian Jim Brewer who does this amazing bit on slayer fans, like how dedicated and crazy they are. Well we actually play it, I forget what song we played. We played a slayer song and literally it was like no one was reacting to anything we were doing. We suck. Right. The second we started playing slayer, some fucking security guide, like, you know, halfway up the renewed just goes slayer.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       Hilarious. So, um, now your style of music like going no, you're gonna ask me something was going to say like, like what does playing before a standup set do for you? It makes the, the venue not as intimidating. I've only done it at like what? Because you know, it stand up in a place that big doesn't make sense. You like highlight, you know, I, I had all these feelings of like, why am I a, like how did I get here? What am I doing here? What the fuck do I have to say that justifies all these people showing up, you know, the normal, if you're any sort of like human being, that's what you have. If you're a psychopath, you just like, yeah, well how come I'm not playing the football stadium or whatever. You know, I've ever played in the Roman Coliseum. But I, yeah, I was sitting there and uh, that's that what was, what was going through my head.

Speaker 1:          00:14:08       But, um, the first time I ever did one I did for the New York comedy festival and I did Madison Square Garden and, uh, we got together and jammed in there. And I just did that because I love led Zeppelin. And they did song remains the same. If I could just play some drums there and make a little bit of noise. And what happened was we were having so much fun and I invited so many people down there, they, I, you know, I didn't ever fully forget where I was, but next thing you know, you know I was yelling, Hey Josh, John is at that Motley crew thing and you just, you just yelling and you just kind of made it yours. Yeah. So that night it just didn't, it didn't feel, um, I was able to kind of just like, I had already made a bunch of noise in there and nothing bad happened, you know, enough the roof collapse. So I think that that's kind of like what it did for me. Although I fucked up at the form cause I played it like three hours. I almost fucked up cause I was just like, I got off stage and I was like wiped out. I was just like, oh no. Oh No. But then like the adrenaline is like, oh my God, what if I bombing from all these fucking people? You know, that that'll get you through a good 90 [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:15:08       but why do you not like play on stage for your audience? Because I respect them. Ah, you're a great drama. I didn't know why you say that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       Uh, I'm good for a comedian. I'll give you that. But I am not a, you know what I, I like, uh, like one of my favorite things to do is to watch a pro play cause it's just, you know, when they're just doing like a sound check, a lot of times there'll be physically playing something that I could play, but I could never make it sound like that. And there's always like a personnel, you know, if you listen to a really good drama, you can hear like you can hear them in the plane, which, um, you know, took me a while to be able to hear that. But, uh, now I'm able to do, and I've, I've, I've seen, I don't know, there's just something cool about it. It's like watching a professional hockey player, like taping up this stick. There's just something, when you see a pro doing something, um, it's an your into it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       Especially if it's your hobby. It's fucking mesmerizing. So that's, that's why when a few times I've come over here, like I'm always in there cause I'm like sitting back and just watching all of you guys play. And um, my favorite thing about watching a live band is watching a band that doesn't play it the same way every night and you, and even if you've never seen the band, you can tell cause they like looking at each other and everything. So that's when I get into like, aw man, they're in the moment right now. This is like watching a comic riff. And so he's going to do something to make somebody smile and then he adds something else tonight. And just as an audience member and a fan of music trying to pick up like that thing going on and um, and like my, I, it turned like I'm the bands I listened to growing up.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       Like I remember Stevie Ray Vaughan, whenever he was playing a solo, it was like Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon and Reese will always looking right at him. Like, is he going to go back in again? Oh are we going to be going back to the, you know, him singing and he just would fucking be wailing and he had this little thing, you just look at him, he gives, give him a little nod and how they all were like, okay. And, and, and they wouldn't fuck that up. I'm just having attempted to Gino get together with friends and play and everything. I just, I've, I have such an admiration for it. So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       I mean that's how I feel about comedy and great comedy and that's why I like watching you perform. Oh yeah. When I do a great shit joke and I, okay. I not over to somebody who just did a dick joke gem and it's amazing. It's right on the same level. No, but like, cause I just started as, you know, like getting really heavily into comedy the past like year or so. Yeah. And like the reason that appeals to me so much is because it like speaks to both parts of me as a musician. There's the, uh, the jazz musician in me, which is like the improvisational musician, which like, like really enjoys watching you ref like, and, and just, and then there's like, then there's like the composer, like the, the person that's like, you know, into writing songs and like, and then watching you create this amazing materials. So it's, it's very sad cause that a requirement for people in your band.

Speaker 2:          00:18:05       Cause I mean, when you work, when you go and do this tour, like, uh, I just know it's doing the same jokes over and over and over again. It's like you have to like, do something to break out of it. Do you, um, on this tour, I mean, you sell on the album, you got to go out and, and, and, you know, play it and sell the music to them. Like how, uh, how much like messing around do you do? I do a lot and then is a requirement and that's why it's been really tricky to find band members. And I have found like the perfect, um, guitarist and drummer to play with me because, you know, my music is a composition. Lee. Um, like lyrically for instance, very influenced by folk music or just songwriter music. But then musically it's um, it's influenced from anything from rock to folk to jazz to whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:19:00       It just goes all over the place. That's what I was loving. But this, this is some sort of through line. Maybe it's you, I don't know what it is on and because I was just listening to that song was so great and then I really started listening to the mix of it. I'm like, wow, she's the whole bottom end of this song. And then it felt like, I don't know how to say technically, but it felt like the guitars and keys were like up here and, but you are the sort of the meat and potatoes of the whole thing driving the whole song. But like the uh, the different tones and stuff. Um, there was wide I'm, I'm, I'm the worst. I don't know the names of the, yeah, when you went into that bridge, that was all our is up though with sections called at Middlesex was just like, what the fuck is that?

Speaker 2:          00:19:35       And then you go right back to that part that really rocks. Cos when I looked at you, I was just like, that's when the crowd's going to go nuts. Cause you taking them on this ride where you coming out and you just, you know, blowing their wig back in the beginning and then it goes to this other places like, Whoa, what the fuck is this? This is this mood thing. Well that's where it's like, hey, if people start taking the drugs in the crowd, I would feel and look, and I went, I went, what you'll be doing? That's what I do. I grew up going to heavy metal concerts. That was a time, all of a sudden somebody like sparked up a fucking J is we used to say. And uh, and then all of a sudden like out of nowhere, you just punched him in the face again and then the fucking song is over.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       It's just like, yeah. Um, I think that the cohesiveness, um, on the record comes from like having the same band play all of these songs, even though they've, they're very different. Like, some are, you know, just vocal and base and some of our acoustic guitar and, and very, uh, little, uh, behind me. And then there's like these full rockers but it's the same band and I just think that that's really important. Like for how long does it take you to put that together? Well, it took me a few years to sort of search for the sound of the record and like figure out who was going to play on it and who, who like what was the, the best sound for these songs. And then I finally went into the studio with the Blake Mills and Jeremy and Paul Stacy and uh, we cut corner painter, which is the first song I played you in.

Speaker 2:          00:21:01       It's the first song on the record. And that when I heard that back on the speakers, and this was no base, it was just, I was playing acoustic baritone guitar. Blake was playing guitar and Jeremy was playing drums and the sound was so full, I didn't even want to play bass on it. There's no bass on that song at all. I just played it on an organ. And then Belmont tench overdubbed a organ as well, like a pump organ. But I heard that song was like, this is the lynch pin for the record. And so then I went home and I like wrote a bunch of other songs that I felt would fit with that vibe or compliment it. And then once I'd done that, we went back in the studio for, it was like anywhere from like eight to 10 days and cut the whole thing at once.

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       And so I think that that's part of the cohesiveness is that we just, we cut it all together. Or when you've put together a band, if you ever had been like, okay, I know these two people are right, and then a third person comes in and so it takes it into another direction. You got to fire one of those other two people that just cause, but the other, cause the other person's such a beast. I mean it's all, it's all about Canada. Sorry, pointed out the drums when I said that. Right. Chemistry take casting for a movie to like some, sometimes it's the most important thing is the casting. All right. How do you like your life by the way? I Miss Australia. Um, I don't Miss Australia. Um, some of my best friends are there. I definitely miss them, you know, but, and I miss the beach.

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       I don't really think that the beach in La is that cool? No, I gotta be, I'm terrified of the ocean and every time I go to Australia, it's like I, if I was ever, you know, there's a place to get eaten by a shark. It is definitely the coasts of your country. It's so beautiful. You'd beat me as well. At least I was, you know, at least you dive beautifully. I remember we were there in like a, I don't know when we were, was your, your weird winter down there, which is just the different time. And it was too, it was too cold and windy. Um, it's not weird. It's just weird to me cause I'm in the northern hemisphere, but, so we were down there and I was expecting it to be fucking hot and all of a sudden I was like freezing. And, uh, but even then I was looking at, and I was like, if it wasn't so rough and it wasn't so cold, I think I would add maybe I did actually go into the water when I was in Perth because I just wanted to say that I stood in the Indian Ocean.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       I literally went up to my ankles and I got back in and then I got in the car and I was listening to the radio and there was a helicopter following in like an 18 foot tiger shark along the beach just to let the surfers and everybody know that the thing was there and you guys had the creepiest terminology ever for when someone gets eaten by a shark, you say he was taken. That's what I heard. Oh yeah, it was something, blah, blah. He got taken. I'm like, Oh my God, I'd rather be eaten than taken, eaten to muse. It's over. I mean, it's fucking horrific.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       And then you bleed out and it's over. Taken means I, I you, you, you took me somewhere. I just start thinking of chainsaw massacre when that fucking guy just grabbed that woman a yanked her in, slammed the door.

Speaker 2:          00:23:57       Hey. Taken. Almost on. Slightly more polite though. No, no. Well I guess what the next word is taken to the movies. Right, exactly. Taken into the fucking, I been taken to the movies by some sharks. Oh yeah, I was going to say, you know, it seems a, you know what I liked? It's this fair play on this album. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:21       As far as a, there was a few where it was the other person. That was a few. That was you. All right, so that's a a, that's a, that's an important milestone in your life when you the, at least for me it was when I was able to be like, all right, you know, I was going through that dude chicks if fucking Psychos, you know, I did that till I was about 35 and I was just like, all right Phil, you know, at what point are you going to fucking is, it may be you maybe who you're picking maybe what you're bringing to the table. And then once I was able to do that, I am finally ended up meeting Nia.

Speaker 2:          00:24:52       I, that's kind of why I called the album love remains because love remains as in the remnants of love. Like the aftermath of, of a love gone bad or love remains. I like love still exists.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       Oh it's true. It is. Oh I thought you went, there was still pieces of other relationships in you. It's, it's both. It's like the remnants and then love still, you know, continues. There's always love. Well this is theory among my guy friends that women are able to cry it out cause you're allowed to cry, that you're able to get passionate and then it's just like fucking gone. Where guys like hang on to shit. I mean I was reading this book on Bob Cousy, he's one of the Great Celtics and Bill Russell, right. And one of the greatest players of all time. And Bob Cousy, his wife passed away and he still has a picture on the wall and he still talks to, well I guess they didn't break up. So maybe it was that. But like, you know, I used to always joke with my wife going, you know, if I died within three weeks, you'd have all my clothes down at goodwill.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       Hey, keep me a DVD in a back of a fucking closet. Where's she's like, no, I would never do that. But I just feel like women are better at, uh, either e how you're wired. And then I also think it's more, it's, uh, one of the great emotions crying when the great healing emotions is not acceptable for guys and you just shut it off. So not only do you not get to heal, you actually make yourself, I think worse by fucking, uh, holding it in. It's bad enough. You know, I dunno, it's, it's a really a weird thing. So, uh, that's a, that's actually, I don't, I don't know what the word is, but to hear you say that, that, that you actually, uh, some of it stays in there. I don't know what that makes me feel not as fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:26:40       Well also like I feel like when when you're in love or when you love someone like it, people often like projected outwards as if it's the other person that's making you in love. Whereas like love is actually just always in you and that that person is, is maybe igniting it or oh, was showing you that it's there, but it is always there. And knowing that keeps me centered.

Speaker 1:          00:27:07       Yeah, it's, it's, it's, that's not something that you can, it's hard to remember that, you know, I would say I would say, I don't know, I'm actually literally getting uncomfortable just even talking about it. It helps. I was walled off for a long fucking time and then I, I had like this massive amount of love in me and it would just come out in these weird ways like about like, like animals being abused or any sort of person being hurt. I could feel it, but like if I was just with somebody and we're going to the movies, like I didn't even know what the fuck to do. I just be sitting there like this fucking robot. Like, did you enjoy that? Now we're getting on the subway and it was just like, and I was meeting people, I, I just, Oh, I know you, I, I'm embarrassed at the, where the kind of person I was back in the day as far as like trying to get through stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       But how did you break through that? I met somebody I couldn't break up with. I would in my head fantasize during tough times of breaking up with my now wife and in my head we were living in this place where there was, there was the first place was an elevating, they'll place had stairs and when she was going to get on the elevator, even in the fantasy of being single again before the door closed, I would run out and go get her. Or when she would walk down the stairs at Iri and I come back in like I couldn't eat. I couldn't even. And for years I did that and it never dawned on me. Like I've always been so fucking like, not in touched with like, hey bill, you know, this is the 20,000 fucking signal. Like I used to ride around. I had a paper back in the day and I used to ride around in the morning and I had memorized comedy routines of my favorite comedians and I would fantasize that I was doing them in front of the school and it didn't dawn on me at that point.

Speaker 1:          00:28:55       They hit bill. Maybe you want to be a comedian. It didn't, it was just, I had no connection to it whatsoever. Huh. It was just me. I think at that point it was all about, you know, getting people to like me so I wouldn't get the shit kicked out of me or I wouldn't have to deal with some, you know, you know, was, you know, it was, it was before all this carrying on social media is just like the whole everyday at school. It's just like, am I going to get it today or is or how can I get it off of me and get it onto the next weakest kid who was a very weird, um, I dunno, some of it was good but a lot of it wasn't a necessarily, probably the way kids should grow up now we're probably like overly doing it. I Dunno. You don't make me feel good when you came when I came into your place here and you were like, oh there's my phone, I lose my phone all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Oh my gosh. You have massive ADHD. I also unfortunately get phone anxiety, which I hate. Like oh you don't have it right? Yeah. If I don't have it I start to like feel like oh shit, where's the phone? Or like if I don't look at it for, for, for too long, I start to feel that and so I have to work really hard at like disciplining myself so that I can like keep it away from me for a certain amount of hours to be like creative and productive. Cause it's just PR. Like I feel so sorry for like for kids that are like teenagers right now. Like they just like so attached to their phones and I see what it does to my brain. Teenager I am. That was brutal. Yeah. Not like gives you the shortest attention span it like everything's just immediate. And so I'm just so glad that like, uh, it kind of came a little bit later.

Speaker 2:          00:30:37       You realize we're like lab rats cause we're like sort of the first wave of like, well let's see what this does. The people I actually saw, you know, I went and I got gas today and I saw this up to the Burrito or no, well that's going to be later. That's what, this podcast will not be a full hour whenever you're know what's hitting me, what the fuck is on the microphones that are here and dropping nuts. Piece of Fuzz. Um, so I went up to that still there. See this is the podcast. People are used to good though. Um, so I pulled up to get, I was getting pumping gas and you know, this la couple pulls up la meaning beautiful. I'm not judging them like they're assholes. They're fucking beautiful. Right? So they pull up and the guy gets out to pump the ghost. The woman's driving the second she barely prost park, you know, the immediately the phone and was just sitting there and I was watching her and I was just like, that's me.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       That is literally me. I do that when I'm driving like a lot. I know. Fucking terrible. It's, yeah, I called a friend up one time, this is maybe about three months ago. I was trying to do like an intense period of writing and I said, hey, could you just cause I'm, you know, it takes like, I think apparently 28 days to break a habit. I said, can you come over for, you know, 28 days apparently, I think, can you, can I give you my phone and then just go away and then I'll meet you back here? And I did that for a few days and actually like helped me like reprogram myself. Oh yeah, yeah. And like once you do that, then it's like, ah, you feel like you can finally relax. It's weird. This is something that I learned going overseas and I can't get texts from anybody.

Speaker 2:          00:32:13       This is what happens if you don't text anybody. Nobody texted you. Like I would come back thinking, oh my God, I haven't checked my text messages in 10 days. I'm going to have 5 million fucking texts. And I had like maybe six, seven. Yeah. I don't, what am I a loser? Nobody. Like if I don't text people, you're like, no, I come back to a zillion of them now. I feel like an asshole. No, I came back and it's just like you, uh, it's, it's like, you know, like once, do you want something in your life not to happen

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       and you don't realize how much of it you're creating? Yeah. Okay. Well, so much of the phone shit, I realize I am creating all of the texting that I'm doing. Like, I'm in traffic. Traffic sucks. I just start calling people, right? I'm just like, hey man, what's going on? I'm stuck on the fuck. I literally have a friend of mine that we like we our friendship cause she's married with kids and I'm married, didn't have a kid. It was just like our whole relationship. I don't think I've seen her in a year and a half hour relationship that we have the deal, the, an unwritten deal is that we call each other when we're stuck in traffic. Yeah. And the big joke is, hey, I'm on the one 35, hey I'm on the one on one or the other person picks up. All right, where are you? How long a drive do you have? And it's just like you're sort of almost like a suicide hotline talking them to get home.

Speaker 2:          00:33:25       I do like all of my phone calls in the car to or um, really, really late at night. Like while I'm getting ready for bed, like, like my friends in Australia just know that I'm going to call it like 3:00 AM my time. Like facetiming them while I'm like brushing my teeth and shit. And now it's like a ritual. Like, oh, are you ready for teeth brushing time and what is it like

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       seven the next day? They're right. A seven at night. 14 year olds or even slightly. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, around, around about then it's great that guy, I always call Australia at that time when I'm getting ready for bed time. What was the last time you heard some music that that made you? Uh, like whenever I listened to like amazing music, I always fantasize that it's me doing it. Oh yeah, yeah, I do that. No, and all the way through the song. If the drums are awesome, I'm playing drums, someone singing great, then all of a sudden I'm doing that. I'm very self involved. One was the last time you as a musician listened to something and you were just like, ah, fuck. I wish that was me.

Speaker 2:          00:34:21       Does that happen? I don't know. It doesn't happen. But strike too with the texting and now fantasy, the fantasizing. I don't do that. But I listened and admire a lot of people. Who'd you to listen to it coming up? I didn't want to ask you any of these questions. I know you've been asked this fuck, I listen to miles Davis and then of course there was the bgs, jazz disco. I just, you know what I'm really obsessed with is his Indian classical music. Do you remember that time? We were like driving back from one of your shows and I played you some Indian Indian classical music. I've played you. I remember we were meeting, me and Josh were singing some Song Bob Dylan Song to you, which you really didn't like or you are making fun of. But Bob Dylan is like one of my favorites of all time.

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       I love Bob doing okay. But like you were like joking around my changing the lyrics and stuff. I was just being an asshole. I with media, if we do that all the time that you made me laugh so much and then I played you in Indian classical piece, but maybe you don't remember that. But what I remember you played me that Blues Song. Yeah. That was blind Willie Johnson. Yes. Also one of my faves. Yes. Okay. Yeah, that I remember. Yeah. I love old blues. Like it's so raw and real. Right. And I also like, like as if you, you'll notice like on my album, like I switch in and out of like time signatures a lot and, but it doesn't sound like I'm switching time secrets. She has. At least that's what I do tell them the things that I, yeah, I didn't really notice it, but that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          00:35:49       Like, because I kind of, I let the music, um, like the melody or the story guide the time as opposed to like the other way around. Like sometimes people will write the music first and then that lay the melody and stuff on top. Oh, I saw an interview with somebody, so they'd said every time I come home with a riff, it's in a weird time signature and then the drummer fixes it. And I remember thinking like, this should've fucking kept it. Right. Getting that, yeah, but like fuck do I know. But I'm just saying that's, that's what I, that's what I would think. Yeah. Like I was joking around like with, uh, with Bob Weir because like basically he, he played with Lightening Hopkins. Bob, we're here shooting grateful dead right now. He played with Lightening Hopkins is one of my favorite like blues players. And um, and when he started, like those guys were all like in their forties, right?

Speaker 2:          00:36:38       Yeah. And lose guys on me. And he was joking around like saying that like lightening played like the 12 and a half bar blues because you know, if he has to add a beat to finish the story, he's telling me he's going to add a beat. Like it's not about like just this rigid thing and like I was, I've been composing like that too. Like if the melody wants to go on a few beats longer or you know, then make it a buyer or seven like, and it will feel natural if it goes with the melody. But if you try to fit a melody over the top of the time signature than sometimes it can feel a little bit more, um, choppy. Yeah, I get that. Yeah, because then it's the cause to the lay person. They're not listening what time it's in. No, they're just following the melody and the story.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       And it's the same with like all that old folk music too. Like you listen to some of the old folk like you hear like bars of five and seven cause it just adding beats to like finish the phrase. I know I never noticed and that's sometimes why like you know, there won't be drums on it. Like if there was drums it, it probably would sound kind of strange, but it's just like an acoustic guitar and a voice. Like that song I played for you, that Bob Dylan Song it's called, it's all right mom. And any bleeding, like there's some bars have like five and shit in that. He just like add some beets and as you were, you wouldn't know it if you counted it. It's odd because he's just trying to fit the lyric in. Ah, yeah. It's, it's genius. I love it. How, how, oh, you're so talented in that area.

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       Like when, when did, when did you notice that shit? Like I would just be like, I'm just psyched if I listen to a song, I know all the words. I wouldn't be like, oh that was just in seven when I first moved to America and I was playing guitar. I, and I was like starting to play like six hours a day and I like gave myself a tendonitis and I had to stop playing for a minute. And then I started like, like messing around like with drums with one hand or like base with one hand. And people started coming up to me being like, yeah, mini Vinny, Vinny, Vinny. And I'm like, what the fuck is mini Vinney you know, of any color Uda. Uh, okay. So I went and like listened to Vinnie Khalida, this is me at I guess like 17 now and uh, and everyone was passing around tapes of, of Vinny color you'd like or like the stuff with charisma and um, just a bunch of other stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:38:55       And uh, and actually Vinnie was then one of the first people I met when, when I moved to America because he came to my school and I'd been playing for two and a half months at the time. And like one of the, the, these drum clinicians was friends with him. Wait a minute, you don't even play in two and a half months if somebody told you to move to no base space. Cause I'd been playing guitar for a couple of years. Yeah. Yeah. And what was that like? And he was like, oh we should play some time. I said yeah. And I was so shy like, because I listened to all this stuff and obviously his, he's one of the best in the world and I was, but I kept it in my head. I'm like, okay, okay. But then I moved to New York and I was like, I just want to be a jazz musician.

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       I want to like play in clubs like five times a night. And like Charlie Parker and monk and all the guys did. And I did that for a few years and then that's when like I, I played with the Allman brothers and like made a record and played with the almond brothers. That was my first Gig when I was a teenager. Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. Like that's where it all started. And then I came back to La and I like played Vinnie, this stuff with the Allman brothers and my, um, my solo project. And, uh, and then the weeks later he got the call from Jeff Beck that like, Oh, hit Jeff Beck's management that they needed a bass player. And then he, he told them about me and then they called me and they asked me to send in tapes, I sending the tapes and the next thing I knew I was flying to England to audition for Jeff.

Speaker 2:          00:40:21       So, and then everything like, you know, prince and her whole, you, um, I think I was 21 when I started playing with Jeff. Yeah, he's as correct. That's the first time I saw you live at Ronnie Scott's, which I've still never been in there the couple of times I've gone to London I received, it's always like packed. I'm like, Oh fuck, I want to go in there and just, yeah, I have a drink and actually listen to some music for like two sites the first time I saw you. So were you nervous when you went into the audition? Um, well, I was food poisoned. I just got enough a plane, like where me and Vinnie went to the airport and I ate some barbecue chicken pizza and I got on the plane and Vinny is a grieving on about politics because he's obsessed with politics and I'm like, hey Vinny, I'm feeling kind of sick.

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       And uh, he's like, yeah, yeah. Um, so then this happened and that he, you know, I mean he kind of reminds me of you and you're writing me and him. He was from, uh, he's from like Pennsylvania. Oh, is he? Yeah. Oh No. Yeah, Pittsburgh. Oh, he's from Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh guy. Oh, he went to Berkeley. That's why I knew there was some sort of Massachusetts from there. Yeah. But anyway, he's going on about politics. And then meanwhile I just like throw up in a bag and I'm like, there it is. He's like that. What is, I'm like, I'll see you in 10. And I was so sick that like, then I had to let get rushed to the hospital and we landed and like be on a drip. And then the next day I auditioned for Jeff. And so I was feeling really weird but um, talk about the worst fucking place to get food poisoning. Oh my God. But the audition went well because at that point I was so like woozy that I was just like, okay, let's get through this. Yeah. And then that was the point where like Jeff pointed to me and said Solo on, cause we've ended as lovers and like he ended up loving that so much that he like kept it in the set and that's how he was like featuring me every night. Oh Wow. Like

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       a cool of him totally sharing who he is and all of that stuff too to like, uh, I love, um, when people do stuff like that, there's a lot of comedians that I, you know, um, that I'm a fan of. But what really makes me, you know, over the top is when I see them like encouraging and helping out, you know, pick comics that are coming up. Cause I, I hate that fucking thing of, uh, you know, that behavior people will get to a certain level, then they start treating, you know, I don't know, I'm here and you're there. It's all stupid. It's just like, it's, you know, you're great like that. Like the way that you kind of mentor younger comedians by, I mean I, I try not to be in it. I mean I remember most people were nice, but I definitely remember who the people who weren't necessarily the names, but I just remember how that may be feel.

Speaker 1:          00:43:00       So it's, it's sort of the same thing too, um, with being like a parent and stuff. I remember the good days at school and I remember the bad day, so I'm about how much fun it was playing with the other kids at school. And then I also remember how bad it was if, you know, you wore the wrong shirt or whatever and it's just, it was just your day to take the pounding and just like how you could just literally beginning that was literally like your world. And that's something that I'm hoping I'm going to be able to remember. Um, which I think I will as, as Mike, my kids going through school as far as, uh, knowing that though, I mean those days, I mean, who the hell knows with all the fucking cameras out there, I don't even get it. If anything, my buddy was just telling me, you know, some key told this story.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       There was some kid everybody picked on that day. And then the kids who picked on him, they found out who all of them were and they had to go see the fucking psychologists and shit. And I was really thinking about that. It's just like, wow, man. Like nobody, like there was none of that at all. Like the guidance counselor was just some Weirdo down the hall and he would just, he just would talk to, he would only really talk to kids who had no hope of going to college. Right. And he'd just be down. They're like, well, hey man, you know, like maybe a, you get into construction, you know. I mean, I never even talked to him. I just, I don't know what he talked to them about maybe their home lives and shit. Maybe it was like a therapy thing, but like, only the fucked up kids, God guidance. Right. Always weird. Everybody else was just like, all right, you're, you're following the cattle right over the fucking cliff. Go to school, two years of language, get into college, pick a major, decide what the fuck you want to do at 18. And then it, yeah, it was one of those things. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       I remember when I was 15, um, there was like this like woman that came to the school that was supposedly like a career counselor and she came up with this huge book that looked like yellow pages or something, right? And everyone had to have an appointment and, and you'd go in and she'd be like, okay, so now what do you want to do? And like someone to be like, I want to be a dock guy, open up the book. And she'd looked under doctor. And so I walked in, she's like, so what do you want to do? I'm like, that wouldn't be a musician. And she's like, sorry, there's no musician here. What else would you like to do? I just walked out. Oh, you walked out. What did she do? I don't know. That was it. I would have been, yeah, I want to have like an epiphany being like, wow, I made, how many of these fucking kids wanted to do something that's not in this book? Right? Yeah. But then you have to look at her. It's just like there's no way that was her dream in life. To have a yellow book and talk to people half your age. What do you want to do? I want to be a zookeeper. All right, let's get to disease. All right. Do you have any khaki shorts?

Speaker 2:          00:45:46       So you literally have somebody didn't follow a dream talking you out of yours and you had the strength to fucking walk away from that. That's very, very commendable. So that's the, those are the

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       moments in life there to haunt me that I think back into my life when somebody said something negative and thank God, you know, I, I didn't latch onto a totally and somebody else like, cause I have like, I have like this like three Mike moments in my life, you know, like climbing up a fucking cliff that if I went to go this way I would have fell back down and, and just the luck of it sometimes when I think of it like, God, what if I didn't meet this person? You know, and why reading my, I worked with this guy in a warehouse and I finally found somebody that was into comedy the way I was and he understood that you could become it. You know what I mean? Like he was going like, dude, these guys on TV and not funny man, one of these days I'm going to take a shot of Jack Daniels and just go on stage and do it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:46       And all of a sudden like, cause it just, you know, it was on TV that was like a million miles away. There was no fucking internet or anything. And uh, we had nobody had video cameras, nothing. So it just seemed impossible to me. It was so impossible. It didn't even seem impossible. Didn't even, I didn't even enter my brain and be like, fucking going to the moon and all of a sudden he was just next to me going, I'm going to fucking do it. And I was just thinking like, well shit, if he can try it, I'm going to try it. So, uh, if I don't run into him and if he doesn't have the balls to say I'm going to try it, then I'm just fucking hanging out with other knuckleheads like me drinking, then then all of a sudden I'm 30 and where the fuck am I? You know? So, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:24       Do you believe like in like a destiny, like do you believe that if that wouldn't have happened, someone else would have happened or do you believe

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       like, I don't believe in destiny because of tragedy, right? I don't think that anybody's destiny is there. The, Hey, thank God you're not this person. I just think you get lucky. You get lucky. It's like a half court shot, I would say in a lot of ways. Well maybe it's not that it's, it's don't you think it's like partly luck and partly manifestation. Like if you really want something, you're going to create the path forward and it can, and it can go in many directions. Yeah. But I also feel like, and there's also tragedy, which is unavoidable and, um, unpredictable, the tragedy of where you're born, right? What you'll look like, what race you are, we're part of the world you're in. Like how lucky I was to be a white guy born in USA, you know what I mean? And it, and how lucky I was to be born outside of Boston had this crazy, insane seeing this like a lot of like, you know, hurdles that were like this big.

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       And even then, even then, because of all the bullshit, uh, that even just, even if you get that much of a head start, all of this other shit that can emotionally fuck you up can, um, you know, I mean, I think by the time I was like nine, uh, I, I, I had already just sort of like, I had that. Yeah, I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. I don't, yeah, I just didn't give a shit like, but, and, but I did, you know what I mean? And then that's all your work to get back to that person who did care and did want stuff. You just, as a defense mechanism, you just like, yeah, I don't give a fuck. Oh, really? Is that going to happen? No. And then when that's supposed to, what make me cry. Fuck you. Like I, I became that person, which is, uh, it's, it works is far as to get through that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       But as far as getting anything you fucking want in life, we have to be open and warm and attract stuff to you that you want. And you're over there with you. Oh yeah. I don't give a fuck. Fuck you really, 400 pounds on my chest. Put 500. I don't give a fuck doing that dumb guy. Shit. Um, yeah, there's like, yeah, it's just, yeah, that's the, that's the thing when you're sitting there and it fucking Boston garden going, how to fuck if I didn't meet this guy, if that guy didn't say that, if I went out that night and went with those people and did that, he just think of all of that fucking what if shit and this somebody who went out that night and went with those people and then they fucking sitting in a cubicle or a jail cell or in a fucking loveless marriage or something.

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       And then just like, why the F that that's somebody's destiny to be in a loveless marriage. It's like I just, I don't, um, yeah, and commas and other one I don't buy into, I think calmer works if you, if you, if you believe in it, but what do you, how do you define Karma? That basically, if you're a good person, good things happen to you. But if you're a bad person, that's not what comment is though. But in my world it is. But comment like if you like comma simply means cause and effect. So, okay, well if you do good things then no, it's not a bad, good or bad. It's just you feel like I'm in school again. No, no, no, but you do it. You do it. Can you just give me the F and I'll go to summer school? This f not like you, you, you, you do an action and it causes a result.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       Right? It's as simple as that. That's all Karma means. That's like being a satanist. People thinks that you believe in the devil and people were just like, ah, satanism or whatever. They don't even believe in a heaven or hell or devil. It's just they just living for themselves and everybody said, oh, they render the devil. So I always thought Karma was like, if you're a fucking nurse or the bed should help us here. And then in my business, I'd watch these fucking people stealing and doing all this shit and just look at them and be like, well, you know, good. You know, nothing's bad's happened to them and I've done a bunch of bad shit. And like overall my life is good. But I, you know, I've heard a lot of people and shit so and so what is it that it just, it just simply means that you do an action and it creates a result.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       So all these people are using that term incorrectly. Yes. I just put it in a script incorrectly. Well, episode eight F F is for family. Well, it's correct in that because like a lot of people think that that's what it, what it is. But like when you go to the root of what comment is, it just simply means like you do an action and it's cause and effect. I saw somebody, uh, somebody I follow on Instagram, they had a picture of a boomerang and it said Karma on it. So that's actually wrong. Oh my God, I wish I knew the real definition than I could have been that pompous ass on the Internet feeding like actually none of you guys. That's like one time I saw this guy talking about how he didn't have white privilege and his idea that he didn't have white privileges because he wasn't born rich and he had to work for the things that he had. So his idea is that white privileges means you're born on a yacht and all of this fucking shit. It's like, no, that's not what that means. That means that no point where you with because of your seat and just get pulled over for being white, get the shit kicked out of you, you know, and all, all of these other things that would have happened to you. You just, you basically because you had to work for things. You feel you're not privileged. So literally his definition was privileged.

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       It was, I can't give you any more details of it, I'll tell you afterwards because it's, I mean, how do you deal with like, um, Internet trolley type people? Like, have you ever struggled with that or wanted to interact with people like that? Early on I did, but now I just, it has nothing to do with me. Yeah. Yeah. It has nothing to do. The amount of shit that I hate that really just has to do with me and my day that I do. And other people do that too. I don't think, um, you know, any different than they are. But like, um, yeah, I don't give a fuck. I don't even have to be a specific thing that I did and I thought it was bad too. And then everybody said you shouldn't have done that, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like, I dunno. I Dunno what I, but if it's just like a, you know, you know, so much of whatever you post isn't about what you posted.

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       It's about what's in the background so you to be, so you could do some gravy. Oh my God, that's fucking great. But what's up with that fucking picture on the wall? Yeah. Laughing my ass off. Like that's like what I learned after a while. It's like that's their moment right on the thread, right? Like I'm going to be the guy that notices the thing that starts and then everybody's talking about what I wanted to talk about. And then it's this weird thing where you feel good, but like I, I, I do the same thing if I send out a tweet and it gets a bunch of retweets and likes, I'm like, all right, people thought that was funny. So I'm just on the other end of it. So I just learned like I can't get upset that somebody is noticing something in this and now they're doing their little show. Like who the fuck am I? It's like, you don't want someone to do that. Don't post something on there. And I just look at like, listen, you don't want people saying a bunch of bad shit about, you don't put your face on the Internet. It's like you're literally asking for it. You're sticking your chin out and they're winding up and punching you and then you're acting like a victim. It's like, well you fucking don't post shit. Just sit there like this or you know, post it. Take a few shots and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       continue on. I guess as a musician like I'm a little firstly like as an instrumental musician, there's nothing anybody can say about like what I'm saying, I'm not expressing an opinion, I'm just playing notes. Right. But then now I've just put out an album of songs with lyrics and there's only been out there for right know. What I'm saying is that in the context of the song, and I'm very much expressing like stories that are personal but like to go out there as a comedian and like express really strong opinions. Like I can't imagine like the difference in like the kind of feedback that you get. And

Speaker 1:          00:55:18       I guess I'm curious what people do is you have to understand that what they do is they don't, like I've always said, he's like you can do 80 jokes in a row and someone will sit there laughing and enjoying your set and then the 81st one has to do something about them. If it's a fat joke in their fat, right. If it's about women and they are a woman or it's about this state and there from there and then all of a sudden, yeah, it's funny you say that, then they go, that statement you made about fucking Arkansas and it's just like, no, no, no. They were all so they all, all jokes except for the one. Right. You know what I mean? So this, this, this, that, um, you know, there's just that, that thing, I just, I don't pay it any mind and um,

Speaker 3:          00:56:00       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       yeah. If there was ever any sort of big dust up about something, I said, if I actually looked at it and thought I said something wrong, I'd be like, all right, well maybe I'll phrase it a different way. But like, I, I do think it's absolutely ridiculous that people get offended about a joke that was told at a show that they weren't at

Speaker 2:          00:56:17       and how has it taken so out of context and no, you want it to show. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:22       And you chose to click that thing and the tears. And another thing too, if the comedian didn't film it and posted, yeah. If just some fucking asshole in the crowd, they'd get mad at them. Yeah. And it's just like, well, what the fuck are you doing if you're this easily offended about standup comedy, what are you doing watching, watching standup comedy? The whole thing is, so like, I just saw, I think it was in Australia, like the first mammal went extinct due to human global warming and barely, barely a word about it. But like all of this shit, uh, you know, fucking, you know, it's more difficult to be a comedian if you're a woman. A fucking me too. Uh, it's all about us and what we're going through and Llama, Llama, blonde, all of this shit. And just meanwhile, all of that pales in comparison to, you know, if, if this fucking places in here, you're not going to have to worry about any of that.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       Right. That's why I think that the cell phones a super destructive, like, because they are making everything about me, me, me, look what I'm doing, look like where I am, look what I'm eating. And so, and, and were on it constantly. And it's like, well, the Jesse Kristala you fall. Did you see his thing that he did the, the unfollowing? No. Oh my God. It's one of my favorite things ever. He's talking about, it's just making fun of Instagram models. Uh, I mean I can do it. I don't feel like I'm doing this joke because he put it out there. He goes, look, he goes, if you're on Instagram, it goes in your posts and stuff. You've just taken a picture of your booty and your titties. He goes, make no mistake. You Hook in. And he just starts calling them hookers and then, you know, and then he just starts really like something.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       Some of these people I didn't even know fucking exist that I guess this thing that pretty girl still with a bite into a sandwich and they kind of look up like that saying like, yeah, that I'm going to start this thing called the unfollowing. And what I love about it is, first of all I'm seeing him turning the corner as a comedian because he was always just, he just had that this guy is a club like a fucking closer, you know, and now he's getting, he's like fine in his like like this razor because he was always kind of fun and energetic and stuff and, but now it's, it's like, it's like it's becoming this, you seeing this force going in this direction. Like I was fucking cry and laugh for like I'm not afraid to do things along those lines make me laugh and it's just really fucking was making me laugh.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       But the funniest thing about that is that would really bother somebody like that where like cause cause they're living, not that I would want to hurt those people cause it's very easy to hate beautiful people. You know what I mean? It's just, it's, they're very hateable as you're staring at them because you hate yourself. Like why am I this fucking of just with like this beauty in all of this stuff. Like, like look at that. You've got like, I got to fucking do nine hours of fucking specials to get half as many followers as you do because you were a fucking half shirt, you know? So I just, there was just something funny to just finally see a, a movement to make their numbers go down. I don't know. The more I'm saying this out loud, I'm actually realizing that it's kind of says more about me than about those people that take those pictures.

Speaker 1:          00:59:33       But I don't know. I just thought it was at, that shit is funny. So I'm actually watching that girl at the gas station. I'm going to try to take, uh, like this morning I didn't have my phone, you know, when I spent the entire, like two and a half hours I have with my daughter this morning, chased her around, we play with the puzzles, I read the books. Uh, what else did we do? Was teaching how to play catch and uh, I think she's going to throw at the left hand, which would be really cool, although she's really big. But the Darryl Dawkins over the top sort of two handed slam. I know you're not going to know that reference he played for the 76 years before you were born. Um, so I'm trying to get her not to, uh, be into stuff like that. But the weird thing is, is because they're so hyper with their energy and all you want to do is just hold them and hug them.

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       The best way to do that is if you put on their favorite cartoon and then they stay just totally snuggle up next to you, but then there's no interaction other than the physical because then you just literally say like, Hey, hey, hey, hey, give me a kiss. Give me kiss. And they'll go like, we'll just sort of lean into you and not even look at you. Just give you the chicken. They just sorta lasered into that. And I'm like, uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I watched a lot of TV. I did all right in life. The fuck are you going to do so and allowed to watch TV and, and look at you look fucking talented. You are. And I'm up there just screaming, yelling like a lunatic. Um, where can people get this album? Um, anyway. Yeah, listen to music. Um, can they download it on iTunes? Yeah. Spotify.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       I don't think it's true to things going to be said on this podcast than that. Yeah, I can't because my fucking computers filled up and I forget my password all the time. Well I just want to uh, congratulate you because I know you worked so hard on this. It just assembling, abandon, all of that type of stuff. Like there's so much more work to this where I just like, I need an order to new hour. I don't have to find a Mike stand guy and all of this shit. I just have to go out and just go do it. But um, uh, whatever you did the three songs that I listened to, I mean it is just, it's on such a high level creativity and everything. Um, I'm, I'm really happy for you and uh, everybody watching listening cause there was going to be some clips of this on video.

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       Please download and it is called love Romaine. Love remains. All right. Thank you for coming on. I was going to ask you, um, how do you stop doing ums and uhs and you knows and shit like that? How do I, yeah. No, I don't, I do it all the time. All the time. Why? Because I get something that will cause you do it. I do it so much. Oh, I do it to how you do and you're in care. Not, I didn't know if I don't give a fuck. He, you listen to a Keith Richards Jagger, people can't understand him. He doesn't give a shit. But like what about when you're doing material? I guess because you've written the material that's going to be less of that because you know what you're about to say, as opposed to if you're just doing a podcast. If I was to actually try to work on something like that, then I would be up here, which is not where I want to write.

Speaker 1:          01:02:37       Yeah. I want to be, it's just calming down the rain spout and out my fucking considered technique for a comedian to like at some point work on that. Yes, it would. Whereas like with like, um, I learned, I started, uh, taken from lessons from Dee de village. Um, how many, like, how much, you know, of the way I was playing was getting in the way of me getting to where I wanted to be with whatever, because my, my technique, I was like sitting like this and I was grabbing the sticks like that was getting blisters and, and uh, like I wasn't making gravity at anything that had to do with physics work for me. So I was literally fighting the drum kit and then he taught me all of this stuff. I haven't seen him in a couple of months and I'm going back to my bad old habits. But, um, there is that thing, I think that like a while we'll say with like a musician, it's like, I don't want to learn how to read, man.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       I just want to, you know, I just want to fucking be this, you know, free fucking thing. Right. And just there is merit in that because you do have those people who only can play if there's sheet music in front of him. But if you can somehow marry both of those where you actually have technique but you can still play from here and not be up there. I think that that's like the promise land and I always kind of felt is a comedian, if you could somehow combine Richard Pryor that specially did live in concert on long beach, if you could combine that with George Carlin, um, where his stuff was just like, I feel like he, he knew every fucking word that he was going to say and it was like, yes, like pop up, up, up, up, up, up. The whole time where prior, you know, on that special came walking out, it was like a hell Gig.

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       There was people walking around and shit and he just started making fun of people. And I think the way he was wired that helped him, that helped him better than if everyone was just sitting there staring at him like, okay, begin your, your standup special. I think that he came out and sit your ass down, you know, sit your fucking ugliest. I what? All that stuff that he was saying and everyone was just walking around and he's riffing and then he just just got in a zone. And what's amazing, you know, is if he can to his own, usually that lasts for like six minutes because what happens up to six minutes of that is you're like, you start worrying going, well what happens when this ends and I have to go into my act, I'm going to be fucked. And you, you can't think that because it's almost like when you haven't tried like meditating.

Speaker 1:          01:05:23       Yeah. So you know, like when you start to feel like you're floating and like leaving your body, if you start thinking, oh my God, this is great, I'm leaving and then you'll just go right back down. So that's the same way with like, like catching his own. So like what I've learned a little, I know about technique with like drums, he should just practice a little bit every day. And then when it starts to become this thing, you don't have to think about, then all those skills you learned about sort of leaving your body and just like, just like, I mean your body's there, but you're, you're listening to what you're playing that's making you do that next thing. If you can exist, you can go back there with all this technique now he not going to get hurt, you're not going to get tired and eventually will.

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       But like, um, so I think what the comedian, if, if I was to try to do that, like okay, maybe I won't curse as much or something like that. Like I that would definitely be a few steps backwards. Um, by that man, maybe it would help me. I don't know. I don't, I honestly don't think, I don't think. Okay. Cause if I go up there and I start doing that, I said it's all about not being here. Um, I mean I sell them. I'm obviously thinking like, okay, I'm going to, it's more like, okay, you like I just walk out, I just start talking and then this Joe comes out and then I said this joke, which made me think, oh yeah, I have this joke and look at this fucking guy. And then it just sorta just, oh now we're over here and it just, you're just, but do you have like a set list of jokes?

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       Like you want to do it in this order or this order? Yeah, but that is all out the fucking window. The second I go up there and sell, some nights it goes like that. And then other nights I like, I definitely have like sections, but this, some nights I just go out there and all of a sudden I tell the last choke first and I'm switching everything around. And then the guy I talked with is this like, you know, waiting to go on stage going like, dude, I didn't know what the fuck was going on. Or You did, you close a bit in the middle. I was like, wait, he's only doing 35 minutes. And then you went on, you did like another, you know, whatever, another 25 after that or something. Um, I have like the main setlist you know, so that's the, you know, this is the plan, the general fucking plan.

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       And then you go out there and shit happens. You're in a weird mood. Somebody says something is you look at something in the back of the room that makes you think of something and then it go, it goes in that direction. And um, and I am a full believer of doing that because then it doesn't become this grind cause I used to, I used to have, I start with this and then that leads to this and I have my segways in blah blah blah blah blah. And it just became like, you know, it's rigid. Yeah. And then I would be on stage and my mouth would be talking and I would find myself thinking about going like, well the second show if the or lets me not close it out, I could probably be home by, and then I was just like, yeah. And then I was just like, wait, I'm talking right now and people laughing and I'm thinking about other shit, what the fuck am I doing right now?

Speaker 1:          01:08:27       And um, I uh, it's weird. I learned how to free myself up through y more through watching musicians. I've always equated it to music because that's something that I sort of started with. So I always thought, I remember talking to a long time ago late great Patrice O'Neil and I said, I was telling him, I was like, you know, I always wished I could see someone cause you couldn't gauge how good you were, you know, you can't see how good you are or how might your improving because you're, you, you know what I mean? You're just in there. So I always said I always wanted this. I wish I could just have somebody sit down and play guitar at the level of comic that I am right now. It's like, could they change chords? Could they play without looking? Could they solo? Like where am I on that trajectory? And it's one of the few times he didn't give me any shit. He was just like, hi. He goes, that's actually interesting. Then probably I reacted to that and then he probably trashed me cause he actually opened up for half a second.

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       So yeah. Fascinating. Fascinating. Nuts and bolts of how to tell Dick and shit. Jokes will continue after these messages from stamps.com and now for bill burrs theme song. Oh, I get a theme song out of this. I would've thought it would've been all like a Ukulele, some sort of Irish Jig song. Did they play Ukuleles out there? I don't know. You have to play though. Seriously? I have to play. Yeah. Why do I have to play this? I'm going to sing the theme song. Well then you have to tell a joke. I have to tell a joke or why do I have to do my hobby? Oh, do you know what I mean? What am I playing Dan to crack? I don't have any earplugs. My years are fucking junk. Okay, so play it really softly. Play it really softly.
