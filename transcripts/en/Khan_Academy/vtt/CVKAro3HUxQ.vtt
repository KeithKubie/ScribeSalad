00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.520
So what do we have here?

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.000
We have a triangle, and we
know that the length of AC

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.650
is equal to the length of CB.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.650
So this is an
isosceles triangle,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.260
we have two of its legs
are equal to each other.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.889
And then they also tell us
that this line up here, they

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.180
didn't put another label there.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.290
Let me put another label
there just for fun.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.560
Let's call this, you
could even call this a ray

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.900
because it's starting at C,
that line or ray CD is parallel

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.180
to this segment AB over
here, and that's interesting.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.590
Then they give us
these two angles right

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.040
over here, these
adjacent angles.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.862
They give it to
us in terms of x.

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:34.320
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.880
is try to figure out what x is.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.850
And so given that they told us
that this line and this line

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.111
are parallel, and we can
turn this into line CD,

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.860
so it's not just a ray
anymore, so it just

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.570
keeps going on and on
in both directions.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.610
The fact that they've
given us a parallel line

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.380
tells us that maybe
we can use some

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.200
of what we know about
transversals and parallel lines

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.150
to figure out some
of the angles here.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.030
And you might recognize
that this right over here,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.900
this line-- let me do
that in a better color.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.820
You might recognize that line CB
is a transversal for those two

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.740
parallel lines.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.400
Let's let me draw both of the
parallel lines a little bit

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.330
more so that you can recognize
that as a transversal,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.560
and then a few things
might jump out.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.320
You have this x plus
10 right over here,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.780
and its corresponding
angle is right down here.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.764
This would also be x plus 10.

00:01:25.764 --> 00:01:27.180
And if this is x
plus 10, then you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910
have a vertical
angle right over here

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.860
that would also be x plus 10.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.610
Or you could say that you have
alternate interior angles that

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.140
would also be congruent.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.420
Either way, this base angle
is going to be x plus 10.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.340
Well, it's an
isosceles triangle.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.580
So your two base angles
are going to be congruent.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.170
So if this is x plus 10, then
this is going to be x plus 10

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.290
as well.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.480
And now we have the three
angles of a triangle expressed

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.087
as functions of--
expressed in terms of x.

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:55.420
So when we take their sum,
they need to be equal to 180,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.961
and then we can
actually solve for x.

00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:07.740
We get 2x plus x plus
10 plus x plus 10

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.180
is going to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.670
And then we can add up the x's.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.150
So we have a 2x there
plus an x plus another x,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.382
that gives us 4x.

00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:20.810
4 x's.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.730
And then we have a plus
10 and another plus 10,

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.420
so that gives us a plus
20, is equal to 180.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.330
And we can subtract 20
from both sides of that,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.750
and we get 4x is equal to 160.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.700
Divide both sides by 4, and
we get x is equal to 40.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.450
And we're done.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.070
We've figured out what x is,
and then we could actually

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.444
figure out what
these angles are.

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:49.200
If this is x plus 10
then you have 40 plus 10,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.140
this right over here is going
to be a 50-degree angle.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.867
This is 2x, so 2 times 40,
this is an 80-degree angle.

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:57.700
It doesn't look at it
the way I've drawn it,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.600
and that's why you should
never assume anything

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.994
based on how a diagram is drawn.

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:04.410
So this right over here is
going to be an 80-degree angle,

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.680
and then these two base
angles right over here

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.110
are also going to be 50 degrees.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.040
So you have 50 degrees,
50 degrees, and 80,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.370
they add up to 180 degrees.
