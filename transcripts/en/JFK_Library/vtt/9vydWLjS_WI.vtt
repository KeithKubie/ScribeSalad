00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:08.024
(gentle techno music)

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:09.955
- You could pick up and take your factory

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:13.253
that was making something
right here in Brockton,

00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:17.420
and put it over one mile
across the border in Mexico.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.570
- Our annual deficits
went over a trillion dollars.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.500
theyâ€™ve been reduced significantly.

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:29.039
- This year's pretty
interesting, and it's not like

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.629
any other year that there
has been an election.

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:33.675
- They've turned this election
into what they have done

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:37.006
and not enough about what they will do,

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.839
and that's important,
obviously, to everybody.

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:49.797
Even if it is a choice I
would make or if it's not

00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:52.374
a choice I would make, I
have to be open-minded.

00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:54.254
Just to understand the
people that are living

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.654
in the same country as
me, considering the fact

00:00:56.654 --> 00:01:00.510
that I only live in Boston,
I only travel in Boston,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.711
it was really cool to see
other people's point of views

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:05.674
about who they believed
would be more beneficial

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:06.757
as president.

00:01:10.398 --> 00:01:12.452
- And kids are actually
in a small enough group

00:01:12.452 --> 00:01:15.078
and where they feel it's
safe to have an exchange,

00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:18.745
they really share some
pretty deep thoughts.

00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:23.520
Something about being here,
I think, gets kids to think

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.421
bigger in some way, because
you just, at some level,

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:33.035
I think the kids sense that
these are serious things

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:35.050
and they really make a difference.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.376
- Business.

00:01:36.376 --> 00:01:40.543
I wanted to know what
candidate Clinton's plans are

00:01:41.844 --> 00:01:43.905
for American manufacturing.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:46.937
- I think the interesting
space around manufacturing,

00:01:46.937 --> 00:01:49.926
and I think it reflects here
in Massachusetts as well,

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:53.487
is that there is a new level
of manufacturing, a precision--

00:01:53.487 --> 00:01:55.416
- For me it was pretty
intense when you have somebody

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.300
who disagrees with you.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.349
It's really important to
understand their point of view,

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:00.986
it expands your mindset.

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:03.530
- Instead of just reading
it or just watching them,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.163
I actually got to see people
that run in their campaign,

00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:11.765
and see what the people
in their campaign believe,

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.407
and how they'd support their candidate.

00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:17.312
- [Man] To give you, that
distinguish these candidates.

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:18.562
Breitbart News.

00:02:20.302 --> 00:02:22.262
- You have to all understand each other

00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:24.146
in all different types of backgrounds.

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:28.627
Just not be ignorant
about some type of people

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:29.857
or creating scapegoats.

00:02:29.857 --> 00:02:32.075
You have to find out the best solutions

00:02:32.075 --> 00:02:34.161
for day to day problems.

00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:36.328
- I do believe that we are the future.

00:02:36.328 --> 00:02:39.783
We're the upcoming faces,
and that's really important

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:42.612
that we understand what's
going on in our country.

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:45.779
