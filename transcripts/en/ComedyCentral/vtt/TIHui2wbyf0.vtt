Marcus Silva says,

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:05.405
“Check out Oscar nominee Sam
Elliott back in his Gary days.”

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:07.740
Dude, let me tell you
how quickly

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:10.510
I would have been staying
at Scott Thompson's house

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.445
if Sam Elliott wanted
to take my mom anywhere.

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:13.646 line:92%
I wouldn't even known.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.814
She would've picked me up
at school.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:16.015
She would've picked me up
from Heartwood Athletic Club

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:18.451
where I went to after school
and she would've been like,

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.753
“Here's a backpack. You got
underwear, your toothbrush.

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:22.655
You're staying at Scott's
for the week.”

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:25.291
He's the ultimate guy
that's gonna bang your mom.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:27.761
My mom, is,
I'm not lying to you,

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:33.033
going with me and Christine
to see Cher in Philadelphia

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.702
because we had the conversation
about seeing the musical,

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.538
and I said, "They didn't even
mention the movie Mask,"

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:42.341
and my mom goes, “Oh, Mask,
that's the best. Sam Elliott."

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:44.110
Do you think your mom
would lose it if I was like,

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:45.278 line:92%
"Hey hey."

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:46.512 line:92%
I told her you'd do it.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.681
But if I called her
and pretended to be...

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:52.485
and I go, "Hey, is this Terry.
This is Sam Elliott."

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:55.121
Let me get disappointed by both
my parents on the phone today.

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:56.756
I go, “I was just
wondering if...

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.424 line:92%
What are you doing right now?

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:01.194
Why don't you put on those jeans
down to your ankles."

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:08.267
Dude, my mom is such a devout
Catholic woman.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.735 line:92%
Doesn't even utter a curse,

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:14.140
but if you put a picture of
Tom Selleck up she'll be like,

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:15.641
“I will suck his fucking cock,”
she'll lose it.

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:16.842 line:92%
She'll totally lose it.

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:20.513
Dude, Tom Selleck, come on.
That might be the trifecta.

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:21.881 line:92%
Tell me Terry's not into Tom.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.383
I know for a fact
Trish would run through

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:27.186
like a wet paper towel
to get to Tom Selleck.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.591
I could be dying of food
poisoning or choking

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:32.792 line:92%
and if Tom Selleck was like,

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.193
"Why don't you come out
to my car

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:36.429 line:92%
and throw me a heej or a beej?"

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.565
And my mom would be like,
"Dan, you had a good life."

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.268 line:92%
He stayed handsome, too.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:43.870 line:92%
Tom Selleck stays warm.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.306
My mom just flicks
her bean to 'Blue Bloods'.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:48.908 line:92%
You know what 'Blue Bloods' is?

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:52.512
And you get an older mature
Don Wahlberg.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.414 line:92%
But Tom Selleck on 'Blue Bloods

00:01:55.447 --> 00:02:00.720
'is the Cinemax
for mom's past menopause.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.723
When women go past menopause
they watch 'Blue

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.826
Bloods' the way young teenage
boys used to watch Cinemax.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.629
Oh God, I hope
there's some stability.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:14.700
You know if Tom Selleck
does a really stable man thing.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:16.469 line:92%
Oh my God, I imagine my mom

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.771
sitting down in her
cloud pajamas with her

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.640 line:92%
Dachshund, Larry,

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.675
just getting hot
flashes watching Blue Bloods.

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:24.644
Oh my God, I imagine Trish
having to get up

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.714
for a refill of a martini
in between a commercial break.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.283 line:92%
Moving Riley and Oreo.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.351
Guys, guys, move.
I need to get a refill.

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:33.853
And she stirs
with the middle finger.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:36.556
And she can't take her eyes
off the screen.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.359
She just goes, “Still looks good
after all these years."

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.162
Oh, that 'stache.
It really does.

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:45.198
That thing velcros
right into a mom bush.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.899
If I was a punk band,
I would name an album,

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:48.801
“Your Mom Wants to
Fuck Tom Selleck”.

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:54.574
It's just him showing up
at any of our mom's house.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:57.343
“How you doing?
MY car broke down. Tom Selleck.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:00.280
Do you mind if I use the phone”"
She's like, "Oh."

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.952
Dude, my mom has been
vocal about

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.321
wanting to have sex
with Samuel L. Jackson.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:10.723 line:92%
She loves Samuel L. Jackson.

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.592 line:92%
That dude is ashy I bet.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.627
For years, she's always
liked Samuel L. Jackson.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.430
Oh man, I wonder how many moms
throw it at Samuel L.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:20.333
Oh, you know who's another one
that moms want to fucking...

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.701
my mom wants
to absolutely bang out?

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:22.868 line:92%
Kurt Russell.

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.638 line:92%
Kurt Russell! Good one!

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.741
Are you talking 'Tango
and Cash' Kurt Russell?

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:31.911
I mean, all of it.
You watch now and go backwards.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:33.579
Yeah. She wants to fuck
Kurt Russell.

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:35.348 line:92%
'Big Trouble Little China'.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.783
There's no... 844-COMEDY9.
No one's called in to say

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:39.017
who they think would
fuck their mom yet.

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:42.421
Well, Rod Brooks, our buddy
that you met in San Francisco,

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:44.557 line:76%
you did his radio show.
You did Rod's...

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:48.461 line:76%
he texted me and he said,
"My moms would've thrown me

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.396
in a river to fuck
Teddy Pendergrass."

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.600 line:92%
That's the black mom Selleck.

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:55.901 line:92%
His life ended in a wheelchair

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.336
so she could've got him
by the end.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.638
Oh yeah, she could've
just ran him down.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:03:59.639 line:92%
Or just stood in front of him.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.474
If she threw you in the river
for that Rod,

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:02.808
she just wanted to throw you
in the river.

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:04.677
She goes,
“But, I get an excuse.”

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:08.447
Look at teddy Pendergrass.
Yeah.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.584
But it wasn't about, you know,
his looks, it was the voice.

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:12.652 line:92%
That was one soulful.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:18.057
Is your mom home?
No Teddy, my mom's not home now.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.027
Hey what's up Jay.
Take Terry around.

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:24.997
Can you make me a plate
to bring home

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.667 line:92%
after I bust off in your momma.

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.936
You've been working all hard
and Aetna,

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.973 line:92%
your son's playing video games.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.611
Turn the TV up or you're gonna
hear your mom

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:40.446 line:92%
getting fucked hard.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.584
Let's do it in the shower
so the kid can't hear.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:49.922
What's that? I'm wondering
who else is on the list:

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:52.858
Bichette, Pendergrass,
Russell, Selleck.

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:54.026 line:92%
Selleck's number one.

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:55.060 line:92%
Yeah, Selleck's number one.

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:57.430
My mom has been vocal about,
and my Aunt Ilene,

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:00.566
they've always wanted to have
a threesome with Michael Bolton.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:03.469
He's another big one.
But again, Selleck is one.

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:06.372
I'll tell you, one that won
for my mom, 70s, 80s,

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:09.075 line:92%
90s and now: Kenny Loggins.

00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:15.514
Buddy, I saw a billboard
for Kenny Loggins right now.

00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:21.754
No dude, he did it.
He went cat-face.

00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:23.823 line:92%
Look at Kenny Loggins

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:26.692
now.There's
the picture actually.

00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:28.494 line:92%
Oh, Kenny!

00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:30.529 line:92%
Come on, Ken.

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:31.897 line:92%
It's odd-looking.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.001 line:92%
Why? He looks like a trans man.

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:38.437
You know what he would say if he
heard us talking like this?

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.605 line:92%
What?

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:43.376
I'm alright.
Don't nobody worry about me.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.111 line:92%
Kenny. The surgery went through.

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:47.880
We grafted you perfectly
with a Siamese cat.

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:50.149
Dean from Maryland says,
“Usher”.

00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:52.985 line:92%
Dean, how old is your mom?

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:55.087
That's a young mom.
Garth Brooks.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.589 line:92%
Garth Brooks!

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.457
How did I forget
about Garth Brooks.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.025
My mom would've
torn those jeans off

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:01.894 line:92%
like tearaway pants in the NBA.

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:04.497
Trisha
was lucky.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.133
My mom wanted to fuck
Garth Brooks something awful.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:11.070
The guy wears jeans
weirdly on his belly.

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:14.407
Cool. You're talking about
a Colorado mom, dude.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.674
Garth Brooks would get hit
in the face

00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:17.009
with a pair
of yellow cotton panties.

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:18.778 line:92%
Dude, I'll tell you this,

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:22.882
Trish would've flung some
fucking legs at James Taylor.

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.850 line:92%
Yeah, she absolutely...

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:28.087
My mom would definitely get
a pedicure for Garth Brooks.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.789
Garth
Brooks would've just...

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.957
he could've came in and ate
all the cupboards bare

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.493
and fucked my mom and left
and she wouldn't have cared.

00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:35.661 line:92%
Loved GB.

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:36.762 line:92%
Garth Brooks.

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:38.497
And James Taylor. My mom was
a big James Taylor guy.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.698 line:92%
Soulful lady.

00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:40.833 line:92%
So weird.

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:41.834 line:92%
Garth Brooks is beyond big.

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:43.702
Kenny Loggins. Who else
did my mom want to...

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:47.907
that I remember he being like,
"Oh, yeah." Michael Bolton.

00:06:49.508 --> 00:06:51.411
Jay in Atlanta says,
"Michael Keaton."

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.546 line:92%
All right!

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:56.849
But that's not for anything
with the look I don't think.

00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:58.618
I don't know.
That's timely.

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.654
Jason in Texas says,
"Woody Harrelson."

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:03.022 line:92%
Woody. I would love if my mom...

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:04.623
That would make me
like my mom more

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:05.824 line:92%
if she wanted to fuck Woody.

00:07:05.857 --> 00:07:08.994
90s Val Kilmer. Not before
bloated in a river Val Kilmer.

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:10.162 line:92%
'Tombstone'.

00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:12.498
No, yeah, 'Tombstone'
Val Kilmer.

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:13.833 line:92%
'Doors' Val Kilmer.

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:16.001 line:92%
Yes! My mom was into Val Kilmer.

00:07:16.034 --> 00:07:19.639
Not wears fucking t-shirt
in a wading pool Val Kilmer.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.875
He's been dead for a week
Val Kilmer.

00:07:22.908 --> 00:07:25.678
Eli in Dallas says, this is
an interesting one to me,

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:30.783
"Mark McGwire."
Eli, your mom particularly...

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.785
That seems like
a very specific one.

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:34.720 line:92%
The baseball player?

00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:37.757
Dude, 98 he's
a fucking big ging.

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:39.758 line:92%
Yeah, he's a big ging.

00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:41.093 line:92%
Big ging.

00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:43.529
So that means Eli's mom
is into Gingers.

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:45.064 line:92%
I can't answer the phone

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:46.932
... baseball players,
it may have been specifically

00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:50.135
Yankees but my mom would be open
about wondering how hot

00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:51.804
and how long
Paul O'Neill's legs were.

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:52.972 line:92%
Oh, Paul O'Neill.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:55.741
She was like, "He's got such
long legs, Paul O'Neill."

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:58.711
Your mom used to call guys out
for having legs for day?

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.079
Look at the stems
on that pitcher.

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:01.280
She was like,
I'll tell you this,

00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:03.716
I'll bury my face
between those yams.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.952
Nothing like your dad's stubby
fucking legs.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.120
Not like your father's
line legs.

00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:09.288 line:92%
What?

00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:11.090 line:92%
Eli, you there?

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.793
Yeah, Mark McGwire's...
that's a fetish almost.

00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:16.262 line:92%
The red-headed

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.297
She wanted to be tossed around
by a fucking Viking.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.533
Yeah, by a Scottish
Viking warrior.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.003
Oh, this is a goody.
Matt in Missouri says,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.606
"Mother would drown him
in a tub for a shot

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:30.576
with the Doctor himself:
Don Johnson."

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:32.178 line:92%
Don Johnson!

00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:35.548
Yeah, dude, great one!
Well, you forget dude,

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:37.316
Don Johnson
was getting moms wet.

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:38.717 line:92%
Wet.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.019 line:92%
Don Dick.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.554 line:92%
Yeah, Don Johnson's fucking hot.

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:42.955 line:92%
He's still handsome!

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:45.891
It'd be funny if your mom
was more, "I'm a Tubs lady".

00:08:45.924 --> 00:08:47.760
Oh, if you're mom likes
Philip Michael Thomas.

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:48.928 line:92%
You're like,

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:51.864
"Mom, you gotta swing for
the fucking fence in here".

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:53.566
That's the kid that grew up
sleeping on the couch

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:57.036
in the living room.
If your mom liked Tubs.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.004 line:92%
I mean if your mom-

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:00.339
Well worse if she liked
Edward James Olmos.

00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:02.041
That would've been
the worst captain.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.909 line:92%
If she's a little bit older.

00:09:03.942 --> 00:09:06.178
I mean, if we're talking about
if your mom had you late in life

00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:08.814
and she's in her 70's,
we're talking Burt Reynolds.

00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:11.584
Oh my God. My moms 70, and I
think Burt isn't her style.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:12.885
You gotta remember
Burt Reynolds,

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:14.353
you gotta remember
'Deliverance' Burt Reynolds

00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:15.754 line:92%
when he was in shape and shit.

00:09:15.787 --> 00:09:16.888 line:92%
Oh man, 'Gator'.

00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:18.857
Although, a lot of people
like not so much in shape

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.960 line:92%
but casual, free wheeling,

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.294
'Smokey the Bandit'
Burt Reynolds.

00:09:22.327 --> 00:09:23.428 line:92%
That's a fun Burt.

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:28.734
But no one's mom is really
fucking giving themselves

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:32.705
a front wedge over the captain,
or not the captain, what was he,

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:34.940 line:92%
Jack in 'Boogie Nights'.

00:09:34.973 --> 00:09:37.310
Tom Selleck is just,
if you're a white woman-

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.779 line:92%
It's over.

00:09:40.712 --> 00:09:43.716
If you're a baby boomer
white woman, I would do...

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.818
If this was Family Feud
and the question

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:51.023
was baby boomer white women
want to fuck Tom Selleck.

00:09:51.056 --> 00:09:52.291 line:92%
The answer's Tom Selleck.

00:09:52.324 --> 00:09:53.859 line:92%
It's like 95.

00:09:53.892 --> 00:09:55.294 line:92%
But it's been a long time since,

00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:56.996
and we figured this out
when we were talking about

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.164
'The Punisher',
that all those characters

00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:02.334
they shave their chests
for the show, that Tom Selleck,

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:05.171
one of those big things,
that big furry chest.

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:09.775
I think Burt Reynolds also,
that's not a thing looked upon,

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:12.845
if that was there'd
be fucking staples

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:15.714
in the middle of a bunch of Joe
Derosa pictures.

00:10:15.747 --> 00:10:17.316 line:92%
He'd be centerfold all day.

00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:19.018
Rosa's got a fucking
Bon Jovi chest.

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.185 line:92%
Young Bon Jovi.

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:22.187
Look at that.
Stephanie Falconi said,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.390
"After bringing her
to a few shows at her request

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:25.624
and seeing her
in that situation,

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:28.193 line:76%
I'm pretty sure my mom would
be down for Big Jay Oakerson".

00:10:28.226 --> 00:10:31.030
I'll give her the biz.
I got her stoned.

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:32.798 line:92%
Stephanie Falconi's a hot name.

00:10:32.831 --> 00:10:36.368
Yeah. She's letting
her mom bang Jay.

00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:37.836 line:92%
Pretty sweet lady.

00:10:37.869 --> 00:10:39.271
Yo, remember when you banged
Stephanie Falconi?

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:42.841
Sean Connery! Good job, Ryan!
The ginga ninja.

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:44.209 line:92%
Dude, Sean Connery!

00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:46.745
I could hear my mom getting wet
watching 'Last Crusade'.

00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:49.448
But as he got older-
Dude, that's what I'm saying.

00:10:49.481 --> 00:10:51.250 line:92%
Trish, what is Dan doing?

00:10:51.883 --> 00:10:54.754
Let's let Dan go down to
the basement play with his guys.

00:10:55.987 --> 00:10:57.757
I'll finger you
in the kitchen.

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:05.731
He may top Tom Selleck.
It's close, it's like 1A, 1B.

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:08.167
It's Highlander situation
between Connery and Selleck.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.869
Yeah, I can't believe we
forgot about Sean Connery.

00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:14.240
Oh, Sean Connery. Coming in
and having sex with your mom.

00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:19.812 line:92%
Welcome to my cock.

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:24.149
Oh dude, look at him,
still getting it.

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:25.417 line:92%
I mean, stone cold fox.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.052
He's still alive, too, right?
Sean Connery?

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:30.056
He's retired from acting.
Took a break.

00:11:31.423 --> 00:11:32.891 line:92%
How about Brian Dennehy?

00:11:32.924 --> 00:11:35.361
He's like,
"You're my stepson now, dog".

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.264
Oh, yeah, Nichole G, good call: 
Springsteen.

00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:40.432 line:92%
Yeah, and that's a musician.

00:11:40.465 --> 00:11:42.234 line:92%
Oh, that's also

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:44.770
musician and I'll tell you
another musician.

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:46.839
Do you mind if I ate
all your Cocoa Crisps?

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:49.008
I was up last night
fucking Trish.

00:11:49.474 --> 00:11:51.176
Yes, you guys are
running low on milk.

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:53.011 line:92%
Hey, I just thought of a song.

00:11:53.044 --> 00:11:55.314
Dan's still asleep
and they're out of milk.

00:11:56.114 --> 00:11:59.185
Should I wake him up or just eat
the rest of his cereal.

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:03.222 line:92%
Bruce Springsteen's stepson.

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:06.926
He goes, "He throws like a fag,
he runs like a queer".

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:10.062 line:92%
His head's so big.

00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:18.537
You need to insulate these walls
when I come and break you off.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.873 line:92%
He cries at scary movies.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:28.814
I don't want to call him my son
but he insists on it.

00:12:29.414 --> 00:12:31.483 line:92%
I'm not saying he's gay,

00:12:31.516 --> 00:12:36.421
but I've never seen
a boy cry so much.

00:12:36.454 --> 00:12:40.092
He hates the sight of blood,
he sucks on a bike,

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:43.862 line:92%
I'd give him back if I could.

00:12:43.895 --> 00:12:50.836
He names his stuffed animals
and he gives them people names.

00:12:52.504 --> 00:12:55.040 line:92%
That's really weird.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.979
He gets scared at lightning,
believes in Santa

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:06.152 line:92%
and he's 11 years old.

00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:08.987
Mom's banging in no particular 
order: Neil Diamond, check.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.289
Lee Majors-
No, not my mom.

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:11.423 line:92%
Pass on Lee Majors.

00:13:11.456 --> 00:13:12.958
Lee Majors.
My mom might've given

00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:14.426
the six million dollar man,
for sure.

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:16.161
I don't know about yours
I can't answer for her.

00:13:16.194 --> 00:13:17.596 line:92%
Ted Dansen, yes,

00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:20.232
and let me answer something
that I'm insulted

00:13:20.265 --> 00:13:23.135
that I didn't know for my mom,
Mr. Pierce Brosnan.

00:13:23.168 --> 00:13:24.503 line:92%
Chris said Pierce Brosnan.

00:13:24.536 --> 00:13:25.904 line:92%
I said Pierce Brosnan.

00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:27.906
I overlapped that.
That's a big one

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:30.876 line:92%
Paul Newman, of course.

00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:33.078
Robert Redford,
goes without saying.

00:13:33.111 --> 00:13:34.546
Paul Newman and Robert Redford
though-

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:35.914 line:92%
And Kevin Costner.

00:13:35.947 --> 00:13:37.115 line:92%
And Warren Beatty.

00:13:37.148 --> 00:13:41.320
That's why I was saying more
like the singers of the time

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:42.521
because Robert Redford
and Paul Newman,

00:13:42.554 --> 00:13:45.891
both of them, by the time
I would look at them to be like,

00:13:45.924 --> 00:13:48.394
"Oh, this is what the girls
are all excited about,"

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:51.163
they were kind of grizzled,
you know.

00:13:51.196 --> 00:13:54.033
Robert Redford aged bizarre
when he started to age.

00:13:56.334 --> 00:13:59.504
He wilted like a ginger
and Paul Newman,

00:13:59.537 --> 00:14:01.440
he's just like a fucking drawing
on salad

00:14:01.473 --> 00:14:03.642 line:92%
dressing at this point to me.

00:14:03.675 --> 00:14:05.878 line:92%
Did your mom ever get remarried?

00:14:06.511 --> 00:14:08.247
No, but she had two
long-term boyfriends.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.481 line:92%
Did you like 'em?

00:14:09.514 --> 00:14:10.883 line:92%
I liked...

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:14.320
the one I didn't like,
my friend's dad-

00:14:15.186 --> 00:14:16.421 line:92%
He was long term?

00:14:16.454 --> 00:14:19.491
They dated for like five years
then he started dating a woman

00:14:19.524 --> 00:14:21.159
who lived directly
across the street.

00:14:21.192 --> 00:14:22.394 line:92%
So he dumped my mom,

00:14:22.427 --> 00:14:24.029
I was like seventeen
when they got dumped.

00:14:24.062 --> 00:14:25.197 line:92%
And this was in Brooklyn?

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.398 line:92%
This was in Brooklyn.

00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:27.900
Literally,
directly across the street.

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:30.068
I'm talking about the house
across the street,

00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:31.503
He started dating
that woman in there

00:14:31.536 --> 00:14:34.006
and it broke my mother's heart.
My mom-

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.173 line:92%
What'd you think?

00:14:35.206 --> 00:14:36.408
Did you talk to your friend
about it?

00:14:36.441 --> 00:14:37.576
Were you like,
"What the fuck, dude?"

00:14:37.609 --> 00:14:38.977
Yeah, I mean it was
like everybody...

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.145 line:92%
he was just a dick anyway.

00:14:40.178 --> 00:14:41.413
Nobody was really
friends with him.

00:14:41.446 --> 00:14:43.248
He was always a dick
so was his dad.

00:14:43.281 --> 00:14:45.083
So my dad one time
came to pick me up

00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:46.318
to take me to
a basketball tournament

00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:48.320
and my mom
was sitting in a chair

00:14:48.353 --> 00:14:50.289 line:92%
looking out the window weeping.

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:52.991
He was like, "What's wrong
with your mother?"

00:14:53.024 --> 00:14:55.961
And I was like,
"Jim broke up with her."

00:14:55.994 --> 00:14:57.696
And he's like, "Well did you
do anything about it?"

00:14:57.729 --> 00:14:59.097 line:92%
And I was like, "What?

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.067
I'm a kid,
I was playing video games."

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.268
And he was like,
"I'm gonna go get bagels,"

00:15:03.301 --> 00:15:06.405
and then he rang the bell
and then all of a sudden I hear

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:09.708
my mother, "Stop, Tony,
what are you doing!?"

00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:13.512
And my dad had him up
against the steps, shaking him,

00:15:14.379 --> 00:15:16.548
and then my dad came back
and it was a whole thing.

00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:18.483
The police were called,
but like nothing happened

00:15:18.516 --> 00:15:19.952
and my dad came back
and he was like,

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.120
"You can't have your mother
crying like that.

00:15:22.153 --> 00:15:23.622
You should've taken care
of that yourself."

00:15:23.655 --> 00:15:26.425
Wow! That's what it's like
having a dad!?

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:27.659 line:92%
That sounds awesome!

00:15:27.692 --> 00:15:29.361
Yeah, and I was just like,
"I get it,"

00:15:29.394 --> 00:15:31.330
and then we went to
Staten Island and he was like,

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:33.432
"Look, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have done that."

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.534
There's always the same story
with my dad.

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:37.736
He would do something
he wasn't supposed to do

00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:39.538
but it was really just
'cause he loved me

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:41.106
and then he would explain to me
on the ride

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:44.443
how I should not do
what he just did.

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:46.044
He fucking shook-
He shook him.

00:15:46.077 --> 00:15:47.346
He pushed him around
a little bit.

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:48.547 line:92%
He scared him and he was like,

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.616
"Look, you can't date
this lady anymore".

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:53.685
I never saw the guy again.
None of us ever saw him again.

00:15:53.718 --> 00:15:56.421
I mean, he's okay but I think
he stopped dating that woman.

00:15:56.454 --> 00:15:57.656
That's crazy.
And my mom-

00:15:57.689 --> 00:15:58.857
What a weird way
to break up with a woman.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:02.728
You go, "A man threatened me.
I got threatened by a man.

00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:06.031
Yeah, my ex's ex told me that
if I keep dating you

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:09.335
he's gonna cut my cock off so...
I like my dick."

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:13.505
So that's what happened.
Oh man.

00:16:14.305 --> 00:16:16.041
And I was telling you, my dad,
apparently,

00:16:16.074 --> 00:16:17.209 line:92%
this was before I was born

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:20.012
or maybe my mom
was pregnant with me.

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:22.748
They were laying on the grass
in central park,

00:16:23.548 --> 00:16:26.518
my mom and my dad
and Dan Aykroyd apparently,

00:16:26.551 --> 00:16:28.120
allegedly came by
in roller blades,

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.188 line:92%
or a skate board,

00:16:29.221 --> 00:16:31.723
and my dad went to go
take a piss behind a tree

00:16:31.756 --> 00:16:33.191 line:92%
or something like that.

00:16:33.224 --> 00:16:35.060
He had stopped
and was hitting on my mom.

00:16:35.093 --> 00:16:37.129 line:92%
What? On roller skates.

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.764
Did he have
the rubber stopper down?

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:42.434
My mom said my dad was close
to getting in Aykroyd's face.

00:16:42.467 --> 00:16:44.269
How fucking awesome
would that be if I was like,

00:16:44.302 --> 00:16:45.670
"Yeah, my dad
punched Dan Aykroyd."

00:16:45.703 --> 00:16:47.305
Or Dan Aykroyd beat the shit
out of my dad.

00:16:47.338 --> 00:16:48.440 line:92%
On roller skates.

00:16:48.473 --> 00:16:49.641 line:92%
On roller skates.

00:16:49.674 --> 00:16:50.742
I mean, if a Ghostbuster
takes out your dad

00:16:50.775 --> 00:16:53.378
while wearing roller skates,
is your father a ghost?

00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:55.514 line:92%
Doctor Detroit?
