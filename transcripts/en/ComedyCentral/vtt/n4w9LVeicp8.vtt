00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.040
Josh Horowitz, you're a
legendary champion,

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.771
thank you for coming
to help me pack.

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.139
Even though you're
just a journalist

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.340
who interviews me sometimes,

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.908
you're my closest
and dearest friend.

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:10.176
Aww.
So I'm happy you're here.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.444
That's so sweet, man.

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.413
I mean I can only imagine
how crazy your schedule's been.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.682
It's gotta be a fantastic beast,
if you will.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.184
Don't make bad puns like that,
Josh,

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:19.419
I'm gonna put a hex on you.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.755
Oh, oh, yes I will, yes I will.
Okay.

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:25.758
Hey, speaking of hexes, have you
noticed that weird Reddit thread

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.361
that talks about you
being an actual wizard?

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.762
Yeah, isn't that ridiculous?

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.231
Because no one's an actual
wizard because magic isn't real.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:35.268
Josh, would you get me
my sex fetishist rave clothes?

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.536
Okay, yeah.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.971
You never know in Paris.
There's a history out there.

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:40.706
I don't see how that can
possibly fit, though, man.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.508
I mean, I'm no mathematician.
Have you seen the movie?

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.910
I liked it, I really.
I thought it was better than-

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.745
Did you think I was the best
person in the movie?

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:46.979
Because everyone keeps saying

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:48.581
Jude Law, Jude Law
was only in two scenes

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.383
so I don't even understand
how that makes any sense.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:53.786
It's not true, first of all, and
it's just because he's English.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.888
But what did you think because
I want your honest opinion?

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.690
I thought Jude was great, but I
thought you were great, too.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:00.326
Jude, Jude, they always
think about Jude.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.761
Oh, wait, hold on,
forgetting my dog.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:02.995
What about your dog?

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:04.964
Gotta bring my dog
to Paris, Josh.

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:06.899
You can't pack a dog
in the bag like that.

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:08.835
No, he's going to be
very comfortable.

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:14.207
Okay, but you need a carrier
or something like-

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.608
Shut the (bleep) up,
shut the (bleep) up.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:16.876
I think that's inhumane.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.379
You know what would be inhumane
is not bringing my dog to Paris.

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:21.747
It's okay, it's okay,
that's okay.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.015
Please don't, please don't.

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.885
That's okay. Or you know
what would be inhumane?

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.153
Forgetting the food.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.754
Right.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.823
Or the bed,
that would be inhumane.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:34.060
Can I switch to water maybe?
Can I get like a glass?

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.095
You are drinking water, Josh.

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:37.730
No, I've been drinking beer
the whole time.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:38.998
It's always been water.

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.000
What are you talking about?
It's not.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.368
What the hell?
That was not like that-

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:45.138
What are you saying, Josh?
That I'm truly a wizard.

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.773
That I truly have dark
wizardly powers,

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:50.977
that I made some sort of deal
with Baphomet in the dark of the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.545
night?

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:53.846
What was that?

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:58.684
Are you implying perhaps that
I turned the scene-stealing Jude

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:01.988
Law into the little cute bitch
that he's always been?

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:06.159
You think I am in fact a dark
wizard fated to rule the world,

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.130
lord over all the repugnant
mortals like yourself?

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:18.504
'Cause that's ridiculous,
I would never do that,

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.840
I'm totally kidding.
You got freaked out.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.141
You just got
genuinely freaked out.

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:23.376
You are kidding.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.045
Oh my God, you got me again.
You always get me.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:29.015
Josh, how could that not be
a joke if it's literally insane?

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.616
Well, you were going
pretty far on that.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:31.884
I know.
It was the scream.

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:33.152
I commit.
These are the bits we always do.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:34.387
That's what we do.
That's what we do.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.788
And then I feel like
there's always this one moment

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:37.023
where I look back and I'm like,

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.725
"Oh my gosh, Josh
is actually scared right now."

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:41.994
I was. I still am a little bit,
I'm shaking.

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:43.396
No, it's you're totally fine.
Hey listen.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.630
What?

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:45.865
Crazy idea.

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:47.333
You wanna come to Paris
with me for this premiere?

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:48.601
Stop it. Don't be,

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.403
don't say stuff like that
if you don't mean it.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.804
Well honestly, I was just
thinking about it

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:53.673
and I was like,
"You know what?

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:57.009
I would be way more comfortable
on this press tour

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.845
if Josh Horowitz was with me,"
'cause I love you, you know?

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:01.080
I love you, I thank you.

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:02.682
That's a yes? You'll come?

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.183
That is a yes.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.419
And you're so excited?
I am so excited.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.787
And you're a neck pillow.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.689
A delightful,
beautiful neck pillow.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:13.960
Another great adventure for Ezra
Miller and Josh Horowitz.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.429
Thanks, buddy,
I'm really gonna lean on you.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.534
I have a propensity
for word play.
