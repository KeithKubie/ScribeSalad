00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
The Japanese government has agreed to pay one billion yen,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.920
equal to about 8.3 million U.S. dollars,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.460
into a fund to support former South Korean comfort women.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.860
These women were taken from their homes, and used as sex slaves by the Japanese military during World War II.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.920
Japan also offered an official apology,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.420
and if they follow through and pay what they pledged,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.340
South Korea will see this matter irreversible resolved,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.680
at least legally.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.420
This seems like a huge step to mend marred relations between the two Asian nations,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.020
but not everyone is supportive of this deal.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.040
The reason many are upset, and that includes surviving victims,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.320
is that they feel the deal was little more than diplomatic cover for Japan.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.720
There is money coming directly from the Japanese government,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.480
but it's not in the form of legal reparations.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.580
If it were, Japan would be admitting that  their actions were illegal,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.440
but they stopped short of that.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.460
Instead, just offering an apology.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.260
Japan also wants South Korea to take down a statue memorializing comfort women

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
that was erected outside of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.720
Many see this as another way that Japan is trying to bury its past.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.960
And if it sounds like Japan is strategic with the way they conduct their public apologies,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.780
it's because they've had a lot of experience doing it.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.840
Since the end of World War II,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.860
numerous Japanese political officials have apologized for various atrocities

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.060
to different communities of people in a number of countries.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.620
This includes apologies to Australian Prisoners of War,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.360
American Prisoners of War,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.160
Canadian Prisoners of War,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.440
the people of Burma, the Philippines, Indonesia, China

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.280
and blanket apologies to all people who were affected by their brutality during World War II.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.200
They have also apologized to the people of Korea in five different decades.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.660
But for many, this is still not enough.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.860
Partly because their track record of denial is just as long as their track record of apology.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.120
They have on occasion denied certain massacres, calling them "fabrications".

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.300
And as recently as 2014,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.700
they've denied that comfort women were forcibly abducted by members of the Japanese military.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.540
Others feel their apologies don't go far enough.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.320
That confidential documents outlining their involvement in war crimes should be officially released.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.940
That Japanese history books should be amended.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.220
And that Japan should admit, under international law, their responsibility.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.320
But Japan will have more chances to apologize.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500
And next up, might be Taiwan.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.280
On the heels of Japan's apologies to South Korea's comfort women,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.160
Taiwan is demanding an apology to the women who were abducted from their country during World War II.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.120
Women who were also used as military sex slaves.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.760
That's something Japan has yet to admit.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.360
It's been more than 70 years since Japan surrendered to end World War II,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.240
but they might not ever be able to put their war crimes fully behind them.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.840
And many people think they never should.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.600
To see what other repercussions of war communities are forced to deal with,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.900
watch this video

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.340
about how a town is using leftover bombs to build homes.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.600
We see the explosions and troops on T.V..

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.340
War leaves behind scarred earth and communities

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.100
left to pick up the pieces, trying to rebuild the life they once knew.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.320
And in some cases, using the remnants of war to do just that.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.580
And as always, thanks for watching, and don't forget to subscribe.
