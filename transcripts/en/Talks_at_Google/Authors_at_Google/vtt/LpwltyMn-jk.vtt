00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:01.880
CHRISTINE: Christine
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.170
I'm a member of our
legal team.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.940
And I somehow got tricked into
doing this event because I was

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.060
so excited to meet Cheryl.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.620
For those of you who don't know,
Cheryl Strayed is a New

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.580
York Times best-selling
author.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.410
She had two books come out in
the last year, "Wild," which

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.580
was her memoir of her
three-month solo trip up the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.910
Pacific Crest Trail of hiking
more than 1,000 miles.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.190
She also had a book come out
called "Tiny Beautiful

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.759
Things," which is a compendium,
I don't know, a

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.630
collection of her columns that
she wrote as Dear Sugar.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.800
And "Dear Sugar" was an advice
column on the Rumpus.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.400
Still is.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.700
CHERYL STRAYED: Yes.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.890
CHRISTINE: But, sort of advice
column that transcended the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.390
bounds of advice columns.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810
She's also the author of a
critically acclaimed novel

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.940
called "Torch." And she has an
MFA from Syracuse University

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.205
and a PA from the University
of Minnesota.

00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:04.879
And she lives in Portland
with two kids.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.620
CHERYL STRAYED: And
my husband.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.520
CHRISTINE: And her husband.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.055
CHERYL STRAYED: And
our three cats.

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:08.840
CHRISTINE: Three cats?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.635
CHERYL STRAYED: Three, yeah.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:10.530
CHRISTINE: That's
a lot of cats.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.460
CHERYL STRAYED: That's
a lot of cats.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.170
CHRISTINE: So welcome.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.390
We're so excited to have you.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.650
CHERYL STRAYED: Thank you.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.390
It's great to be here.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.010
And thank you all for coming.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.040
Oh, thanks.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.260
CHRISTINE: So, we
had lunch today.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.250
And Cheryl has seen all
of the Google perks.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.020
So I think the next step, Laslo,
is maybe that we need

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.563
an artist in residence.

00:01:27.563 --> 00:01:28.310
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.480
We're thinking.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.440
I could split my time,
artist in residence

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.370
and hiker in residence.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.310
CHRISTINE: We have plenty
of trails around here.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.706
CHERYL STRAYED: That's right.

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:35.500
That's right.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.720
Somebody needs to take you
guys on those trails.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.540
CHRISTINE: So, the last year of
your life, I think, must be

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.040
something that you couldn't
have anticipated.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.850
Did you anticipate that both
"Tiny Beautiful Things" and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.340
"Wild" would have exploded
like this when you were

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.410
writing them and publishing
them?

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.850
CHERYL STRAYED: No.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.830
And yet, there's a longer
answer to that question.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.050
It has to do with essentially
what I had to do along the way

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.550
as I became a writer.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.650
When I was in my early 20s and
I had all of these ambitions

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.580
to be a writer and was really
studying the writer's craft

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.270
and writing my first stories,
I had these grandiose ideas

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.200
about what it meant to be a
writer that I think a lot of

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.820
times people early in their
careers as writers they think,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.910
OK, I'm gonna write this book.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.030
I am gonna be on the best seller
list, or I'll be a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.510
famous author.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.350
And then the more you work,
the more you come to

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.680
understand that you really
cannot measure

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.400
success in that way.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.990
Your book being on the best
seller list is not an accurate

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.220
gauge of success when you're
a literary artist.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.510
And I say that with great
confidence because I know so

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.690
many fantastic writers who are
writing beautiful work worthy

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.480
of our attention that
they don't ever

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.000
really get our attention.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.290
And so, I had to really come
to grips with that pretty

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.590
early on and say the way I was
going to measure success as a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.070
writer was to always do the best
work I could, to put my

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.200
full self into it, to do my
work, to study the craft, and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.010
to write fearlessly with great
vulnerability, and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.990
then come what may.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.470
What's so fascinating to me is
"Wild" would be the exact same

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.350
book whether two people had read
it or two million people

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.660
had read it.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.660
That book what exist.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.830
I would not have done anything
differently.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.080
But of course what happens when
two million people have

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.810
read your book is it becomes
something else.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.210
It goes from being my
book to your book.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.850
And one of the things that has
happened over and over again,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.070
I've talked to thousands of
people around the world in

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.960
this last year.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.230
And they all tell me their
relationship to the book,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.130
their stories about the book,
the pieces of it that

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.550
intrigued them or infuriated
them or whatever

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.030
the book did to them.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.920
And so they've sort
of made it theirs.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.960
CHRISTINE: Your writing, I
think, is so emotional.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.080
And it's so honest, I think, so
raw about experiences that

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.695
happened to you.

00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:07.180
It's seems like you're very,
very forthcoming about things.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.680
And I think I'm curious as to
what it's like as a writer to

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.870
have something that's so close
to your heart that then goes

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.940
out into the world and sort of
morphs into its own beast?

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.810
What is that like?

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.710
CHERYL STRAYED: The couple
months right

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.680
before "Wild" came out--

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.590
I'm just gonna set this down.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.030
The couple months before "Wild"

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.200
came out, I was terrified.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.110
I had been writing the
"Dear Sugar" column.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.380
I'd written essays that had
been read widely that were

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.030
very vulnerable and raw.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.510
But I had never published a book
that was essentially my

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.750
heart on the page.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.310
I mean, my first book, "Torch,"
is my heart on the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.420
page, but it's fiction.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.220
And so even though there are
all these pieces of "Torch"

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.450
that are, in fact, very true,
there was this screen between

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.980
me and the reader where
I could say,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.510
well, this is a fiction.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.710
"Wild," I was saying
the opposite.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.230
I was saying this is me.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.700
This is my story.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.650
If somebody doesn't like
the book-- and I

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.510
mean, I've seen this.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.870
I try not to read--

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.860
I try not to Google myself.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.175
Because really for a writer,
that's a dangerous prospect.

00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:20.690
And I get these Google
alerts every day.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.110
And I try to sort of skim and
not really actually read what

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.090
people have written about me.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.350
And people have written all
kinds of really nice

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.330
things about me.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.050
And then some people have
written really nasty

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.820
things about me.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.730
And what's happening is that
character in that book is me.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.090
And so if they don't like
the book, they think

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.870
they don't like me.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.040
Or if they do like the book,
they think they like me.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.780
And, a couple of nights ago
I was giving a reading.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.870
And afterwards, this woman came
up with her book and she

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.190
said, I'm so glad
I came tonight.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.310
And I said think you.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.840
And she said I didn't think I
was gonna like you at all.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.270
And I was like, oh, thank you.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.760
And I didn't even want
to explore what she

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.810
meant by that because--

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.710
What she was saying is you in
person, I like you in person.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.220
But I think she had
some misgivings

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.600
about me on the page.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.650
And so this is an incredibly
scary thing.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.190
And yet it's the
writer's work.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.160
It's the whole deal.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.960
Not just the writer,
any artist.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.400
I walked past some paintings
when we were coming in here.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.250
And that is this person taking
a great amount of risk and

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.460
presenting it to you.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.340
And you get to say whether you
like it or you don't like it.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.090
And so you're either accepting
or rejecting really something

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.150
that is this person's like
greatest passion.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.640
And, it's a big deal.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.020
And I had to really come to
grips with the fact that like

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.450
there's never been a book
written that everyone loves.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.140
I'm OK with the fact that some
people hate the book and some

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.030
people love the book.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.270
But, I've had to step
back from it.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.270
CHRISTINE: One of the craziest
things that I think must have

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.740
happened to you--

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.970
this is from my perspective, of
course-- but I understand

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.280
that Reese Witherspoon requested
your book before it

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.910
was even published and then
optioned it essentially before

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.300
it was out on the presses.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.010
And so, now there's going to be
a big screen movie of your

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.630
life, of an incredibly raw part
of your life that is also

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.320
going to be made in Hollywood.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.880
And letting go of that control
must be something difficult to

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.130
contemplate?

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.520
CHERYL STRAYED: Just last
week, I read the script.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.760
So, you're right.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.930
About three months before
"Wild" came out,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.760
I got a film agent.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.200
And in just all right in one
day, the film agent said,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.390
there are three women in
Hollywood under the age of 40

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.770
who can get a movie made.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.410
And they knew that the challenge
of "Wild" is the

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.890
main character is a woman.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.240
And there are a bunch of men in
the book, but none of them

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.380
are really main characters.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.260
And so that's already
problematic.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.900
Hollywood doesn't want to make
a movie featuring a woman.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.270
And so, right away my film agent
said, so we need to find

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.320
an actress who feels
passionately about the book

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.950
and will take it on
as her project.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.120
And she said, I just was
chatting with Reese

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.020
Witherspoon, and she said she'd
loved to read your book

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.970
over the weekend.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.660
So this was a Friday.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.590
Would you let Reese read it?

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.070
And I was like sure.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.280
I mean, why not?

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.400
CHRISTINE: Yeah.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:16.620
I guess.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.670
CHERYL STRAYED: And so, and
then I lit a candle--

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.300
which I don't necessarily
believe that lighting a candle

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.640
has any actual impact on the
world-- but I light a candle

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.049
and every time I passed it or
looked at it I'd say, Reese.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:40.346
And, I can't believe I'm telling
you this actually.

00:08:40.346 --> 00:08:42.350
I've only said this
two times now.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.159
This is the second time.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.960
So, it's 'cause you guys gave
me ice cream at lunch.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.430
CHRISTINE: Really
good ice cream.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:56.090
CHERYL STRAYED: And so then
Monday, my cell phone rang.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.805
And it was my agent saying,
Reese loves it and she wants

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.140
to option it and she wants
to talk to you.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.660
And so, Reese and I just had
this hour long conversation

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.740
where she just told me
everything she understood

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.910
about the book, everything
she felt about the book.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.480
And I could see right away that
she got it, that she was

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.710
really deeply connected to
the story I was telling.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:26.360
And then she was sharing with me
all parts of herself as an

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.320
artist, too, as an actress,
what she could

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.240
bring to the story.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.380
Because that's the deal is it is
gonna be strange when I see

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.260
the movie and there's
Reese and she's me.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.150
But it's also I've had
to let that go.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.280
Because I wrote the book.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.555
Nobody can change the book.

00:09:43.555 --> 00:09:45.150
That was my creation.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.090
The film isn't my creation.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.230
And so Reese is gonna have to
make it hers in order for it

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.430
to succeed.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.050
I really think that anything
that is made with artistic

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.860
intentions, it has to come
from a core place.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.050
It has to come from an
authentic place.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:08.700
And so she can't be trying to
sort of mimic me in the course

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.130
of making the film.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.040
So I have just great
confidence in her.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.460
I think she's really smart
and really kind of--

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.820
and I've met her and had long
conversations with her.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.880
I couldn't be more thrilled.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.680
And she hired--

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.480
I didn't want anything to do
with the script, so she hired

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.220
Nick Hornby, the writer
Nick Hornby--

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:27.550
CHRISTINE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.720
CHERYL STRAYED: --to
write the script.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.020
And so then I went to England
in January for the "Wild"

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.900
launch there, and I hung out
with Nick for several days.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.490
And it was so strange 'cause
I met him and he's been

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.310
obsessively thinking
about me for like

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.112
the last three months.

00:10:40.112 --> 00:10:41.450
He's like, Cheryl--

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.450
and it was just this--

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.936
CHRISTINE: So have I,
just by the way.

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:45.688
CHERYL STRAYED: Have you?

00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:49.515
And we just had this really
intense experience together.

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:51.060
And last week I read
the script.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.850
I was afraid to ask him for it
because I was like, oh, what

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.690
if I don't like it?

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.310
He sent it to me, and
it's really good.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.790
It's great.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.340
CHRISTINE: That's wonderful.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.880
CHERYL STRAYED: So, the
hope is that it'll

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.190
be shot this summer.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.260
There are all these logistics
that need to be worked out.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:03.900
And who knows.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.770
It's Hollywood.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.690
You never know.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.900
But, there are good
things happening.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.990
CHRISTINE: So when you play the
game of who would play you

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.450
in a movie, did you ever think
it would be Reese Witherspoon?

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.540
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.380
I never did.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.840
I never could think of an
answer to that question.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.235
CHRISTINE: Now you know.

00:11:22.235 --> 00:11:22.700
You don't even have to--

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.520
CHERYL STRAYED: Now I know.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:23.940
It's really--

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.590
CHRISTINE: --play the
game anymore.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.720
CHERYL STRAYED: Isn't
that interesting?

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.070
Yeah.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.360
So it'll be Reese.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.850
CHRISTINE: Well, let's talk
about the book a bit.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.270
So, the book is about
your memoir of

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.465
your hike up the PCT.

00:11:34.465 --> 00:11:37.370
It's 1,000 miles, three
months alone.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.770
You were 26 at the
time, right?

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:39.310
CHERYL STRAYED: Um-um.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.700
CHRISTINE: And, to me that's
just a startling undertaking.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.160
And I hear that lots of women
are now being inspired to do

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.280
this by themselves.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.990
But, one of the themes of the
book, one of the things that

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.440
you're open and honest about,
is that you were completely

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.860
ill prepared for it.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.200
So, I guess one of the things
that I think about is if you

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.850
were to do it again, would you
have done it differently?

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.590
Would you have planned
it differently?

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.610
Would you have thought
it through?

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.090
Would you have gone
with a group?

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.630
Are there things about the hike
that you would have done

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.270
differently?

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.600
CHERYL STRAYED: Well, I
certainly would not have gone

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.840
with anyone.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.860
I think that being alone was a
really important piece of it.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.530
And I still love to
travel alone.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.150
I love to do things alone.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.180
You just exist in the world in
a different way when you are

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.280
by yourself, whether you're
a man or a woman.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.500
And I do think that there's
something about solitude,

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.740
especially in wild places,
that you go

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.010
into a deeper solitude.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.280
And also that when you're
by yourself, you

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.510
have to rely on yourself.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:42.042
You have to literally carry
your own weight.

00:12:42.042 --> 00:12:44.150
You are the beast of
your own burden.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.700
And I think that was an
incredibly powerful thing for

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.920
me at that moment in my life.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.890
I think it would be a powerful
thing for me at any moment in

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.830
my life, but I think
particularly then.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.070
And as far as preparing, I
mean one of things that's

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:58.520
interesting--

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.100
I've been really thinking
about this 'cause this

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.020
question comes up a lot--

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.500
I did so much preparation
before my hike.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.040
I had to pack those boxes.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.110
I had to dehydrate food.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.270
I had to figure out these little
Podunk stops along the

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.240
way and calculate how long it
would take me to get them.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.450
CHRISTINE: And there
was no Google then.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.290
CHERYL STRAYED: And there
was no-- that's

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.960
what I was gonna say--

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.980
and there was no Google.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.200
And, so I think a lot of times
people say, oh, you were so

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.020
ill prepared.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.750
They're forgetting the
world of 1995.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.420
I was on the PCT when somebody
for the first time explained

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.330
to me what email was.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.400
And I could not understand
what she was saying.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.260
And I remember saying, so you're
sitting there at your

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.750
computer and then a letter
appears on the screen?

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.130
And she was like, yeah, it's
kind of like that.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.120
And I was like, that seems
totally weird.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.790
The other thing is I was also
on the PCT the first time I

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.990
heard of a cell phone.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.830
So those of you who have read
the book, the guy Albert who

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.640
was like this Eagle Scout who
helps me lighten my load and

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.110
like finds the condoms and all
that, this guy, he was like

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.920
Mr. Lightweight.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.810
But he did have this huge brick
of plastic with numbers

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:06.940
on the front.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.800
And I said, what is this?

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.570
And he said it's a stupid
thing that I have been

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.860
carrying now for 500
miles now, and I'm

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.670
gonna dump it here.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.630
It's a thing called
a cell phone.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.450
And this company had found out--
that was like trying to

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.040
make these early cell phones--
had found out he was taking

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.070
the PCT and wanted him
to carry it to see--

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.440
and he'd have to turn
it on once a day to

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.700
see if he got reception.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.910
And he'd never got reception.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.110
And he's like, I'm not
carrying this.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:38.100
And I remember us sitting around
this campfire and the

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.270
absolute consensus without any
question was this is a product

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:48.340
that is never gonna fly because
who would want to walk

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.330
around with a phone in their
pocket all the time?

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.300
I mean, who would want--

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.650
I mean, right?

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.610
Which is so funny now,
'cause I'm like--

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.305
CHRISTINE: That's like 15 years
ago we're talking about

00:14:57.305 --> 00:14:57.580
at this point.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:57.900
CHERYL STRAYED: I know.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.850
CHRISTINE: Like that's
amazing.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:59.060
CHERYL STRAYED: I know.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.560
That's what's so
crazy about it.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.920
So the world changed
really quickly.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.400
We could Google--

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.390
I mean, I swear I think I use
Google like 500 times a day.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:07.670
CHRISTINE: We all do.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.570
CHERYL STRAYED: We all do.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.150
We could have hundreds, maybe
thousands of trail

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.650
journals, in a snap.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.040
People now, they blog
from the PCT.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.350
I have tweeted on my iPhone
from the PCT.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.570
Different world then.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.000
Like my communication with the
world is if you wanted to get

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.550
in touch with me, you'd write
a letter to a post office

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.300
where you thought I might be
in a couple weeks and write

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.530
general delivery, Cheryl
Strayed and the

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.410
town and the zip code.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.000
CHRISTINE: Which is interesting
because that's the

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.003
way that we would have
communicated for hundreds of

00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:37.050
years before--

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:37.400
CHERYL STRAYED: Hundreds
of year.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:37.950
CHRISTINE: -that.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.680
And in a mere 15, 16 years--

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.040
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.525
CHRISTINE: --at this point,
it's utterly changed.

00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:43.840
CHERYL STRAYED: It's
totally different.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.860
And I remember, I bought
that guidebook at

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.450
REI, the PCT guidebook.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.780
And I went to the Minneapolis
Public Library because I

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.520
wanted to read more
about the PCT.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.122
And they didn't have any
other books about it.

00:15:54.122 --> 00:15:54.950
And that was it.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.580
That was the end
of my research.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.940
The piece of it that you're
right about that I didn't

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.800
prepare physically.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.900
I mean, I don't know,, drinking
a lot, doing heroin,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.720
sleeping with a lot of guys.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.000
It's not really a great
preparation for--

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.250
CHRISTINE: Not the
best training.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.710
CHERYL STRAYED: So I did that.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:14.960
So that was a mistake.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.960
I wouldn't recommend
those things.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.690
And I also just didn't know
how hard it would be.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.660
I had this idea of being
in the wild.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.220
And I had been a day hiker.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.460
And I thought, well, it's
kind of like that.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.900
But it's not like that.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.960
It was much harder and much
more remote than I

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.110
thought it would be.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.460
But having said that, I don't
think I would do anything

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:38.820
differently.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.300
I would get better
boots that fit.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.550
And I would take fewer things.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.070
But I'm glad in retrospect
that I had exactly the

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.580
experience I did because I'd
learned the hard way, and all

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.730
the best things I've learned
the hard way.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.570
Because the thing about that
is you never forget then.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:01.470
And, I think I needed to have
a sort of reckoning.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:08.420
And, I suffered the consequences
of all of my

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.329
decisions on the trail.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.284
And that was an incredibly--

00:17:11.284 --> 00:17:11.720
CHRISTINE: In a very, very--

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.510
CHERYL STRAYED: --empowering
experience, in a really

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.250
physical way.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.369
CHRISTINE: Right.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.329
I guess I've heard you say in
other forums that putting

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.530
yourself through the physical
pain sort of helped you cope

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:21.990
with the emotional pain.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.920
And, I don't know what the
question is here, but that's

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.250
very, I think, powerful.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.329
And to understand that, I mean,
I think that's something

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:31.400
I do in my life is that you
focus on something else so

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.510
that the other things can
process behind you.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.880
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.870
CHRISTINE: Which is cool.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.484
CHERYL STRAYED: I think
that that's true.

00:17:37.484 --> 00:17:40.680
I think, too, one of the
things I maybe didn't

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.180
consciously realize at the time
is that I was creating my

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.250
own rite of passage.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.090
We don't really have this
in our culture.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:48.850
And we all know--

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.600
I mean, some of you in the
room are in your 20s, but

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.400
those of you who have gone
beyond those years know that

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.450
even if things had been going
really well for me, even if

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.250
I'd had like a great father and
a mom who didn't die at 45

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.010
of cancer, all of these
different things that sort of

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.990
combined to get me at that place
in my life of despair

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.740
that I was at, I would
still have had to

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.400
figure out who I was.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.320
And I would still would have had
to figure out what path I

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.160
was gonna take and also
how to survive and

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.390
thrive on that path.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:27.510
Because I was choosing a path
of the writer, which can be

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.930
seen sort of as an illegitimate
path for quite a

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:30.860
number of years.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.960
I was a waitress, and I'd say,
well, I'm a waitress but I'm

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.710
really a writer.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.280
And people, they scoff at that
or they roll their eyes or

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.010
they're when are you gonna get
a real job, all of that stuff

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:44.120
you have to endure when you have
taken that other path.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:50.060
And so I needed to go through
some sort of rite that would

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.990
take me to that next place
of growing up.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.090
And I needed to heal.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.850
I needed to heal all of that
stuff that you mentioned.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.320
And so I think I didn't
know quite what I was.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.960
Like I said, I didn't know
what I was getting into

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.560
physically.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.950
But once I was out there, I
realized it was very physical

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.870
and it was exactly
what I needed.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.310
I was suffering on the inside,
and suddenly I forgot about

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.150
those things because I was
suffering so much physically.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.430
CHRISTINE: One of the things
I think that's really

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.720
interesting about this book
that I've realized only in

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.205
retrospect and when you talk
about the rite of passage it

00:19:22.205 --> 00:19:26.370
brings it up to me is that I
think your memoir is very much

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.210
sort of a female archetype
story, like sort of a feminine

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.560
superhero in some ways.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.390
I mean, you did this
rite of passage.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.150
You were doing it on your own.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.470
And you're sort of creating your
own archetype or tapping

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:44.380
into an architect that isn't
necessarily out there for a

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.180
female archetype.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.390
It's something that you see in
a lot of male role models.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.300
And that's more what you touch
on in popular culture.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.450
But, you were doing this as a
woman, and there wasn't a lot

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:55.280
out there that time.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.090
And so I think to me it's
interesting that you--

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.490
I guess my question to you is
did you consciously write with

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.470
that archetype in mind?

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.400
Because to me this is also
just your story.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.140
And this is just something
that you did.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.350
But at the same time you are
tapping into those themes.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.820
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.830
I teach memoir writing
sometimes.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.620
A lot of people, when they first
began to write creative

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.040
nonfiction or memoir, stories
from their lives, they'll come

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:29.440
to me and say, well, you know my
son died or I spent a year

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.050
in France or I climbed Mount
Kilimanjaro after surviving

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:37.140
breast cancer, whatever
story they have.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.990
And they're impulse is to write
that story because they

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.010
had the experience and the
experience was dramatic or

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.710
traumatic or adventuresome or
whatever, any of those things.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.140
And I always say, the experience
isn't enough.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.560
We've all had traumas and
dramas and adventures.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:00.060
And there's a difference between
having a great dinner

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.500
party conversation about an
experience you had and writing

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.860
a great book or writing
a great essay.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.530
And the difference is the
consciousness you bring to

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:10.250
bear on it.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.430
Well, first of all it's
the writing craft.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.230
You have to actually know how to
write sentences that people

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.510
want to read.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.950
But then--

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.426
CHRISTINE: Which you do
really, really well.

00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:21.360
CHERYL STRAYED: Oh, thank you.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.490
But then, what consciousness
are you bringing to bear?

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.110
What awareness?

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.660
What does this thing mean?

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.520
For years, I didn't write
about my hike on the PCT

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.620
because I had nothing to
say really about it.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.650
If I met you, we could talk
about it and it would be a

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.970
nice conversation.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.920
But until I really had something
to say in the realm

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.510
of art which is, I think,
is a bigger undertaking.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.770
What did my hike really
mean to me?

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.330
And what can it possibly
mean to you?

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.210
And if you're ever reading a
book and you're thinking,

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.600
well, why the hell am I reading
about this woman's

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.660
dad's death, I think
that writer hasn't

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.730
really done her job.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.680
Because, I think when you read
personal stories that do that

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.780
thing where they transcend--

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.210
which means to move from one
realm to the other, to move

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.260
from me to you--

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.260
is that they've obliterated
that question in your mind

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.220
because you recognize yourself
in the work, even if the life

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.460
you're reading about
is profoundly

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.170
different than your own.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.250
And so, lot of times people say,
well, you took the hike

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.450
in '95 and the book didn't
get published in 2012.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.650
Why did you wait?

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.100
And the answer is
I did not wait.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.320
I wrote the book as soon as it
was time to write the book.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.730
And, I didn't write the book
'cause I took a hike.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.660
A lot of people have taken
longer, better hikes than me.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.170
I wrote the book because
I'm a writer.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.180
I wrote the book because I
finally realized I'd reached a

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.050
place in my own life that I
understood that I could

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.380
actually tell this story in a
way that had a consciousness

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.210
of those layers that we're
talking about.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:23:00.040
Which brings me to your
question about

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.540
the heroine's journey.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.130
And I did.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.620
I wrote with great consciousness
and awareness of

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.900
the long tradition of
the hero's journey.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.320
And it's almost always
been male.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.370
But I decided that I was
part of that, too.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.790
I didn't write a
book for women.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.500
I wrote a book for people.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.420
And I wanted my stories
to resonate with

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.380
both men and women.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.090
And so I just decided to
essentially look at those kind

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:33.660
of deep mythologies of somebody
who goes off into the

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.540
darkness, off into the wild
darkness, has to slay a bunch

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:42.275
of demons and dragons and then
returns different, changed.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.350
And so, when I was able to think
about my own journey

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.810
within that context, I was
able to write "Wild." It

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.740
wasn't like I sat down and said,
well, I'm gonna tell the

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.610
hero's journey.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:24:00.660
But it was in the cells of my
creative mind when I was

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.970
writing the book.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.150
I was aware of it.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:09.760
I was aware of basically the
woman versus nature, the

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.030
hero's journey, all of those
different elements of the

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.130
story that are there.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.870
CHRISTINE: One aspect I think of
the hero's journey that is

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.610
common to literature is that
some event has to kick it off,

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.390
something has to create it.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.500
And it's all part of
the mythology.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.000
One thing that stood out to me
when I read this book with my

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.640
book club was the figure of your
mother, who obviously is

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.440
an amazing woman.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.800
But you have a passage, like
near the very end, of two

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.070
pages of minor faults
of your mom.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.350
And other than that, it's almost
all glowing praise.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.250
And I wonder if you feel that by
writing this you've sort of

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.590
mythologized your mother
or changed her

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.240
character in some way?

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.340
I don't know.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.210
CHERYL STRAYED: That's
a great question.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.840
So for those of you who haven't
read the book, what

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.900
she's referring to is there's
this time a couple months into

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.440
my hike when I realize it's
my mom's 50th birthday.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.505
And, I'm furious.

00:25:01.505 --> 00:25:03.570
My mom's been dead like 4.5
years at this point.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:07.490
And I'm furious with my mom for
the first time because she

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.160
doesn't get to turn 50.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.150
And, as I'm hiking--

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.430
and I did this in my
journal, too--

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:18.610
this mother who was so beloved
to me and so--

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.390
I did idolize her and
mythologized her.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.080
I loved her so fiercely that
to even think one negative

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.950
thought hurt my heart.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.060
But on this day for whatever
reason, I'd reached a place

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.010
where I finally could
be mad at my mom.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.520
And I listed everything
that she had

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.880
done wrong in my childhood.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.740
I listed all of the things that
I didn't like about her

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.150
or that I think that she
shouldn't have done or she

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.440
should have done better.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.880
And, I think that was a really
important thing for me

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.750
personally in my life.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.300
My mom died at this--

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.760
I was a senior in college.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.600
I was at this moment in
my life where I had

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.620
full license really.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.240
It was developmentally
appropriate for me to be kind

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.420
of rejecting my mom or angry
with my mom or assessing her

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.520
with a critical eye.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.680
And she died in the
middle of that.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.830
And so I was robbed of
that experience.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.470
And so I think what happened
was I was doing it then.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.040
But when I was writing "Wild"
all those years later when I

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.240
had completely forgiven my
mother everything, it was so

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.410
painful for me to write that
chapter because I thought,

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.020
well, I can't possibly keep
this in the book because I

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.850
don't want you all to hate my
mom-- oh, my mom smoked pot in

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.750
front of me sometimes-- and
that I didn't want to be

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.700
judgmental or whatever it was.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.980
And then my editor said, no, you
really need to keep this

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.790
in here because it's
important.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.180
It actually makes us
love your mom more

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.410
because she's human then.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:38.430
She's not a myth.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:44.920
So, I don't think I've idolized
my mom in my work.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.540
I did have an incredibly
good mom.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:53.970
My mother was a really
powerfully loving person.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:58.110
And she did mothering
really well.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.810
My brother and sister would
say the same thing.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.850
My brother and sister have very
different lives than me,

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.260
but we all always knew that we
were really loved by our mom.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.970
And I think that
that's probably

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.370
what matters the most.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.440
But she was human.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.920
And she did all these
things that were

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.710
probably mistakes, too.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.350
And I think that more than
anything, that's been the

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.640
strange experience around my mom
is how many people now are

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.130
aware of my mom.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.940
My mom who was not remotely
a public or

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.640
famous person at all.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.410
She was just like a very
ordinary person who had a very

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.660
ordinary life.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.760
Thousands of people
know her now.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.053
CHRISTINE: It's great.

00:27:40.053 --> 00:27:40.915
CHERYL STRAYED: Isn't
that crazy?

00:27:40.915 --> 00:27:41.810
CHRISTINE: That's an
amazing thing.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.200
CHERYL STRAYED: I mean, really
in some ways it's like I

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.910
brought my mom back to
life through my work.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.510
Like the one thing I want
the most is my mom.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.690
And I've made her like
live again in my

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.560
work over and over.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.230
CHRISTINE: Well, I think
including the passage on the

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.050
faults I think your editor was
absolutely right because other

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.340
than that she would
have just been a

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:01.880
different type of archetype.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.296
CHERYL STRAYED: A saint.

00:28:02.296 --> 00:28:05.710
CHRISTINE: Yeah, a saint or the
other role in the sort of

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.570
hero's journey, something
that--

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.400
a saint, you know, something--

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:10.670
CHERYL STRAYED: Right.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.620
CHRISTINE: --you can't
really relate to.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.426
And by putting in those faults
that, frankly, I read them and

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:16.126
I was like minor.

00:28:16.126 --> 00:28:16.552
CHERYL STRAYED: I know.

00:28:16.552 --> 00:28:16.978
CHRISTINE: But--

00:28:16.978 --> 00:28:17.404
CHERYL STRAYED: Me too.

00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:20.840
But what's funny about the minor
faults-- but don't you

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.370
remember when you're like in
your early 20s and you're like

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.200
even the little things you can
hold against your parents.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:26.500
CHRISTINE: Oh.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.930
That's what parents
are for, right?

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.580
CHERYL STRAYED: That's
what parents are for.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.090
And so, I didn't have parents
from that age on.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:36.110
And so I have no one to blame
for any of my shit.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.710
CHRISTINE: It's all on you.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:37.120
God.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.162
CHERYL STRAYED: It
was all on me.

00:28:38.162 --> 00:28:39.370
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:43.280
CHRISTINE: And literally, like
with monster, your backpack,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.140
the backpack that you carry is
something like 75 pounds.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.070
Did you ever weigh it?

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.360
CHERYL STRAYED: I didn't.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.580
The one thing I didn't bring out
there with me is a scale.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.800
I brought everything else.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.540
But some newspaper
just decided--

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.200
I read a story recently, they
said it was like 50 pounds.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.460
It wasn't 50 pounds.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.800
I could totally lift
50 pounds.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.480
It was really heavy.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.760
I couldn't lift it at
all the first--

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.920
I mean, I couldn't lift it.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.515
Literally, I mean I had to
get it on my back, but--

00:29:09.515 --> 00:29:11.180
CHRISTINE: I grew up backpacking
with my dad.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.500
And I read you packing it
in the beginning and I--

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.480
oh no, no.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.230
You don't need that.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.380
You don't need that.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.680
It just sounded so
painful, so.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:19.860
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.770
I would say it was
at least 75.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.850
Just the first day alone, just
the water, was 24.5 pounds.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:26.210
OK.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.820
So that was just the water.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.100
And, 'cause I started my hike
in the Mojave Desert.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.360
And I'm from Minnesota--
so here's maybe lack of

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.160
preparation--

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.410
and I'm like, you know, there
are lakes everywhere, right?

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.270
I mean, I'm from the land
of 10,000 lakes.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.380
Turns out, Mojave Desert,
hardly any lakes.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:40.780
CHRISTINE: Yeah.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.560
CHERYL STRAYED: And--

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.760
CHRISTINE: It's weird
about deserts.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.010
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.020
It's a really funny thing.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:49.390
Well, and I write about this
in "Wild", too, the way I

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.340
didn't really understand what
a mountain was and what a

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.330
desert was.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:56.450
And I think you can even live
here maybe and not totally

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:57.135
understand.

00:29:57.135 --> 00:29:59.440
You have a different
understanding of the world

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.960
when you are on foot.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.830
One of the things that would
always happen to any of the

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.180
backpackers if we would run
into people who would be

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.760
driving past in a car and you
ask them ever for like

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.610
directions to anything, they
would always say, oh, it's

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.750
just right down the road.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:16.920
It's just right there.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.030
And then they'd drive away.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.950
And you'd be like walking for
10 miles to this thing.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.380
And your perspective's different
when you're in a car

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.460
then when you're on foot.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.770
And when your on foot, you
actually see the world.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.310
I mean, you really see
in a very close up

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.140
fashion what it is.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.000
And so that was a really

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.360
fascinating part of the journey.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.140
CHRISTINE: One of the things
that I think is another

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.940
consistent theme in the book is
how much kindness and just

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.470
help you get strangers.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.360
Was that something that you
would have expected?

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.150
And what do you think
it is that caused

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:49.320
people to be so kind?

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.450
CHERYL STRAYED: It's really a
huge part of trail culture.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:55.260
And it's true across
any long trail.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.370
And I know this because I've
experienced it many times, but

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.840
also all of the different
backpackers who have read

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.650
"Wild" say that's exactly
how it is out there.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:08.280
And I think is that when you're
out there doing this

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.680
thing and you meet other people
who are doing this

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.140
thing, you're in it together.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.430
And there's this wonderful--

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.210
it doesn't matter if you like
have different religious

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.580
beliefs or political beliefs
or totally different lives

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:23.530
back home, there's this sort
of kinship and energy about

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.220
being in this together.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.140
And also, you're the
only game in town.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.210
Like if you need help and I'm
the only one there to give it

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.460
you to, I'm gonna give it
to you, and vice versa.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.980
And so that happened
over and over.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.780
And it really is a wonderful
experience.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.550
If your faith in humanity
ever flags, just get a

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.940
backpack and go hiking.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.270
I promise you, you will
be met with kindness.

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.330
Unless you do meet the one
serial killer, I mean.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.910
CHRISTINE: Well, I was always
expecting that.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.570
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:56.610
Except once in awhile.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.640
I mean, that's the other thing
people always say, well, the

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.950
fear thing.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:00.630
CHRISTINE: Especially
as a woman.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.000
I think that's--

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.850
CHERYL STRAYED: As a women.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.160
CHRISTINE: --pretty
remarkable that--

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.450
CHERYL STRAYED: Right.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.770
CHRISTINE: Well, your motto
on the trail was--

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.550
CHERYL STRAYED: I
am not afraid.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:06.130
CHRISTINE: I am not afraid.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.200
I am not afraid.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.640
And do you think that was
specifically because

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.185
you're a woman or--

00:32:10.185 --> 00:32:10.640
CHERYL STRAYED: Yes.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.100
CHRISTINE: What was it?

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.490
CHERYL STRAYED: Yes.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:13.080
Absolutely.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.210
Though a lot of men would be
afraid to go sleep in the

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.020
wilderness, too.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.900
But, I was plugged into
everything we're all plugged

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:25.940
into in terms of the narrative
about violence against women.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.080
And I mean, those
things are true.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.620
But what I decided to really
rely upon was reason.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.910
And that is, it would be more
dangerous for me to live in

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.760
Portland or Minneapolis that
summer than it would be for me

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.080
to go walk a wilderness trail.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.300
You know, the chances were--

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.690
just like any of us right now,
I mean, chances are nothing

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.550
bad is going to happen to us
today, but something might.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.460
And it doesn't always have
to do with where you are.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.780
You could be in the
wrong parking lot

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.450
in the wrong apartment.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.750
You could be on the wrong trail
at the wrong moment.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.910
And I don't mean to
make light of it.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:01.060
I mean certainly people have had
bad things happen to them

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.250
all over the place.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.940
But what I just decided to do
was say, look, was I gonna let

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.950
this tiny little chance of
something bad happening to me

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.200
stop me from doing this
incredible thing?

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.830
And the answer was no.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:19.300
And so then what I had to do is
just manage my inner voice.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.360
I think so much of life is
managing your inner voice.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.620
And I had to say, OK, when
that voice says, well,

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.040
something bad is gonna
happen, I would just

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.060
say, no, I'm not afraid.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.250
I'm gonna do this.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.360
And it was really helpful.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.880
It kept me going.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.910
CHRISTINE: It's the
mantra, you know.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:35.580
CHERYL STRAYED: That's right.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.020
And no harm came to me.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:37.750
No harm came to me.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.650
CHRISTINE: It's like chanting
Reese at your candle.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.110
CHERYL STRAYED: That's right.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.360
Reese.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.320
I didn't chant Oprah.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.280
I didn't even dream of Oprah.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.180
CHRISTINE: How could
you dream of Oprah?

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.160
And one of the things I saw--

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.130
so, Oprah revived her book
club just for "Wild."

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:54.640
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.680
CHRISTINE: And I saw it in
another interview that you

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.870
just picked up your cell
phone one day--

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.680
your cell phone that--

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.960
CHERYL STRAYED: It's a
pretty hot cell phone

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.430
I have there with--

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:04.460
CHRISTINE: And you answered
and it's,

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.870
hello, this is Oprah.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:06.630
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:07.070
CHRISTINE: It's quite
an experience.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.130
CHERYL STRAYED: It's true.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.260
It was an experience.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.526
CHRISTINE: And I can't imagine
that the person that you were

00:34:13.526 --> 00:34:16.170
at 26 walking the trail, I can't
imagine would have had

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:19.880
even the possible inkling that
that could have happened on

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.215
the other end.

00:34:21.215 --> 00:34:21.820
CHERYL STRAYED: None
of this is--

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.650
Yeah.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.630
It's really nutty.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.960
So my cell phone rang, and I
think a lot of times-- and I

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.330
thought this, too, before this
happened to me, that there was

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.770
this whole sort of marketing
wizard committee who tells

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.670
Oprah what book she's
gonna pick.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.080
And, the reverse is true.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.889
I mean the only person--

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:42.909
the only two people who knew
that Oprah was gonna revive

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:45.780
her book club for a little
period of time

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.460
there was me and Oprah.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.620
Oprah got my book
just on her own.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.670
Read my book.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:51.750
Loved it.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:55.090
Asked the editor of O magazine
who she knew had interviewed

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.440
me for a piece about "Wild",
'cause "Wild" kind of came out

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.620
like the month before.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.500
And she said will you give me
Cheryl Strayed's phone number.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.710
And the editor said sure.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.610
And Oprah called me.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:11.040
And, we just had this great talk
about the book, when I

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.560
wasn't shrieking and saying
things like, are you fucking

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.575
kidding me?

00:35:15.575 --> 00:35:18.550
I said fuck to Oprah.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.590
And then she's like,
I have this idea.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.090
I just want everyone
to read it.

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.330
How about I restart
the book club.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.880
I was like OK.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.000
CHRISTINE: If you insist.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.490
CHERYL STRAYED: And we
got off the phone.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:31.400
And she said, well, now my
people are gonna call your

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.800
people and we'll work
all this out.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.980
But you have to not tell anyone
until everything's

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.380
worked out and I make
the announcement.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.580
And so she was like, will you
come to my house this week?

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:43.390
I said sure.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:44.340
So we shot this thing.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.470
But she said but you have to
keep it a secret until I

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.200
announce it.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.350
So there were like seven weeks
where I knew and my husband

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.800
knew, but I couldn't
tell anyone.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.610
And it was just terrible,
because also--

00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:01.430
meanwhile, "Wild," I was on my
book tour and meeting people.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.150
And everyone kept going,
you know, Oprah would

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:05.080
really like this book.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.260
I'd be like, you think so?

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.450
And I had to like pretend.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.580
And it got the point where I
was getting so like waiting

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.860
for this news to come out that
even every time I thought the

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.760
word Oprah--

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.915
and especially because my editor
and all the people at

00:36:16.915 --> 00:36:20.130
my publishing house were like,
you cannot say anything to

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:21.680
anyone 'cause if this
comes out, the whole

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.060
thing could go away--

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.240
and so it got to the point were
every time I even thought

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.900
the word Oprah just silently
in my head, I felt like a

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.150
sniper was gonna shoot
me, you know.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.230
And I couldn't even tell my kids
because I knew if they

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.480
said the word Oprah, everyone
knows who Oprah is.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.860
But I did have this funny
Oprah thing in January.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.740
I just got on a plane.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.770
I was flying to Santa Barbara.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:48.680
And she lives there.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.850
And I was gonna talk
that night.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.960
So I text her and said you
know I'm gonna be--

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.850
CHRISTINE: You text Oprah?

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:53.665
CHERYL STRAYED: We do.

00:36:53.665 --> 00:36:55.900
Oprah is really sweet.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.650
She's very texty.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.710
And anyway--

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.230
I said, hey, I'll be in
Santa Barbara tonight.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.450
If you want to come to
my talk, let me know.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.980
She texted me.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.720
And I'm sitting on the runway
on this plane right before

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.830
they're saying turn off
your cell phones.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.770
And she texted me back and
says I'm in Texas.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.540
I'm about to interview
Lance Armstrong.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.550
So I can't be there.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.600
And I was like, I'm asking
her about this.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.565
And the flight attendant comes
by to tell me to turn off my

00:37:22.565 --> 00:37:24.610
cell phone just as a text
from Oprah comes in.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.530
And her name is like Oprah
on my cell phone.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.910
And the flight attendants says,
wouldn't that be funny

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.160
if it were the real Oprah?

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.710
And I was kind of like, what
makes you assume it isn't?

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:37.702
But, no.

00:37:37.702 --> 00:37:39.525
I just laughed and said, yeah,
it would be totally hilarious.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.820
Oprah's really exact-
she's so sweet.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.630
Have you guys ever had Oprah
come to a Google Talk?

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:48.420
CHRISTINE: Maybe we should.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.695
CHERYL STRAYED: You could lure
her with a nice lunch.

00:37:49.695 --> 00:37:51.280
CHRISTINE: There we go.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.000
Well, so one of the things that
happened to you over the

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.600
last couple of years is the
explosion of fame, basically.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.950
And you've become this
household name.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.530
You've had these associations
with all these interesting

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:04.300
famous people.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.580
And my question for you is how
you manage to maintain the

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.590
boundaries between your life and
the way that all of these

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.620
other people want something from
you now, both the outside

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.250
world in terms of publicity and
excitement and just people

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.840
that I would imagine crop up in
every dark corner seeking

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.230
your incredible advice
at this point?

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:28.200
CHERYL STRAYED: I think that
that's an answer I'm still

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.480
trying to figure out.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.350
I mean, essentially this past
year or so has been like

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:38.150
holding on really hard to
a very fast rocket ship.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:42.240
And my husband and I have two
kids who are seven and eight.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.000
And in so many real ways--
people are like how is your

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.720
life different?

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.650
In so many real ways essentially
that like the

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:53.520
things that are actually very
important in my life--

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.840
what I think of makes up the
heart of my life, my family

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.750
and just that my three cats and
my two kids and my husband

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:04.500
and that daily thrum--

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.860
is very much the same except
it's been disrupted by me

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.640
traveling so much.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.210
But it's true that now I do.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:11.720
I occupy like a different space

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.020
professionally than I ever have.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.270
And on top of that, the work
I do causes people to feel

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.030
really connected to
me personally.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.630
CHRISTINE: Or maybe even
entitled that they know you, I

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.050
guess, because you are so
raw in your writing.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:26.950
CHERYL STRAYED: And that's
a beautiful thing.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:29.360
I mean, it's allowed me to
really feel connected to other

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:29.900
people, too.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:35.360
I was saying earlier that I just
feel that so many people

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.110
have experienced the book and
then like come to me with

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:42.030
really open hearts and shared
profound stories with me.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:44.830
I don't think there's
ever been--

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.050
I know there hasn't been a day
in the last year that I

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.520
haven't received countless
emails that really tell me

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.260
just the most beautiful stories
about people's lives.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.170
And I feel so grateful for that
and so lucky about that.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.470
And yet, yeah, I'm trying
to figure out how to--

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.960
I can't give that
much every day.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.430
One of the places I have to go
to as a writer where the

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:15.240
energy lives is in solitude,
in blocking out the world.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.610
And so, I'm thinking I'll move
into that space this summer.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.340
I'm hoping to kind of
pull back from some

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.400
of this public stuff.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.330
But I really think it's any of
the big changes in my life--

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.300
my mother's death, the
birth of my children,

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.830
and then this success--

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.290
I would say that those were
times where my life just

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.280
shifted pretty seismically.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.460
It took some time for me to
figure out what it even was,

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.700
what it even meant.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.085
And so I guess I'll find
out down the road.

00:40:44.085 --> 00:40:44.810
CHRISTINE: Get your footing
eventually.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:45.860
CHERYL STRAYED: Or
down the trail.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.260
CHRISTINE: Right.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:46.900
Down the trail.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.240
Up the trail.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.570
CHERYL STRAYED: Up the trail.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:49.390
Yeah.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.510
Are we gonna answer
some questions?

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:51.290
CHRISTINE: I think we
are supposed to.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.368
And I think we were supposed
to start those

00:40:52.368 --> 00:40:53.040
five minutes ago.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:53.240
So.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.370
CHERYL STRAYED: OK Who
has questions?

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.510
My feet are OK.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.730
My siblings are OK.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.650
My ex-husband did not
object to the book.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:02.590
He loved it.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.690
Those are some common
questions I get.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:04.906
AUDIENCE: Hi Cheryl.

00:41:04.906 --> 00:41:05.560
I'm Heather.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.680
I love all your work.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.045
CHERYL STRAYED: Thank you.

00:41:07.045 --> 00:41:08.590
AUDIENCE: I have so many
questions, but I'm gonna

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:09.860
narrow it down to two.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:10.660
CHERYL STRAYED: OK.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:14.070
AUDIENCE: One is what is the
best piece of writing advice

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:15.380
you've ever gotten?

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:20.140
And the second one is after
writing "Wild," have you

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.820
connected with a lot of
the characters whom

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.310
you met on the trail?

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:23.930
CHERYL STRAYED: Yes.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:28.030
So, I'll answer the first first,
or the second first.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.380
Pretty much everyone
in the book has

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.330
come out of the woodwork.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:34.230
I've had so many fun experiences
with people who I

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.680
wrote about in the
book who show up.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.870
I'll look out and they're
in the audience.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:40.930
And some of those people I had
actually connected with them

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:41.810
when I was writing the book.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:42.880
But because--

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.840
that's the other thing-- so
because I met these people

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.250
before really the age
of the internet--

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.920
I know the internet was
around then, but only

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.860
Al Gore was on it--

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.090
but--

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.140
were any of you on the
internet in 1995?

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.540
Probably you guys were.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.920
You're like--

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.520
I wasn't.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:03.130
You were different, but-- and
you still are different.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.810
But it wasn't like we exchanged
email addresses.

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:07.330
Nobody had an email address.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.050
And so if your name was Roger
Smith, I was never

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.400
gonna find you again.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.650
And so some people I could find
them when I googled them.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:16.890
I could track down people while
I was writing the book.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:20.550
And I would always ask them
their memories of when we met,

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.990
and also if in the book they
wanted me to use their real

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.110
name or change their name.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.820
And different people said
different things.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.690
But, yeah.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.020
So it's been really
fun to reconnect.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.910
One of the funnest experiences,
I did an event in

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:33.540
LA last summer.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.010
And there was an elderly
gentleman in the front row.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.080
And every time I looked up, he
kept sort of making a funny

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:40.920
face at me.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.731
And so finally I just stopped
in the middle of the action,

00:42:42.731 --> 00:42:44.080
and I was like what
do you want?

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.910
And he said, Cheryl, it's Ed.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:50.010
And it was Ed who was the
trailing angel at Kennedy

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.725
Meadows, one of the
first guys I meet.

00:42:51.725 --> 00:42:53.980
And he feeds me at
his encampment.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.350
And it was there that I also
lightened my load and went

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.500
through my pack and got rid
of a bunch of stuff.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:03.230
So Ed in LA last summer, he
opens up his bag and he pulls

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:08.200
out my foldable saw that I had
taken with me on the PCT and

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.620
left, and he took it.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.820
And he's like, every time I see
this saw, I think of you.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.110
And now it's like famous because
I wrote about it in

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:15.030
"Wild."

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.340
So he gives it to me.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.080
And I realized that I was
on my book tour and

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.460
just doing carry on.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.170
TSA won't let you take a saw.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.320
So I had to give
it back to him.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:25.960
But it was so funny.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.580
It's probably now for sale
on eBay or something.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.760
But, so that was fun.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.000
And I connected with all
kinds of other people.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.010
And the best piece of writing
advice, I think that one of

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.070
the things that is really
true about being a

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:40.540
writer is it's hard.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.000
It's hard like all the time.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.420
Like when I sit down to
write the next book,

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.660
it's gonna be hard.

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.980
And it was hard for
me when I was 22.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.400
And it was hard for
me when I was 32.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.460
And it's gonna be hard
for me when I'm 72.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:56.570
It's always this incredible
sort of vulnerable,

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:57.670
scary leap of faith.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.240
Am I gonna write something
that you're all

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.752
gonna want to read?

00:44:01.752 --> 00:44:03.540
And how can I even guess that?

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.080
I don't know.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.520
I can only forge ahead.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.960
And so, I think that especially
early on--

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.520
now I've gotten all these
rewards and praise, I can kind

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.760
of ride on the steam of that.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.530
But back there--

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:21.940
imagine me back there in my 20s
and early 30s when a lot

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.730
of the feedback was when are
you gonna get a real job?

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:27.470
And what if it doesn't work?

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:30.260
And then I look up and I'm 40
and I've been working as a

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.050
waitress and trying this
writing thing.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.550
What if it doesn't work out?

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:35.820
And that's what I mean when I
was saying I had to redefine

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:41.740
what success was in order
to have success.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.540
And, one of things
I did last fall--

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.940
have any of you heard
of the Do Lectures?

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.400
You should go to the Do
Lectures sometime.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.730
It's like the hippie
Ted Talks.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:55.590
But it's in Mendocino County on
this beautiful vineyard and

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.520
say in tee pees.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.140
You sign up for this weekend.

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.150
And, it's just this
amazing thing.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.560
You just like drink wine and eat
amazing food, and then all

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.810
day sit around listening
to these speakers.

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.640
And they're speakers from all
walks of life, CEOs of

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.970
companies, people like
me, chiefs of

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:14.550
Native American tribes.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:16.280
And they stand up and they
tell their story.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.360
They have like 20 minutes
to tell their story.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.980
So they asked me to come.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.060
And I sat there listening.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.510
I was the final speaker.

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:25.730
And so it was two days
of talks, lectures.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:28.620
And I sat there and listened
to everyone's lecture.

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.250
A woman who founded an
orphanage in Nepal.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:30.930
I mean really.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:31.860
All the people--

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.470
a guy who makes these
fancy shoes.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.895
The guy from Blue something
Coffee in San Francisco.

00:45:36.895 --> 00:45:37.280
The founder of --

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:39.120
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.990
And they all tell their story.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.480
And they're all incredibly
successful people.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.410
And the whole story was like
a path of their failures.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.950
And that was so fascinating
to me because all of their

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.640
successes were built on a string
of failures from which

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.760
they decided to learn
from them.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:59.730
And instead of giving up on that
thing then, they either

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:02.120
worked harder or they took
a different path.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.520
But they used their failures
as successes.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.350
And I think that that's
what a career in the

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:09.990
arts looks like, too.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:14.760
And so my best advice is to keep
the faith and stick with

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.850
it and just surrender, surrender
to the idea that you

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:22.380
don't know what the outcome's
gonna be.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.060
You don't know.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.540
And so what you need to keep
faith with is the thing that

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:30.200
you control, which is how much
heart you give something, how

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.290
much effort you give
something, how

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.881
much work you commit.

00:46:33.881 --> 00:46:34.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.576
I was really excited
to see the email

00:46:36.576 --> 00:46:37.510
that you were coming.

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:39.350
I just saw that on Monday
on the food discussion.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.910
I don't know how I ended
up on the food one but.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:44.340
I'm actually leaving Google on
Friday to hike the PCT this

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.425
year with my boyfriend.

00:46:45.425 --> 00:46:46.613
CHERYL STRAYED: Oh, really?

00:46:46.613 --> 00:46:47.066
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:47.066 --> 00:46:49.430
So it was like perfect timing,
you're here 'cause--

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.780
CHERYL STRAYED: Oh my gosh.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.720
--I only have three days left.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.780
My one question for you is I
have only gotten to the part

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.210
of the book where you
were in [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.770
Meadows and the boy scout
dad had to leave

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.350
with Giardia or something.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:46:59.740
CHERYL STRAYED: Right, right.

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:00.520
Yeah.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.573
AUDIENCE: But, I know there was
a moment before that where

00:47:02.573 --> 00:47:04.660
you felt like quitting
and somehow you kind

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.650
of persevered so.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:07.380
And I'm afraid of the unknown.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.580
I know this is gonna
be really tough.

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.300
My backpack is not gonna be
a monster, think goodness.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.730
CHERYL STRAYED: That'll
make a big difference.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:16.231
And you're going, did you say,
with your boyfriend?

00:47:16.231 --> 00:47:16.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.580
This has been his passion and I
kind of got sucked into it.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.856
CHERYL STRAYED: Men are
superb pack animals.

00:47:20.856 --> 00:47:23.150
This is-- yes.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:24.890
AUDIENCE: So my question is at
those times when you felt like

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:27.900
really quitting, how did you
get past that so you could

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.160
keep moving? 'Cause I think
I'm mentally tough, but I

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.080
don't even know what I'm getting
myself into yet, and

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:33.960
I'm terrified.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:34.690
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:40.960
Well, I will say that the three
hardest things that I've

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.200
ever done, I would say, hiking
the PCT, giving birth

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.390
naturally to my two children,
and writing books.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:53.540
And all of those things at many,
many, many steps along

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.950
the way I felt like quitting.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:48:00.140
And so I think it might be
helpful to just go in knowing

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.740
that you are going to feel
like quitting at certain

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.770
points and just talking to
yourself ahead of time and

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.550
saying, well, but I'm
not going to quit.

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:09.770
And also just to acknowledge
that misery

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:12.580
is part of the deal.

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.220
You don't go on a long
backpacking trip and then have

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.300
it be every day feels good.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.970
Sometimes it's gonna be
searingly hot or terribly cold

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:25.220
or raining or you're gonna want
some real food and all

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.530
you've got is dehydrated
beans, or any number of

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.560
things-- your feet
are hurting.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.250
And so that's going
to be part of it.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:32.230
It's kind of like--

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:35.665
and the reason I compare it to
birth is my friend just gave

00:48:35.665 --> 00:48:37.410
birth and she said, it
was so much harder

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:38.990
than anyone told me.

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:40.950
And I was like, well, you should
have asked me because I

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.540
would have told you.

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:48.024
If you go in going, well,
I'm gonna try not to--

00:48:48.024 --> 00:48:50.120
I'm gonna maybe-- it's
like, well, no.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.880
You've got to be like determined
because it's going

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.340
to be really hard.

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:54.780
And same with writing a book.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:59.670
It's like you're going to want
to stop writing your book.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:03.230
And so you have to make
room for that.

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:05.950
Don't enter into the journey as
if it's going to be always

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:09.020
like sunshine and you're singing
what a beautiful

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:13.670
morning with your boyfriend
and eating Cliff bars.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:15.940
And then the times when it's not
miserable, it's gonna be

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.230
so profoundly magnificent that
you are gonna feel like the

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:20.430
luckiest person ever.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:24.560
And I don't even know you, but
I'm pretty sure that this will

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.420
be one of the best things
you've ever done.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.530
AUDIENCE: This kind of memoir
especially, what it's like to

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.190
be in your 40s and look back at
yourself when you're in the

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:36.420
20s and at that time.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.590
I think I would have
so much empathy for

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:39.690
myself at the point.

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:42.730
And I remember reading your book
thinking about like you'd

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.430
open your box and there'd
be like $20.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:45.960
And I'm like, no.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.100
CHERYL STRAYED: I know.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.516
AUDIENCE: I remember 20 like
thinking-- or in my mid-20s--

00:49:48.516 --> 00:49:49.120
thinking, OK, I can get by.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.120
It's OK.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:50.500
CHERYL STRAYED: Right.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.110
AUDIENCE: Like, what do you
think of your 20-year-old self

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.890
when you look back?

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:57.980
CHERYL STRAYED: I think that's
such a great question.

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.400
And somebody pointed this out to
me pretty early on which I

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.440
think is accurate.

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.800
He said that he loved that I
wrote about myself on one hand

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.710
in a very--

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.100
I didn't let myself off.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.590
Like, I totally revealed
negative things as well as

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:15.540
positive things.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.520
But I also wrote with a lot of
compassion and love for my

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.220
younger self.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:23.150
And I think that it was because
the older me was

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.470
looking back at that
younger me.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:29.780
And I could see from a long way
away very clearly some of

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.300
the mistakes I made.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:34.490
But I also could for the first
time figure out like well why

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.710
did I do that thing?

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:40.360
Like one of the things that was
clearly a bad idea, for

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:45.250
example, was using heroin, like
just a really bad idea.

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.350
Don't do it, kids.

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:50.840
But I understand why
I did it actually.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:54.050
Like the older me could actually
say I understand how

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.790
it made sense within
the context of that

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:57.160
moment of my life.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.900
I was young and in pain.

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.340
And I was looking for
something to take

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.160
me away from that.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.610
I was looking for attention.

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:07.790
That's something I would've
never admitted in my 20s, but

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:09.600
I totally was.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.050
It was like a cry for help.

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:13.450
So I'll just do something really
bad and dramatic so the

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:15.550
people who love me will
notice and help me.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.810
And that's exactly
what they did.

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:19.910
My husband, my ex-husband,
helped me.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.670
My friends helped me.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.600
And, it doesn't make sense,
but it's like what I did.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.200
And so I could look back on it
now with this perspective and

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.720
say, well, you know you
dumb kid, but it's OK.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.950
And so I sort of wrote it
from that perspective.

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:36.660
And I also just shook my
head a lot and just

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.540
thought what an idiot.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.480
And also so many of the
things that I--

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.980
there are all these pages and
pages in my journal of just

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:50.830
how sure I am at the age of 26
that nobody will ever love me

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.290
again, and I will never
love again, that I'm

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:54.810
just a ruined woman.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.810
Which is so silly,
but I do remember

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:58.710
feeling that way at 26.

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:02.400
And I was like who gets
divorced at 26?

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.650
And what's so funny now in my
role as Dear Sugar, I have so

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:08.390
many letters from people in
their 20s who have had that

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:09.350
first big break up.

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:10.640
And they're convinced
it's over.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.790
And I'm just like, it's only
just begun, honey.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.370
I couldn't see that then.

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.480
So I see that now.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.050
So it was just I got to look
back at myself from a wiser

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:22.380
and more loving--

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.850
like as if I were
my own mother.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:28.730
It's always interesting to me
that some of the haters--

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.020
you can Google them--

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.140
this one guy wrote, Cheryl
Strayed is essentially a

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.490
mental cripple and a slut.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.820
I mean that's actually
a quote.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.520
If you Google mental cripple
and slut, I'm not kidding.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.420
Google mental cripple and slut,
it'll come to me, or to

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.290
this guy's blog post about me.

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:48.830
And one of the things that I
find fascinating when people

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:51.990
criticize me about those things,
I just think, my god,

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:53.620
were you never young?

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.110
Did you never make
any mistakes?

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:58.850
Did you never sleep with the
wrong person or 10 of them, or

00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:00.340
whatever the case may be?

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.010
And I'm always amazed by that.

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:05.300
I think that's a lonely
life, actually.

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:08.480
AUDIENCE: So, given all of your
experience that you had,

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.010
going forward now that you have
two kids, do you feel

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:13.840
like you're going to be the
most forgiving, excepting,

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.280
loving, empathetic mom when your
kids turn into teenagers

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.800
and then their 20s?

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.740
Or do you feel like, I don't
know, I'm still a mom?

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.270
CHERYL STRAYED: Yeah.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.620
Well, I'm just planning that
my children will be perfect

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.580
and never make a mistake.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.490
But, no, I'm teasing.

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:32.250
That is something that's
really interesting.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.840
I get asked a lot like what
have you told your

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.810
kids about your book?

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:40.790
And, I've told them like the
g-rated version of "Wild",

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:41.880
because they're seven
and eight.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.390
I mean, that's the version
they should get.

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.780
But as they get older, what
parts of my life will

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:46.670
I share with them?

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:48.410
Will I tell them about
my experience

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.540
with drug use or whatnot?

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:54.300
And, I'm not exactly sure how
my husband and I are gonna

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.220
approach that quite yet.

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.720
We're talking about that because
it's like pretty soon.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.150
We got to think about it.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.660
That's right.

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.440
Well, they can.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.050
I think that they won't.

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:05.000
I think my kids won't read the
book until they're grown ups.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.220
That's just my sense.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.680
Just because I think a lot--

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.420
the kids of writers
often like, OK,

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.280
that's just too much.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.830
Like they don't want to
get too involved.

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:14.700
But when they're older,
they will.

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.650
But I think that what I hope
to do , as I hope to always

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.050
bring into every relationship
I have, and probably most

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:25.480
significantly into my
relationship with my kids,

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.030
everything that I've learned and
that I know along the way.

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:34.720
And I certainly hope that they
don't have as traumatic a

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.730
teenage and early 20s
years as I did.

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:46.120
But, I feel like I want to be
there to support them no

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.100
matter what happens.

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:51.460
And one of things I want to say
about that is I return to

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.210
my mom's love.

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:55.110
So even though I got sort of
lost along the way and did

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:58.970
some things I regret, I do think
that actually what saved

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:01.810
me was everything that
my mother had given.

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:05.640
So that in some ways, even
though my mother's death

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.010
caused me to go off course, it
was my mother's life that

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:11.160
provided me with the
confidence to get

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.890
myself back on course.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:14.700
The primary thing-- and I wrote
this in "Wild"-- the

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:19.845
primary failing that I felt
acutely when I decided to hike

00:55:19.845 --> 00:55:23.190
the PCT is that I had not become
the woman my mother

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:24.360
raised me to be.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.900
And so I was hearkening back to
the values that I knew were

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.880
really my own, and also the
deepest way of honoring my mom

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:33.540
would be to be that woman,
to become that person.

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.220
And so I just had to find my
way back to that person.

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:40.570
And so, I know that I love
my kids in that same way.

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:43.540
And so I hope that will provide
whatever foundation

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.660
they need when they're lost,
because they probably will be

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.150
at some point, right.

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:50.900

coming today.
