00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.430
Consider the function F of X is equal to
the natural log of X squared.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.100
Let L of X be the local linearization of F
at A is equal to E.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.720
What is a rule for L of X?

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.922
Let's just make sure we understand what
they're asking for, and I've copied and

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:21.450
pasted this exact exercise on my little
scratchpad so we can work through it.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.330
So, let's just visualize what f of x looks
like.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.090
And what l of x is.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.630
What the local linearization, if we are
centering it at x equals e.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.603
If we're saying that there's the set, when
they say

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:40.320
a that's just a convention for what are we
approximating around.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.030
What the locality, what the x value that
we are approximating around.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.950
So lets just, let me grab some points here
just to visualize f of x.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.662
So let's say this is 1, this is 2, this

00:00:52.662 --> 00:00:56.230
is, actually let me spread them out a
little bit more.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.810
So this is 1, this is 2, this is 3.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.420
F of 1 is gonna be 0.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.820
The natural log of 1 squared is just 0.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.910
And let's see, we could think of F of

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.910
E, and that's actually where we're
centering our linearization.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.380
We're gonna think about values in that
locality.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.030
So E is roughly right over here.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.890
E is right, roughly right over here.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.176
And F of E is equal to natural log of

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:28.070
E squared is, well, that's just going to
be 2.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.027
So this is going to be, you're gonna have
1 and 2 and so, this is also

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:39.220
going to be a point on the graph and it's
going to look something like this.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.350
Gonna look something, something like that.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.960
That's what, that's the graph of Y is
equal to F of X.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.030
y is equal to f of x.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300
Now, what do they mean when they say the
local,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.390
the local linearizaton of f at a, is equal
to e.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480
Well the convention here, is they use the
letter a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.220
when they're talking about, when they're
talking about local linearization.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.050
Say okay, this is what we're approximating
around.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.640
So this our a value right over here.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.400
So we're essentially just gonna think
about the slope of the tangent

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.650
line at that point, or this point E comma
F of E.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.160
So the L of X is going to describe, L

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.560
of X is going to describe this line right
over here.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.294
So this is, this right over here, is Y is
equal to L of x, but we write it in a

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:33.661
way that is well suited for local
linearization, for approximating

00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:38.850
the value of the function around, well,
for x values around e.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.190
So what do we mean by that?

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.700
Well, the general way of describing L of x
say

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.820
that L of x is equal to the function
evaluated.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.187
At that point that you're centering around
at a, at a, so

00:02:53.187 --> 00:02:56.920
it's going this, it's going to be this
value right over here.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.184
Plus the slope of the tangent line today,
plus the slope of the tangent line

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:07.755
today times how far, times the difference
between

00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:10.790
the x value that you're approximating and
a.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.050
And once again why does this make sense?

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.162
Well let's say that you're trying to

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:17.970
approximate half of this value right over
here.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.260
So the function evaluated there would be
right over there, but we want to use

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.810
the local linearization, so we essentially
want to say, what is l of this x value?

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.550
So we want to figure out what is this
right over here.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.180
Well you start at f of a, which is this.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.410
And then you multiply, or to that, you add

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.260
the slope times the difference between
these two values.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.270
X minus a is this distance.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.330
You multiply that times the slope, that's
gonna give you your change in y.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.840
So your change in y, plus this y right
over

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.930
here, is going to give you the y value of
that.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.470
Right over there.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.120
So this could be useful for approximating,
let's

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.720
say you want to approximate what, what
the, what

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.330
the natural log of e plus 0.2 squared is,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.100
and so this could, could be, could be
valuable.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.450
But let's just work through this for this
particular case.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.960
We know that, so we're saying that a is
equal to e.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.410
So let's replace, this should be e, this
should be e, and this should be e.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.399
And now what is f of e?

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.910
Well this is this right over here is the
natural

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.680
log of e squared and now whats f-prime of
e?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.320
Well let's just calculate that down here.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.740
So f-prime of x we can just use the chains
rules.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.550
It's the derivative of the natural log of

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.190
x squared with respect to x squared, so
that's

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:48.120
going to be 1 over x squared, times the
derivative of x squared with respect to x.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.290
So times 2x and so this is going to be
equal to 2 over x.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.722
So f prime of e is going to be two over e,
and

00:04:57.722 --> 00:05:03.608
then times x minus e so that's, that's our
rule, our definition for l

00:05:03.608 --> 00:05:08.021
of x and lets see which one of these lets
see which one of

00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:13.780
these oh and of course we can simplify the
natural log of e squared.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.405
The power that have to raise e to get to

00:05:15.405 --> 00:05:18.270
e squared, well this is of course equal to
2.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.230
So 2 plus 2 over e times x minus e.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.000
So 2 plus 2 over e times x minus e.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.080
It's that choice right over there.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.730
But just to make it clear, how this could
be useful, let's say that we're trying to

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:38.603
approximate, we're trying to approximate f
of e plus 0.1.

00:05:38.603 --> 00:05:41.850
So, we're trying to approximate that.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.663
Now, like if I just put e plus 0.1 and I
squared and I have

00:05:44.663 --> 00:05:46.386
to figure out the natural log of that

00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:49.450
without a calculator, that seems hard to
me.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.210
But now we can use a local linearization.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.020
This is going to be approximately equal to
2 plus,

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.840
2 over e, times, well what's e plus 0.1,
minus e.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.300
Well it's just gonna be 0, 0.1.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.261
And I guess you probably still need a
calculator to figure this out,

00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:14.150
or you could just leave it here, anyway
this is a pretty good approximation.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:22.250
For what the natural log of e plus 0.1
squared is going to be equal to.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.960
And let's just, let's just check our
answer.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.680
So, it is that one right there.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.980
And we got it right.
