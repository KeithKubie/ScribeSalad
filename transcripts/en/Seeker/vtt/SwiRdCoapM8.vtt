00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.020
This is your brain.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.590
This is your brain on love.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:17.760
Yeah, I'm sure there are questions.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.930
Love is a HUGE emotion, it pulls information
from our senses of sight and smell, our experiences

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.320
throughout our life and hormones are flying
through the body affecting our attachments

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.550
our feelings and our reactions.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.210
All this is driven by your brain; it controls
everything you are.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.720
Scientists know this, so they wanted to scan
people experiencing love.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.510
Functional magnetic resonance imaging looks
at how blood is flowing through your brain

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.690
to determine blood oxygenation, and therefore
what parts of the brain are working hardest.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.140
In 2005, the American Physiological Society
looked at the brain of 17 men and women who

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.390
were "newly and madly in love."

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.699
Looking at brain scans, they found activity
in their brains' motivation, reward and "drive"

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.559
aspects far more than emotions or sex.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.830
They say, "romantic love engages brain systems
associated with motivation to acquire a reward,"

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.120
which is to say a match for reproduction and
genetic compatibility.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.590
That pairing elicits the emotions of euphoria
and happiness!

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.590
I.E.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.590
Love!

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.580
But the question scientists kept asking is,
how does LOVE show up in your brain?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.970
When the APS researchers used fMRI's on the
participants they found romantic love activated

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.280
the right side of the brain, and activates
areas related to subcortical reward systems;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.750
while facial attractiveness activated mostly
in the left hemisphere.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.750
But a new study in Frontiers of Neuroscience
scanned 100 men and women who felt a range

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.500
of love-related emotions.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.181
This new research found as love progresses,
the activity in the brain changes the structure

00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:46.640
of the brain itself.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.910
People who were "in love" reflected earlier
studies.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.470
Activity showed up in "reward, motivation,
and emotion regulation as well as social cognition."

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.090
On the other hand, the longer they were out
of love, the lesser activity they had in each

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.140
of those areas!

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.860
Being in love seems to change how our brain
works and organizes itself for everyday behavior,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.300
not just "love" stuff.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.090
This is the first time brain structures have
been shown to change for those "in love" and

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.450
those who have "ended love."

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.480
Of course, this is just a cross-sectional
study.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.230
Ideally the researchers would follow the participants
and see how their brains changed over the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.590
years they were in and out of love.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.859
Knowing the neurological activity behind love
helps us comprehend how love serves to draw

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.680
us to ideal mates for genetic and reproductive
reasons.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.680
But in the end, we'll need a lot more information
to know why such a complex hormonal and neurological

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.170
dance is performed.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.230
This new research mirrors the way other animals
seem to experience love, which might make

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.769
it seem cheaper… but outside of stories,
movies and music… what is love?

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:58.480
We're still figuring that out.
