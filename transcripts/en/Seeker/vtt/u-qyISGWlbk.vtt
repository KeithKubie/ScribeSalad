00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.070
Have you been in a GPS fight with someone
in the car?

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.840
We need to listen to the GPS!!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.800
No we don’t I know where we’re going just
read the signs!

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.620
I love my GPS, sometimes to a fault.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.190
And now ... scientists know exactly what’s
going on inside our brains when we rely on

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.759
navigation apps to guide us from point A to
point B.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.150
*We* go on autopilot.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.849
In the UK, volunteers underwent a series of
simulated tests while fMRIs captured their

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.769
brain activity.

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.460
Participants were shown movies of where they
were, given a goal of where to go, and then

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.290
told to either make a left or a right to reach
their end destination.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.899
When the volunteers were navigating on their
own -- without GPS -- researchers noted spikes

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.579
of activity in the hippocampus, which is involved
in memory &amp; spatial navigation; and in the

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.559
prefrontal cortex, a key area for planning
and decision making.

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.550
Then, when the participants *were using GPS
… the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.100
went completely inactive.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.269
This told the researchers that, when GPS does
the thinking and planning for you, your brain

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.880
basically checks out.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.720
Using the hippocampus is super important,
because we suspect it stores mental maps,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.360
sort of like our brain’s very own GPS.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.250
It help us remember where we’ve been and
where we’re going in 3-dimensional space.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.470
The hippocampus helps us picture what's in
front of us, and the prefrontal cortex helps

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.330
us decide which way we should turn.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.210
These findings corroborate another study which
found that when we rely on GPS, we stare at

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.600
our screens way more and disengage from the
outside world.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.150
Do you remember what it was like to drive
before GPS?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.990
We had to work hard to pay attention to our
surroundings, assemble pictures in our heads,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.270
remember landmarks, roads, intersections and
… we had to improvise quicker routes all

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.310
on our own.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.750
We had to actually, like…

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.750
USE A MAP.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.070
MADE OF PAPER.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.420
And that requires a whole other set of skills!

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.890
But when we rely on GPS, we’re focusing
more on the blue lines and dots on a screen

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.630
than on the journey itself.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.920
Visualizing our environment through spatial
orientation is a natural ability we all have,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.340
but it’s a use it or lose it type of skill.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.000
And It’s relevant not just for driving … we
use spatial orientation in our daily jobs,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.350
home life, and in all sorts of other tasks.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.630
Plus, flexing our hippocampi can keep our
brains alert and active!

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.251
Keeping your brain active can help protect
it from future cognitive impairment due to

00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.540
afflictions like Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.870
So… think about it.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.700
If your GPS told you to drive straight into
the Pacific Ocean, would you do it?

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.310
That’s exaclty what happened to tourists
who found themselves ankle deep in ocean water

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.590
after being mislead by their GPS device.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.620
This just shows HOW MUCH we switch into autopilot.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.730
There’ve been plenty of anecdotal hints
that our mechanical co-pilots encourage us

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.620
to chuck common sense out the window.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.630
There are cases of people being lured into
lakes, off bridges, down hiking trails and

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.930
into the desert by a soothing robotic voice.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.990
(Mine’s got a Australian accent.)

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.400
There’s even a phenomenon called Death by
GPS!

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.800
Literally, people following their GPS into
peril.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.800
Sure, satellite navigation is incredibly convenient
and comforting, it takes the guesswork out

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.800
of navigation.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.400
But, don’t let a little fear of the unknown
deter you from strengthening your prefrontal

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.650
cortex and hippocampus!

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.209
It might be a good idea to get lost on your
own for a change.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.280
I don’t think I’ll stop listening to my
Australian copilot anytime soon.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.730
What about dogs and cats and birds?

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.840
How do they find their way around town without
their own GPS?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.980
Julian knows the way.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.520
You can watch it here.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.380
Are you gonna stop using GPS and give your
brain a workout?
