00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I’ve talked a lot about observing the night
sky with your eyes; just simply going out

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.370
and seeing what you can see. It’s pretty
amazing what you can learn just by doing that,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.469
and of course that’s all we humans could
do for thousands of years.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.680
But now we can do better. We can use telescopes.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.930
The first person to invent the telescope is
lost to history; despite “common knowledge,”

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.930
Galileo did not invent them. He wasn’t even
the first person to point one at the sky,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.260
or the first person to publish results! But
he was a loud and persistent voice over the

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.789
years, and his amazing string of discoveries
using his crude instrument landed him firmly

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.249
in the history books. Aggressive self-marketing
sometimes pays off.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.480
You might think the purpose of a telescope
is to magnify small objects so we can see

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.199
them better. That’s how a lot of telescopes
are marketed, but to be honest that’s not

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.869
exactly the case. If you want to be really
general, the purpose of a telescope is to

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:06.439
make things easier to see: To make the invisible
visible, and to make the things already visible

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.810
visible more clearly.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.729
A telescope works by gathering light. Think
of it like a bucket in the rain: The bigger

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.479
the bucket, the more rain you collect. If
your bucket is big enough, you’ll get plenty

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.630
of water even when it’s only sprinkling
out.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.090
In the case of a telescope, the “bucket”
is an optical device like a lens or a mirror

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.950
that collects light. We call this device the
objective, and the bigger the objective, the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.109
more light it collects. Look at your eyes…
well, that’s tough, so let’s think about

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.809
our eyes for a moment. They also work as light
buckets, but they only collect light through

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:40.389
our pupils, which even under the best of
circumstances are less than a centimeter across;

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:42.040
a very tiny bucket indeed.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.390
But we can do better. To extend the analogy,
a telescope is like a bucket with a funnel

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.619
at the bottom. All that light that it collects
is then concentrated, focused, and sent into

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.759
your eye. It turns a trickle of light into
a torrent.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.079
The amount of light it collects depends on
the area of the objective. That means if you

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.350
double the diameter of the collector, you’d
collect four times as much light, because

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.780
the area of the collector goes up as the square
of the radius. Make a bucket 10 times wider,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.250
and you collect 100 times as much light! Clearly,
as telescopes get bigger their ability to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.010
show us faint objects increases enormously.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.879
In fact that was one of Galileo’s first
and most important discoveries: Stars that

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.069
were invisible to the naked eye were easily
seen through his telescope, even though it

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.299
only had a lens a few centimeters across.
Those faint stars didn’t emit enough light

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.699
for his eyes to see them, but when he
increased his collecting area with a telescope,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.020
they popped into visibility.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.470
The primary way telescopes work is to change
the direction light from an object is traveling.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.640
I can see a star with my eye because light
from that star is sent in my direction, into

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.569
my eye. But most of that light misses my eye,
falling to the ground all around me. The telescope

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.000
collects that light, bounces it around, and
then channels it into my eye.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.269
When the very first telescopes were built,
this changing of the direction of light was

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.989
done using lenses. When light goes from one
medium to another – say, from going through

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.110
air to going through water or glass – it
changes direction slightly. You see this all

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.680
the time; a spoon sitting in a glass of water
looks bent or broken. The spoon is doing just

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.349
fine, but the light you see from it is getting
bent, distorting the image. This bending is

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.730
called refraction.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.290
The way light bends depends on what’s bending
it (like water or glass) and the shape of

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.420
the object doing the bending. It so happens
that if you grind a piece of glass into a

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.530
lens shape, it bends -- or refracts -- the
incoming light in a cone, focusing it into

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.860
a single spot. It’s a light funnel!

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.040
This refraction has a couple of interesting
results. For one thing, the light from the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.030
top of a distant object is bent down, and
the light from the bottom is bent up. When

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.189
this light comes to a focus, it means you
see the object upside-down! It also flips

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.610
left and right, which can be a little disconcerting,
and takes getting used to when you’re using

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.769
a refracting telescope.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.860
For another thing, the lens can magnify the
image. That’s again because the light is

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.569
bent, and the image created of object observed
can appear larger than the object does by

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.950
eye. It depends on a lot of factors including
the shape of the lens, the distance to the

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.220
object, and how far away the lens is, but in the
end what you get is an image that looks bigger.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.740
That has obvious advantages; a planet like
Jupiter is too far away to see as anything

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.989
other than a dot to the eye, but a telescope
makes it appear bigger, and details can then

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.360
be seen. When Galileo and other early astronomers
pointed their telescopes at the sky, multitudes

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.360
were revealed: Craters on the Moon, the phases
of Venus, Jupiter’s moons, the rings of

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.910
Saturn, and so much more. The Universe itself
came into focus.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.350
When astronomers talk about using a telescope
to make details more clear, they use a term

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.920
called resolution. This is the ability to
separate two objects that are very close together.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.630
You’re familiar with this; when you’re
driving on a road at night a distant car coming

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.630
toward you appears as a single light. When
it gets closer, the light separates out — resolves

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.980
— into two headlights.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.970
A telescope increases resolution, making it
easier to, say, split two stars that are close

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.820
together, or to see details on the Moon’s
surface. The resolution depends in part on

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.580
the size of the objective; in general
the bigger the telescope objective

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.100
the better your resolution is.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.060
Resolution is more useful than magnification
when talking telescopes. Fundamentally, there

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.320
is a limit to how well your telescope resolves
two objects, but there’s no limit to how

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.280
much you can magnify the image. If you magnify
the image beyond what the telescope can actually

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.980
resolve, you just get mush.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.640
Refracting telescopes are great, but they
suffer from a big problem: Big lenses are

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.910
hard to make. They get thin near the edge,
and break easily. Also, different colors of

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.530
light bend by different amounts as they pass
through the lens, so you might focus a red

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.160
star, say, and a blue one will still look
fuzzy.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160
No less a mind than Isaac Newton figured a
way around this: Use mirrors. Mirrors also

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.260
change the direction light travels, and if
you used a curved mirror you can also bring

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.570
light rays to a focus. Telescopes that use
mirrors are called reflectors.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.970
The advantages of reflectors are huge: You
only have to polish one side of a mirror,

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.650
where a lens has two sides. Also a mirror
can be supported along its back, so they can

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.030
be manufactured much larger more easily and
for less money. Although there have been many

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.080
improvements made over the centuries, most
big modern telescopes at their heart are based

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.990
on the Newtonian design, and in fact no large
professional-grade telescopes made today have

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.730
a lens as their objective. Nowadays, it’s
all done with mirrors.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.580
And that brings us to this week’s aptly
named Focus On.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.340
The most common question I’m asked (besides,
“Hey, who does your hair?”) is, “Hey,

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.170
Phil, kind of telescope should I buy?”

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.220
It’s a legitimate question, but it’s very
difficult to answer. Imagine someone walked

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.370
up to you and asked, “What kind of car should
I buy?” That’s impossible to answer without

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.710
a lot more information.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.250
Same for telescopes. Do you want to look at
the Moon and planets, or fainter, more difficult

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.870
to spot galaxies? Are you really devoted to
this, or is it more of a pastime? Is this

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.440
for a child or an adult?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.310
These questions are critical. Most small ‘scopes
are refractors, which are good for looking

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.910
at detail on the Moon and planets (they tend
to magnify the image more than reflectors

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.930
do). But they’re tricky to use because they
flip the image left and right and up and down.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.710
Bigger ‘scopes are good for fainter objects,
but are more expensive, and can be difficult

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.360
to set up and use. I hate hearing about a ‘scope that
just collects dust because it was bought in haste.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.440
So here’s what I recommend: Find an observatory,
planetarium, or local astronomy club. They’re

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.660
likely to have star parties, public observing
events, where you can look at and through

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.690
different kinds of telescopes. Their owners
are almost universally thrilled to talk about

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.460
them — as an astronomer, I can assure that
the problem with astronomers isn’t getting

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.840
them to talk, it’s shutting them up — so you’ll get
lots of great first-hand advice and experience.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.660
Also, I usually recommend getting binoculars
before a telescope. They’re easy to use,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.960
fun to use, easy to carry around, and you
can get good ones for less money and still

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.030
see some nice things. Even if you decide not
to get more into astronomy as a hobby, they

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.750
can also be used during the day on hikes and
for bird watching. I have a couple of pair

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.520
of binoculars and I use them all the time.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.030
There’s a third aspect to telescopes that’s
very important, beyond resolution and making

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:55.020
faint things easier to see. They can literally
show us objects outside of the range of colors

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.280
our eyes can see.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.900
In the year 1800, William Herschel discovered
infrared light, a kind of light invisible

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.940
to our eyes. In the time since we’ve learned
of other forms of invisible light: radio,

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.430
microwave, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma
rays. Astronomical objects can be observed

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.170
in all these flavors of light, if we have
telescopes that are designed to detect these

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.930
flavors of light. Radio waves pass right around
“normal” telescopes, ones that we use

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.060
to observe visible light. X-rays and gamma rays pass
right through them as if they aren’t even there.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.120
But we’re smart, we humans. We learned that
giant metal dishes can and will bend radio

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.690
waves, and can be formed just like gigantic
Newtonian mirrored telescopes. In fact, different

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.259
forms of light need different kinds of telescopes,
and once we figured out how, we’ve built

00:08:36.259 --> 00:08:39.930
‘em. We can now detect cosmic phenomena
across the entire spectrum of light, from

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.639
radio waves to gamma rays, and have even built
unconventional telescopes that detect subatomic

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.000
particles from space as well, such as neutrinos
and cosmic rays. Because of this, we have

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.220
learned far more about the Universe than Galileo
could have imagined.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.460
And we’re in the midst of another revolution,
too. The actual biophysics is complicated,

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.259
but in a sense our eyes act like movie cameras,
taking pictures at a frame rate of about 14

00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:04.639
images per second. That’s a short amount
of time. Photographs, though, can take far

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:09.649
longer exposures, allowing the light to build
up, allowing us to see much fainter objects.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:14.529
The first photographs taken through a telescope
were done in the 1800s. This has led to innumerable

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:19.519
discoveries; for example, in the 20th century
giant telescopes with giant cameras revealed

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:24.589
details in distant galaxies that led to our
understanding that the Universe is expanding,

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:27.800
a critically important concept that we’ll
dive into later in the series.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.459
And now we have digital detectors, similar
to the ones in your phone camera, but far

00:09:32.459 --> 00:09:37.790
larger and far more sensitive. They can be dozens
of times more light-sensitive than film, able

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.339
to detect in minutes objects that would’ve
taken hours or more to see using film. These

00:09:42.339 --> 00:09:47.029
digital cameras can also be designed to detect
ultraviolet light, infrared, and more. We

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:51.860
can store vast amounts of that data easily
on computers, and use those computers to analyze

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.009
that huge ocean of information, performing
tasks too tedious for humans. Most asteroids

00:09:56.009 --> 00:09:59.720
and comets are discovered using autonomous
software, for example, looking for moving

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.259
objects among the tens or hundreds of thousands
of fixed stars in digital images.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.960
This has also ushered in the era of remote
astronomy; a telescope can be on a distant mountain

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.960
and programmed to scan the sky automatically.
It also means we can loft telescopes into

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.639
space, above the sea of air in our atmosphere
that blurs and distorts distant, faint objects.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:22.389
We can visit other worlds and send the pictures
and data back home, or put observatories like

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:27.660
the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit around the Earth
and have it peer into the vast depths of the Universe.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.180
I would argue that the past century has seen
a revolution in astronomy every bit as important

00:10:32.189 --> 00:10:36.339
as the invention of the telescope in the first
place. In the early 17th century the entire

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:40.779
sky was new, and everywhere you pointed a
telescope there was some treasure to behold.

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:45.819
But with our huge telescopes and incredibly
sensitive digital eyes now, that’s still true.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.319
We learn more about the Universe every day,
just as we learn that there’s more to learn

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:55.240
every day, too. That’s one of the best parts
of being an astronomer; the Universe is like

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.029
a jigsaw puzzle with an infinite number of
pieces. The fun never ends.

00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:05.480
And remember: Even with all the wonders revealed
by telescopes, your eyes are still pretty

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.009
good instruments, too. You don’t need big
fancy equipment to see the sky. The important

00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:14.240
thing is to go outside. Look up! That’s
fun too.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.749
Today you learned that telescopes do two things:
Increase our ability to resolve details, and

00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:23.949
collect light so we can see fainter objects.
There are two main flavors of telescope: Refractors,

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:27.790
which use a lens, and reflectors, which use

and with the invention of film, and later

00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:35.790
electronic detectors, we have been able to
probe the Universe to amazing depths.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.129
Crash Course is produced in association with
