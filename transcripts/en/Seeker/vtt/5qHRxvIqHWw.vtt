00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.450
You hear stories all the time about dogs that
trek hundreds of miles to find there way home.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:12.450
And then there’s me: lost in my driveway.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.270
Hello fellow travelers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.609
There are a number of animals that routinely
travel hundreds or thousands of kilometers

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:19.710
without a gps.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.830
Birds, whales, antelope.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.800
Heck even Monarch butterflies make a trip
from Canada to Mexico each year when winter

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.230
is coming and then find their way back north
again.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.759
How is it a little insect can do that while
siri yells at me for missing yet another exit?

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.000
For a lot of animals they take advantage of
the earth’s magnetic field.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.690
Recently it was discovered that dogs, foxes,
wolves and some primates have a protein in

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.970
their eyes that’s sensitive to magnetism.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.550
We think birds use this same protein to navigate.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.600
Other creatures like ants use smell to find
their way to food and then back to their nests.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.600
And monarch butterflies combine the position
of the sun with an excellent sense of timing

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.800
to stay on track.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.800
For many other animals though, their cartographic
prowess is a mystery, but they seem to make

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.570
a mental map and follow it much better than
most humans do.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.080
Researchers have been exploring just how well
we keep track of where we’ve been and where

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.300
we’re going and, spoiler alert: we’re
not very good at it.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.750
Neuroscientist William Warren of Brown University
had volunteers wear VR headsets and taught

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.060
them how to navigate a virtual maze.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.860
Once they familiar with the layout, they had
to navigate to a target by themselves.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.690
Half the time though, while navigating the
maze, the volunteers would unknowingly and

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.640
suddenly be warped much closer to the target.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.970
And none of them noticed.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.440
They got to the target faster and with fewer
turns than they should have, and nobody thought

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.530
anything was amiss.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.910
Basically, they didn’t form a mental map,
which would be bad in real world environments.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.540
Obviously no one will get transported all
of a sudden, but losing track of where you

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.570
are without realizing it could be disastrous.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.260
Another experiment using a good old fashioned
blindfold is called the triangle competition.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.680
Volunteers are lead blindly along 2 sides
of a triangle and then asked to complete the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.900
triangle and walk back to where they started.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.560
When Jack Loomis of UC Santa Barbara performed
this experiment, he found people got the turn

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.640
wrong by an average of 24 degrees, and usually
either underestimated or overshot the distance.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.549
So we have no sense of direction or distance.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:05.549
Great.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.049
How did we ever survive?

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.670
Actually it turns out our inability to form
a concrete mental map may actually be a benefit.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.420
It may have opened us up to traveling to new
places instead of following the same migratory

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.050
route year after year.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.040
We can travel farther and wider than any other
species, and indeed we have.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.090
That’s also because if our thoughts aren’t
grounded in the real world, then we can imagine

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.200
an unreal world.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.990
I don’t mean a discworld on the back of
a turtle, although that’s true too.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.680
But now we can form mental maps of intangible
places like the internet or the route to another

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.680
planet.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.140
It’s possible that our propensity for getting
lost is a more recent phenomenon.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.780
At some point in our evolution we may have
lost our intrinsic ability to navigate but

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.069
our smarts made up for it.

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.870
We learned to track the stars and make compases,
and we could use logic and experience when

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.290
we did get in a pinch.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.770
Since the invention of the GPS, we don’t
need to flex those mental muscles anymore,

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.770
and they could be starting to atrophy: younger
inuit hunters have recently adopted the modern

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.340
technology and have been getting lost when
it failed.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.709
Before this the inuits didn’t have a word
for lost.

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.500
Dozens of words for snow.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.100
No word for being lost.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.280
There may be a genetic component to sense
of direction too, because some tests have

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.599
shown that certain people just don’t get
better at navigating, even with practice.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.930
They may have inherited their parents inability
to navigate because their parents grew up

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.600
in a city and never wandered into the woods
and got eaten by bears.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.540
But like any muscle, It’s possible to work
it out: London cab drivers who have navigated

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.209
the city’s complex streets for years develop
larger hippocampi, the area of the brain associated

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.209
with memory.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.209
So there’s hope!

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.880
If you’re utterly hopeless, then you’ll
probably still need to rely on GPS.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.380

where you’re going, check out Anthony Carboni’s

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:54.590

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.070
So are you a fearless explorer or is the outernet
too confusing to bother with?
