00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.900
I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
Literature.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.459
So some of you might be familiar with Margaret
Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale from the

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.520
Hulu series starring Elisabeth Moss, which
is a great show.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.280
It’s especially enjoyable if your favorite
emotional experiences are fear, loathing,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.710
and waking nightmares.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.530
But the book is even better.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.830
Now, that’s not always the case--the movie
Die Hard was better than the book it was based

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.910
on; The Fault in Our Stars was a very good
film--but it is true of the Handmaid’s Tale.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.910
So read it!

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.580
OK, so last time, we discussed the historical
events that influenced Atwood as well as why

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.690
she characterizes her novel as speculative
fiction.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.960
Today, I wanna focus on the narrative’s
perspective--or perspectives.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.770
Although Atwood has said that she wanted to
write from a “female point of view,” and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.270
she obviously literally did that, I want to
discuss today whether there is a distinctive

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.540
or inherent “female” or “male” point
of view, outside of just narration, and also

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.550
why Atwood presents her final chapter from
the perspective of a male scholar.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.220
INTRO
The Handmaid’s Tale is set in the reproductively-challenged

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.970
Republic of Gilead, where fertile women are
forced to have babies with military Commanders.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.479
To maintain her sanity, Atwood’s protagonist,
Offred, engages in personal rituals, but also

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.180
connects with other women – like her college
friend, Moira and a fellow Handmaid named

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.180
Ofglen.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.180
But let’s face it.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.710
Offred’s life is terrible.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.920
Her husband and child have been taken away.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440
Her mother is missing.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.210
If she fails to conceive, she will be forced
to clean up toxic sludge.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.270
And worse, her Commander appears to be sterile.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.770
A handsy obstetrician offers to “help”
Offred conceive.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.960
(She declines.)

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.760
The Commander’s wife bribes Offred to mate
with the gardener/chauffeur, Nick. (which

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760
Offred accepts.)

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.670
Meanwhile, the Commander entreats Offred to
play Scrabble, to wear some (seriously) old

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.870
lingerie, and to visit a brothel called Jezebel’s.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.689
At Jezebel’s, Offred discovers that Moira
is working as a prostitute.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.710
And it’s from Moira that she learns of her
mother’s fate.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.440
Offred begins to lose her grip.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.659
When Ofglen asks her to become a spy for the
“Mayday” resistance movement, Offred drops

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:13.659
the ball.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.519
The Commander’s wife confronts Offred with
the (recently-worn) lingerie.

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.099
And right before the novel ends, Offred is
arrested.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.450
So, let’s talk about whether this narrative
is presented from a “female point of view.”

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.540
It’s a tricky question.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.720
The relationship between gender and narrative
has sparked decades of academic debate about

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.771
how sex (biological designation), gender (social
identity), and/or sexuality (orientation of

00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:35.389
desire) shape texts and their analysis.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.340
And I’m not going to resolve it today I’m
just going to try to introduce it to you.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.299
In the 1960s, the structuralist theorist,
Tzvetan Todorov coined the term “narratology”.

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.290
It’s a word accustomed to analyzing the
themes, and conventions and symbols of a text.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.459
Todorov argued that we should also be analyzing
the structure and function of narrative.

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.779
Soon, feminist theorists began to explore
the implications of gender on narrative form.

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.200
Some fought to define a distinctively “feminist”
poetics.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.349
Others resisted the idea that there’s a
fundamental “female” consciousness or

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.349
self.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.760
In 1975, the French theorist, Hélène Cixous,
coined the term écriture féminine (loosely

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.059
translated to mean “women’s writing”)—And
yes, I know that my french pronunciation is

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.059
fantastic.

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:22.330
Cixous maintains that misogynistic culture
has “driven” women from exploring their

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.330
desires.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.400
She encourages women to use their bodies as
a source of inspiration.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.900
But she also recognizes that femininity is
a social construct, defined as much by cultural

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.799
convention as by biological characteristics.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.040
Cixous associates “féminine” writing
with “openness.”

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.180
For her, women’s writing isn’t the exclusive
provenance of women; it’s a non-exclusionary

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.120
approach to exploring that which is different,
or “other.”

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.069
It’s a way of regarding the world accessible
to all genders.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.409
So, let’s explore the degree to which The
Handmaid’s Tale exhibits this kind of “openness.”

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.169
We know that Offred often presents her bodily
experience by cataloging physical sensations:

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.449
Sunlight comes in through the window too,
and falls on the floor, which is made of wood,

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:11.029
in narrow strips, highly polished [....] [A]
chair, sunlight, flowers: these are not to

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:12.699
be dismissed.

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:18.810
I am alive, I live, I breathe, I put my hand
out, unfolded, into the sunlight.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.810
(7)

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.290
Now This is a tiny moment of expressing bodily
autonomy--putting her own unfolded hand into

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.000
the sunlight--but it is still real.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.150
Offred--robbed of her name and her freedom--still
finds ways to express her existence using

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.720
her body--including, by the way, in her relationship
with Nick.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.400
And she also expresses her existence by telling
stories:

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.780
...if it’s a story, even in my head, I must
be telling it to someone.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.370
You can’t tell a story only to yourself.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.810
There’s always someone else.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.830
Even when there is no one.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.140
(39-40)
This is storytelling as a survival technique,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.720
as a way of establishing one’s humanity
when the broader culture is denying it.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:04.479
Those needs to testify and connect are human
desires, not restricted to a particular gender.

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.560
But pay attention to the way Offred writes
about her body and her bodily experiences.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.520
Sometimes, she describes her body from an
external perspective:

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.960
I know they are watching, these two men who
aren’t yet permitted to touch women.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.150
They touch with their eyes instead and I move
my hips a little, feeling the full red skirt

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.449
sway around me [....] I enjoy the power; power
of a dog bone, passive but there.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.550
(22)
Offred’s ability to view herself from the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.650
outside here is manifestation among many of
her “openness” to imagining the perspectives

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.650
of others.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.039
At other times, Offred describes her body
from a different perspective:

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:47.600
I sink down into my body as into a swamp,
fenland, where only I know the footing.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.219
Treacherous ground, my own territory [....] I’m
a cloud, congealed around a central object,

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.960
the shape of a pear, which is hard and more
real than I am and glows red within its translucent

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.160
wrapping.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.750
Inside it is a space, huge as the sky at night
and dark and curved like that, though black-red

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.150
rather than black.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.860
Pinpoints of light swell, sparkle, burst and
shrivel within it, countless as stars.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.630
(73-4)
Sinking into her body, Offred explores a territory

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.599
that is inaccessible to others--a “more
real,” vast “space” within, huge as

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.180
the sky.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.889
Her own territory.

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.009
She says its treacherous ground, but still--her
own.

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.379
It’s also worth considering that Offred
chooses to have sex with the gardener, Nick,

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.340
and states very clearly why:
I went back to Nick.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.509
Time after time, on my own [....] I did not
do it for him, but for myself entirely.

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:44.969
(emphasis added, 268)
So, Offred’s descriptions of inhabiting

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:50.189
a female body, her “openness” to external
perspectives, and her exploration of desire

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.639
exhibit the qualities associated with écriture
féminine.

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.779
But here’s the wrinkle: Offred recorded
her story on thirty unnumbered cassette tapes,

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:05.009
and it was two male scholars who used “guesswork”
to arrange her “blocks of speech” into

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:06.009
text (302).

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.750
In other words, it was male editors who created
the structure to Offred’s narrative that

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.750
we’re reading.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.650
So, to use an analysis word, that problematizes
a bit what sex, gender, and/or sexuality have

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.180
to do with narrative structure in this novel.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.060
There’s this theorist Peter Brooks who famously
describes the classic plot as a trajectory

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.960
of desire that mirrors the sexual experience
of a normalized “male” subject.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.759
Like, in Brooks’ reading, the start of a
story requires arousal; the middle entails

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:40.419
expectation, frustration, and suspense; and
the end involves a climactic release from

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:41.419
desire.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:47.809
Now many readers, including I must say, myself,
feel this theory leaves a bit to be...desired.

00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:51.840
Some feminist theorists have argued that women’s
stories are “patterned”: they emphasize

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.110
detail and repetition; focus more intently
on the relationships between events; contain

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.689
circular plot structures; and involve multiple
moments of climax.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:06.580
But I would argue it’s just too simplistic
to say that sex, gender, or sexuality dictate

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.669
what kind of plot you “can” write.

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:13.280
All narratives are the product of a complex
series of choices, some conscious and some

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.280
not.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.729
Men write circular fiction that doesn’t
resolve; women write books with classic plotting;

00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:23.900
and all attempts to put story, or for that
matter gender, into dichotomous boxes are

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.900
doomed.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.659
That said, Offred’s story as we read it
has the plot structure that mirrors the classic,

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:35.120
so-called ‘male’ plot trajectory--but
is that inherent to her story or created by

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.370
later scholars?

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.250
Thinking about that,other questions emerge:
how might her story be different if presented

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.830
in an alternate order?

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:46.339
And why did Atwood include the “Historical
Notes on The Handmaid’s Tale” chapter

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:47.339
in the first place?

00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:49.500
Well, Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.050
So like the final chapter of Orwell’s 1984,
“The Principles of Newspeak,” “Historical

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.680
Notes” assures us that the dystopian regime
will eventually be overthrown.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.570
And, of course, this is good news.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.360
But, we have not left a dystopia for a utopia.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.100
In this chapter, we learn that the conference
chair is Professor Maryann Crescent Moon,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.029
Department of Caucasian Anthropology, University
of Denay, Nunavut.

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:18.440
Apparently, women will regain the right to
education and Caucasians may be marginal to

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.440
dominant culture.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.269
But Crescent Moon works for a fictional university,
while the (male) keynote speaker, Professor

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:30.220
James Darcy Piexoto, is affiliated with a
historic bastion of Caucasian-ness: Cambridge

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.750
University in England.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:38.230
Also, some readers have posited that Pieixoto’s
unusual name is a reference to Pope Pius IX,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.820
the nineteenth-century Vatican pope known
for repressing liberal values.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.910
So, that might say something about the kind
of society that will dominate 22nd century

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:47.910
America.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.389
(1) Piexoto’s lecture (and its reception)
suggest that the culture studying Gileadean

00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:55.250
Studies is still profoundly misogynistic.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:01.110
(2) I mean, Piexoto objectifies Crescent Moon
with some lame pseudo-flirting; he refers

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.540
to what other historians have called “the
Underground Femaleroad as “The Underground

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.370
Frailroad,” a joke that is met with laughter,
and he says of Gilead, “our job is not to

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.860
censure but to understand,” which elicits
applause.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.389
But really, can’t your job be both to understand,
and to censure?

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:23.220
Piexoto even credits Gilead for its “effective
totalitarian system.”

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.100
so he may fancy himself above the injustices
of Gilead, but it’s not like the structure

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.070
of patriarchy has been dismantled.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.250
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:36.300
Pieixoto also critiques Offred for not having
the “turn of mind” that could benefit

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.440
his own research:
She could have told us much about the workings

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.130
of the Gileadean empire, had she had the instincts
of a reporter or a spy.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.310
(310)
That is to say, he wishes she had approached

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:51.779
Gilead as a prototypical male historian, writing
about great men and empire-building, but of

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:56.810
course, we as readers recognize the tremendous
value in the way that Offred has told her

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.230
story, and the true heroism telling it required.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.950
And then after Piexoto receives his final
applause comes the novel’s wonderful final

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.649
line:
“Are there any questions?”

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:08.790
(311)
There are many, of course, but the ones that

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.320
reverberate for me are: Could this happen
now?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320
Could this happen here?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.060
I think what makes the Handmaid’s Tale so
upsetting is that it shows exactly how it

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.820
could happen here and now.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.730
It reminds us that the battles for equal opportunity
and equal protection under the law are never

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.630
over, and they are never won.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:33.190
And that we all must heed Offred’s mother’s
warning: do not take your freedoms for granted.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.740
Let us not be complacent.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.360
Next week, we’ll continue our look at dystopian
novels with Voltaire’s Candide.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:44.740
Thanks for watching.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:12:08.070
I’ll see you then.
