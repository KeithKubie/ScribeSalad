00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:09.304
In the world of math,

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:13.384
many strange results are possible 
when we change the rules.

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:17.226
But there’s one rule that most of us 
have been warned not to break:

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:19.605
don’t divide by zero.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.584
How can the simple combination 
of an everyday number

00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:26.463
and a basic operation 
cause such problems?

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:29.693
Normally, dividing by smaller 
and smaller numbers

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:32.321
gives you bigger and bigger answers.

00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:34.844
Ten divided by two is five,

00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:36.443
by one is ten,

00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:39.022
by one-millionth is 10 million,

00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:39.980
and so on.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.291
So it seems like if you divide by numbers

00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:44.900
that keep shrinking 
all the way down to zero,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.061
the answer will grow 
to the largest thing possible.

00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:52.723
Then, isn’t the answer to 10 
divided by zero actually infinity?

00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:54.683
That may sound plausible.

00:00:54.683 --> 00:00:57.733
But all we really know is 
that if we divide 10

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.674
by a number that tends towards zero,

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:03.734
the answer tends towards infinity.

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:07.864
And that’s not the same thing as
saying that 10 divided by zero

00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:10.514
is equal to infinity.

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:11.833
Why not?

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:16.222
Well, let’s take a closer look 
at what division really means.

00:01:16.222 --> 00:01:18.574
Ten divided by two could mean,

00:01:18.574 --> 00:01:22.671
"How many times must 
we add two together to make 10,”

00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:26.113
or, “two times what equals 10?”

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:30.453
Dividing by a number is essentially 
the reverse of multiplying by it,

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:32.401
in the following way:

00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:35.423
if we multiply any number 
by a given number x,

00:01:35.423 --> 00:01:39.653
we can ask if there’s a new number 
we can multiply by afterwards

00:01:39.653 --> 00:01:42.286
to get back to where we started.

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:47.344
If there is, the new number is called 
the multiplicative inverse of x.

00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:51.445
For example, if you multiply 
three by two to get six,

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:55.564
you can then multiply 
by one-half to get back to three.

00:01:55.564 --> 00:01:59.394
So the multiplicative inverse 
of two is one-half,

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:03.964
and the multiplicative inverse 
of 10 is one-tenth.

00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:09.234
As you might notice, the product of any
number and its multiplicative inverse

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.264
is always one.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.463
If we want to divide by zero,

00:02:13.463 --> 00:02:15.843
we need to find 
its multiplicative inverse,

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:19.144
which should be one over zero.

00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:24.972
This would have to be such a number that
multiplying it by zero would give one.

00:02:24.972 --> 00:02:29.143
But because anything multiplied
by zero is still zero,

00:02:29.143 --> 00:02:31.556
such a number is impossible,

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:34.842
so zero has no multiplicative inverse.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:37.343
Does that really settle things, though?

00:02:37.343 --> 00:02:40.983
After all, mathematicians 
have broken rules before.

00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:42.713
For example, for a long time,

00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:46.774
there was no such thing as taking 
the square root of negative numbers.

00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:50.861
But then mathematicians defined 
the square root of negative one

00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:53.284
as a new number called i,

00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:57.803
opening up a whole new
mathematical world of complex numbers.

00:02:57.803 --> 00:02:59.245
So if they can do that,

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.203
couldn’t we just make up a new rule,

00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:05.264
say, that the symbol infinity 
means one over zero,

00:03:05.264 --> 00:03:07.543
and see what happens?

00:03:07.543 --> 00:03:08.593
Let's try it,

00:03:08.593 --> 00:03:11.723
imagining we don’t know 
anything about infinity already.

00:03:11.723 --> 00:03:14.292
Based on the definition 
of a multiplicative inverse,

00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:18.474
zero times infinity must be equal to one.

00:03:18.474 --> 00:03:24.530
That means zero times infinity plus
zero times infinity should equal two.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.487
Now, by the distributive property,

00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:29.388
the left side of the equation 
can be rearranged

00:03:29.388 --> 00:03:32.619
to zero plus zero times infinity.

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:36.188
And since zero plus zero 
is definitely zero,

00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:40.049
that reduces down to zero times infinity.

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.717
Unfortunately, we’ve already defined 
this as equal to one,

00:03:43.717 --> 00:03:48.353
while the other side of the equation 
is still telling us it’s equal to two.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:51.238
So, one equals two.

00:03:51.238 --> 00:03:54.464
Oddly enough, 
that's not necessarily wrong;

00:03:54.464 --> 00:03:58.132
it's just not true 
in our normal world of numbers.

00:03:58.132 --> 00:04:00.714
There’s still a way it could
be mathematically valid,

00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:05.221
if one, two, and every other number 
were equal to zero.

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:07.714
But having infinity equal to zero

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:12.884
is ultimately not all that useful 
to mathematicians, or anyone else.

00:04:12.884 --> 00:04:16.114
There actually is something called 
the Riemann sphere

00:04:16.114 --> 00:04:19.409
that involves dividing by zero 
by a different method,

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.773
but that’s a story for another day.

00:04:21.773 --> 00:04:25.965
In the meantime, dividing by zero 
in the most obvious way

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.733
doesn’t work out so great.

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:30.674
But that shouldn’t stop us 
from living dangerously

00:04:30.674 --> 00:04:33.605
and experimenting 
with breaking mathematical rules

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:37.483
to see if we can invent 
fun, new worlds to explore.
