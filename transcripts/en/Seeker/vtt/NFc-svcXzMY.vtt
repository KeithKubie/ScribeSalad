00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:08.200
It might look like I'm leaking all the time
but I'm just crying.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.679
Hey freaky leakies, Jules here for Dnews.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.039
Our skin is an amazing organ.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.660
It’s a barrier for gross things that might
get into your body, it helps us sense the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.380
world around us, it keeps us from overheating
and overcooling, it even synthesizes Vitamin

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.160
D when UV rays hit it.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.800
But perhaps one of the most impressive things
about it, to me at least, is that your skin

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.670
holds all your blood and guts and mucous,
and other fluids and gasses without leaking.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.721
Sure, we do stuff like sweat, but that’s
a controlled response, often to heat, and

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.540
it’s only sweat that comes out.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.370
On top of all that, we shed millions, and
by some accounts, billions of skin cells every

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.680
single day, and yet somehow everything important
stays inside.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.730
We take this for granted, but we shouldn’t!

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.590
Because the way it is able to form a tight
seal is absolutely incredible, and only recently

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.590
discovered.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.600
But first, let’s get the skinny on skin.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.240
Human skin is made up of several layers of
tissue, but it’s the top one, [points at

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.510
hand] this one, that makes us effectively
leakproof.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.880
It’s called the epidermis, and it is actually
made up of its own series of distinct layers.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.000
Yes, it’s layers within layers, it’s skinception.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.550
The outermost layer of the epidermis is the
one that is constantly shedding off, millions

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.190
of times a day, it is called the stratum corneum.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.370
That’s Latin for “horny layer”.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.800
Beneath that is a layer called the stratum
granulosum, and that’s where the no-leak

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.170
magic happens.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.670
New research from 2016, published in the journal
eLife looked at skin cells in mice using highly

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.821
specialized light-based microscopes, cross
referenced against mathematical models, to

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:32.800
determine that the key to the skin’s tight
seal is actually it’s shape.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.740
This stratum granulosum is arranged like a
checkerboard pattern, except instead of 2

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.380
dimensional squares it’s flattened versions
of 3 dimensional tetrakaidecahedron.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.610
That means they have 14 sides, with six rectangular,
and eight hexagonal.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.940
They’re actually called “Kelvin’s tetrakaidecahedron”,
after Lord Kelvin, an 19th century mathematician

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.910
who dared to ask “hey how do we make stuff
fit together with no gaps and minimal surface

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.910
area?”

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.740
Turns out, all he needed was a two-photon
microscope to get the answer.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.140
Too bad those were invented 100 years later.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.670
These Kelvin shapes are arranged in a sort
of zipper-like honeycomb pattern.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.330
And not only are there effectively no gaps
in this arrangement, but the cells in that

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.470
region are also capable of producing a sort
of glue, that binds this shape together, so

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.049
this perfect fit doesn’t fall apart.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.090
What is perhaps most amazing about this whole
arrangement, is that it’s configuration

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.730
lets the old skin cells at the top disengage,
while keeping a redundant seal beneath them,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.450
then pushing the new skin cells forward with
another seal behind that.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.499
Like a tightly bound conveyor belt pushing
old skin out and new skin up, never breaking

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.499
the seal.

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.230
So the next time you’re sitting around in
one piece, with all your blood and guts and

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.770
stuff securely inside of your body, take a
second and be grateful that you don’t need

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.599
to wear a scuba suit all the time.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.219
So your skin doesn't leak but did you know
that it also can't tear?

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.469
That's kind of amazing and you can find out
why in this video right here.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.530
And do you have any other questions about
skin in general?
