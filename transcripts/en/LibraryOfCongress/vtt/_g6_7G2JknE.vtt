00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.160
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.510
&gt;&gt; I am pleased to turn the
stage over to Brendan Kiely.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:17.570
[ Applause ]

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: How are you doing?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.820
Nice one -- I love the tone
of the [phonetic] response.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.220
This is good.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.090
So I am very, very grateful.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.880
Thank you for that
super kind introduction.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.830
And I am just really grateful to be
here at the National Book Festival

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.410
with all of you, and very
excited to share with you -

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.570
you can probably barely
see it out there,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.210
but I know there is
a camera back there.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.720
So I am just going to mug for the
camera and - I'm excited to share

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.480 position:56%
with you "The Last True Love Story."

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.770
And I have been very fortunate.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.650
I worked in a high school in
New York City for ten years.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.780
And when I published
"The Gospel of Winter"

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.440
that was my final year of teaching.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.540
And it was a remarkable experience
to be still teaching my classes

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.250
and speaking to students
about my own book.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.240
And I just - I love this
confluence in the young adult world

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.130
because I think that young
adult readers are avid,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.070
you know, and passionate readers.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.810
And I feel so grateful to be a
writer in the community with them.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.660
And I think YA readers
-- as you mentioned --

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.920
actually span all ages,
and so it's very cool.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.140
So before I tell you
about this book,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.430
let me tell you a family story.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.230
In September of 2001,
actually, a number of folks

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.990 position:56%
in my large Irish Catholic family
decided that it would be a good idea

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.300
to try to help my grandfather get
back to Ireland to the village

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.280
that his whole family
is from in order for him

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.550
to see it one last time, because
he had Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.370
And it was a thing that we wanted
to do to try to help him sort

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.300
of see this important
space one last time.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.470
It was kind of a romantic idea.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.980
And I don't know, in
hindsight, how smart it was.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.250
In fact, it was a little dangerous.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.150
And lo and behold,
I - so I got lucky.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.920
I was one of the family members
who was chosen to go with him.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.380
And I went with my grandmother and
my grandfather and my Uncle Bob.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.920
And I met them over there.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.140
And we all - we're touring
around, looking at the village.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.540
And it was pretty remarkable
because I have a photo to this day

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.490
of my grandfather standing on a
stone bridge right in Stradbally.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.480
And he had - he is holding
a postcard that he had;

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.920
and that was his only way of
remembering where in the village,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.180
you know, his family was from.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.170
Now the problem --
like I said, though --

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.830
is that it was a little dangerous.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.100
He had Alzheimer's,
and there were moments

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.100
where he would really lose touch

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.270
with what we were doing
and where we were.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.650
And it was quite frightening.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.430
And it was frightening for me.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.610
I was - I had recently
moved to New York.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.650
I had recently graduated
from college.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.820
And to see my grandfather
in this state where he was -

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.590
at one point we were at a
hospital because they had records,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.990
and he thought he was
back in high school.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.830
And it was disorienting to be there
and see this and to see the pain,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.280
you know, that my uncle was
experiencing, and my grandmother,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.210
and mostly for him because he would
go in and out of these moments.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.200
And so I also knew I had to
do something else about this.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.960 position:56%
I really wanted to try to record his
stories and try to get them down so

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.250
that we had the family
recording of these stories.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.940
And so at night, after we had
ventured to various places,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.120
I'd sit down in the hotel room
with him and I'd say, "Grandpa,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.240
tell me about life back in
Worcester, Massachusetts."

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.600
We're from Massachusetts.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.590
"Tell me about growing
up in Worcester."

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.320
And he'd tell me all these
stories that were about, you know,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.210
trying to get to school and
going through the neighborhood.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.620
But his stories would wander.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.260
And he - as he would - as often
happens, the stories began

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.820
to meander and go somewhere else.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.120
And the anchor -- every
time, when he was coming back

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.460
and he realized he had gone
off or if he just didn't know

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.740
where he was anymore -- his anchor,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.560
the refrain that he would
say every single time,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.170
was "And this is why I
love your grandmother.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.140
And this is why I love
your grandmother.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.940
And this is why I love
your grandmother."

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.340
And so for me, I wanted to write
a love story that was in homage

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.420
to the man who -- despite this
disease -- wanted to make clear,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.250
in whatever moments of
clarity that he hung onto,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.780
that the most important thing
that he could say was "I love you"

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.810
and "I love you" to my grandmother.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.760
That matters to me.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.590
Love is the foundation, I think,
for all three of the books

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.780
that I have been fortunate
enough to publish.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.000
And I wanted to honor
that spirit in this book.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.840
So what's this book?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.150
This book is not - it does
not take place in Ireland.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.880 position:56%
It takes place in the United States.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.610
And it is about, in
brief, Teddy Hendricks --

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.800
who is a 17-year-old boy -- a
lonely poet living in Los Angeles

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.100
who was basically raised
by his grandfather,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.830
who is now in an assisted-living
facility in L.A.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.540
because he has Alzheimer's disease;

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.020
and it's difficult take
care of him at home.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.890
Teddy has been going to visit
him and spend time with him.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.420
And he says - he's
talking to the grandfather.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.420
And at the beginning of the book
the grandfather is searching

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.320
for this photograph
of the grandmother.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.050
And finally they are
able to find it.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.960
But he says to Teddy,
"Make me a promise.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.280
Please don't let me
forget your grandmother."

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.580
She is deceased; she
died years earlier.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.650
And the last thing he wants
is to experience that pain --

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.570
the pain of losing her
- the memory of her.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.790
So he says, "Make me a promise.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.320
Promise me you won't
let me forget her."

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.170
And it's an impossible
promise, but Teddy makes it.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.530
And so he is trying to
figure out "How am I going

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.210
to get Grandpa across the country?"

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.100
Because Grandpa is
from Ithaca, New York.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.570
"And how am I going
to get him there?

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.940 position:56%
Because if I can get him there -- if
I can get him back to that hillside

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.130 position:56%
where he first kissed the woman of
his life - the woman who is the love

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.880
of his life -- maybe we
can do something to try

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.350
to hold on to these memories.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.550
We can go back to the church
where you were married,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.270
and maybe that will conjure
up some of the memories."

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.240
It's a quixotic, romantic hope,
but he still wants to do it.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.310
The problem is he can't drive.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.750
So as he is - one night, as
he is out on the boardwalk --

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.830
the Venice Beach boardwalk
in L.A. --

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.890
and he is listening to
the 17-year-old girl

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.850
that he has a huge crush on, who
is this rocker who is rocking it

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.250
out on the Venice Beach Boardwalk.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.860
They slip off and have an
adventure that evening.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.380
And Carina, the rock star, learns
that he wants to make this trip.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.230
And she wants to get out of
L.A., to get out to New York City

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.230
to jump-start her music career.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.060
And so she says, "Teddy,
here's the deal.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.360
Pack your bags.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.070
We're stealing your mother's
car and we are driving

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.370
across the country tonight.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.670
Let's do it.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.970
Let's go."

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.270
So it's this adventure story.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:46.550
And the important thing to
know about this essentially is

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.740
that this road trip story
is two love stories.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.640
It's a love story of Carina and
Teddy beginning to fall in love

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.740
with each other for the first
time, and it's the love story

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.190
of the grandfather capturing
these memories and trying

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.640
to remember the love of his life --

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.090
trying to make love,
in fact, last forever.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.800
So it's these two love
stories bound together.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.740 position:56%
And what's interesting about this,
in my mind, is this notion of trying

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.430
to figure out how to go home.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.920
And so they are going
to Ithaca, New York.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.040
And so the entire book is
in homage to "The Odyssey."

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.820
Imagine Odysseus but with
Alzheimer's, or a young Telemachus

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.080
who is trying to help an
Alzheimer's-afflicted Odysseus get

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.290 position:56%
back home to the Penelope of Ithaca.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.430
Unfortunately, it's
a Penelope in memory.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.590
And so the whole book is
this homage to "The Odyssey."

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.220
So it's these love stories;
it's an homage to "The Odyssey."

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.320
And then here is the kicker,
because this is true as well.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.820
The story is also about Carina.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.380
Carina is, again, a rocker.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.760
She's - wants to get out there
and jump-start this music career.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.570
And what's fascinating is that
she is this huge musical library.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.200
She can play songs from
all different eras.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.450
She loves a lot of
contemporary music.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.800
But she was adopted, and
part of her relationship

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.420
with her adoptive parents is that
she plays the songs of the 60's

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.710
and 70's that they grew up on.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.400
She calls them "the ex-hippies."

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.660
And she has built this
music catalog of songs.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.960
So while they are driving --

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.190
because every road trip
needs a good playlist --

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.370
she is playing some of those songs.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.390
And those songs are what jog
the grandfather's memory.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:36.560
Because as many of you probably
know, music resides in the mind

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.660
in a very different way than
your everyday short-term-

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.960
and long-term memory.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.830
Music is more fluid.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.820
And in fact, to this day there is a
lot of research that is being done

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.420
about using music as therapy for
people who have Alzheimer's disease

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.190
to help them tap into their
old memories, to help them tap

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.690
into emotion in the
moment -- all of that.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.250
So Carina's rock songs, in fact,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.920
are the songs that help the
grandfather begin to tap

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.370
into some of these memories.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.370
So it was - it's all this in one.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.420
And I'm very excited about it
because it's so deeply personal

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.230
to me, because it comes from that
space of family storytelling.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.430
The other thing that
I'll share about the book

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.420
that I think is also just
important is that this book is -

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.690
if you are talking about
"home" and building home,

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.870 position:56%
I think that's also a
conversation to talk about identity.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.020
And something that's really
important for me as a writer in all

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.030
of my books and - is
acknowledging the fact

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.670
that I am a straight white male.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.470
I think a lot about
identity construction.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.020
And I think a lot about,
in particular --

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.650
as I did with the second book
that I co-wrote with Jason,

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.710
"All American Boys"
-- I think quite a bit

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.650 position:56%
about the construction of whiteness.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.540
And I think it's an important
subject that often gets left

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.300
out when we talk about
identity, because it's -

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:10.300
it is this "whiteness" that is part
of the dilemma when we are talking

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.060
about racial tension
in the United States.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.590
So part of Teddy's journey
while he is on the road

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:22.880
and while he is witnessing some of
the racism that Carina experiences

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:29.610 position:56%
as a transracial transnational
adopted child is to think, you know,

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:35.460
"Why am I not experiencing
this kind of, you know,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.980
verbal attack in the
way that she is?"

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.790
And for him to reflect on
that across the country.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.340
So this road trip is
to go back home.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.890
This road trip is to try to
think about who we are as people.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.640
But also it's Teddy's
thinking a little bit about

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.710 position:56%
"Why are we refusing to talk about
this part of our national identity?"

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:00.710
And for me, that's the discussion
of white privilege and the harm

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.110
that it causes across the country.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.450
So all those things are wrapped
up into one great big adventure.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:12.570
And I had a lot of fun writing this
book, creating my own playlist,

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.570
and trying to get inspired with
music that really inspires me.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.610
So that's the book.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.230
And I would be - I would
love to take some questions

questions for me.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.030

microphones here.

share with you some more.

if you guys have some questions.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.060
Yeah, nice one.

&gt;&gt; My daughter, she's 13.

She's downstairs right now.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.740
But she is - she calls
herself a feminist.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:13:00.100
And I know that the narrative
around feminism is also,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.120
in addition to racism, something
that's - we just don't seem

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.460
to want to address or face.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.760
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yeah.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.110
&gt;&gt; Your character is a female.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.090
Does that enter into
the conversation at all?

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.390
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yeah,
yeah, absolutely.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.690
I appreciate that.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.990
Thank you.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.290
Yes, absolutely.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.460
So I think that's really a
valuable question to think

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.380
about in terms of love, as well.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.350
And in this book it's a
heterosexual love story.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.090
And I think it's really important
for the construction of identity

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.980
to think a little bit about gender
and sexuality and, in particular,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:43.020
Carina as a character who is a
very strong female character.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.710
But not all feminism has
to look a certain way.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.780 position:56%
And I think that's really important.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.170
Like, when I - part of my
experience teaching was getting

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.280
to know all these great
students and getting

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.060
to know the different
kinds of students.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.560
You know, I would teach a whole
bunch of different young women

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.710
who would all consider
themselves feminists.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.250
But, you know, you
can't categorize them.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.550
They don't look all the same.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.490
They don't - you know, they
don't - they argue for it

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.790
in different ways, right?

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.500
And I think Carina is somebody who
is strong but also really grappling

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.750
with this notion of,
like, "I'm going to be -

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.720 position:56%
I'm going to take charge of my life.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.020
And that's OK.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.870
I am often told that I
can't, but it's OK for me

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.660
to take charge of my
life in this way."

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.500
So for me it's really
important to think about that.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.870
But do you have a followup?

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.040
&gt;&gt; Well I was just going to comment
that she pointed out to me recently

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:41.480
in something she saw on the
Internet that a huge percentage

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.280
of people do not identify
as feminist.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.580
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yeah.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.110
&gt;&gt; But that same people
identify - they say yes,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.620
men and women should be equal.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.190
So yeah. Part of that
conversation is just why does

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.890 position:56%
that word engender so much pushback?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.190

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:04.010

- it makes me sad.

[Chuckles].

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.200
Because I just can't understand why
something as simple as, you know,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:18.100
respect and looking at somebody not
through a sexualized lens or not

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:23.310
through some kind of preconceived
assigned category, but just to look

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.970
at a person and to say "Hey,
we're all in this together."

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.800
I - it just - it drives me
crazy that "feminism" is a word

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.540
that seems like a bad word.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.840

trip, or the experience in New York?

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.050

This is amazing.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.370
Nice job. So the book
is mainly the road trip.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:16:02.610
Because I think when speaking about
love, I think it's really important

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.760
to have a story that is about
the process of falling in love --

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.430
a story about the long,
twisting turning.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.520
Sometimes things are working out;

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.900
sometimes things are
not working out.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.900
Road trip -- journey -- story,

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.240
as opposed to what it
might look like at the end.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.300
I think too often, in fact, we
are given images on TV shows

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.870
or in magazines that set up
an expectation that, like,

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.890
"This is what love
should look like."

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:40.080
And instead of teaching us the
process, the living in love,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.360 position:56%
the line that the grandpa says in
the book is - to Teddy and Carina is

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.360
"The point of living is
learning how to love."

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.880
And it's a valuable lesson to
know that love is in action,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.660
that love is in process, that love
is a journey, love is an adventure.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.330
And it's not a place.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.690
It's not necessarily a destination.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.930

so I launched the book in New
York, launched the book in L.A.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.460
except I can't because it can't be.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.300 position:56%
It can't be the end -- not for G-pa,
not for Carina, and not for me --

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.950
because it is out here on the
road in the middle of nowhere

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.580 position:56%
that I have finally come to
understand what my grandfather means

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:17.510
when he says 'The point of living
is learning how to love.'" So --

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.680
[ Applause ]

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.730
Thanks. The book begins "in media
res" -- in the middle of things,

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.350
because that's how
"The Odyssey" begins.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.180
And we flash back to the night
that they are about to leave

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:40.640
and how they make the decision;
springing the grandfather; Carina,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.140 position:56%
you know, basically sticking it to
the music producer who is, you know,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.490
ignoring her; and then
busting out of town

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.500
and heading out - heading east.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.790
And I think it's important that
the book moves from the West Coast

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.850
to the East Coast because
so many road stories are the

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.150
opposite direction.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:04.800
And for me this felt like an
opportunity to move west to east

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.620
as if we were kind of going
back in time a little bit,

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.490
like the grandfather who is kind
of digging back in his memory.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.860
Yeah.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.950
&gt;&gt; Hello. Forgive for asking what's
probably a very basic question

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.700
as the mother of a 14-year-old.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.000
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yeah.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.060
&gt;&gt; When I was 14, we didn't
have young adult fiction.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:31.200
So why do you think this is a
genre that has caught on and --

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.190
in an age of Internet and stuff?

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.870
And why do you write in it?

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.640
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: So I
appreciate that question very much.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.760
I, too, didn't really
technically grow

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.690
up reading young adult literature.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:47.180
And in truth, I think many
young adult writers would say

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.500
that I don't write for
teens; I write about teens.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.220
But I would actually say
that I write for teens.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.560
I want to write for
teens and for adults.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.550
And I think it's essential
that we are creating stories

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.230 position:56%
that feel exciting and contemporary,

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:07.020
in particular to help teens
see themselves in literature,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.750
see their lives, see their
pain -- see their, you know,

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:15.140
their everyday life in literature
and to not think of literature

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.600
as that thing that is assigned
in class but rather something

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.510
that is living and breathing
and a part of our everyday life.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.410
And when - I kind of grew up
in the Church of Literature.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.040
My mother worked the night
shift at Mass General Hospital,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.490
and Sunday mornings,
so that she could go

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.080
to sleep when she came home.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.290
My father would take me out
in Harvard Square in Boston

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.650
and would walk me, and my little
hand in his, from bookstore

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.050
to bookstore to bookstore.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.060
And I feel like books
were my church.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.780
And I'll never forget it.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.490
It was, you know, such
a powerful experience.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.070
And I think young adult
literature --

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.610
especially contemporary realism --

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.790
is trying to capture that
spirit of, like, "Hey.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.420
You are living literature.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.720
You are living the adventure.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.020
Here it is!

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.920
Come check it out and stay
excited about literature."

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.310
I try to do that with "Macbeth,"

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.730
but that's an uphill
battle [laughs], you know?

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.170
And I feel like I can do it,
but I would rather do this.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:18.310 position:56%
And frankly I would love it if more
classes would pair young adult books

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.270
with some of the books that we
teach in our English courses.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.300
For me, I really think
that it would be so fun

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.440
to pair this with "The Odyssey."

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.680
I read "The Odyssey" in
9th grade in high school,

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.660 position:56%
and I taught "The Odyssey" to
various grades when I was a teacher.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.050
And it would be cool to
have that kind of pairing.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.350
So that's what I think.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.690
I don't know where I'm even looking
right now; I know you're out there.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:44.330
But I - but I'm - you know, I
really appreciate that question

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.730
because I think it's important
to think about it as a living,

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.030
breathing part of our lives.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.200
And that's what young adult
literature is about for me.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.540
So I appreciate that.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.800
&gt;&gt; Can I ask a completely
irrelevant followup?

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.310
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.710
&gt;&gt; My husband is in mourning over
Famous Ray's going out of business.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:02.970
Do you have a backup Greenwich
Village pizza suggestion?

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:04.270
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: I'm sorry.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.570
He's mourning what?

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.440
&gt;&gt; Famous Ray's closed
in Greenwich Village.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.740
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Oh yeah.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.040
Yeah.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And we - I used to actually order
them to Washington for his birthday.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.820
So I don't know where to order them
from Greenwich Village anymore.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.550
Do you have any suggestion?

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.850
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: I - yes.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.150
I would say McNally-Jackson Books.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.840
You can order plenty from there.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.140
And it's not quite the Village.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.440
I know it's Soho.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.740
But it's --

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.040
&gt;&gt; No -- pizza.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.340
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Oh, pizza.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.640
Sorry -- that's why I was confused.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.940
Pizza, yeah, Two Boots!

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.240
Come on! Two Boots is great.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.840
[ Laughter ]

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.140
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: That's hilarious.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.440
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.740
I gotcha. Yeah.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.040
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thanks for doing this talk.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.340
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Thank you.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.050
&gt;&gt; You all [phonetic] wrote "All
American Boys" with another author,

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.710
which to me seems a little bit
uncommon for a fiction book.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:50.210
Could you talk a little bit about
what it was like to collaborate

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.530
on that versus being
the only author?

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:54.830
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Sure.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.130
I really appreciate your question.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.670
And it's interesting, because
Jason and I have spent a lot

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.190
of time touring together
and speaking together

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:07.220
And I am very passionate about "All
American Boys" and I think it's a -

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:12.160
it's a book that was born, really,
in a moment of rage and love

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.600
that we had as we were
kind of pounding our fists,

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.240
asking ourselves "What
are we going to do?

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.580
What is our responsibility
as young adult authors

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.080
to help the young adults
of our country begin

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.770
to process the absolute
horror that we see

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.470
on the news week after
week after week?"

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.870
-- young people of color,
people of color in general

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.560
who are being brutalized
by the police officers.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.440
And it's a disgrace;
it's disgusting.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.700
And we felt it was necessary
to try to do something

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.220
and say something publicly
about this.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.340
And for us, it was really important
that we could do this together

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.670
because Jason and I
were already friends.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.850
And the book really emerges
out of our friendship.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.210
It doesn't emerge out of an idea.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:05.460
It emerges out of the fact that
Jason, who is a black man who grew

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.030
up in DC, and Brendan, who is a
white man who grew up in Boston,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.860
forged this really deep,
meaningful friendship.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.810
And for us, that - to share that
passion that we have for each other

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.320
on the page was really,
really important.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.940
It was also incredibly important
for us to lay open and be honest

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.140
about our cultural experiences

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.450
that influence the two
narrators in the book.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.830
So in short, the book is about
one - it's about two boys --

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.390
one black, one white -- who go

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.990
to the same high school,
live in the same town.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.460
But as Martin Luther King said in
1968 at Grosse Pointe High School,

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.350
"You know, these are two
Americas living side by side."

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.370
And we wanted to be very,
very honest about that --

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.660
and so for Jason to write out of
his cultural experience and for me

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.490
to write out of mine and to
speak very openly and honestly

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.080
about white privilege and
-- as I mentioned earlier --

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.150
the harm that it causes
many folks in our country.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.830
So we wanted to do it
together because it felt

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.510
like it was right way to do that.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:12.580
And we had so much trust built
between us that when it came

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:18.310
to the writing process we just
let each other do what we did.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.570
And we wrote the book side by side,
checking in with each other --

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:26.840
like we would if we were
walking through DC and, you know,

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.960
going into a bank and having
two different experiences.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.270
Or if we are walking in Boston
and going into a restaurant

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.310
and literally, side by side,

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.180
still having two very
different experiences

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.710
because of the inherent
racism in our country.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.170
So we had to just tackle
that together,

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.650
and it was the best way to do it.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.720
And by the way, I'll forever,
forever, forever be grateful

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.910
that I got to work on
a project like that

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.200
with such an unbelievably
amazing human being.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:00.630
So thank you for giving
me the chance to say that.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.930
Hi.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.830
&gt;&gt; Is there going to
be a movie for that?

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.570
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: It - for
"The Last True Love Story"?

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.170
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yeah.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.470
Are you a producer?

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:11.770
[ Laughter ]

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.070 position:56%
I mean that would be great [laughs].

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:14.370
&gt;&gt; Student director, but no.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.060
[ Laughter ]

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.360
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: I would love it.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.120 position:56%
I would love it if there were a
movie of "The Last True Love Story."

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.980
I have in my mind a kind of
cinematic experience because,

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.630
in brief, I also got
to write this book

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.130
by taking the exact road
trip that's in the novel.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.750
A buddy of mine said,
"Hey, man, I'll drive.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.050
You just write."

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.970
And so I was in the passenger's
seat writing as we, you know,

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.640
went by the bluffs in New
Mexico or as we went, you know,

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.800
down into the desert in Arizona.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.690
And it felt that kind of cinematic
experience through the window.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.450
So I would love it
if it would happen.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:55.020
And I - then you could
watch it and then read it.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.320
Yeah.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.620
&gt;&gt; Usually I read books
before watching it, but --

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.920
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Even better!

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.220
Even better!

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.520
Nice one. OK.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.820
I'll take one last question,
and then I think I'm done.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.710 position:56%
So I - I'll take this last question.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.010
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:12.250
So your book "The Gospel of Winter"
was about a young boy dealing

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.970
with the crisis in
the Catholic Church.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.270
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yeah.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.570
&gt;&gt; And so I was wondering,
from your own background

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:20.070
and your own growing
up, how did that writing

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.330
and that final book
work with your family,

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.120
with your own personal connections?

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.960
You know, how did that
work in that dynamic?

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.820
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: I deeply,
deeply appreciate that you bring

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.120
up "The Gospel of Winter."

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.420
Thank you so much.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.170
It is a very important book in
my relationship with my family --

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.600
which I'll answer very quickly.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.090
But I will say this: Whether
it's "The Gospel of Winter"

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.810
or "All American Boys" or
"The Last True Love Story,"

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.860
I think the fundamentals
that are key

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.730 position:56%
to me whenever I approach a book is,

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:51.490
how do I help portray
the act of listening?

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:57.560
How do I portray this
discussion about love?

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.920
And those are those two - those
are the two things that are key,

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.820
I think, to the third pillar --
which is, how do we get a person

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.040
to stand up when things are
going wrong in society, right?

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.120
I want to help people, and
young people in particular,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.570
feel like they have a roadmap
to learn how to listen,

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.320
to get to the road to empathy,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.560
and that they know what
love is in its many forms.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.430
And then they can stand up
and do something about it.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.520
And so for me, writing
"The Gospel of Winter" --

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.400 position:56%
which is a story about a 16-year-old
boy who is trying to decide whether

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.470
or not he will let the world know
he has been abused by his priest --

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.610
was a very powerful experience
for me to write about,

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.080
coming from an Irish
Catholic background in Boston,

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.960 position:56%
going to Catholic school my whole
life, having a huge Catholic family.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:48.100
And I was extremely nervous when
in - when writing the story.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.740
In - as I tried my best, though,

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.130
it's not a book about
blaming people.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.780
And I don't think any of my
books are about blaming people,

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.930
but instead helping us think
about being honest and letting

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.870
that become a part
of our road to love.

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.610 position:56%
I will end with this, because the
person that made me the most nervous

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.050
to read the book was my
grandmother, who is the matriarch

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.070
of the family -- also the
woman who I was with in Ireland

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:20.550
when I was touring Ireland,
you know, with my grandfather,

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:24.580
and to whom this book is
dedicated along with my wife.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.500
Because she said to me, when
she read the book, "Brendan,

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.530
your book 'The Gospel
of Winter' reminds me

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:35.290
of Solomon asking God
for a listening heart."

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:38.150
And for me, I still have
goose bumps just repeating

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.070
that because that's
my goal, you know --

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.030
to help us think about how
to have a listening heart.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.480
And that's my goal in all my books.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.970
So I appreciate that.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.510
Thank you Grandma [laughs].

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:56.400
[ Applause ]

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.100
So I believe I'm done.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.990
If you would like to join me in
the signing line, I think it's -

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:10.050
it's 5 o'clock, and I think it's
Lane 20 in Section A. Come on down.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.350
Love to chat more.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.840
Thank you.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.020
[ Applause ]

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.670
