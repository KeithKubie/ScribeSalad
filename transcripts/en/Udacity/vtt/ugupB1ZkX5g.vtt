00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.575
For equations we just saw that there's one solution, but sometimes there's no

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:08.995
solution or there's infinitely many solutions. Let's look at the number of

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:13.545
solutions for inequalities. So for this inequality how many solutions do you

00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:18.205
think there are? None, one, two, three, or more than three. And to help you out,

00:00:18.307 --> 00:00:22.726
think about what you could plug in for x, I'm going to try 0. I can plug in 0

00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:27.277
for x and I know 3 times 0 is 0. I get 8 is less than 2 but I know this isn't

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.154
true. 8 is bigger than 2. So 0 wouldn't be a solution to this inequality. Can

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:37.123
you think of some other values of x that would work? Remember you are not after

00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:40.856
the value of x you want to know how many solutions there are.
