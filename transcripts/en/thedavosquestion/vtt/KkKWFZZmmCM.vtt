00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.130
&gt;&gt; I think it is obviously India's destiny
to become a superpower.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.799
The whole infrastructure, the whole culture,
the whole development

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.340
we've seen in India predestines India to become
a superpower.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.561
And I think it is for the Indians to start
believing in themselves, in

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:29.450
believing that they can, not only get India
right, but help India

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.489
contribute to getting the world right.
So I think getting involved in issues of climate

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.020
change, getting
involved in issues of poverty, getting involved

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.070
of issues of governance
at the global level, I think it will demonstrate

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.750
India's leadership in
a multiplicity of areas and give birth to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.270
this superpower of India.
