00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:02.065
CATHERINE RUESCH: 
So GMOP stands 

00:00:02.065 --> 00:00:04.430
for the Graduate Molecular
Biology Outreach Program.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.580
We're a student-run
volunteer group,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.069
and our goal is to bring
science to the community.

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:12.110
KEITH SMITH: We're working
with kids in the local community

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.026
and we're showing them
how we can extract DNA.

00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:15.694
And we're using
pumpkins as an example.

00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:17.610
SHREE TANNETI: There is
science all around us,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.190
so just trying to
find ways to get

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.740
people to notice it
and talk about it

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.000
and maybe appreciate it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.240
JARED SAUNDERS: I think that
science can be really fun.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.590
And you can learn
while having fun,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.250
and that's one of
the things at least

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.270
I try to keep in mind when you
think of activities when we're

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.390
going into an event.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.690
We're brainstorming.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.740
CATHERINE RUESCH:
We target anywhere

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.570
from pre-school
children all the way

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.070
through actually
senior citizens.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.195
JENNA GASKA: Whether we're
doing special needs day,

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:47.630
or whether we've both
participated and planned

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.460
out curriculum, we've
had to really learn

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.790
how to be flexible and ready
to improv and figure out

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.430
how we can address every
different type of audience we

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.250
might be getting.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.590
BETSY HART: So we have
science everywhere

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.150
in our everyday
lives, whether it's

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.280
having a beer at
the end of the day

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.320
or eating some
cheese and crackers.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.340
Both of those processes involve
a lot of science and microbes.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.820
So I think everyone's
a scientist

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.590
if they're pairing a different
wine with a different cheese.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.470
So it's fun to have people
understand that and get

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.520
inspired by that.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.880
CATHERINE RUESCH: When you see
people have that aha moment

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.040
and when they get
that excitement that

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.310
comes from seeing some
reaction before their eyes

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.042
or when something clicks,
it's just really rewarding.

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:33.500
SHREE TANNETI: I
think any science,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.511
any sort of experimentation,
involves imagination in a way,

00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.010
right?

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.000
You're coming up with an idea
that kind of makes sense,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.460
and you're trying
to address that idea

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.032
in the most logical, simplistic
way possible as well.

00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:48.740
JENNA GASKA: Going
out into the community

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.570
is just making
science accessible

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.180
and showing that scientists
can also be accessible.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.510
We're not just locked up
in our labs all the time.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.730
CATHERINE RUESCH:
Fostering an appreciation

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.190
and understanding of
the scientific process

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.050
is really important
to help people really

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.130
trust how science is done
and be able to make informed

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.730
decisions.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.380
