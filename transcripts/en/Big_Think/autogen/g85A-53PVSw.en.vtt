companies but that's good as long as
 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.120
companies but that's good as long as
they bounce back I think that's one of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130
they bounce back I think that's one of
 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.980
they bounce back I think that's one of
the most most common traits of

is that they're willing to fail and then
 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.370
is that they're willing to fail and then
bounce back from it and that's an

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380
bounce back from it and that's an
 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.850
bounce back from it and that's an
important trait of a very successful

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860
important trait of a very successful
 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.260

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270
entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem
 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.550
entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem
is for people to accept failure as a

is for people to accept failure as a
 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.020
is for people to accept failure as a
path towards learning so everyone makes

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
path towards learning so everyone makes
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.890
path towards learning so everyone makes
different mistakes and each one of them

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900
different mistakes and each one of them
 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.770
different mistakes and each one of them
are is like a badge of honor I think one

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
are is like a badge of honor I think one
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.530
are is like a badge of honor I think one
mistake that some people make is to be a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540
mistake that some people make is to be a
 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.090
mistake that some people make is to be a
bit too secretive with their idea

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100
bit too secretive with their idea
 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.920
bit too secretive with their idea
because they think that if they give

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930
because they think that if they give
 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.120
because they think that if they give
away their idea then they've lost

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130
away their idea then they've lost
 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.910
away their idea then they've lost
everything when in fact the idea is you

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920
everything when in fact the idea is you
 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.000
everything when in fact the idea is you
know maybe one percent of the solution

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010
know maybe one percent of the solution
 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.500
know maybe one percent of the solution
and that's what innovation is not just

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510
and that's what innovation is not just
 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.699
and that's what innovation is not just
about the idea but it's about

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709
about the idea but it's about
 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.550
about the idea but it's about
translating that idea into tangible

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
translating that idea into tangible
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.130
translating that idea into tangible
impact so one of the ways to do that of

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140
impact so one of the ways to do that of
 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.490
impact so one of the ways to do that of
course is to talk to as many people as

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500
course is to talk to as many people as
 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.350
course is to talk to as many people as
possible to get their feedback talk to

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360
possible to get their feedback talk to
 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.490
possible to get their feedback talk to
customers get their feedback understand

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
customers get their feedback understand
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.259
customers get their feedback understand
how they do what they do and have it how

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269
how they do what they do and have it how
 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.690
how they do what they do and have it how
you can help them do it better and you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700
you can help them do it better and you
 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.410
you can help them do it better and you
won't do that by being secretive
