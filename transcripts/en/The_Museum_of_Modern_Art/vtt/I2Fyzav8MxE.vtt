00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.569
Okay, so let's start working in
the process of Agnes Martin here.

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.440
I've stretched a simple 12 by 12 inch
canvas, this is cotton duck canvas, which

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.340
Agnes Martin worked on periodically.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.000
Also, working on linens here and there,
so feel free to do which ever you prefer.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.680
I'm going to start by priming this canvas,
and in Martin's markets, it's really interesting

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.020
to think
about the fact that she never used more than

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.140
two coats of priming, and
she never sanded between coats of priming.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.870
And the reason for that is, she actually wanted
some

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.800
roughness in the canvas surface.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.680
Now usually,
most painters when they're priming, they go

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.870
through great pains
to stretch out the primer.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.980
You don't want to have any lumps and
bumps etc, in fact Agnes Martin liked those

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.930
lumps and bumps, she used those lumps and
bumps,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.970
as we'll see shortly, to her advantage.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.530
So I'm not going to be too
particular about stretching out this priming

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.530
coat here.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.950
If I leave some streaks,
if I leave some impasto, if I leave some texture,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.830
that's actually
going to be all to my advantage, once I get

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.720
to the graphite step,
shortly here.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.420
So I'm going to put on two coats
of this priming, and you can see, I'm not

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.380
really being too concerned
about exactly how this is going on.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.759
I'm just covering up the canvas here, and
leaving a little bit of texture here and

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:19.759
there.

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.670
All right so that priming layer is more or
less dry, not 100%, but that's fine.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.659
I'm going to add a second priming layer, again
to give a little more

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.010
tooth to the canvas now.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.030
And I'm going to turn the canvas
by 90 degrees, in other words that second

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.689
coat is going perpendicular
with respect to the first one.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.850
And just like that first coat, I'm not going
to be too concerned with

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.890
exactly how this priming layer goes on.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.029
Because a little bit of texture
is going to be just fine, Okay, good enough,

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:52.009
so
I'm going to let that dry, as well.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.320
All right, so we're here and
we have two applications to ground here.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.579
The thicker,
more absorbent layer to paint on now, and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.249
it also has a little bit of texture.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.679
I've painted in orthogonal directions, or
perpendicular directions

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.450
with respect to one another.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.539
So I have a nice,
heavy nice primed layer to work on top of.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.930
Now what I'm going to do is add
an all over paint application here to change

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.490
the color of the ground.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.599
But I'm going to work quite
translucently because I want to keep this

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.480
painting looking mostly white.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.340
But I'm going to work very thinly, now what
Martin would do, later in her

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.170
career after moving to New Mexico.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.189
Is to work in acrylics and
to really highlight the translucence, the

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.790
water white so to speak, the clear
translucent quality of those paints.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.650
Building up layer upon layer,
sometimes as many as eight or ten different

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.879
layers
of paint applications.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.780
So let's start small here with just one, another
thing that Martin often did

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.030
is to use acrylic priming as a paint.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.340
So I'm going to add a little
bit of that to my palette here.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.359
[SOUND] I'm going to
tone that color yellow, and I'm using an AZO

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.359
yellow.

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.569
This a acrylic paint, and a synthetic pigment
here,

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.900
a nice bright translucent yellow.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.930
And, I'm going to add some water, because
I'm going to make this a very

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:44.930
thin application of paint here.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.500
Just lightening the color
a little bit here, think I'll lighten it

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.459
even a little bit more.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:21.920
Then I'm going to thin that
out again with some water.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.650
Painting very lightly here, letting
some of that white shine through here.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.920
And here, we have a nice light,
quite translucent glaze, if you will, of this

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920
yellow.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.130
With that base toned layer dry now, I'm now
going to work on the graphic path,

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.760
the drawing of this painting.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.480
But first I'm going to add a border, and the
easy way to do that is just

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.860
to use some simple masking tape.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.200
This is one inch wide, I'm simply going to
run a band

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.310
of this all around the painting.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.010
To make sure that these pencil lines
are not going to cover the very edges.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.790
Now, it's important when you start
making this grided composition, that you not

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.530
only use a ruler,
but you do some arithmetic too.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.030
Use a calculator, what have you,
because once you start making these marks

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.500
it's going to be real difficult for
you to do any editing.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.480
But you want to figure
out how big your grid is, what are the dimensions,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.210
vertically, and horizontally.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.000
In other words you should have an idea for
what this painting is going to look

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.081
like before you start making it.

00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:32.830
Now it may not work and you can always change
these all

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.710
over layers one after another.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.170
But, once you lay down the drawing
the editing becomes a little bit more difficult

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.170
here.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.030
So, I've decided here to use a blank
one inch border around my drawing, and then

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.710
I'm going to make a grid.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.300
So that each box here is going to
be a horizontal rectangle one quarter inch

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.790
tall and
one full inch wide.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.550
Now, the other nice thing about using that
masking tape here is I

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.740
can draw right on it.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.930
And I'm going to take that off afterwards,
so there's no real problem here.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.150
So what I'm going to do here
is simply to notch each inch.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.040
So that first inch is right
where the tape ends, and then two, three,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.880
four,
five, six, and so on.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.560
Same thing on the top edge,
and by the way, Agnes sometimes used these

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.610
blank borders.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.570
Other times she made these little
lines right on the edge of the canvas.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.650
And the next time you go to a Agnes Martin
exhibition, take a look at the edges, and

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.600
you'll often see these small pencil lines.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.180
And you're just peeking over her
shoulder as you are mine right now, as to

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.030
how she was able
to make these grids.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.520
So we have the top and
bottom axis marked with every inch.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.390
Now the lateral axis, excuse me,
I'm going to mark every quarter inch.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.150
Now it's really importantly you do this
exactly, otherwise your grid is going to be

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:07.040
pretty far from rectilinear,
pretty far from geometry.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.860
Now to draw the grid,
what kind of pencil to use?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:16.680
Agnes used every kind of pencil imagined,
lead, graphite, colored pencils, sharp, dull.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.250
These are all variables that she explored,
again we're talking about an artist

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.440
who's often called a minimalist.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.860
I'd prefer to think of her as
a maximalist, she refined her means to a quite

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.020
narrow margin and then really
found the maximum expression with it.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.130
So what am I working with here?

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.410
These are two b's, in other words,
a pretty dark lead pencil here.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.470
It doesn't matter how hard you try,
and don't try too hard, you're not going to

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.510
make a perfect line,
because the canvas is bumpy.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.100
It has not only bumps of
the canvas itself, but all these waves of

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.060
the brush strokes,
so if you look closely, my lead is going to

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.920
be bouncing
around from peak to peak.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.851
Bouncing over the valleys
of this canvas weave, skipping over some of

00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:00.450
the brush
work of the priming layer.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.740
And that's fine,
in fact as we are going to see that's actually

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.050
part of what makes
these paintings so wonderful.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.920
Agnes sometimes used rulers,
she sometimes used masking tape.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.730
She sometimes used string, actually,
tacked to either side of the canvas that she

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.750
then just passed over,
following that string line.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.010
What's important here is that
I'm not pushing down too hard.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.591
because if I push down too hard,
the canvas flexes and my line's not going

00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:26.591
to be linear any more.

00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:28.230
It's going to have a little wave to it.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.219
So it doesn't have to be perfect,
but we don't want it to be so far away from

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:35.820
a straight line either.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:09:02.360
Let's make a lot more of them.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.030
If you really zoom in
here you can see that, that line is actually

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.650
jumping back and
forth and back in forth, and back and forth

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.680
in addition to skipping forward,
forward, forward, forward.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.300
In other words it is not
continuous it is not complete.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.200
There's all of this beautiful
little whispers of yellow in there.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.560
And this is a gorgeously imperfect line.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.620
Okay.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.080
So the pencil line completed here
within this masked off border here.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.630
You can see all of these gorgeous
irregular lines jumping around over the weave

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.850
of the canvas.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.720
And as you look closely, you'll notice
that the fact this grid is not perfect.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.690
Because this is not math class.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.411
And although Agnes used the grid as her
principle template for so many years, she

00:09:41.411 --> 00:09:45.480
never made one mathematically
correct grid in her entire life.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.710
In fact, what I've allowed to happen
is a little bit of imprecision, a little bit

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.010
of error, and that's fine
because it's equally informed everything.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.990
Now if you get carried away and
you start having crooked lines or lines that

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.730
are really irregularly
spaced well then it just looks sloppy.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.500
So there is a threshold that you can't
really pass and you'll find out in your own

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.540
studio practice very likely
you'll miss it a couple times.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.110
And actually she did too, she spent her entire
career exploring

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.730
this kind of manual geometry.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.540
And I have it on very good
faith that she threw out more paintings then

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.040
she actually saved.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.100
So she'd finish a painting that
didn't work because the lines weren't quite

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.240
right, because the paint
didn't quite take in the right way.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.180
Garbage, start over again.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.990
So if you're having that same
experience in the studio, don't worry, you're

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.990
on a good track.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.610
So, let's take off this masking tape.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:49.490
All right, what I'm going to I'm going to
do next is to give the entire surface a really

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.620
light sand, now don't overdo it because you
can

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.570
sand the pencil right off here.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:02.990
Just to give it a little bit of smudging,
a little bit of smearing.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.430
A little bit of this kind of thing,
some nice rubs there, some more complications

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.610
in the surface.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.630
Now, overall, I really like that effect.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.710
I like somebody's really faint marks here.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.410
But I overdid it a little bit here.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.880
In fact, I got this strange zigzag.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.980
That's a little bit too loud for me.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.870
So fortunately, what we can do here,
just using a Q-Tip, just moisten it a little

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.520
but and you can rub some
of those marks that you don't like.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.330
Now, be careful, because you can
rub your drawing right off with it.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:40.090
This kind of smudging,
is actually kind of nice.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.660
And any time you find yourself being
a little bit too fussy, as I am right now.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.660
Just stop.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.880
Because the name of the game here is to
allow these materials to do their thing.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.370
And in fact,
I got a dark line right there.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.740
It's going to lighten a little bit
as it dries but this is interesting.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.890
This is the kind of stuff as they happen,
let the painting carry through, finish off

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.779
your plan and then take a look.

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:03.480
Now maybe it worked, maybe it didn't.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.290
But when a Martin type painting works,
it's because everything comes together.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.510
All of the little errors,
all of the little mistakes here and there

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.310
all kind of equalize of normalize
in the entire flow of the painting.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.740
So let's see if it happens.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.120
Now I'm going to start thinking about
the next color to apply to the canvas.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.540
And what I've done is to use the same
exact paint I use for the ground here.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.830
And to give myself just
a little blank here to test the kind of blue-ish

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.589
grey
that I've chosen to work over it.

00:12:32.589 --> 00:12:37.230
So in the pan here,
a little bit of acrylic emotion black, a little

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:43.779
bit of ultramarine, little
bit of our old friend titanium white.

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:46.950
And a little bit of gloss medium here.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.830
Now this looks white, right now,
but that dries clear so don't be confused

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:56.140
by that I'm using
a Golden product here, polymer medium.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.350
This is the same kind of stuff
that's already in the tube and it comes in

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.650
two flavors, glossy or matte.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:05.110
Here I'm choosing glossy because I want
the marks I'm about to make to really leap

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.110
off of the canvas.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:11.620
And what I'm going to do to make
this painting rhyme a little bit more visually

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.770
is to start off with
that same yellow as my base coat.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:21.830
This is a nice easy way to guarantee
that the color that I'm about to mix has something

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.650
to do with
the color that I've already used.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:29.280
So I'm going to take
a little bit of black, Then I'm going to cool

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.620
it off
with a little bit of blue.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:42.029
I'm going to ensure that
this gets nice and glossy.

00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:46.010
Now by the way, not only does this make it
glossy, it also makes it more translucent.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.530
So be careful, don't add too much.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.140
You may say, I want it really,
really glossy.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.850
But suddenly it becomes
really translucent, and you get that color

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.990
underneath it too much.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.310
Now I'm going for something that
actually has a nice body here.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.830
And I want to cover up that yellow,
so I don't want to overdo it and make this

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:02.830
too translucent.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.910
So, I'm making this nice and
homogeneous here.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:10.920
I'm going to lighten it up
a little bit with some white.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:18.480
I'm going to add just a little bit of
water here to make sure that this doesn't

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.990
dry out on me.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:29.000
So, I'm just going to pick up
a little of that paint here and lay it on

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.490
that color that
I put out beforehand.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.450
I like this.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:39.120
You have a nice neutral cool gray over
this really light hot yellow background.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.750
It's a nice push pull relationship
hot colors, cool colors.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.760
In fact the cool colors
on top of the hot colors which allows them

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.920
to kind of
sandwich around the picture plan.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:15:02.620
Remember the push pull color theory
that we've talked about previously in the

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.940
course.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:15.360
So what I'm doing here is using
a round and as you can see here, the beginning

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.700
of each brush stroke is
going to have the profile of that brush, which

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.149
is quite round, just the left
of each one of these brush strokes.

00:15:22.149 --> 00:15:24.399
But when I pick it up,
I can pick it up flat.

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:30.240
And working from left to right, starting
round with a full load of paint and then trailing

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.302
off flat to the middle,
eventually I'll turn this around and come

00:15:33.302 --> 00:15:34.930
from the other side.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:41.590
Another rule that I've kind of self
imposed here is that I'm reloading every other

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.590
brush stroke.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.960
And I do that one and I'm going to flip it
over and paint with side of the brush for

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.339
the next stroke.

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:49.339
And then reload.

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:54.420
Now, I want to do this
the entire painting So that there is a logic

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.370
there to
how this painting should work.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.260
However, you can see all of
these marks are not the same.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.399
In fact, some of them aren't even close.

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:05.430
Now I'm breaking the rule here and
fussing a little bit.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.440
Try not to fuss too much,
because the more you fuss, actually, the further

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:15.649
away you get from this fresh,
direct, spontaneous type of painting

00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:16.649
that we're after here.

00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:20.490
Now, if you really screw something up,
then by all means try to save it.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:27.600
But again, Agnes herself,
the way she would deal with screw ups is usually

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:34.300
just to chuck the entire
painting rather than to fuss.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.880
So essentially what's happening here,
is we're really playing with this tension

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.730
between the geometric
determinancy of the grid, platonic geometry,

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.420
something that our minds know is perfect.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.850
But the tension between all of that
perfection, that conceptual perfection and

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:56.480
manual imprecision that we have because,
well, face it, you're human.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.210
You make lots of mistakes,
that's what we are best at.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:07.639
And really, this is what makes Martin's
works tick, is the fact that humans are filled

00:17:07.639 --> 00:17:13.189
with errors, yet
we know the concept of perfection.

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:19.569
In fact, where the hell did we
invent the idea of a triangle from?

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.850
Where in nature have you ever seen
a triangle, a perfect triangle?

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.269
But we all know what it is.

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:28.630
Why is that?

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.779
I don't know either.

00:17:31.779 --> 00:17:35.610
But it's pretty interesting that geometry
is something that is extremely human, yet

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.759
it's some that we're extremely
bad at actually making.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:42.519
In fact this grid is not a grid,
it's filled with errors.

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:46.149
These brush marks here,
nothing complicated here, but I haven't been

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:48.049
able to make
two of them identical yet.

00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:54.509
So what's going to happen
if we pull this off right, Is that we're going

00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:58.710
to have this beautiful
tension in the entire painting between exactly

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:05.190
those two variables,
perfection and imperfection.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:10.440
I'm going to come back and fill in
the right half of that first column, but I'm

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.490
going to do it from the other side.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.400
So I'm going to flip the painting
over by the time I get there.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.049
The reason is, I've decided,
and this is arbitrary, there's a million different

00:18:19.049 --> 00:18:21.159
approaches
to make an Agnes Martin painting.

00:18:21.159 --> 00:18:23.659
No need to copy mine.

00:18:23.659 --> 00:18:27.909
But I've decided that these brush
strokes are going to go from the outside in,

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:30.990
both of them.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:42.289
You could do the opposite and
go from the inside out.

00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:44.799
So here, I've finished my first pass.

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:48.780
I've worked on the left side
of each one of these columns.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.200
With a brush stroke working
from left to right.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.380
I'm not going to work on the right side
from right to left, but rather than try to

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.361
paint with my left hand,
I'm just going to flip the painting over.

00:18:58.361 --> 00:19:02.720
The reason I'm doing this is that symmetry
is very important to Martin paintings.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:10.869
Symmetry is very easy on the eye, and
her paintings are certainly that.

00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:25.289
All right, so just finishing up
that pass of brush strokes here.

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:29.659
And to my eye, we have a pretty nice looking
painting that we're looking at here.

00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:33.970
A couple things I want to bring your
attention to, first of all, the edges of the

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:39.370
grid I left open, whereas the top and
the bottom of the grid I closed off.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.720
This gives the painting a little bit
more horizontality, and a little bit of a

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.869
floating feeling, which is nice,
rather than boxing it off that way.

00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:50.730
You also could open up the top and bottom
to really give a lot more

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.809
air into the entire composition.

00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:56.830
As this painting is reaching completion,
one thing that Martin often did, that you

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.240
may also want to do,
is to varnish the painting.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.309
You'd likely want to use some kind of
a synthetic, probably an acrylic varnish.

00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:08.461
But you would not want to brush on
this varnish because if you did that, you'd

00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:13.369
lose almost all of your drawn grid
here as that graphite would just get dissolved

00:20:13.369 --> 00:20:17.210
into the water of that
acrylic varnish and be dispersed.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.489
In other words, you'd probably
want to use a spray varnish on this, or just

00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:23.110
leave it with this
very fine matte surface.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.309
It's a beautiful matte surface.

00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:30.519
The only problem with leaving it
matte is that it is quite fragile, it is quite

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:31.629
vulnerable.

00:20:31.629 --> 00:20:34.619
So if we're to wrap this painting with
something directly on the surface or if we

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:37.210
rubbed it and
touched it with something, that graphite line

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:42.019
would be smudged and
eventually rubbed right off.

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:45.279
But there we have it, a beautiful little painting
in

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:47.840
the style of Agnes Martin here.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.600
Working with acrylics, some cool colors
and this broken brush work on top, working

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.211
with graphite and
this broken line in the background, and then

00:20:55.211 --> 00:20:59.049
working with this very nice,
nebulous, warm yellow ground.
