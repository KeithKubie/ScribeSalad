00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.400
Émile Durkheim is the philosopher who can best help us to understand

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.180
why capitalism makes us richer and yet frequently more miserable.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.440
He was born in 1858 in the little french town of Épinale near the German border.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.160
Before he was forty, Durkheim was appointed to a powerful and prestigious position:

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.800
as a professor at the Sorbonne in Paris.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.520
Durkheim lived through the immense, rapid transformation of France.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.740
From a largely traditional agricultural society...

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.740
...to an urban industrial economy.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600
He could see that his country was getting richer;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.480
that capitalism was extraordinarily productive

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.160
and, in certain ways, that it was also liberating.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.900
But what particularly struck him and became the focus of his entire scholarly career,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.080
was that the economic system was doing something very peculiar to people's minds.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.880
It was, quite literally, driving them to suicide.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.600
In ever increasing numbers.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.960
This was the immense insight unveiled in Durkheim's most important work: Suicide, published in 1897.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.320
The book chronicled the remarkable and tragic discovery

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.700
that suicide rates seem to shoot up once a nation has become industrialized

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.160
and consumer capitalism takes hold.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.680
Durhkheim observed that the suicide rate of Britain of his day was double that of Italy

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.000
but in even richer and more advanced Denmark it was four times higher than in the UK.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.880
Durkheim's focus on suicide was intended to shed light

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.820
on a more general level  of unhappiness and dispair in society.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.140
Suicide was the horrific tip of the iceberg of mental distress created by modern capitalism.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.080
Across his career, Durkheim tried to explain why people had become so unhappy in modern societies,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.580
and he isolated five crucial factors:

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.260
1-In traditional societies, people's identities are closely tied to belonging to a clan or a class.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.100
Few choices are involved;

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.120
a person might be a baker, a lutheran or married to their second cousin without ever having made any self-conscious decisions for themselves.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.120
They can just step into a place created for them by their family and the existing fabric of society.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.380
But under modern capitalism,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.700
it's the individual that now begins to choose everything: what job to take, what religion to follow, who to marry and where to belong.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.140
If things go well, the individual takes all the credit.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.980
But if things go badly, the individual is in crueler place than ever before

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.240
for it seemingly means that there is no one else to blame but they themselves.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.900
Failure becomes a terrible judgement upon the individual.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.880
This is the particular burden of life in modern capitalism.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.540
Capitalism raises hopes: everyone, with effort, can become the boss.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.960
Advertising stokes ambition, by showing us limitless luxury that we could, if we play our cards right, secure very soon.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.800
The opportunities are said to be enormous, but so too are the possibilities for disappointment.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.760
In modern capitalism, envy grows rife.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.920
It is easy to become deeply dissatisfied with one's lot, not because it's objectively awful,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.120
but because of tormenting thoughts about all that is almost, but not quite, within reach.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.840
The cheery, boosterish side of capitalism attracted Durkheim's particular annoyance.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.200
In his view, modern society struggled to admit life just is, often, quite painful and sad.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.720
Our tendencies to grief and sorrow are made to look like signs of failure

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.380
rather than, as should be the case, a fair response to the arduous facts of human condition.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.160
One of the complaints against traditional societies, strongly voiced in Romantic literature,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.580
is that people need more freedom.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.040
Rebellious types used to complain that there were far too many social norms.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.480
Norms telling you what to wear, what you're supposed to do on Sunday afternoons, what parts of an arm is respectable for women to reveal.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:24.260
Capitalism, following the earlier efforts of Romantic rebels, has relentlessly undermined social norms.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.500
Countries have become more complex, more anonymous and more diverse.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.760
People don't have so much in common with one another anymore,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.060
the collective answers to even very important questions like

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.400
who should you marry or how should you bring up your children

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.400
have become weaker and less specific.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.900
There's a lot of reliance on the phrase 'Whatever works for you',

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.680
which sounds friendly, but it also means that society doesn't much care what you do

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.240
and doesn't feel confident that it has good answers to the big questions of your life.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.000
In upbeat moments, we like to think of ourselves as fully up to the task of reinventing life

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.280
and working everything out for ourselves.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.880
But in reality, as Durkheim knew, we're often simply too tired, too busy, too uncertain

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.040
and then there's nowhere to turn.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.300
Durkheim was himself an atheist, but he worried that religion has become implausible

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.740
just as its best side, its communal side, would've been most useful to repair the fraying social fabric.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.800
Despite its factual errors in its fantastical dimensions, Durkheim appreciated religion.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.880
He knew that the sense of community and consolation that religion offer are highly important to people.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.820
Capitalism has, as yet, offered nothing to replace this with.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.560
Science certainly doesn't offer the same opportunities for powerful shared experiences.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.940
The periodic table might well possess a transcendent beauty and be a marvel of intellectual elegance,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.280
but it can't draw a society together around it.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.360
In the nineteenth century, it had looked at certain moments, as if the idea of the nation

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.860
might grow so powerful and intense that it could take up the sense of belonging and shared devotion

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.100
that had once been supplied by religion.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.760
Admittedly, there were some heroic moments, but they generally didn't work out very well.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.980
Family too seemed for a time to offer the experience of belonging that people seem to need.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.520
But today, although we do indeed invest hugely in our families,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.780
they're not as stable as we might hope

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.460
and by adulthood children are hardly tied to their parents anymore.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.240
They don't expect to work alongside them, they don't expect their social circles to overlap

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.460
and they don't feel and they don't feel that their parent's honour is in their hands.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:54.420
Today, neither family nor the nation are well placed to take up the task of giving us a larger sense of belonging,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.000
of giving us the feeling we're part of something more valuable than ourselves.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.060
Émile Durkheim was a master diagnostician of our ills.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.460
He shows us that modern economies put tremendous pressures on individuals

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.660
and leave them dangerously bereft of authoritative guidance and communal solace.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.400
We are all Durkheim's heirs and still have ahead of us the task that he grappled with.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.780
How we can create new ways of belonging,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.520
how we can take some of the pressure off individuals

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.220
and find a more correct balance between freedom and solidarity

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:34.880
and how to generate ideologies that will allow us not to be so tough on ourselves for our failures and our setbacks.
