LISA BLOOM: Well,
hello everyone.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.530
And thank you so much
for joining us here

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.890
at Talk at Google.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.020
And we're here at Google LA.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.340
My name is Lisa Bloom.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.190
And I'm very privileged
to have the opportunity

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.229
to interview Gene Baur.

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:21.770
I'll tell you about
Gene in a second.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.480
I'm a civil rights attorney
here in Los Angeles.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.770
I do race and sex
discrimination cases,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.510
police excessive force cases.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.490
I'm also an author and
legal analyst for NBC News.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.730
And I appear frequently on CNN
and another networks talking

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.900
about the big legal
issues of the day.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900
But for today, I'm
here in my role

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.780
as vegan and an animal activist.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.160
I am personally a
very passionate vegan

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.350
and animal rights person.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.910
I've been vegetarian since
1977, vegan since 2009.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.930
And I'm here to say that it's
a very easy, wonderful life not

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.550
participating in animal cruelty.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.340
I thought it would be difficult,
but in fact, it's very easy.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.740
But enough about me.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.340
I'm here to interview Gene Baur.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.525
Gene is the president and
co-founder of Farm Sanctuary.

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.750
And he's going to tell
us more about that.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.250
And he's also the author
of this wonderful new book,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.260
"Living the Farm Sanctuary
Life-- The Ultimate

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.900
Guide to Eating
Mindfully, Living Longer,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.980
and Feeling Better Every Day."

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.680
And who doesn't want to
have all of those things?

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.720
So I'm going to
interview Gene for a bit.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.082
And then we're going to
have questions and answers.

00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:28.540
I always love live
events because I

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.539
feel like it's a great
opportunity for everybody

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.590
to participate
and ask questions.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.650
We're actually here
live, in the flesh.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.550
This is not TV.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.522
So please ask us questions and
please interact at the end.

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:39.230
And don't be shy.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.940
I'm sure Gene is willing to
answer any questions that you

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.780
have.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.820
So, Gene, can you tell us a
little bit about Farm Sanctuary

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.940
and how it got started?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.190
GENE BAUR: Yeah.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.564
Farm Sanctuary is
an organization

00:01:48.564 --> 00:01:51.680
that works to protect
farm animals from cruelty,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.900
to challenge the
factory farming system,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.490
to change how our society
views and treats these animals,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.660
and to promote more mindful
compassionate living.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.990
Most people are humane.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.520
Most people are against cruelty.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.210
But most people are unwittingly
supporting a cruel system

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.400
through their food choices.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.070
And this is something
we grow up with.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.994
I grew up eating animals without
really thinking about it.

00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:14.410
So at Farm Sanctuary,
we just want

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.370
people to think about
the way we're living.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.270
And ultimately to
make choices that

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.620
are aligned with
their own values

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.282
that we can feel good about,
instead of what often happens

00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:26.490
when the topic of factory
farming or animal slaughter

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.189
comes up.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.230
People say don't tell me.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.104
I don't want to know.

00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:30.520
Because it's upsetting.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.800
And the fact that
it is upsetting

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.500
speaks to how it is not
aligned with our humanity

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.470
and our compassion.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.560
And we also grew up believing
we need animal foods for health.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.670
We need meat for
protein, for example.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.450
But we don't.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.850
So a big part of
what we do is dispel

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.277
these myths and these beliefs.

00:02:48.277 --> 00:02:50.360
And so Farm Sanctuary is
a place where the animals

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.200
are our friends, not our food.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.170
We started by
visiting factory farms

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.050
and documenting
conditions, finding

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.100
living animals
thrown in trash cans

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.950
or on piles of dead animals.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.010
So it started as an
investigation and an expose

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.440
of factory farming.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.560
And partly to heal
ourselves, as well as

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.080
to help individual animals,
we started rescuing animals

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.010
because seeing horrible
thing after horrible thing is

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.124
difficult. And it
does something to you.

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:17.540
It does something to people
that work in these industries.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.000
And I feel bad for people
that work at slaughterhouses.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.190
I just saw something
this morning

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.730
online about a case in Ohio
where an egg factory and people

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.570
involved with it are being
charged with slave labor.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.260
So people that work
in these places

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.900
are also not treated well.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.970
To me, being vegan,
really, is an aspiration

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.010
to live as kindly as possible.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.990
And not eating animal foods and
choosing to eat plants instead,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.880
is a pretty easy way to do that.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.060
And if somebody can't
do it overnight,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.310
they can do it incrementally.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.480
And that's a big part of
what the book's about.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.540
LISA BLOOM: There's a great part
in the book about small steps

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.081
you can take.

00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:56.580
Because I think
for a lot of people

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.220
the idea of going vegan
entirely seems really extremely

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.509
and difficult and scary.

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.050
Even though I'm here
to say it's not.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.341
But I want to talk about
those small steps in a minute.

00:04:04.341 --> 00:04:06.570
But what is a Farm
Sanctuary for people

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.737
who aren't familiar with it?

00:04:07.737 --> 00:04:09.778
GENE BAUR: It's a sanctuary
where the animals get

00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:10.870
to live out their lives.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.270
And we have three farms.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.290
One in Watkins Glen, New York,
one in Northern California,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.000
and one in Acton.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.700
And so if they're sick, we
take them to the veterinarian.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.200
Whereas on factory
farms and in production,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.390
if an animal is sick, they're
oftentimes just left to die

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.740
or sent to slaughter.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.140
Because, financially, if
an animal's worth $10,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.360
or if it's a chicken
they're worth even less.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.730
It's not worth it economically
to spend $50 on a veterinarian.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.866
So the animals are our
friends at Farm Sanctuary.

00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:39.240
And it's a place
where people get

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.430
a chance to interact with
them, to come up and give

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.990
a pig a belly rub.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.660
Like 800 pound pigs, you walk up
to them, you touch your belly,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.200
they flop over for a belly rub.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.950
LISA BLOOM: Aww.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.658
GENE BAUR: We do other
events at the farm

00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:53.220
where we encourage people
just to think differently

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.170
about these animals.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.130
For Thanksgiving every
year we do a celebration

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.630
for the turkeys, where the
turkeys are our guests, not

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.840
the main course.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.050
So we turn the tables.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.830
And, of course, have vegan food.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.240
LISA BLOOM: I always say,
if we can pardon one turkey,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.920
as the president does every year
in the weirdest political event

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.650
of the year.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.420
Every year, right?

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.715
That weird turkey pardon.

00:05:13.715 --> 00:05:15.840
If we can pardon one, why
can't we pardon them all?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.410
And I've been to your Farm
Sanctuary Thanksgiving event.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.810
And it's a wonderful event.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.790
And I encourage everybody
to check that out.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.060
GENE BAUR: But it's really
true, though, how we

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.494
have this big public pardoning.

00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:25.660
LISA BLOOM: It's so bizarre.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.118
GENE BAUR: And at
the same time, we

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.380
have millions of
dead bird bodies

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.290
on plates around the country.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.430
So there's this irony, and this
disconnect, and this conflict,

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.180
in a sense, between sort of
our humanity and our compassion

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.030
and our desire to live
well without causing harm.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.810
And one of the
things that we say

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.360
is, if we can live well without
causing unnecessary harm,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.115
why wouldn't we?

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.990
LISA BLOOM: And I want
to encourage everybody

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.359
to look at the books
that are on your seats

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:54.400
and the seats around you.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.990
Because there's
just these beautiful

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.550
photographs in the book
right at the beginning

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.990
and throughout the book.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.110
As Gene says, a lot of
times, animal rights things

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.537
can bombard you with
these horrible videos

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:08.620
that are just very painful
and difficult to watch.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.830
This is the opposite.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.440
These are beautiful images.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.110
These are positive images.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.160
And, frankly, it's kind
of refreshing as somebody

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.900
who works in the
animal rights movement

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.180
to see the positive stuff.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.110
And to come at this more
the carrot than the stick.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.440
GENE BAUR: Yeah.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.990
Seeing those ugly
images is very painful.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.250
And sometimes people
do turn off to them

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.742
because they don't
want to see it.

00:06:29.742 --> 00:06:32.200
I think is important to know
about that and be aware of it.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.870
So I think those images are very
helpful in terms of advancing

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.400
awareness about these issues.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.466
But they can be
very depressing too.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:41.340
And we need to know that
there is a solution.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.490
There is something
we can do to prevent

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.180
this abuse and this
horror from continuing.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.370
And the good news is
that every day each of us

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.079
makes choices that
can make a difference.

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.661
There's many things
in this world that

00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:55.080
are outside of our control.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.870
And we feel helpless.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.060
But when it comes to
what we eat every day,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.200
we have a lot of
power over that.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.560
And so being vegan
for many people,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.610
myself included, is a very
empowering kind of statement.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.750
It's something you can do.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.820
It's very affirmative.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.010
And you know, Farm Sanctuary,
in this book particularly,

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.390
is really about taking
steps and building momentum

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.055
towards living more mindfully,
more compassionately, more

00:07:18.055 --> 00:07:18.555
healthfully.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.200
I went vegan in 1985.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.294
And at the time, I was primarily
concerned about animal cruelty.

00:07:26.294 --> 00:07:27.710
And I didn't want
to support that.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.790
But I wasn't as health oriented.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.100
So I was eating
noodles and margarine

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.780
and not the healthiest things.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.030
And as a vegan, you
can eat Oreos and Coke.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.000
And that's not the
healthiest thing.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.120
In recent years,
I've become more,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.500
I think, holistic in this.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.290
And trying to eat more whole
foods, all plant foods.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.330
But more fresh plant foods,
like fruits, vegetables,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.324
less processed food.

00:07:50.324 --> 00:07:52.490
So I think that's an important
part of this as well.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.540
Not only to leave animal
foods off the plate,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.560
but to eat whole plant foods.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.040
And it's been estimated we could
save 70% on health care costs

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.125
by eating a whole
foods, plant-based diet

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:03.910
in this country.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.700
That is massive.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.280
If you think of the cost
associated with health care.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.240
And in addition to the pain and
suffering people experience,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.380
if we could alleviate that,
it makes a lot of sense.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.950
So what we're
talking about is not

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.120
only aligned with
our values, it's

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.470
aligned with our interests.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.670
It doesn't make sense.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.670
It's irrational to eat
food that makes us sick.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.020
But we do that in this country.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.910
And we die younger
than we need to.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.555
We suffer from heart
problems and cancers

00:08:30.555 --> 00:08:31.555
that could be prevented.

00:08:31.555 --> 00:08:33.480
Or the risks certainly
could be lessened

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.750
by eating plant foods instead.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.240
So this is about living in a way
that is healthy for us and then

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.345
the environment.

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:41.970
The United Nations
has put out a report

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.070
talking about how
animal agriculture is

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.660
the top contributor to the most
serious environmental problems

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.990
we're facing, including
climate change.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.970
United Nations talks about how
animal agriculture contributes

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.590
more to climate change than the
entire transportation industry.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.230
So this is another thing, where
by making food choices that

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.420
are mindful, we can take a
bite out of all these problems.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.120
So the more you look at it,
the more sense it makes.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.690
LISA BLOOM: So obviously,
you're obese and disease-ridden

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.935
and protein deprived.

00:09:10.935 --> 00:09:15.870
And probably have a very
short lifespan ahead of you.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.120
How old are you, if I may ask?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.720
GENE BAUR: I am 52.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.195
Gonna be 53 in a couple weeks.

00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:20.820
LISA BLOOM: OK.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.770
So I'm 53.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.280
And one of the
things that we always

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.863
notice when we go
to vegan restaurants

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:27.740
is how everybody's in pretty
good shape and pretty healthy.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.450
And it's kind of a
joke among vegans.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.080
And another joke among
vegans is the question

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.130
that we always get, which is,
where do you get your protein?

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.222
And I don't mean that
in a derisive way

00:09:37.222 --> 00:09:38.680
because it's a
legitimate question.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.800
We've all been so
brainwashed to think

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.940
that we have to eat
animals or animal products.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.126
Otherwise we just wither
away from lack of protein.

00:09:46.126 --> 00:09:47.750
So can you address
that issue for those

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.710
who might be wondering?

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.626
GENE BAUR: Absolutely.

00:09:49.626 --> 00:09:53.440
Well, we actually eat way too
much protein in this country.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.210
And that creates
problems as well.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.780
Excessive protein in our bodies
creates an acidic condition.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.570
And when you have that
it has to be neutralized.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.600
And oftentimes it is
neutralized with calcium,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.010
which is leached from our
bodies, leached from our bones

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.940
and contributes to
things like osteoporosis.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.020
In this country we have a huge
problem with osteoporosis.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.362
And we also drink a
lot of cow's milk.

00:10:16.362 --> 00:10:18.570
But we've been told that
drinking cow's milk prevents

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.390
osteoporosis.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.860
So there's a disconnect there.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.800
So excess protein
is more of a problem

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.190
than not enough protein.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.160
And there's protein in things
like potatoes and broccoli,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.060
believe it or not.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.030
Not a lot of it,
but there is some.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.350
If you want higher
protein content,

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.110
you can have beans, which
have plenty of protein

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.610
and also a lot of fiber.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.510
Tofu, tempeh, whole
grains, quinoa

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.090
are good sources of protein.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.870
Greens are good
source of protein.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.660
But eating a whole
foods, plant-based diet

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.930
and eating a variety
of foods is probably

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.710
the best nutritional advice.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.960
And by doing that you'll get
all the protein you need.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.170
There's never been a
documented case of somebody

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:01.014
who has had protein deficiency,
if they have had enough food.

00:11:01.014 --> 00:11:02.680
The only time you see
protein deficiency

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.650
is if people are not
getting enough food.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.080
So if we eat just a whole
foods, plant-based diet

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.282
in a variety of things,
it does us very well.

00:11:10.282 --> 00:11:10.990
LISA BLOOM: Yeah.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.540
We really don't have any
problem with protein deficiency

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.040
in America.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.560
What we do have a problem
with is fiber deficiency.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.060
And so if you turn
on the TV, you'll

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.820
see all these ads
for yogurts and pills

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.080
that you need to take because
you have digestive problems.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.950
And I always want to scream back
to the TV, just eat vegetables.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:28.950
GENE BAUR: It's so true.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.410
I mean if there's
one nutrient that we

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.650
need to say more Americans
need to eat, it's fiber.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.260
I mean because that is
linked to whole plant foods.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.290
So that really is one of
the most important messages.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.570
So eating greens,
eating big salads

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.880
with like beans on it and nuts
or whatever you want to add,

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.740
croutons, there's
all kinds of things.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.750
You can make some amazing salads
with a large bed of greens.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.630
And arugula is actually
a performance enhancer

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.650
for athletes.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.365
What I found basically there
is, you just eat the same foods,

00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:06.070
you just have to eat a lot more,
if you're training and burning

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.990
a lot of calories.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.490
But these greens and
especially arugula

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.332
can actually
enhance performance.

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:14.540
I mention Scott Jurek before,
who's an elite athlete.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.510
He's written about this.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.450
There's also a guy,
Patrick Baboumian,

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.960
who broke the world
record carrying

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.980
the most weight of any person.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.920
And he's a vegan.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.780
So he also might have some
ideas about elite performance.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.850
For me, I would just
eat a lot more food.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.440
And things like arugula, I found
to be a performance enhancer.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.970
But I'm also more of
a distance person,

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.680
as opposed to,
perhaps, explosive.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.125
And so there are, I'm sure,
plant foods that could be used.

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:42.750
I don't know enough
about them, though,

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.400
to give you really solid advice.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.880
But I would do it slowly.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.600
And dates, for example,
are pretty dense.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.625
You probably need to go
to dense foods, nuts.

00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:54.000
You could probably
make something

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.114
with a dried fruit and--

00:12:55.114 --> 00:12:56.030
LISA BLOOM: Smoothies.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.655
GENE BAUR: nut.

00:12:56.655 --> 00:13:00.130
Smoothies are really great.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.140
But dense foods, probably.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.310
And you could put nut
butters in smoothies

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.381
to get additional
kick, if you needed it.

00:13:07.381 --> 00:13:08.880
LISA BLOOM: I've
also run marathons.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.505
And I do a lot a long
distance cycling.

00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:13.610
And I get what you're
saying that you're hungry.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.010
And you're big guy, right?

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:16.880
I love smoothies.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.980
In fact I had one this
morning with peanut butter,

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.834
or almond butter,
or with bananas.

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:23.000
It's also great if you're
busy and you're on the go.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.550
You could take it in the car.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.034
There's a lot you can do.

00:13:27.034 --> 00:13:27.700
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:27.930
Thank you.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:28.220
LISA BLOOM: All right.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.470
GENE BAUR: Thank you very much.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.720
LISA BLOOM: Thank you everybody
for turning out again.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.365
Thank you Talk at
Google and Google LA.

00:13:33.365 --> 00:13:34.240
Really appreciate it.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.615
And thank you so
much, Gene Baur.

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:37.600
GENE BAUR: Thank you, Lisa.
