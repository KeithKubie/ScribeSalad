[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:13.930
PETER BARRON: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.310
Great to see.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.040
Welcome to Evan--

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.920
EVAN DAVIS: Thank you.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.360
Nice to be here.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.568
PETER BARRON: --who obviously
most of you will know--

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:23.310
BBC Newsnight presenter,
top economist, and author.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.342
And I must say, after
the last couple of days

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:26.800
that we've been
doing this, this is

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.340
a bit of an oasis, a
blessed relief where

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.800
we can get away from antitrust
and talk about bullshit.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.730
Excellent, so Evan's
book, "Post-Truth--

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.837
Why We Have Reached
Peak Bullshit and What

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:39.670
We Can Do About It."

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.800
Now, it's something
of a crowded market.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.189
I've seen something like--

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:45.980
EVAN DAVIS: Three came
out on the same day.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.410
PETER BARRON: --at
least three books

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.780
that came out on the
same day on this subject.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.270
EVAN DAVIS: There was a
bit of bunching, I think.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.070
Because if you're aware
the others are coming out,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.320
then you all start trying
to come out on the same day,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.200
but it's a popular topic--

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.557
Oxford dictionary's
word of the year.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:00.640
I actually, slightly
differently to the other two,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.800
had started work on this
one, God knows how long ago,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.150
just because I observed so
much bullshit in my day job.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.400
And actually in
economics, there's a--

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.470
economists study bullshit.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.680
I mean, there's a whole field
of information economics.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.880
And economists basically
work on the assumption

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.120
that if you, Peter,
said something

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.990
to me that you would say,
regardless of whether it was

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.600
true or not, if you
would say that anyway,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.550
I would be mad to believe you.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.799
So I wouldn't believe you.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.340
And so you wouldn't
bother saying it.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.950
I mean, that is basically what
economists call an equilibrium.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.182
I won't believe you if
you'd say it anyway.

00:01:41.182 --> 00:01:43.640
You won't say it because you
won't waste your breath on it.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.480
And there will be no bullshit
in the world of economic theory.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.320
And this has earned people
Nobel Prizes, that insight.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.570
And then we observed there
is quite a lot of bullshit.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.520
So I actually started out--

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.280
before "Post-Truth"
and the other books.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.030
I started out thinking,
why is there so much of it

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.190
if the theory says
there shouldn't be any?

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.820
PETER BARRON: And
then you had to rush

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.690
to get it finished, did you?

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.190
As--

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.420
EVAN DAVIS: Well, then, it
had been sort of moving--

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.240
progressing a little slowly,
and Tim, the very excellent

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.380
publisher, then said,
Evan, this is the time

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.730
to publish a book on bullshit.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.105
And you've got to finish it,
and we've got to get it out.

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:19.189
So that was, yeah, it was.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.855
PETER BARRON: So I
was kind of expecting

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:22.480
a book about fake
news, and there's

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.630
a bit of a fake news in
it, but it's primarily not

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.480
about fake news.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.835
It's about the sort of
bullshit in society as a whole.

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:29.210
EVAN DAVIS: Right.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.850
So it has application
to fake news,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.500
but essentially, it started out
and remains primarily a book

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.500
that is trying to explain
why in politics, business,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.870
and journalism, people are often
not entirely straightforward.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.270
And why it is believable
when they're not

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.430
entirely straightforward, why we
fall or why that works to not--

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.110
so you're trying
to explain that.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.980
When you get into that, that
sort of the general theory

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.250
of bullshit bit, when
you get into that,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.600
you see that everything
that happened in 2016--

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.300
and Brexit and Trump, and indeed
in the last election, Corbyn

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.230
and May, the way that played
out and other things too--

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.330
you see that the theory kind
of explains or has something

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.480
to do with quite a lot of
the new political divide

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.350
between populism and liberalism.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.950
And that political schism can
be explained in terms of some--

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.480
I mean, just to give
you a very quick peek.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.060
I think one of the reasons why
Trumps and Farages have been

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.430
very popular is because the
traditional politicians,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.680
their communication
repertoire, has run out.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.530
Their bullshit has faded,
basically, and become

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.180
rather tiresome to many voters.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.010
And a Trump comes
along-- and you know,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.760
you can say whatever
you like about Trump,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.677
but that guy can kind of
communicate in many respects.

00:03:56.677 --> 00:03:58.260
PETER BARRON: So
you're kind of saying

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.870
it doesn't have to be true
to reveal a wider truth.

00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:07.090
EVAN DAVIS: OK, when we
look at why there's so much

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.120
bullshit, one of
the reasons is, is

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.150
that a lot of stuff
that looks like bullshit

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.560
is deeply informative.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.430
And it's not about the truth
value of the proposition,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.980
it's about the
underlying message.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.390
And so Trump came along--

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.940
I'll stick with Trump because
it's a bit further removed

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.390
from our country.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.470
Trump came along and spoke
what most people regarded

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.390
as bullshit.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.800
So he would say, unemployment
in the US isn't 5%,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.180
it's 40%, which
is simply untrue.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.817
And even a mild modicum of
knowledge on the subject

00:04:49.817 --> 00:04:52.150
would tell you it's not true,
and even just anecdotally,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.870
it's not true.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.470
It's not 40%.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.960
But when he says that, he's
trying to communicate something

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.660
a little bit deeper, which is
not about is it true or not.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.570
He's trying to say,
I'm on the side

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.300
of the American worker
who feels picked on

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.400
and doesn't have
security in that job.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.540
And I worry about blue
collar America rather than

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.940
LGBT rights, which is what
Hillary Clinton is banging on

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.440
about.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.770
So all the time,
Trump's bullshit

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.282
was designed to signal
something about Trump.

00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:29.740
And in fact in the book, I talk
about him and Wrestlemania.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.870
If you've seen the YouTube
videos of Donald Trump,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.990
his participation in World
Wrestling Entertainment

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.980
and Battle of the Billionaires.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.827
And this goes back a bit
before he was a politician.

00:05:42.827 --> 00:05:44.410
Now, in a funny sort
of way, you might

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.000
say that the bit where he
body slams Vince McMahon,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.780
and they fall to the ground and
scrap each other, I don't know,

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.390
but I'm suspecting there was
a bit of theater or stagecraft

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.690
to that encounter.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.690
But again, you could
call it bullshit,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.410
but also you could call
it quite informative.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.725
I don't think Hillary Clinton
could have done that, you know.

00:06:08.725 --> 00:06:10.960
So you learn
something about Trump

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.830
from his willingness
to play that game.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.679
So by your bullshit, I
learned something about you.

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.470
PETER BARRON: In the
beginning of the book,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.170
you talk quite a bit about--

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.400
you sort of define bullshit
and different kinds

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.080
of bullshit and so on.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.570
You make the point that
there's a cost to lying.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.690
People don't want
to be called a liar.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.410
EVAN DAVIS: No.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.826
PETER BARRON: But
it's quite clear

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:33.100
that some of the things
that Trump is saying

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.210
are demonstrably not true.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.780
So how does he kind of
gotten away with and not

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.160
felt the cost of lying?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.990
EVAN DAVIS: Yeah,
so the first point

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.920
is that actual direct lies,
for complicated reasons

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.900
I've never quite
managed to work out,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.850
direct lies carry a
disproportionate penalty

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.420
relative to simply
misleading people

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.430
by being selective
with the facts,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.100
or being economical
with the truth,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.330
or carefully positioning words
that in the Bill Clinton,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.310
"I didn't have sexual relations
with that woman" kind of way

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.360
were designed to mislead
while not actually lying.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.680
I think he probably slightly--

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.590
PETER BARRON: Actually, apology,
but go into a little bit

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.350
more detail on that because
it was pretty extraordinary,

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.940
the dancing around and the
meaning of words on that.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.773
EVAN DAVIS: But your
question was, why did--

00:07:24.773 --> 00:07:27.364
how has Trump got away
with saying stuff--

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.780
PETER BARRON: Or
are you declining

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.350
to talk about Clinton and his
sexual relations, are you?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.720
EVAN DAVIS: Oh no, I
will talk about it.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.136
I'll come back to
that, but I want

00:07:34.136 --> 00:07:37.150
to answer your first
question, which

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.300
is I don't know how Trump has
got away with it, actually.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.076
I don't know.

00:07:41.076 --> 00:07:42.200
I think if he had done it--

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.650
if he did it in court or
he did it in a solemn way.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.010
And I think the other thing
is I think Trump supporters,

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.970
they understand Trump.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.310
The quote of the election
campaign, almost a cliche now,

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.330
is the press took him
literally but not seriously,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.820
and the supporters took him
seriously but not literally.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.300
And so you kind of know
what you get with Trump.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.640
You know, he stood up at that
press conference and said,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.670
I have the biggest
electoral college vote

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.010
of any president since Reagan.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.630
And then the CNN
guy got up and said,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.570
well actually, Obama got
a bigger one than you.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.510
And he says, well, I
meant a Republican.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.700
And he says, and
George Bush the second

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.090
got a bigger one than you.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.030
And says, well, I
was told different.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.920
I was told different.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.320
I didn't know.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.770
Is that right?

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.436
But I had a great big
victory, didn't I?

00:08:28.436 --> 00:08:30.570
Do you agree I
had a big victory?

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.339
And so he's so blase
and you kind of--

00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:36.309
you would never really--

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.250
you would never really kind of
act on a sort of a Trumpism,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.770
would you?

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.370
You sort of know you have
to check the facts after.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.800
So I think in a way,
it's because he's

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.670
so blase with facts that
he gets away with it.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.390
Because no one is
any way misled.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.811
That's it.

00:08:56.811 --> 00:08:57.310
Clinton--

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.070
PETER BARRON: Clinton.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.570
EVAN DAVIS: Well
so, Clinton is just

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.179
a great example of bullshit and
the distinction between lying

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:03.720
and bullshit.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.170
I mean, bullshit is a
whole lot of things,

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.280
but Clinton's was "I didn't
have sexual relations

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.180
with that woman."

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.970
The people who had
interviewed him about this

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.670
had defined sexual relations.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.980
I can't remember what the
formal definition was,

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.290
but it was contact between any
genital part and another part,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.870
blah, blah, blah.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.590
And so they defined
it because they

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.750
knew Clinton might wriggle out.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.920
PETER BARRON: But he--

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.586
this is not really
safe for work, is it?

00:09:32.586 --> 00:09:34.906
But he kind of
argued that she was

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:36.280
having sexual
relations with him,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.260
but he wasn't having
sexual relations with her.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:37.760
EVAN DAVIS.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.070
But he didn't have relations.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.760
PETER BARRON: Strict definition.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.550
EVAN DAVIS: By the strict,
literal definition of the words

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.660
that they had--

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.330
and he said, well, I just
went by your definition,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.390
and I did wonder, you
know, as though he was just

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.750
doing his best to be helpful.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.315
But I mean, we know he wasn't.

00:09:55.315 --> 00:09:57.690
But bullshit comes in a lot
of other forms though, Peter.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.980
I mean because I
think you've got

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.370
that, which is very carefully
attuned to the facts.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.160
Clinton knew what the facts
were and was carefully dancing

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.122
around them.

00:10:07.122 --> 00:10:09.580
You've got a spin, which is
what you do all the time, which

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.000
is kind of trying--
you're never going to lie,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.660
but you're going to interpret
the facts in a generous way

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.140
to yourself.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.510
And then you've got
a whole lot of sort

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:27.209
of afactual forms of bullshit,
which is it's just not about

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:28.250
whether it's true or not.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.410
It's just about
attention-grabbing

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.350
or it's about gibberish.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.060
I quoted wine review in there.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.420
I mean literally, I
googled "wine review."

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.740
The first thing that came
up was a wine review,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.550
and I just read it.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.220
And it was just such gibberish.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.820
I thought that is a
fantastic example.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.880
It's It's not that
it's true or false--

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:55.250
and even itself it has
a purpose, you know.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.600
She obviously knows about
wine, but could she really

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.855
detect those seven flavors?

00:10:59.855 --> 00:11:01.340
I mean, I don't
believe she could

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.340
detect all of those
[? simultaneously ?]

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.240
and say they were
in sync, and it's

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.020
a juicy wine with a personality,
a structured personality.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.430
Do we really think wine--

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.300
PETER BARRON: Yeah, but it was
trying to tell you something.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.650
And then you mentioned
the advertising.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.330
So largely, advertising
is bullshit,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.830
and you don't believe the things
that happen in advertising,

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.207
but they are
nevertheless sending you

00:11:25.207 --> 00:11:25.410
an important message.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.118
EVAN DAVIS: Right, so
all this comes back

00:11:27.118 --> 00:11:29.060
to a lot of the time,
the bullshit you observe

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.000
has an underlying message.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.690
And yeah, so that wine
review is telling you--

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.836
A, she liked the wine.

00:11:36.836 --> 00:11:38.460
It was quite a long
way of saying that.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.670
B, it was a pleasure to read.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.830
And C, it told you
she knew about wine

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.630
because she knew
what words to throw

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.600
into the gibberish
of a wine review.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.380
But advertising is a
very interesting one

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.190
because economists have had
a bit to say about this.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.170
So if someone says,
buy my product,

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.230
it's the best
product in the world,

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.480
you'd be foolish really to
believe them because they'd

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.730
probably say that anyway.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.980
If they spend 20 million pounds
telling you, buy my product,

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.010
it's the best
product in the world,

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.140
should you believe them now?

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.477
At one level, you shouldn't
because 20 million pounds

00:12:19.477 --> 00:12:21.810
makes no difference to the
likelihood that they want you

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.850
to believe what they're saying.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.040
However, if they spend
20 million pounds

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.920
telling you to
buy their product,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.670
it tells you something
about how much belief

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:36.240
they have in their product
because they wouldn't spend

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.160
20 million pounds
on this if they

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.840
thought it was
just fly by night,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.800
here today, gone tomorrow.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.270
And so they're spending
20 million pounds

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.970
because they think
this product is good.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.710
And they may not
even understand that,

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.250
and you may not understand why
you respond to advertising.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.300
But there's a sort of an
underlying message there

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.370
that is carried by the
lavishness of the ad that says,

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.377
this is a product
we're investing in.

00:13:06.377 --> 00:13:07.710
And that's an important message.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.430
And if that means hiring
Catherine Zeta-Jones

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.130
to advertise your mobile
phone service, that

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:20.100
is better than hiring another
beautiful woman to market

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.360
your mobile phone
service because the fact

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.910
that you've hired
Catherine Zeta-Jones says,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.100
we really like this product.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.900
We're here and investing in it.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.740
And it's important as a
consumer that you know

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.030
that they like their product.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.405
So a lot of
advertising, I think,

00:13:37.405 --> 00:13:39.219
can be explained that way.

00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:40.760
PETER BARRON: Let's
talk a little bit

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.520
about the recent
election campaign.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.460
So it's a pretty extraordinary,
historically extraordinary

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.630
campaign, and you saw
Theresa May not doing well

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.250
by very much sticking
to soundbites, and then

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.310
Jeremy Corbyn apparently
being extremely authentic.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.000
So where was the bullshit there?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.890
EVAN DAVIS: Well, in some
ways you could write up

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:14.000
the UK election campaign as
similar to the US one, that you

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.900
had an outside politician who
had commanded a style that

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.300
was just more authentic,
less media savvy,

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.100
more kind of saying
what he thinks

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.250
against a traditional
politician with the controlled

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.340
messaging of traditional
political communication

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.740
industry.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.320
And in the kind of battle
of communication styles--

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.950
each, by the way, has
their own bullshit in them

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.740
and each has their own kind of--

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:47.120
their own style and their
own artifice and their own

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.020
promises.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.619
Some may or may not be
sustainable or deliverable,

00:14:50.619 --> 00:14:52.160
but they each have
their own elements

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.280
of kind of fantasy about them.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.730
And in the battle
of those styles,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.230
the old style political
bullshit was defeated.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.470
She won the election, but no one
would say she won the campaign.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:11.650
And personally, I think
that was the last time

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.970
that kind of
controlled messaging

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.190
can be deployed on anything like
that scale and expect to win.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.590
It's just worn out.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.080
And These things
will come and go.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.740
There will be a period
of the new style outsider

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.550
authenticity, and I'm sure
that will grow wearisome.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.600
And people will move
on to something else.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.240
But I definitely think
the spin and control

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:41.760
that one would say started
with new labor post '92,

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.370
it kind of peaked and
it started diminishing.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.940
And Theresa May's campaign was
the sort of last, last one.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.120
PETER BARRON: You talked
about peak bullshit.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.570
Where did peak bullshit happen?

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.490
Did it happen in the Brexit
vote or the Trump election?

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:00.630
Does Corbyn
represent the falling

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.329
of the line in
terms of bullshit?

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:04.870
Would you be able
to talk about that?

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.470
EVAN DAVIS: Yes, so I was
thinking of peak bullshits

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.140
back in 2013.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.830
And then 2016 came
along, and you

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.420
realize that these peaks
are like climbing hills.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.490
There's always another one just
beyond when you get to the top.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:24.030
No, I mean, I think
we're in an era--

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.430
this is one of the key
points of the book.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.180
I think we're in an era in
which politics is divided,

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.140
societies are feeling
discombobulated

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:39.420
by change, cultural change,
cultural and economic change.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:45.440
There's a discontent
around, and truth has come--

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.490
for this period of
our politics has

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.580
come to matter a bit less
than it sometimes does.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.850
So in the election
campaign, there

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.400
was less scrutiny
in this campaign

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.950
about whether the plans
added up or were sensible

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.390
or made were affordable.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.740
There was less of that.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.550
The campaign was more viscerally
about whose side are you on.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:14.280
Insiders, outsiders, liberals,
populists, globalists,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.900
or nationalists, these
divides have taken over.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.180
And with those divides
being very fearsomely

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.470
felt, a lot of people,
when a proposition pops out

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.730
of public discourse
to hit them--

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.220
we send 350 million
a week to the EU--

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:37.050
people are not
thinking, is this true?

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.970
Does it matter if it's true?

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.170
What is the evidence?

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.050
Who says this?

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.780
What interests do they
have in saying it.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.030
People are not appraising
it in that way.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.040
They're looking
at it and saying,

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.010
does my team believe this?

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.100
Is this what my side is?

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.060
And belief in propositions,
for the moment in our divided

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.640
times, is more about
a kind of tribal

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.230
belonging than about
evidence appraisal.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:10.460
And so yes, I think we are at
a high in terms of bullshit.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.470
And I think we're at a
high in terms of people

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.950
being willing to swallow
stuff, or like it on Facebook

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.600
and share it and regurgitate it
because our critical faculties

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.650
have been overcome by
our tribal allegiances.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.930
And I don't know about you.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.960
I see it with my
friends on Facebook,

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.990
who by and large are
kind of more metropolitan

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.450
than the typical bunch.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.130
And I just see
them liking stuff,

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.250
not because they've
thought about it

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.420
or that because
they're open-minded,

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.020
but because it makes
them feel good.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.970
So it's gratifying
to like something

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.410
which your friend
likes and which

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.250
is affirming him all in this
kind of common involvement.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.640
PETER BARRON: Yeah, and
what we saw after Brexit,

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.145
in particular, is people are
horrified by the Brexit vote

00:18:56.145 --> 00:19:00.930
so they shouted louder about why
our voters have voted that way.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.300
Counterproductive you would say.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.920
EVAN DAVIS: Well you see, I
think if you believe all that--

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.350
I think that one of the--

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.037
how to respond to
this phase we're in--

00:19:09.037 --> 00:19:10.870
I mean, look, bullshit's
always been with us

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.050
so I don't want to exaggerate
the point that we're

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.220
in an era of bullshit.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.370
But I do think we are in an
era of somewhat more of it

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.900
in public discourse.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:24.560
And if you want to deal with
that, I mean, some people will

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.890
say, well, you need arbiters.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.840
You need the Advertising
Standards Authority

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.190
to monitor advertising.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.680
And you need the
Statistics Authority

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.866
to monitor statistics.

00:19:32.866 --> 00:19:33.990
And you need a bit of that.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.670
I'm not against
that, but I think

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.810
it's less about arbiters of
what is true and what is false.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.260
It's much more
about getting people

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.620
to put evidence and
truth and reliability,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.570
back up their priority list.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.290
And to make people
worry more about truth,

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.730
you need for them to worry
less about their tribe's status

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.240
and their tribe's position.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.730
And if you are a
bunch of Brexiteers--

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.420
unlikely-- and I was
a remainer, and I

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.280
was trying to persuade
you you're wrong,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.740
shouting that you're a
bunch of dimwit idiots

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.240
who didn't know
what you were doing,

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.490
and you are gulled
by 350 million,

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.780
and don't you understand what
the economists have been saying

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:27.390
about how bad it will be, that
it is not going to persuade you

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.360
any more than trying to
have an argument about facts

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.470
with a 9/11 conspiracy
theorist will persuade them.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.970
It won't persuade them.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.690
So the way to persuade
you is to reduce

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:43.860
your sense of tribal
allegiance to your side.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.270
And the way to reduce your
sense of tribal allegiance

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.020
is to offer you more respect,
to listen harder, and have

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.980
a more gentle
conversation, and not

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.680
just to shout at you about
the facts and the proof

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.180
that you're wrong because that
really entrenches positions.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.360
Any of you have dogs
that sometimes you

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.970
tug the dog on the lead to
get it to come your way,

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.100
and sometimes that
makes the dogs want

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.946
to go that way even more.

00:21:11.946 --> 00:21:13.570
And I think there's
been a lot of that,

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.220
particularly on
the remainer side

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.160
of shouting at the Brexiteers.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.030
It's shouting about
how stupid they are,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.880
and I don't think that's a very
good way of persuading people

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.140
that they're wrong and
probably counterproductive.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.640
PETER BARRON: And
that kind of feeds

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.586
into your philosophy
of interviewing.

00:21:32.586 --> 00:21:34.210
And obviously, people
make the contrast

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.100
between you and Jeremy Paxman.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.470
And you saw the Jeremy Paxman
style in the election debate.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.380
Your attitude is to draw people
and draw things out of people

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.210
rather than be combative.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.580
EVAN DAVIS: Yeah,
I mean, I don't

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.160
think there's a right or
wrong interviewing style.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.280
And one or two newspapers
always try to set it up

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.170
as me against Paxman style.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.540
And I mean, Paxman is a god,
a giant among interviewers.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:09.100
And I'm a pigmy compared to
him, so that's not his at all.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.260
I think that there has
been a problem of everybody

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.100
trying to be a Paxman,
which has had the effect--

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.560
if you get too many
Paxmans, it has the effect

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.390
and has had the effect of
training our political class,

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.900
in particular to kind of
obfuscate rather didn't say

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.040
anything.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.550
So it sort of
works up to a point

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.380
and then you just train the
politician to be boring.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.370
And the conversation
just ends up

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.630
in a kind of [? an old ?] school
draw and them basically just

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.570
scrapping on the floor.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.990
So I think there are--

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.710
we do need other interview
styles to be available.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.590
Paxman and Humphrys,
absolutely the best

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.780
at that sort of
adversarial approach.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.200
I've certainly thought you
need to notch the dial away

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.640
from that.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.500
It's not that I've taken a
particularly intellectual

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.950
approach, thinking it through.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.420
It's more I just am incapable
of doing what Paxman does.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.030
I'm just too empathetic.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.800
But I think there is a
danger to not being a Paxman,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.310
which is there is a risk of
it just being a bit boring.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.330
And the absolute
worst risk of it is--

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.730
I mean, at the very least,
if the politician closes up

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.340
and Paxman is
haranguing them, you

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.710
can enjoy watching
Paxman haranguing them.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.190
So at least half the
conversation is interesting.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.610
If the politician doesn't
open up and are still boring,

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.030
and if I'm nice to them,
and they're still boring,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.180
then you just end up with a very
boring conversation because you

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.780
haven't even got me being funny
and pulling faces at them.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.694
And it's just not as
entertaining as Paxman

00:23:56.694 --> 00:23:58.110
getting nothing
out of them if I'm

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.210
getting nothing out of them.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:07.317
So there is a definite
problem, but I don't

00:24:07.317 --> 00:24:08.400
know what you do about it.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.830
I think you just have to
keep exploring things.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.140
You have to be a little
bit unpredictable.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.660
And you have to hope that
people will occasionally

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.480
be a bit more revealing
in an interview

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.840
if you're giving them a
little bit more rope, really.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.260
And sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.660
But as they say,
there's no right style,

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.986
no right or wrong style.

00:24:28.986 --> 00:24:30.610
PETER BARRON: Now I
was quite surprised

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.193
that in the index
of the book, there's

00:24:32.193 --> 00:24:33.880
no mention of either
Google or Facebook,

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.100
which I was kind of expecting.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.880
And you don't cover
hugely fake news,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.750
but in terms of peak
fake news, do you

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.150
think we have reached
peak fake news?

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.150
And actually, I wonder, as
the emphasis has been placed

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.950
on the fake news
in recent months,

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:54.420
is it in proportion to the scale
of the problem in this country?

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.571
EVAN DAVIS: Well, I've got
a slightly odd perspective

00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:00.070
on this.

00:25:03.912 --> 00:25:05.870
To be honest, I think
probably some of the talk

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.640
is a bit overdone.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.740
The reason I think it's
overdone is that people--

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.960
I think ultimately, the
most important thing

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.600
is that the truth is out there.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.560
And that it is fairly easy to
navigate your way to the truth.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.280
And if people are not navigating
their way to the truth,

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.560
they're believing stupid
lies despite easily available

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.410
evidence to the contrary.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.640
I tend not to think, well,
that's Google to blame

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.600
or we need a big censor to
come down and block the lies.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.170
I tend to think
we need to ask why

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.730
are people believing nonsense
when truth is available?

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.560
So that's my sort of take.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.780
So the first thing I
think you guys have to ask

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.970
is, is the truth available?

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:01.800
And if you are autodirecting
me towards nonsense,

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.830
I think that's a bit
irritating because I

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.750
think you don't want
people to be autodirected

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.810
to nonsense because that's
making the truth less available

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.920
rather than more available.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.240
So your first question has
to be is the truth available

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.150
and is it easy to
navigate your way to it?

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.440
And that's where I think
your responsibility-- that's

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.440
where I would tend to
say, I don't feel strongly

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.856
about any of this,
actually, but I

00:26:22.856 --> 00:26:27.110
would tend to think that's
your responsibility.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.750
If people choose not to
navigate their way to the truth

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.030
because they would
rather believe

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:38.420
in fairies or in the Holocaust
conspiracy theories or 9/11

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.860
conspiracy theories,
if they'd rather

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.120
believe that kind
of nonsense, I think

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.360
that's the bigger problem
that's above your paygrade.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.070
PETER BARRON: But you
wouldn't intervene

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.360
to stop people claiming--

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:53.630
EVAN DAVIS: Right.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.600
I would intervene on
certain things, Peter.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.380
I think I don't want
it to be easily--

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:03.100
I don't want pictures
of child abuse

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.440
to be available and searchable.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.420
I don't want
bombmaking techniques

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.080
to be to be easily available.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.040
So I think there are areas where
you're going to close it down,

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.150
basically.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.820
But I think those are
pretty few and far between.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:20.530
My own-- my sort of instinctive
view is that it's much more

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:23.455
important that the truth is
available and easily available

00:27:23.455 --> 00:27:28.280
and is your kind
of navigable and--

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.180
easily navigable to
those who want it.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.680
In a funny sort of
way, if there are

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:38.280
people believing batshit
crazy stuff about 9/11,

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.420
or someone who
doesn't believe that,

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.210
I want to know that there are
some people who believe that.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:47.680
I mean, that's the useful
thing for me to know.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.150
There's a fine balance
between oversuppressing it

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.670
and undersuppressing it.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:59.680
I have, and the book is,
optimistic about human nature.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.420
Most people, most of the
time in the long-term,

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.520
gravitate towards
things that are true

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.170
rather than that are false.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:13.900
So I feel optimistic that,
by and large, the truth

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.210
does emerge.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.277
And so I'm less--

00:28:18.277 --> 00:28:20.110
I suppose just instinctively
a bit less keen

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.500
on trying to control the
public discourse away from sort

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.970
of stupid, stupid things.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.636
I worry more about--

00:28:27.636 --> 00:28:29.010
the only other
thing I've said, I

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.807
do think kids should
be taught at school

00:28:32.807 --> 00:28:34.390
what the difference
between a reliable

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.250
and an unreliable source is.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:41.150
And so I think a little bit of
critical thinking is good news,

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.707
and you can help with that.

00:28:42.707 --> 00:28:43.540
PETER BARRON: Great.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.032
OK, let's go to some
questions from the audience.

00:28:46.032 --> 00:28:47.740
There's a microphone
there in the middle,

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.877
if anyone would like
to queue up for it.

00:28:49.877 --> 00:28:51.460
EVAN DAVIS: And do
ask about anything.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.640
I mean, you can complain
about the BBC all day.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.270
I'm here available
till five to 2:00.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:00.430
So that's normally what
happens anyway, but--

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.580
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.410
Hello?

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:03.310
Yes.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.060
Thank you for joining us today.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.300
My question is
journalism has largely

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.060
operated with the principle
that facts are facts,

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.070
and you have to report them.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:17.800
In an era of post-truth
where a person can get

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.930
elected president,
ignoring largely the facts,

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.360
How can you
journalists hold them

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.920
accountable within
that new framework?

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.670
EVAN DAVIS: Right.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:30.910
OK.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.118
So two things, good question.

00:29:32.118 --> 00:29:35.260
How do we hold people who are
fast and loose with facts, how

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.320
do we hold them accountable?

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.610
Just number one, don't overstate
the importance of facts.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.380
I mean, there are facts.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.960
And I'm not a kind of,
you know, relativist

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.580
who thinks nothing is
actually objectively true.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.460
There are facts.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.770
But the vast bulk of our
disagreements in society

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.780
are not so much about the facts.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.740
They're about the weight
we put on different facts.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:08.680
And so the Brexit
debate, the 350 million

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.900
was a contested fact,
and it was not true.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.860
But the reality was
it was 280 million.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.060
And 280 million, 350 million,
I think to most people,

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.230
it still feels like
a lot of money.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:26.950
And so I don't think the
difference between 350 and 280

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.590
explains the outcome.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:34.000
So look, I just think
don't over-obsess on facts.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.920
Most of it is about
judgments, and the judgments

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.820
in that referendum
was the economists

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.260
say it will be bad to leave.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.800
Or the vast bulk of them say
it would be bad to leave.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.340
But it's not a
fact that it would

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:50.350
be bad to leave the EU, bad for
the economy, it's a judgment.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:53.110
And people are entitled
to say we hate economists.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.160
We don't trust them.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:59.130
The first thing is it's not
about facts most of the time.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.400
Sometimes, but not most.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.500
Secondly, how do we
hold people to account

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.870
when they are lying
about the facts,

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.880
fast and loose with the facts?

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.890
I think we just
present the facts

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.400
in a gentle and uncritical way.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.530
They've said it was 350 million.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.080
It's actually 280 million.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.440
That's all you have to do.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.060
If people don't want
to listen, then you

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.840
need to ask why will people
choose to believe the lie

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.610
rather than believe the truth,
and that's a different problem.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:35.110
So all we can do is
gently and as patiently

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.750
and objectively as
possible present the facts

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.460
as we understand them.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.140
Now, there is one
complication which

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.060
I want to give you
with the 350 million

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.600
fact which is very unusual, that
there's a sort of a fact which

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.400
is at such--

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.870
call it, you know, the
center of such a dispute.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.150
The one thing I think the
media has difficulty with,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:59.530
and this proved, is that
when a campaign throws out

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:02.880
a lie knowing it's
a lie in order

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.810
to get us to report it's a
lie in order to draw attention

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:11.800
to it and give weight to
their side of the argument,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.890
I don't know what we do.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:14.640
PETER BARRON: And you
think they did that?

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.794
EVAN DAVIS: Well, there were
some formulations where they

00:32:18.794 --> 00:32:21.210
were kind of more accurate,
and there were some where they

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.000
clearly weren't.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.570
And Dominic Cummings, who
ran the lead campaign,

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.970
has I think use the
phrase "designed

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.160
to promote discussion,"
or something like that.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.150
And I think if
you're in a campaign,

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:39.180
and you know the argument could
be about business and jobs,

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.310
could be about the money
we send to Brussels,

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.500
or could be about
immigration, you

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.799
might want it to be about the
money we send to Brussels.

00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:48.840
How on earth do you get
it to be on that terrain?

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.390
Well, maybe the way you get
it to be on that terrain

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.350
is to throw out a lie.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.349
And then we'll spend the
next week arguing about

00:32:54.349 --> 00:32:56.490
is it 350, 280, or 150?

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:00.630
And then we've kind of
done their job for them.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.600
In the act of debunking
what they say,

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.590
we've done the job for them.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.040
And I think that's something
we need to think about.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.720
I think that's a
sort of tricky one,

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.540
because normal rules
would be we have to report

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.520
what the campaigns say.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.080
If one campaign lies, we have to
say by the way, it's not true.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.740
We're not impartial
between lies and truth.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.240
We can say that's not true.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.460
We should report it's not
true, but we can end up

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.032
giving it undue prominence.

00:33:28.032 --> 00:33:30.240
PETER BARRON: And we now
have the American newspapers

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.830
policy's on reporting
Trump tweets, for example.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:35.880
[? Theo ?]

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.510
AUDIENCE: Is political
journalism failing in Britain?

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.680
And just to give you some--

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.720
how I think about
this, the election,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.730
we saw this traditional way
of reporting politics, which

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:51.600
I subscribe to the "Today
program, Newsnight, the kind

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.100
of reasonable and respectful.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.058
And then you have this
kind of nontraditional--

00:33:55.058 --> 00:33:57.480
online [? VRS ?]
[? Media, ?] you know,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.900
all of these kind of news sites,
Paul Mason kind of launching

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.200
diatribes, the idea that
the institutions that do

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.290
the reporting are in
themselves inherently biased.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.860
And when you look at the side
that I am sympathetic to,

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.960
the traditional, respectful
media, in 2015, it

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.790
told us that there would
be a hung parliament,

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:21.199
and it was an outright majority.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.190
Then this time, they told
us that there would be--

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.770
PETER BARRON: An
outright majority,

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:24.855
and there was a hung parliament.

00:34:24.855 --> 00:34:27.271
AUDIENCE: And then when you
look at the kind of the people

00:34:27.271 --> 00:34:29.909
that I think are the nutters
online, they were right.

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:33.348
And now, which one is nonsense
and which one is the truth?

00:34:33.348 --> 00:34:34.889
EVAN DAVIS: Well,
I think-- you know,

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:36.179
I think one of the things--

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:41.219
and this is really important,
is you mustn't think that there

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:46.290
is some objective fount
of knowledge which

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.120
is known to somebody.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.130
Or we just have to
find the person who

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.852
has that fount of knowledge.

00:34:51.852 --> 00:34:53.560
And if we can just
find the right person,

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.710
then everything will be clear.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.320
It's just not like that.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.620
Public discourse is
a discovery process.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.450
But it's a discovery
process in which

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.570
the thing you're discovering
is moving all the time.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:12.300
And so rather than
thinking, oh, is there

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.480
some systemic flaw in
the mainstream media,

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.360
I would tend to say, crap,
we get it wrong quite a lot,

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.065
don't we?

00:35:20.065 --> 00:35:22.080
And this was one of those
ones, and the last one

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.840
was, because the rules seem
to have changed quite a bit.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.800
It's not, by the way,
just the mainstream media.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.740
I mean, mainstream media
didn't just make it up.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.740
They looked at the local
election results, which

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.390
were entirely in
accord with everything

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.120
the mainstream media was
saying throughout the election

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.440
campaign.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.920
It wasn't evidence free what
the mainstream media said.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.990
So yes, I mean, the
outsiders did much better

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.750
than everybody said they would.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.260
Rather than thinking you
know, what rubbish messengers,

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.355
you just think, well,
something big is going on.

00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:58.980
Something big is
going on, and the kind

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:03.270
of tools which we've had
aren't working very well.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:07.560
Uniform swing models
of seat projections,

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.110
which were the thing
that was driving

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.760
a lot of these projections.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.510
Rubbish.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.250
They just didn't work this time.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:24.660
And so my view is that it's
a mess, but life is a mess.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.910
And we're going to reflect
that messiness sometimes.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.060
And I like the fact that you can
read The Canary, or Breitbart,

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.700
and take different
views on these things.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.200
I like the fact that
they're sniping at us.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.020
Personally, I
wouldn't recommend you

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.040
go to The Canary or
Breitbart for an effort

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.990
to see the other
side of the argument.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.150
I think we will make
some efforts to present

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.470
both sides of an argument,
I don't think they will.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:51.690
I think they will not do
that as well as we do.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.340
We don't always do
it well, but we'll

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.480
make an effort to present
both sides of an argument.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.490
So I just want there to
be a mixed ecosystem.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.157
I want there to be people
shouting at the sidelines.

00:37:03.157 --> 00:37:04.990
I want there to be
people who are offensive,

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.680
and people who are funny,
and people who exaggerate.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.750
And people who give vent
to frustration and anger.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:14.074
And I want there to be
kind of the New York Times

00:37:14.074 --> 00:37:15.490
and the BBCs of
the world who will

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:18.730
make some effort in
their own flawed way,

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.010
to sort of be fair to everybody.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.200
And I don't want the BBC
to be a monopoly of that.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.420
I want there to be Sky
News, and ITV News,

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.270
and others who are making
a kind of a similar effort

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.487
to just sort of be fair
and to be measured.

00:37:31.487 --> 00:37:33.070
And I want everybody
to know what they

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.210
get when they buy those things.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.668
I want people who
know when they go

00:37:35.668 --> 00:37:38.050
to "The Canary" or
"Breitbart," that they're

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:41.170
getting something that
is probably skewed

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:42.850
from a particular perspective.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.990
And I hope that they won't think
that is the ultimate truth.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:50.290
And I hope they will come
to other areas of the media

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.970
to see the other
side of an argument.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:56.390
But it's a mess, and
we are not perfect.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:01.190
There isn't some innate truth,
it's a process of discovery.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:05.800
And as soon as you think about
it as a process of discovery,

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.789
you kind of stop looking
for the fount of all wisdom.

00:38:08.789 --> 00:38:10.330
And then so these
people are rubbish.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.170
They got it wrong twice.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.780
I mean, we get it
wrong all the time.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.950
But we're discovering it's
along with the rest of you.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:16.324
PETER BARRON: Is
the BBC's center

00:38:16.324 --> 00:38:20.080
of gravity in the right
place, would you say?

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.727
You often get attacked
from both sides.

00:38:21.727 --> 00:38:23.560
EVAN DAVIS: We get
attacked from both sides.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.260
I mean, look, I think it is
sort of in the right place.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.500
I think we nudge towards
the opinions of experts

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.400
away from mass opinion,
to some extent.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.994
And I think it's
appropriate for us to do so,

00:38:39.994 --> 00:38:41.660
but I think the main
thing about the BBC

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.118
is its heart is in
the right place.

00:38:43.118 --> 00:38:47.260
Most people at the BBC,
whatever their views,

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.110
will understand
that we have to be

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:52.120
fair to both sides
of an argument.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.814
That doesn't mean we have
to say, on the one hand,

00:38:54.814 --> 00:38:56.855
the Earth is flat; on the
other hand, it's round.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.470
But we do have to sort of
be fair to the evidence

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.840
that each side puts up.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.600
To me, it'll be terrible,
both for personal reasons,

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.010
because I'll lose my job, and
for society, if the BBC is

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.560
kind of deemed to be unfit.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.820
Because I think
you do want people

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:26.180
who see their job as
being fair to both sides,

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.390
as you also want people who
don't see their job as being

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:32.500
fair, who see their job as
being unfair to the other side.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.670
I like adversarial
journalism, but I

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:37.910
don't want it to be the
only kind of journalism.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.326
So no, I don't think in
answer to your question,

00:39:40.326 --> 00:39:42.200
that traditional political
reporting is dead.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.230
I think it's been a particularly
fascinating time in which we've

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.640
got a lot wrong.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:53.030
And that is life's
experience, and that's fine.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:56.460
I mean, we just need to keep
working with getting it right.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.615
PETER BARRON: Next question?

00:39:58.615 --> 00:40:00.240
AUDIENCE: All right,
thanks for coming.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.115
So how much do you think
the rise of bullshit

00:40:02.115 --> 00:40:05.240
is due to basically
the lack of good ideas

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.950
or lack of solutions from
a policy point of view?

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.192
So politicians have to
increase bullshit because they

00:40:11.192 --> 00:40:12.400
can differentiate themselves.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.097
I mean, the two
parties is the UK

00:40:14.097 --> 00:40:15.680
have basically become
very centralized

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.900
as they were in the '70s.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.626
And on the business
side of things,

00:40:19.626 --> 00:40:21.500
so in areas where they
don't have innovation,

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.583
you see a lot of bullshit.

00:40:22.583 --> 00:40:25.345
Used to work for Unilever, a
difficult place to innovate.

00:40:25.345 --> 00:40:27.470
And if you compare Apple,
when the iPhone came out,

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:28.511
they didn't say anything.

00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:31.179
They just had an iPhone
and Google with search.

00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:32.470
So how much do you think it's--

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.386
AUDIENCE: That's such
an interesting question.

00:40:34.386 --> 00:40:36.230
That's a really,
really good question.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:41.120
And so at some big level, my
sort of stock answer to that

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.142
would be--

00:40:42.142 --> 00:40:43.850
I think a lot of what
we're talking about

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:48.420
comes back to the
financial crash of 2008.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:52.100
The crash has given us a decade
of stagnation and no rising

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.120
incomes.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:59.840
And that stagnation has given
us a period in which bullshit

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.730
has held a bit more sway.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.260
When everybody is
getting richer,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:08.650
and everybody's feeling we were
on a trajectory of improvement,

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.550
there's less to
sort of fight over.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.260
And it's less
tribalistic, incidentally.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.360
And I worry less about
my relative's status,

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.460
because we're all
getting better.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.250
When the going gets
tough and there's

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:23.510
no general increase
in living standards,

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.680
it feels much more like
a sort of visceral fight

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.370
for relative status.

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:29.990
And then I'm going
to become tribal.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:34.460
I'm going to believe the crap
that my side believes and--

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.500
just because my
side believes it.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.990
And so I think in that
sense, your point is right.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.270
Now, the other-- but you
take the question further,

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.490
it's a really good example.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.540
When the iPhone comes out,
they don't need bullshit,

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.140
because it just sells itself.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.170
And as the improvements get
much more and more incremental,

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:05.390
the bullshit notches up a dial
to try and pretend otherwise.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.840
I mean, that's the
sort of grand--

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.339
I hadn't even thought
of that, but I

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:11.120
think it's a really
interesting theory.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.580
I would slightly disagree with
your premise, because to me,

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.996
it doesn't feel
like at the moment

00:42:14.996 --> 00:42:17.572
we are in an era
of low innovation.

00:42:17.572 --> 00:42:19.030
I mean, you would
know more of this

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.157
than I do, but it still
feels to me like--

00:42:21.157 --> 00:42:22.490
AUDIENCE: Policy points of view.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:23.240
EVAN DAVIS: Policy point of view

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:23.790
AUDIENCE: Government not in.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:25.248
EVAN DAVIS: Yeah,
good government's

00:42:25.248 --> 00:42:27.270
not knowing what to do.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:28.510
Possibly.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.590
I mean, there's definitely
the center ground

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:37.840
in politics hasn't had a
good period since 2008 when

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.600
they haven't really had an idea,
they haven't had a response.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.560
You know, the
populous right has had

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.520
a response, a sort of
nationalist response

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.020
to the crash.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.966
The populist left has
always had a response

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:50.590
and said the crash
would always happen.

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.620
So they've been to
that extent vindicated

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.500
and I think feel
empowered by it.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:01.040
And the kind of Blairite
middle of the road

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.410
have struggled, because
they haven't really

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.270
had a response to the crash.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.900
And Macron is the
best kind of example

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:15.310
of someone coming up with
perhaps having one in France.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.832
But we don't really know whether
he's going to deliver or not.

00:43:18.832 --> 00:43:19.540
And you're right.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.940
I mean, maybe that has led to
some of the bullshit we see.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:26.721
So do you remember the Labour
leadership contest where Corbyn

00:43:26.721 --> 00:43:27.220
won?

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:32.650
So this is September 2015.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:38.344
It was definitely the case that
if you were a casual observer,

00:43:38.344 --> 00:43:39.760
you would say the
only one who had

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.740
anything to say out of the four
standing was Jeremy Corbyn.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:50.110
And the others were
kind of flanneling,

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:53.620
because they didn't have
enough kind of substance

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:57.260
to articulate a new vision.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.740
So in comes Corbyn
with that vision.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.710
And I do think that is a
problem for the center ground

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:03.860
in politics at the moment.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:09.490
They're a bit bereft
of stuff to say.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:15.340
And that's why at the moment
the choice is really not one

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.340
in which the center
is very strong.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.680
It feels-- you know, Theresa
May and Jeremy Corbyn

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.590
is kind of-- there's a
missing piece in the middle.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:26.061
Tim Farron, I suppose.

00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:26.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.580
PETER BARRON: By the
way, quite close on time.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.610
So should we take three
quick questions and then

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:33.602
Evan can wrap them up.

00:44:33.602 --> 00:44:35.310
AUDIENCE: Thanks very
much for coming in.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:36.726
I found it absolutely
fascinating,

00:44:36.726 --> 00:44:40.620
especially the sort of
idea around persuasion

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.870
not being necessarily
about being right,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.340
but about sort of reducing
barriers between tribes,

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.050
I guess.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:51.370
And as a fact-wielding Ramona,
I can see how that sort

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:53.576
of applies to both
political parties,

00:44:53.576 --> 00:44:54.950
but also at an
individual level--

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:55.220
EVAN DAVIS: Absolutely.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.960
AUDIENCE: --having
arguments with people.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.690
And I wondered if you have any
sort of good examples of that,

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:04.467
maybe recently, or at a personal
level that you could share?

00:45:04.467 --> 00:45:06.050
EVAN DAVIS: Quick
answer, no, I don't.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.540
But I do know-- on
a personal level,

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.990
I do know that every argument
I ever have is helped

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:17.300
and your case is strengthened
when you show enormous respect

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.360
to the other person.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.740
It's incredible.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.790
I mean, it's incredible how
obvious that is when you do it

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:25.390
and how few people
seem to understand it.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:28.160
And I'm trying to
work out what's

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.870
really motivating,
which is normally

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:32.232
something about status.

00:45:32.232 --> 00:45:34.190
You know, it's like the
sort of family argument

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:37.220
where you have an argument
about where the kettle goes

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.620
or something, and then, this
is really about your mother,

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:40.120
isn't it?

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:50.150
If you can get to that
without hostility, you do--

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.800
it is much better.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.590
Yeah, I've got builders
in at the moment,

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:58.440
and I'm tempted to have an
argument with them every day.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:03.770
And I do think it works better
when I'm really nice to them.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:06.140
Except occasionally,
you have to get cross

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:11.629
to show it really matters to
you, but better to be nice.

00:46:11.629 --> 00:46:12.462
PETER BARRON: Kitty?

00:46:12.462 --> 00:46:15.128
AUDIENCE: Hi, just really quick,
and thanks again for coming in.

00:46:15.128 --> 00:46:15.950
Very interesting.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.230
As well as enjoying
bullshit and responding

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:20.750
to that at the moment, we also
seem to be really celebrating

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:21.249
losers.

00:46:21.249 --> 00:46:23.180
So thinking about
Nicola Sturgeon

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.760
after the Scottish
referendum, and Jeremy Corbyn

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.100
fever, Glastonbury,
which is obviously

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.240
a certain type of bubble.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.180
But why do we love a
loser post the election?

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.040
Why aren't we doing
that before the election

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.175
and shaping the result?

00:46:36.175 --> 00:46:37.550
EVAN DAVIS: I
think it's actually

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:40.480
just trajectory matters much
more than you're suggesting.

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.560
So although Jeremy Corbyn
won, his trajectory was up.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.730
So it felt like
he was the winner,

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:48.750
and Theresa May's
trajectory was down,

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:50.810
so she felt like the loser.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:55.400
And momentum matters
enormously, because human beings

00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:01.580
are sort of evolved
to always extrapolate

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.440
the current trajectory.

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.700
So in our minds, the fact that
he did better than expected

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.782
is a kind of a winning pitch.

00:47:09.782 --> 00:47:11.240
And it has been
difficult sometimes

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:16.910
not to say he won the election,
even though he obviously lost

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:19.010
the election to Theresa May.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:21.350
And so I think it's
about trajectory, that,

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:22.430
rather than loving news.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.310
There are people
who love underdogs,

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:28.070
but it didn't really sort of
work for the lib dems, did it?

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:30.150
Or even UKIP, who were
a long way behind.

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:33.770
So, in fact, bandwagon
effects, we like winners.

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:34.490
We like winners.

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:36.890
Actually, the thing that
all parties want to do

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:38.140
is to pretend they're winning.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.340
So they all lie and say, oh, our
private polling says we're on--

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.730
we're on to a thing here.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:43.480
We're the winners.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.850
You know, join the bandwagon.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:45.680
You don't want to be left out.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.721
You know what I'm saying.

00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:49.100
So it's-- I probably don't
agree with your premise,

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.970
but it's a good question.

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:52.678
PETER BARRON: [? Lajer? ?]
Last question.

00:47:52.678 --> 00:47:53.290
Last one.

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.206
AUDIENCE: I'm on the PR
team, so my question's

00:47:55.206 --> 00:47:58.022
a little bit selfish.

00:47:58.022 --> 00:47:59.980
When it comes to Google,
we're faced with a lot

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.460
of bullshit externally.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.370
And it seems like we have done
pretty much everything you've

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:05.030
suggested.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:06.440
So we've been nice.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.690
We've been respectful
in different situations.

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:13.310
So my selfish question
to you is how can Google

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:18.050
withstand and maybe even
ride the tide of bullshit?

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.800
EVAN DAVIS: Right.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.644
So I think it's
carry on as you are.

00:48:21.644 --> 00:48:23.060
It would've been
much worse if you

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:27.050
hadn't been nice, respectful,
and all those things, so that's

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:27.950
one.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.750
And secondly, just
to hold in your head,

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.125
this was something that was
said to me by Warren Buffett.

00:48:32.125 --> 00:48:34.880
I interviewed him
for the BBC, he's

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.820
one of the best
interviews I've ever had.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.350
It was in his
office in Nebraska.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.950
He let us wander around with
a camera just filming stuff

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:44.720
while he was in his office.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.470
He didn't have any PR in tow,
he didn't require any questions

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:49.370
in advance.

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:51.230
He didn't set a time limit.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:53.360
He was absolutely wonderful.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.180
And he gave fairly frank
answers to the questions.

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:59.240
And I said to him
afterwards, why don't you

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:03.650
have a PR when probably a mid
manager in a large company

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:07.260
would come with two PRs
to an interview like that?

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.660
And he said, well,
by the time you die,

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:15.029
you'll have the
reputation you deserve.

00:49:15.029 --> 00:49:16.820
And so really, there's
no point in thinking

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.920
about the PR too hard.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:23.030
Just behave as you will,
and I'm afraid I really

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:25.560
do believe that.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.180
And so there's a lag.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.060
There's a lag.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:36.510
But if you are nice, the
public will regard you as nice,

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:38.580
eventually.

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.770
I would work on that rule.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:43.650
Just as if your
company is worth a lot,

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:46.245
your share price will
reflect that eventually,

00:49:46.245 --> 00:49:48.370
which is by the way, how
Warren Buffett made money.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.748
It's the same principle.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:58.740
There's no way, I'm afraid,
of spinning a bad thing

00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.790
and making it look good.

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:01.831
And this has been the
mistake of the PR industry.

00:50:01.831 --> 00:50:04.360
PR isn't about trying to
make the company look good.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.730
It's not trying to make a rat
look like a cuddly squirrel.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:14.970
PR is about communicating
the truth in effective ways.

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.650
It's not about
trying to communicate

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.150
something that isn't true.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:21.540
And far too many PR's think
it is about putting lipstick

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.680
on a pig.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.680
And I think in the
end, all you can

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:30.290
do is assume that your company
will have the reputation it

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:33.660
deserves, and make sure
the company has pitched

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:38.250
its behavior at a level which
will yield the reputation which

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:38.760
it wants.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:43.152
I'm not saying
there aren't going

00:50:43.152 --> 00:50:45.360
to be short-term bumps and
distortions, just as there

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.872
are in your share price.

00:50:46.872 --> 00:50:48.830
But in the end, I would
work on the assumption.

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.490
Because you can
be really clever,

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:52.250
and you'll still
get the PR wrong.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.930
And when you try too hard,
it'll look like it's insincere,

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.870
and it'll look like
it's insidious.

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.110
So just be-- communicating
the truth is what PR is about,

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:00.914
and that's it.

00:51:00.914 --> 00:51:02.830
PETER BARRON: Yeah, I
think I agree with that.

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:04.175
But as you are an
economist, I just

00:51:04.175 --> 00:51:05.633
want to ask a final
question, which

00:51:05.633 --> 00:51:09.410
is your views on yesterday's
European commission ruling.

00:51:12.745 --> 00:51:13.370
EVAN DAVIS: Um.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:21.691
EVAN DAVIS: I can see both
sides of the argument.

00:51:21.691 --> 00:51:24.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.100
EVAN DAVIS: I mean, I
think often people think--

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:37.990
I think the world probably
feels more competitive to you

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.180
than it might to some outsiders.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.430
And I mean, I think there's
something in the argument.

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:44.300
There is quite a lot
of competition around

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.910
and quite a lot of choice.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:49.780
And if there is
competition, then I

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:53.500
don't think it matters
so much if you're

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.970
favoring your own products.

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:57.280
Because we don't have to
use your search engine,

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.710
we can use someone else's.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.300
And I think probably
to you, it feels

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.760
like there's a lot of
competition between shopping

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.850
services, potentially
between search engines,

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:10.370
between sites you can go to.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:12.610
And so I can see why.

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:14.905
I can see why you might feel--

00:52:14.905 --> 00:52:16.930
I can see why you
might feel aggrieved.

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:24.530
I'm not going to go further
than that, because as you know,

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:27.220
if you've heard anything
in the last hour that

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.830
sounds like an opinion,
you've misunderstood me.

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.200
This argument is an old one.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.790
There's an economics
of vertical restraints,

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:42.740
which is about people
using their own supplies.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.670
It's the same, by the
way, as tied pubs.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:49.090
It's the same issue there, you
know, brewers who own the pub

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:51.830
and force the pub to take
their beer or should they have.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:55.300
This issue of so-called vertical
restraints is an old issue.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.750
And in general, I think it's
been seen as anticompetitive

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:01.930
by half the economics
profession who don't like

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:04.810
any of these vertical ties.

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.180
And the other half of
the economics profession

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:10.270
say as long as there's
competition for pubs,

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:12.310
if this pub-- if
this brewer wants

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:15.930
to lower the value of that
pub by insisting that it has

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:17.750
its rubbish beer in
it, well, they'll

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:20.000
make more money on the beer
than they otherwise would.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.708
But they're making
less money on the pub.

00:53:21.708 --> 00:53:23.210
And it doesn't matter.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:28.060
So there's a sort
of huge economics

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.180
of these vertical--
these kind of privileging

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:35.030
the in-house business.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:37.870
And the most important thing
is that there's competition

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:41.020
really at each side of
the deal, and that's

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.767
where I think the
argument would be.

00:53:42.767 --> 00:53:43.600
PETER BARRON: Great.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.170
Evan Davis, thank
you very much indeed.

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.770
EVAN DAVIS: Peter, thank you.

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:46.670
Thank you very much.

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:47.270
Thank you.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:49.420
[APPLAUSE]
