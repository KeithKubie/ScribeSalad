00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.150
So, summarizing, we have two
equations: a prediction equation, and

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.660
a correction equation.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.320
Our prediction basically
takes two components.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.930
The, the estimate of our previous step.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.870
That is, our belief about X
after time t minus 1 was done.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.980
And then, we have a dynamics model.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.620
RIght?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.260
And the way of thinking about this is,
the likelihood,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.700
the probability that X could
be at some specific point.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.520
Well, it's the sum or
the integral of getting to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.780
that point from any point that
it might have been before.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.990
Integrated over the likelihood that
you were at those points before.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.260
This is a lot easier to see when we do
the particle filtering where we make

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.410
things discreet.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.260
But for the probabilistically inclined
for you if you look at that and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.420
you realize remember we
talked about marginalizing.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.420
What we're doing is we're saying all of
the possible places we might have been

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.780
before, what is the likelihood of
me getting to some particular spot.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.250
And we have to weight that by all of
the probabilities of having been at that

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.360
point before.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.960
That's the likelihood of
being at that next spot.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.660
And then you go to the next spot,
and the next spot.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.710
That's the probability.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.510
That's your prior belief,your,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.060
of your prediction about
the places you might end up.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.590
P of Xt given the measurements
up until now.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.280
We don't have the measurement yet.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.350
Once we get a measurement,
we can do a correction, right?

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.370
And our correction, we use,
doing Bayes' rule, right?

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.380
We have the predicted value from before.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.500
That's the, the quantity we
just talked about producing.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.110
And then we have an observation model.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.320
This observation model says, well.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.880
if you really were at
some particular point

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.830
what's the likelihood of getting the
measurement you just saw and by using

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.980
Bayes rule we are allowed we use that
to turn that into a prediction of Xt

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.600
given everything we saw including that's
why is in red the new measurement and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.350
then like I said on the bottom
here it's just the normalization
