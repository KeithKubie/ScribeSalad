00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube.
My name is Shafik Gabr, I am an entrepreneur

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.920
from Egypt.
I have had the pleasure of being asked this

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.032
difficult question and I
will give it my best shot.

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:15.799
My feeling is if there's one thing that could
be asked for making the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.060
world a better place in 2008 is to be able
to ask for political

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.590
leaders to stand up to the challenges that
they have and the conflicts

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.020
that are costing people lives around the world
not only in our part of

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.210
the region, in the Arab world, in the Middle
East, but in Asia, Latin

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.660
America, other parts of the world.
I think the world needs more people like President

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.149
Sadat who was able
to stand up to responsibility, take up the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.820
challenge, and be able to
find sustainable, just, and peaceful solutions

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.870
that have the grace and
it sort of bottom line and unless people stand

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.949
up to that
responsibility, sadly enough given the state

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.590
of the world, I think we
will enter into a viscous circle which will

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.760
continue and maybe even
get worse.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.310
If there's one thing that I hope 2008 will
bring is to provide vision

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.600
and courage to our political leaders to stand
up and take that sort of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.600
responsibility, work together as a team, and
to be able to make this

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.490
world a better place.
