00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.010
In this lesson we will
be reviewing caches.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.930
You should already know most of this,
but

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.840
it is extremely important to
understand the basics of caches

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.260
before we move on to virtual memory and
other more advanced caching topics.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.800
So this lesson has much more detail
than your typical review type lesson.
