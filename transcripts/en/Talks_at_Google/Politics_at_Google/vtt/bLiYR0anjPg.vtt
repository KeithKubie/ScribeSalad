00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:10.636
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:12.010
JOSHUA PARTLOW:
Thanks very much.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.230
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.244
It's great to be here.

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:14.910
My name is Josh.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.680
Like he said, I'm with
the Washington Post.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.840
I've been a reporter, a foreign
correspondent for the Post

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.600
for about 10 years now.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.410
I've been based in
Iraq, in Brazil,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.049
and currently living in Mexico.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:36.370
I had been in Rio
de Janeiro in 2009

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.320
and had a great, great place
a couple blocks from the beach

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.320
and my boss asked me to help out
very temporarily in Afghanistan

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.190
for two months and cover an
election for Hamid Karzai's

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.670
second term.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.190
And I thought it was going
to be just a brief stay,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.640
and I ended up spending
five years on and off

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.930
in Afghanistan, and it became
a really big part of my life.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.940
I made a lot of lifelong
friends there in that situation.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.590
And so I'm really thrilled
to be here and excited.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.540
This book's been a long
time coming for me.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.040
I've been working
on it for a while.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.650
And when I got there as
a reporter for the Post,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.360
I had been in Iraq for a
couple years in 2006 and 2007.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.612
And the violence there and
the combat was really-- I

00:01:21.612 --> 00:01:23.070
mean, it was
everywhere in Baghdad.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.290
There were car bombs and
suicide bombings every day.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.706
And it was the
kind of thing where

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:31.320
we were living hunkered
down and just escaping

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.400
for an hour or to do interviews
and coming back to the house

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.750
and just trying to
stay safe mostly.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.470
And what I found in Afghanistan
was a lot different than that,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.150
particularly in Kabul,
the capital city.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.360
It was much safer, basically.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.580
You could get around.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.700
You could live a normal life.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.810
The war was mostly out
in the countryside,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.645
in the rural areas.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.980
The Taliban was involved
in sabotage and hit and run

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.120
attacks and this low level
of insurgent violence.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.680
And so what I found myself
writing about more and more

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.990
was the political scandals
that were engulfing the United

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.480
States and the Afghan government
over there, whether it

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.840
was some bribery scandal
at the Ministry of Mines

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.970
or the US, the DEA
investigators and the FBI

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.320
going after President
Karzai's brother,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.640
trying to uncover his
business dealings,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.210
or the fights between the
US Ambassador and President

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.510
Karzai.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.340
And so I guess I
found being there

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.750
that what seemed
to be determining

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.350
the course of the war
was less the combat

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.790
and more of these
political struggles.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.910
And the US military was
fighting several wars at once.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.210
They were fighting the Taliban
on the ground in these far off,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.470
distant villages, and they were
fighting the Afghan government

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.270
that we had helped set up and
we had empowered over a decade.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.955
And they were also fighting
within the themselves.

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:07.360
The military, and the State
Department, and the CIA all

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.380
had different strategies
of what to do.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.130
So the book that I
wrote is basically

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.330
a story of those other wars
and how wherever you looked,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.300
there was a Karzai in
the middle of them.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.570
Whether it was we were
trying to figure out

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.195
how to deal with the
warlords and there

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:26.870
was Ahmed Wali Karzai, who was
the president's half-brother,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.770
and he was the kingpin
figure in Kandahar

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.790
who was larger than
life and was accused

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.090
of presiding over the drug
trade in southern Afghanistan.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.880
And when we were
trying to figure out

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.590
how to make this government into
more like a Western democracy,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.500
Mahmoud Karzai,
the other brother,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.064
was involved in banking scandals
and these corruption issues.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.309
In the book, I try
to explain basically

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:58.850
some of the things,
some of the areas

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.280
where I think the United States
went wrong in Afghanistan,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.710
and how we tried to change a
little bit too much about how

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:14.230
the Afghan government functioned
and how we didn't really

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.300
understand or we weren't
really honest with ourselves

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.490
about who we were fighting.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.480
So just to get a
sense of the writing,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.080
I was going to read
a very small portion.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.830
This takes place when Ahmed Wali
Karzai has just been killed.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.680
And he was the
president's half-brother,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.580
and he was murdered
in the summer of 2011,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.470
and he had been the glue that
held the family together.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.840
And when he was murdered by
one of his closest associates,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.310
it fractured the family
and sent everybody

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.820
fighting over the
business empire

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.950
and trying to maintain
the political stability.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.419
So it's a key moment in
the story of the family.

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.960
And it took place
in a village called

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.560
Karz, which is the president's
home village, which

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.210
is near Kandahar.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:12.040
And it's a little small
town, grape-growing area.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.552
And the family
cemetery is there.

00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:16.760
His father and his grandfather
were all buried there,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.550
dozens of Karzais.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.710
And one of the cousins
who had been selling

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.260
car loans in
suburban Virginia and

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.400
then had moved back to
Afghanistan after 2001

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.295
and had opened a
private security company

00:05:31.295 --> 00:05:33.670
and is making millions of
dollars from the US government,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.270
he had built a giant mansion
in the middle of the town

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.500
where he had a private
zoo and lions and tigers,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.900
an arena for dogfighting.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.830
So that is the setting of
where this takes place.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.280
So I'm waiting on the road
for the funeral procession

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.010
to come down to the cemetery
and there's military

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.950
all around the area.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.200
So what came down the road
was a group of men carrying

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.970
bamboo broom sticks, then a
man pushing a wheelbarrow,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.940
a guy toting a shovel,
and four policemen

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.310
in mismatched shoes and white
cruise ship captains' hats.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.950
I wondered if maybe I
was once again too late.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.440
Then a procession of men, 20
abreast and filling the road,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.890
came into view.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.410
They wore turbans, and
blazers, and sandals,

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.670
and wristwatches that
glinted in the sunlight, row

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.740
after unsmiling row.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.630
The procession swept
by and through us

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.245
and we fell in among them,
following the surging crowd

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:32.620
through the village
until we came

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.810
to a grove of eucalyptus
trees ringed by a white metal

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.240
fence topped with arrow
shaped spikes that surrounded

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.180
the Karzai family cemetery.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.140
We entered through the gate.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.090
Across the cemetery grounds,
dozens of humble headstones

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.620
marked the graves
of lesser Karzais.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.660
In the center stood
a small, open air,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.740
domed mausoleum,
an inner sanctum

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.080
reserved for family royalty.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.100
The president's father,
Abdul Ahad Karzai,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.590
a former parliament member
and leader of the Popalzais,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.210
was buried there, as
was his grandfather,

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.004
another tribal Han,
Khair Muhammad.

00:07:06.004 --> 00:07:07.420
That morning, men
from the village

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.590
had used picks and shovels
to pierce its marble floor

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.940
and dig the grave where
Ahmed Wali lay in the dirt

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.100
under a white sheet.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.510
The crowd surged
around the open grave.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.200
Shouting and jostling,
mourners pushed toward it,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.010
six and seven men deep.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.640
Among them where
many Popalzais who

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.947
lived in the area and
surrounding villages.

00:07:25.947 --> 00:07:27.780
There were also dignitaries
who had flown in

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.940
from Kabul the night before.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.626
I recognized cabinet
ministers, army generals,

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:34.000
and provincial
governors sweating

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.840
in their suits and uniforms.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.970
People were wailing and crying.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.170
Security guards in
black bulletproof vests

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.390
with curly cords tucked
behind their ears tried

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.540
in vain to keep control,
screaming and shoving people

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.650
back from the lip.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.410
Then the sound of
rotor blades rose

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.110
above the din and the
US military Blackhawk

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.630
helicopter touched down
in a plume of dust.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.670
The president had arrived.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.640
Hamid Karzai,
looking wan, pushed

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.470
through the tangle of bodies and
stood at the edge of the grave.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.420
He wore a simple white
tunic and a dark vest.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.200
He looked down into the
hole and said nothing.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.120
I could see he was crying.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.230
For a second, the
scene seemed to freeze,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.780
bodies teetering over the
pit, all eyes trained on him.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.770
Then he dropped into the grave.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.660
He knelt to kiss his
murdered brother,

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.290
and the crowd
closed in over him,

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.440
breaking like water
through a dam.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.490
People enveloped him in a
tangle of interlocking limbs.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.460
He stayed down there, out
of sight, under the bodies,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.770
for what seemed like
minutes, amid the keening

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.210
moan of the crowd.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.860
Then the bodies
parted and he rose

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.289
from the ground, hoisted
up and out of the grave

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:37.820
by the men around him.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.380
He walked quickly through them,
out through the cemetery gate

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.060
to his waiting convoy, and
drove off without saying a word.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.610
A group of men lowered a
concrete slab over the corpse

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.530
and shoveled in dirt.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.030
When they had filled
the grave, they

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.110
pressed in two saplings,
one at either end,

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.170
and tied them together
with pink ribbon.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.200
Almost everyone had dispersed
by the time it was done.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.650
So this was just a little
scene of the cemetery there.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.040
So the book goes on from
there, tracing, basically,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.690
the election in
2009 that I first

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.870
observed and the final election,
when Karzai left power,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.640
in 2014.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.950
And I think it's a story about
how the United States really

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.750
went out of their
way to build up

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.660
these people in all
sorts of different ways,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.810
from politically supporting
the president to giving--

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.910
one of the brothers
on the CIA payroll.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.010
Another one received loans
from the US government

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.520
for some of his
business projects.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.310
And then, by the
end of their arc,

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.205
they had become the
enemies of the US

00:09:42.205 --> 00:09:47.147
and really were at the center
of a lot of the conflicts we had

00:09:47.147 --> 00:09:48.730
and the trouble we
had in Afghanistan.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.840
So I'd be happy to
take any questions you

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.050
have about the book or
Afghanistan in general.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.570
AUDIENCE: What are
they up to today?

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.580
JOSHUA PARTLOW:
So the president,

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.860
he left office peacefully.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.130
There was a lot of
speculation leading up to 2014

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.080
that he would try to
change the constitution

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.380
and stay in power indefinitely.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.200
But he accepted the popular
vote and he's now living

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.840
a few blocks from the palace.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.690
But he's still very
involved in politics

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.070
and he's meeting with leaders,
tribal leaders, every day.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.220
And his critics
speculate that he's

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.640
trying to scheme
and return to power,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.150
because the current
government is pretty weak

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.380
and is very fragile right now.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:40.140
So there's a lot of concern,
or there's a lot of suspicion

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.520
that he will be back
in the spotlight again.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.210
Because the situation
in Afghanistan

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:51.620
right now is a lot worse
than even when I was there.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.420
In 2014, the Taliban are
stronger than they used to be.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.960
They control a lot of
areas around the country.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.170
The government is weaker than it
used to be and is very fragile.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.680
The US still has
10,000 soldiers there,

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.790
so we still have
quite a footprint,

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.480
but we're more in
an advisory role.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.980
So everyone's trying to keep
it from collapsing right now,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.190
is the main issue.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.340
AUDIENCE: So with the
benefit of hindsight,

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.839
what are some of
the things that you

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:22.550
think maybe could have
been done differently

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.570
or should have been done
differently, looking back

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.420
over how much
support the US gave

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.999
to the Karzais and the
politics that came out of that?

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:35.040
JOSHUA PARTLOW: I mean,
I think one of the things

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.180
is we could've managed
our expectations better

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.620
about what was possible to
be changed in Afghanistan.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:47.190
And this was a country where
before 2001 the colleagues,

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.940
the Afghan colleagues
I worked with there,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.050
they would have to drive
for hours to Pakistan

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.890
if they wanted to
make a phone call.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:58.030
And then the
government ministries,

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.820
they don't have electricity.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.310
People don't have computers.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.020
They were starting from
absolute zero when this started.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.010
And we poured in billions
and billions of dollars

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:12.084
into this country
to try to make it--

00:12:12.084 --> 00:12:13.500
I think the
expectation was almost

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.580
that we could make it a modern,
Western, functioning democracy.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.100
So when that wasn't
happening, and there

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.490
was a lot of people
stealing this aid money,

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.927
it became an obsession
for the United States,

00:12:26.927 --> 00:12:28.510
and they launched
these investigations

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.557
into why this
corruption was happening

00:12:30.557 --> 00:12:31.890
and who was stealing this money.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:39.240
And that, I think, ended up
undermining their relations

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.050
with the Karzai
government in a huge way,

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.400
and was not really necessary,
I think, in the long run.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.580
So that was one thing.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.900
I think that we were not
also honest with ourselves

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.780
about the enemy.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.160
When President Obama would
talk about Afghanistan,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.830
he would talk about Al Qaeda
and the threat from Al Qaeda

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.490
and we have to make this not
a sanctuary for terrorism

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:02.990
anymore.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:07.350
But when I was working
in Afghanistan,

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.940
I hardly saw-- no one
would talk about Al Qaeda.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.390
It was all about the Taliban.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.620
For the commanders on the
ground, for the diplomats

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.680
it was not much of a concern.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:26.190
So the Afghan Taliban, from what
I learned and what I saw there,

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.610
was interested in controlling
Afghanistan and controlling

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.610
the politics, being involved
in the politics of Afghanistan

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:37.360
but didn't have international
terrorism ambitions

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.790
for the most part.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.100
And so President Karzai's
criticism of United States

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.930
were the Americans are
attacking Afghan homes,

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.040
or they're bombing Afghan homes,
or killing Afghan civilians,

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.950
or bringing dogs
into their houses.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.530
That really resonated with
people because, I think,

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.150
a lot of people were
really upset about the US

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.150
military presence there.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:06.200
And we didn't really acknowledge
the extent of that discontent

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.630
among Afghans.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.300
AUDIENCE: Why did
the US pick Karzai?

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.550
And do you think the outcome
could have been different

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.370
if they'd gone
with somebody else?

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.620
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah, well,
he was a default candidate

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.420
in a lot of ways.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.940
I mean, there were some
other very prominent

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.200
charismatic Afghans around 2001.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.870
Two of them got killed right in
the days either prior or days

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.940
just after September 11.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:36.670
He was a moderate
English-speaking Pashtun

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.120
from the majority
ethnic group there.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:46.290
And he was a known entity
among US diplomats.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.990
He had lived in Pakistan
as an exile for many years,

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:55.210
and he had been involved
in the Afghan resistance

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.950
to the Soviet
occupation in the '80s.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:03.890
So he was somebody who
had rather moderate views.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:04.800
He was not a warlord.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.730
He didn't have
blood on his hands.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.274
And so I think that he was
acceptable to the United States

00:15:09.274 --> 00:15:09.940
for that reason.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.420
He was also acceptable to the
other factions in Afghanistan,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.380
the other ethnic groups, the
other warlords and commanders.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.090
So he was the least offensive
choice to a lot of people,

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.597
I think.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:25.130
I mean, whether it would
have been different

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.680
with someone else,
I mean, I really

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.530
wonder if it had been
different with someone else.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.960
I mean, now there's a different
president in Afghanistan,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.330
and he's having a
hard time keeping

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.962
this coalition of
ethnic groups together,

00:15:41.962 --> 00:15:44.170
and the government's more
divided than it was before.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:48.610
So I think what his
great skill was,

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.200
was he was a natural
politician and he embraced

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.030
the tribal customs of
Afghan politics, where

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.610
you get together and
you sit and hundreds

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.020
of villages come
in for hours on end

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.530
and talked about
their complaints.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.540
The farmers talk about their
complaints from the village

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.400
and he hears these
people, and that's

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.159
where he's getting his
ground understanding

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:12.200
of the war in Afghanistan,
from these people that

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.880
are coming into the
palace by the tens

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.360
and hundreds every day.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.430
And that time, those hours
in the lunch or at dinner

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.670
late at night that he
spent with these people,

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.240
he loved that aspect
of Afghan politics.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.460
And he was very good at keeping
his-- I think his main goal was

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.930
keeping the broad
coalition together,

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.530
even if he's turning a blind
eye to people stealing money.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.420
So I think his legacy,
part of his legacy,

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.980
will be that he kept Afghanistan
from descending further

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.700
into civil war.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.440
And that was a very
real possibility

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.650
all throughout this
last 15 years there.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.970
I mean, there is
obviously a war going on,

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.840
and it's still violent, and
refugees are flowing out

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.630
of Afghanistan
now at high rates,

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.319
and Afghan security forces
are dying in greater numbers

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.089
than they ever have.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:13.060
So this is by no means
a victory of any means.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.859
I describe it as a tragedy
in the title of the book.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:19.494
But you talk to the
diplomats who worked with him

00:17:19.494 --> 00:17:21.869
and the commanders who worked
with him, and a lot of them

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:25.060
will say he was probably
the best choice for the time

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.290
and place.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.410
In the research for
this book, I ended up

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.330
developing more respect
for him, I guess,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.760
than I had initially
expected to have.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.710
I saw him, when I first got
there, as a bit unhinged.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.230
I mean, he's this
emotional guy who

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.965
was crying in public about
the tragedy of his country.

00:17:43.965 --> 00:17:45.340
And just he seemed
like a guy who

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.757
was biting the
hand that fed him,

00:17:46.757 --> 00:17:48.840
and he's a puppet president
essentially propped up

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.590
by the United
States and yet he's

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.740
spending all this time
criticizing every action.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:59.310
But I came to think that
he was genuinely concerned

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.090
about the welfare of the
Afghan people and was

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:07.120
and was being a critic at a
time when-- and was really

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.995
standing up to what he saw
as a military strategy that

00:18:09.995 --> 00:18:10.620
wasn't working.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.240
AUDIENCE: After the US
withdraws 10,000 troops,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.021
do you see the
current Afghanistan

00:18:18.021 --> 00:18:23.092
government being able to
survive without US support?

00:18:23.092 --> 00:18:26.270
And if it does disintegrate,
which groups do you think

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.987
are going to rise to
power in Afghanistan?

00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:30.820
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.520
It's the key question right now.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.840
I was reading today there was
an estimate that the government.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.070
It thinks it controls
about 60% of Afghanistan.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:45.290
So there's 2/3 of the
country that it does control.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.760
The Taliban is
surrounding Lashkar Gah

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.870
in Helmand province, which is
a province tens of thousands,

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.210
maybe more, US
soldiers have fought.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.380
And many died there, trying
to defend these villages

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.400
and establish the Afghan
government in these areas.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.680
And so that's reverted
almost completely

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.361
to Taliban control,
which for people

00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:08.610
who were living and working
in Afghanistan at the time

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.530
I was, to see that
change is stunning.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.360
That's where billions and
billions of dollars were spent

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.140
and thousands of lives
were lost defending

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.150
the Afghan government.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.890
And it's also the key
terrain for the Taliban.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.060
So that's another
northern city, Kunduz,

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.640
is in a similar predicament.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.006
So without any US
troops, I think

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.380
these are all the reasons why
President Obama has delayed

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.390
the withdrawal of troops.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.010
And we were supposed to be
completely out of the country

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.400
by now, but there's
still 10,000 people.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.934
But I think that unless the
US cuts off all funding, which

00:19:49.934 --> 00:19:51.350
I don't think
anyone is proposing,

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.210
they're still paying probably
$10 to $20 billion a year

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.812
for the Afghan
security forces, I

00:19:56.812 --> 00:19:58.270
think the ability
is probably there

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.550
to protect the major cities.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.420
But in the long
run, I think there

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.890
is going to have to be a
political accommodation

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.670
with the Taliban of some sort.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.660
I mean, if they come in, if they
militarily conquer Afghanistan

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:15.700
again and are ruling again like
they did before 2001-- I mean,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.415
it depends on their
internal politics,

00:20:18.415 --> 00:20:21.150
then, of whether they want to
invite in ISIS in a big way,

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.020
or some of these other groups.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.230
I think one thing about
the Afghan Taliban

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.250
that I learned was
that they have learned

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.760
a lesson from September 11,
and they lost their country

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.026
because they were
supporting Al Qaeda

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.900
and allowing Al Qaeda
to be in their country.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.740
So I think that it
doesn't necessarily

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:48.000
follow for me that if
the Taliban regains power

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.830
completely or partially
that they'll welcome back

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:56.070
in a big way some of these more
extreme Islamic terror groups.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.440
AUDIENCE: Based on your
experience in Afghanistan

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.880
during this period,
what do you foresee

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.770
in the future of US involvement
in the region [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.870
Afghanistan?

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.760
And do you have any
policy recommendations

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.400
for the next president
based on that?

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.670
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.580
It's interesting.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.190
I mean, one recommendation
for both the candidates

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.510
or the next president would be
to talk about Afghanistan more.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.140
I mean, there was an interesting
piece in the New York Times

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.750
the other day about how
neither candidate has really

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.750
raised it as an issue.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.760
And I mean, it's
clear in one sense.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.960
There's not a lot to gain
from focusing on a 15-year war

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.730
that nobody has a
good solution for.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.470
But yeah, I think
when I was there,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.760
when there was a surge of
some 100,000 American troops

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.150
and we were really militarily
trying to defeat the Taliban,

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.920
I think there could have been
more effort made in the peace

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.540
negotiations.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.220
The thought at the
time was that we

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.250
have to hammer them
into submission

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:58.400
and basically they'll only
negotiate if they're losing

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.450
or fear they're losing.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:04.280
And they've managed to
weather that situation.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.890
I think the current president
of Afghanistan and President

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.650
Karzai as well, they made
overtures to the Taliban.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.880
They tried to get those
peace talks going,

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.800
but ultimately, that
dialogue is going

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:25.210
to be the only avenue
out of this endless war.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:29.710
So that would be the focus
if I was running this thing.

00:22:32.415 --> 00:22:34.039
AUDIENCE: If the
Afghanistan government

00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:36.444
decides to sign a peace deal
with the Taliban government,

00:22:36.444 --> 00:22:41.344
do you foresee the US stopping
its aid towards Afghanistan?

00:22:41.344 --> 00:22:43.010
JOSHUA PARTLOW: That's
a great question.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.660
I don't think-- it
depends on, I guess,

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.810
the actions of the Taliban.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:53.920
I mean, if they welcome
in ISIS or help groups

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.220
with international
terrorist goals,

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:01.020
I'm sure there will be
some shift in the policy.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.680
But I think American
officials would

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.570
welcome Taliban participation
in the government.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:15.120
As long ago as 2014 and the
run up to that election,

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.070
there was a lot of talk
about Taliban candidates,

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.480
at least on the local level,
for district governorships

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.990
or provincial governorships.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.690
Maybe not like in
the FARC in Colombia,

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.310
where now they're actually in
an official process of trying

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:33.150
to turn the rebel group into
political candidates, where

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.620
you're campaigning under
the banner of the FARC,

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.310
but at least people who are
sympathetic to the Taliban, who

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.500
would be known as
representing their interests,

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.910
as welcome candidates.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:51.890
And I guess, going back to
mistakes, early in the war,

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.744
there was a blanket
policy, basically,

00:23:53.744 --> 00:23:55.410
in Afghanistan that
the Taliban couldn't

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.520
participate in politics.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.103
I mean, much the
same way we disbanded

00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:03.220
the Iraqi Army in Baghdad
and cleaned out Saddamists,

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.640
and those people ended
up joining the insurgency

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.850
and fighting against
us for years.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:14.960
I think most Afghans that I
met, including in government,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.310
have a much more nuanced
view of the Taliban

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.400
as other Afghan actors
and politicians,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.692
and they see a place for them
in the Afghan political debate

00:24:24.692 --> 00:24:25.650
about what's important.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:31.170
So I don't foresee
them being excluded

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.490
in a big way in the future.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.202
AUDIENCE: Last
question for me, sorry.

00:24:36.202 --> 00:24:38.660
The opinion polls from Afghanis,
do they want America still

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.804
to be involved in Afghanistan?

00:24:40.804 --> 00:24:45.187
And the second thing, women's
rights in Afghanistan,

00:24:45.187 --> 00:24:47.622
have women's rights
been promoted

00:24:47.622 --> 00:24:49.986
since the US has been there?

00:24:49.986 --> 00:24:53.890
And do you see this change being
sustained after America leaves?

00:24:56.445 --> 00:24:58.070
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah,
on that question,

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:03.580
I think there have been
very tangible changes

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.690
for the situation for women
in Afghanistan since 2001.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.430
I mean, living under the Taliban
as a woman sounds like it

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.530
was a brutal experience.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.570
But it's still an extremely
conservative place,

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.750
and the treatment of women was
something that, as a foreigner,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.330
as an American, that was the
hardest thing about being

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:29.320
in Afghanistan was seeing
women treated, essentially

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.340
as property and
kept in their homes.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.600
I mean, on certain
levels, there's

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.370
a lot more access to public
life than there was in the past.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.820
I mean, there's plenty of
women in the Afghan parliament

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.020
in positions of power, many
more than there were before.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.060
So that's tangible progress.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.490
More women are going to school.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:57.051
But in conservative areas, in
Kandahar in the Pashtun south,

00:25:57.051 --> 00:25:58.800
lots of families don't
want their children

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.140
to go to school, their
daughters to go to school.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.610
Lots of women are still
in the full burqa.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.450
So yeah, I think from
a Western perspective,

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.620
it's hard to say there's
been too much improvement

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.730
for the situation for
women in Afghanistan,

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.845
but there have been incremental
and concrete changes, I think.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.474
Sorry, the first part
of your question?

00:26:27.474 --> 00:26:30.222
AUDIENCE: Have there been any
opinion polls from Afghanistan

00:26:30.222 --> 00:26:32.472
to see what the Afghans think
about the US involvement

00:26:32.472 --> 00:26:33.805
and if they still want us there?

00:26:35.402 --> 00:26:36.860
JOSHUA PARTLOW:
You see that people

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.327
in places that are changing
from government control,

00:26:41.327 --> 00:26:42.910
or the Taliban's
coming in, or they're

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:48.800
worried about a change like that
in the local power structure,

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.440
I mean, you talk to
Afghans and yeah,

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.230
they want the American
military back to protect them,

00:26:54.230 --> 00:27:01.680
to keep things the
way they were, not

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.010
have a change in local power.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:08.480
But I think broadly
speaking, Afghans

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.340
aren't happy with the
US military presence.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.080
At least, they aren't
happy with them

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.490
in their homes on these
operations, doing night raids,

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.780
and arresting people, and
holding Afghans in US jails.

00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:24.600
I always sensed that,
I guess, living there,

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.150
but then I did a story
once, where I went around

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.870
to the Friday sermons
in the mosques,

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:34.242
and I heard the
preachers giving their

00:27:34.242 --> 00:27:35.700
giving their sermons
to the people.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.880
And these were
mainstream, many of them

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.230
government-funded, mosques, just
the average cleric's opinion

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.780
about the week's events.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:48.190
And I was just stunned by how
anti-American everything was,

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:52.070
describing people, the US
soldiers, as infidel crusaders

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.440
and it's our responsibility
as regular Afghans

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.850
to rise up against them.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:28:00.470
So that opinion is
definitely out there.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.410
Yeah.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:05.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Could you paint

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:10.140
the most optimistic picture
about the future of Afghanistan

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.160
and tell us how to do it?

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.660
How to implement it?

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.780
Reason being, I mean,
look, a lot of these things

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.280
are pretty depressing,
to be honest.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.446
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah, right.

00:28:20.446 --> 00:28:24.365
AUDIENCE: And in the Middle
East, in other countries too,

00:28:24.365 --> 00:28:26.240
it seems it would be
interesting to know what

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.205
would need to happen to fix it.

00:28:28.205 --> 00:28:29.080
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.210
I guess I would just go back
to what I touched on before.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.880
There needs to be a political
agreement between the groups

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.640
fighting in Afghanistan
and the government

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.150
to settle these things
diplomatically and peacefully.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.608
And there are
obviously going to be

00:28:44.608 --> 00:28:48.507
opposition groups and ethnic
rivalries that will exist,

00:28:48.507 --> 00:28:50.590
and there's a long history
of that in Afghanistan.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:58.800
But I think a relatively
peaceful resolution

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.140
to the conflict
is the first step.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.840
What's going on in
Syria, what's going on

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.210
in Iraq, the spread of ISIS--
that's a whole other ball

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.070
game right now.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:16.260
And that's a whole other
concern for the United States,

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.620
for Europe, that's
not going to be,

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.570
unfortunately, changing, I
don't think, any time soon.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.950
Yeah, I mean,
what's happened when

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:32.650
I got to Iraq in 2006, the rise
of groups like Al Qaeda in Iraq

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:37.640
and then ISIS and these
shock waves that got

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.460
set off from the Iraq war
and the invasion there,

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.440
I think they've gone a
lot farther than anyone

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.280
expected they would.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.752
I wish I could be a little
more optimistic, but--

00:29:46.752 --> 00:29:48.460
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry
to sound pessimistic.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.220
Is there a more likely
scenario say, 10 years out,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.290
than the Taliban
have complete control

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.820
and it's in some
kind of state that's

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:07.390
not far off from the year 2000,
given when we exit, what forces

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:08.930
are there, really,
to counter things

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.161
like their military strength?

00:30:11.161 --> 00:30:13.660
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah, I think
it's definitely a possibility.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.239
The Iraqi Army and police
have received billions

00:30:18.239 --> 00:30:20.780
of dollars and tons of training
from many different countries

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.409
over the last 15
years, and they're also

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:25.200
very battle-tested.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.860
They're people who are not
going to necessarily just desert

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.290
at the first sign
of trouble coming,

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.280
and a lot of these
people-- not everyone,

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.669
but a lot of people
involved-- are

00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:43.710
fighting because they do
believe in the direction

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:47.360
of the government and they
think that's the better

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.820
alternative than the Taliban.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:55.700
So I think the security
forces, they're well seasoned

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.720
and they can protect this
government in certain areas.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.560
And I think with
things going their way,

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.520
with maybe other countries
supporting the Taliban less,

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:16.020
somehow that their strength
diminishing in some ways,

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.470
I think it's possible this
government can survive.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.550
I think one of the huge
problems right now,

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.700
again, is whether
this government will

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.840
agree to work together.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.530
I mean, it's a
coalition government

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:32.310
of different ethnic groups, and
they had formed this coalition

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.694
with some conditions, that some
changes, reforms would be made,

00:31:35.694 --> 00:31:37.110
and the deadline
for those reforms

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.600
is this month and none
of them have been met

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.520
and so people are threatening
to withdraw from the government.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.120
So if major ethnic factions
leave the government,

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.960
I don't think it's
possible to really have

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.126
it survive very much longer.

00:31:53.126 --> 00:31:58.022
Because the security forces and
the leadership of the security

00:31:58.022 --> 00:32:00.480
forces have been some of these
minorities, like the Tajiks,

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.970
and the Uzbeks, and
the Hazara leadership

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:09.410
have been important to keeping
the military and police force

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.380
fighting for the government.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.980
So there are a lot of risks
out there right now for sure.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.538
AUDIENCE: When the US first
arrived in Afghanistan we

00:32:19.538 --> 00:32:24.150
were trying to replace the
opium production with wheat.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.520
Was that successful?

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.420
I'm assuming it wasn't.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.636
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah, no,
that wasn't successful.

00:32:29.636 --> 00:32:31.260
There were some
programs early on where

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:36.180
they tried to buy up the
opium crop, poppy crop,

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:42.090
from all the farmers as a way
to keep them having some income

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.530
and then destroying the crop.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.950
But that wasn't successful.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:49.360
They've tried eradication.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.710
That hasn't been successful.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:54.130
It still produces the
majority of the world's opium

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.020
and heroin, Afghanistan.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.630
And it's still the
funding source that

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.155
drives a lot of the insurgency.

00:33:02.155 --> 00:33:03.950
Both the Taliban makes
money off of opium

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.083
as well as the powerful members
of the Afghan government.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.960
So when I was there, the people
in this family, the opium trade

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.740
was always in the background.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.830
The United States
for a while was

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:21.840
fixated on whether they
could they could find out

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.460
whether the president's brother
was a drug trafficker or not,

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.452
and spent a lot of hours
and a lot of people

00:33:26.452 --> 00:33:28.660
investigating that question
and were ultimately never

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.960
able to find any evidence.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.160
But there was a lot of
smoke and a lot of suspicion

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.650
that he somehow
helped, basically,

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.080
the trucks keep moving
and that sort of thing.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.170
So yeah, I mean, the opium
trade is still alive and well

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.390
in Afghanistan.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.760
AUDIENCE: I'm not quite
sure how to ask it,

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.290
but was there pushback on
trying to get this published?

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.912
Was there any issue with that?

00:33:52.912 --> 00:33:56.054
And secondly, are you
working on something else?

00:33:56.054 --> 00:33:57.720
JOSHUA PARTLOW: No,
there wasn't really.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.928
There wasn't really pushback.

00:33:58.928 --> 00:34:02.420
There was not as much
access, sometimes,

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.095
to the family members as
I had hoped when I began.

00:34:05.095 --> 00:34:06.720
Some people didn't
want to be involved.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:16.290
The president has six
brothers and one sister.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.539
A lot of them left
during the Soviet War

00:34:18.539 --> 00:34:19.830
and lived in the United States.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.288
One of the brothers,
Mahmoud, owned

00:34:21.288 --> 00:34:23.570
a restaurant, the Helmand
on Telegraph Hill,

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:28.208
here in San Francisco, until
it got destroyed by a boulder

00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:28.999
during a landslide.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:35.199
They set up a successful chain
of restaurants in Baltimore,

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:37.889
in Boston, in Chicago.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:41.310
And they were living this
immigrant successful life

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.340
when September 11
happened, and then they

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.910
went back to Afghanistan and
got involved in the politics

00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:49.159
and the businesses of the war.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:53.159
So their lives changed
dramatically on September 11.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:57.560
And some of them, one of
the more colorful members

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.370
of the family, Hashmad,
who I mentioned

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:05.130
earlier, he had this private
zoo and he had the dogfighting

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.810
pit in his mansion
in the home village,

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:14.220
he was suspicious of
me coming and spending

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.052
too much time with him,
I think, because it

00:35:17.052 --> 00:35:19.010
was like Game of Thrones,
in a sense, with him.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.740
I mean, he was really reaching
for the mantle of family power.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:27.670
And so he had been
the real striver

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.080
who felt left out
of the family power

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.615
and was trying to gain that.

00:35:31.615 --> 00:35:35.530
And he ultimately ended
up getting blown up

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.100
as well by a suicide bomber.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.650
And so several of the people
I wrote about in this book

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.730
ended up dying
during the process.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:45.030
So--

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.030
AUDIENCE: And are you
working on something else?

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.321
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Something else?

00:35:48.321 --> 00:35:51.211
Well, right now I'm the
Mexico correspondent

00:35:51.211 --> 00:35:52.210
for the Washington Post.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:55.120
So I live in Mexico City and I'm
covering Latin America, Central

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.430
America, some in South America.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:00.250
So I've been occupied
on that lately.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:03.110
So I haven't started
another book yet.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:06.232
AUDIENCE: What was life like
living in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:36:06.232 --> 00:36:07.952
as a journalist?

00:36:07.952 --> 00:36:09.910
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah,
they were very different.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:14.170
Iraq, I got there in 2006
when it was the height

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.520
of the sectarian violence.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.430
Sunnis and Shiites were killing
each other left and right.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.910
People were moving to
be in neighborhoods

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:29.590
with their different sect.

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:37.460
We lived in a heavily fortified
house in central Baghdad.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.090
At the time, I think there was
a staff of at least 30 Iraqis

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:43.320
working for the Washington
Post, whether it was drivers,

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.270
or security guards,
or translators,

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:49.100
or stringers in different
parts of the country.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.210
And it was a much
harder place to work,

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.969
because you were
constantly calculating

00:36:55.969 --> 00:36:57.510
the risks of going
to a certain area,

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.330
and you were living a little
bit more like a prisoner,

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.060
or traveling with
the US military

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.120
and covering their actions.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.480
In Kabul, I mean, I
loved living in Kabul.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.400
I thought it's a
fascinating city.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.674
It's beautiful in a lot of ways.

00:37:11.674 --> 00:37:12.840
It's a kind of stark beauty.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.660
It's ringed with mountains
and it's a valley city.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.850
I think it's 6,000 or
7,000 feet elevation.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.670
There's wood smoke and still
muddy streets and people

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:31.190
in donkey carts and little
kids waving these cans of smoke

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.800
to ward off the
evil eye to cars.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.900
It's very exotic
and very different.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.410
And you can still
imagine them living

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:44.880
as 1,000 years ago in a similar
fashion in a lot of ways.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.060
But also they have this
ruggedness in the sense

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:55.136
that they've lived through
so much horrible suffering.

00:37:55.136 --> 00:37:57.180
There are places I've
been, like in Islamabad,

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.317
for example, in Pakistan,
where I felt like people

00:38:01.317 --> 00:38:02.150
were looking at you.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.750
And as a foreigner, it
was a little threatening

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:07.640
and I was worried
about where I was going

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.990
and who was watching me.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:12.980
In Afghanistan, they have this
joyful sort of hopefulness,

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.860
despite all the
troubles, and they're

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.789
welcoming to foreigners.

00:38:17.789 --> 00:38:19.580
There have also been
attacks on foreigners,

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.120
so maybe it's gotten
worse over the years.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.490
But at least when
I first got there,

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.770
there, I lived in a group
house with other aid workers,

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.830
and diplomats, and
journalists, and there

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.570
were a lot of ex-pats at the
time when I first got there.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:36.432
Now there are less.

00:38:36.432 --> 00:38:38.890
AUDIENCE: Is the royal family
completely out of the picture

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.010
at this point?

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:46.470
And secondly, does Afghanistan
as a political unit matter

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:47.790
to the Afghans?

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:54.175
Or is that a construct
that the West buys into?

00:38:54.175 --> 00:38:55.390
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Yeah, right.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:00.105
The royal family is not
too much in the picture.

00:39:00.105 --> 00:39:01.480
Some of the members
of the family

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.600
were allowed to live in
the presidential palaces

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.981
as a courtesy.

00:39:04.981 --> 00:39:10.770
I believe that the king
passed away in 2007.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.630
Or maybe earlier
than that, 2004.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:16.590
He had ruled for
decades until the '70s,

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.350
when he was overthrown.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.990
So they are
respected as a family

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:26.900
but they don't have too
active a role in politics.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.100
As far as the construct?

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.300
Yeah, I mean, I definitely
think to a large degree

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:36.460
the government is seen
as a Western construct.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.280
I mean, I write in
here about the efforts

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.230
to fashion the National
Security Council in the palace.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:46.060
And ISAF, the US military,
created these detailed flow

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.910
charts about how decision
making should take place

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:50.785
and whose committee
meeting and who

00:39:50.785 --> 00:39:52.410
had to go to which
subcommittee meeting

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:53.742
and who had to brief who.

00:39:53.742 --> 00:39:55.450
And the Afghans just
looked at this stuff

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.910
like, "we're not going
to do it this way.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.790
We have our own way of doing it.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:02.265
We'll all sit around and
talk about it and decide.

00:40:02.265 --> 00:40:06.550
And the foreigners won't be
in the room when we decide."

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.770
So there's that aspect of it.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:09.770
I think they see
it as a construct,

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:16.170
but also it's also a predatory
government in a lot of ways.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:19.060
So at a local level,
police will demand bribes.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.425
Or to get anything done,
if you have a legal case,

00:40:21.425 --> 00:40:23.550
you're going to have to
pay the prosecutor a bribe.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:24.590
You're going to have
to pay the judge.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.506
You're going to have to
pay everyone involved.

00:40:26.506 --> 00:40:28.550
So people are
infuriated with that.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:30.110
A lot of the
sympathy, I think, you

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.750
see for the Taliban's
manner of justice

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:36.940
is because it's just
simpler and they get rid

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.630
of all that red tape.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:45.120
AUDIENCE: Is there a partition
that would make sense?

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.320
Or do people talk
about a partition

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.590
along ethnic or tribal--

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:53.080
JOSHUA PARTLOW: Not the
way in Iraq that I saw.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.080
There's a lot of
nationalism in Afghanistan,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.780
and people are proud
to be Afghans and proud

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.140
of their history
and their heritage

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.740
as repelling foreign
occupiers for generations.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:08.140
And there are areas
of the country,

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.072
predominately the
Tajiks and the Uzbeks

00:41:10.072 --> 00:41:11.530
in the northern
part of the country

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.738
and the Pashtuns in the
southern part of the country,

00:41:13.738 --> 00:41:17.540
but there was never any
serious talk about partition,

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.019
at least when I was there.

00:41:19.019 --> 00:41:20.560
AUDIENCE: Could you
give your opinion

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.680
on if the foreign
aid dollars that

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.860
go there get spent not on
military and on security

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.990
but rather on
economic development,

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.850
would there be any
chance it would be easier

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.460
to stabilize the country?

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.970
Because of a lot of this talk
is just about security forces

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.100
this or that and military
involvement and what not.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:44.624
But what if they got Starbucks
and these kinds of things?

00:41:44.624 --> 00:41:45.290
Would that help?

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.030
JOSHUA PARTLOW:
Yeah, well, I mean,

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.560
there has been a lot of that
tried, and a lot of that

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.510
has succeeded over the years.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.130
I mean, the development
in Kabul in particular

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:56.670
and the other major
cities is pretty

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:01.160
amazing in a certain way.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.695
I mean, there was maybe
one or two radio stations

00:42:05.695 --> 00:42:06.570
when the war started.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:09.060
There's now a
flourishing media market,

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.670
TV stations, radio stations.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.990
There's access to the
internet, cell phones,

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:20.750
access to the outside world
and other ways of thinking.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:25.300
And the economic
development, there

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:31.320
have been big projects in
mining and agriculture.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.010
What the US military
tended to do often

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:38.340
was flood these little
villages, pay everyone

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:41.930
in a village to dig a ditch,
these day labor projects.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:45.010
Or they have a
karez system, which

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:46.550
is an underground
irrigation system,

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:50.840
or to dredge those
out and clean those.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.570
And that's just good
for a couple weeks

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.600
or however long
the program lasts,

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.960
and then people are
back in the same boat.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.960
There have been major advances,
I guess, in the road network

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.720
in Afghanistan.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.240
That's changed a lot.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.990
The infrastructure is
better than it was.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:23.930
I mean, definitely
poverty is rampant.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:30.690
The economy is ripe for
other projects and for jobs.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.890
And that's what people
care about most.

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:36.310
But there's been a
lot of money wasted.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:37.890
This aid money
comes in and it gets

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:39.598
filtered through so
many different levels

00:43:39.598 --> 00:43:41.540
of the government.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.480
And a school that should
cost $1,000 to build

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.960
ends up costing $1
million because so many

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.520
different contractors
along the way take a cut.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.620
And then it falls
apart because they

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:59.700
used materials that were
shoddy or weren't appropriate

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.110
to the local weather conditions.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:04.940
There's been a million stories
of squandered aid money.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.802
So a lot of the record
is that kind of stuff.

00:44:09.802 --> 00:44:11.760
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
from your perspective

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.090
as a foreign journalist
working in Afghanistan,

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:19.390
did you see a big contrast
between how media was covering

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.340
foreign news, especially
the West, and the West's

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.625
interaction with Afghanistan?

00:44:24.625 --> 00:44:27.000
Was there a big contrast
between how you were covering it

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.810
and how Western
media covered it?

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.945
JOSHUA PARTLOW: You mean
other European journalists

00:44:32.945 --> 00:44:33.945
would cover Afghanistan?

00:44:33.945 --> 00:44:35.695
AUDIENCE: Yeah, European
and American news

00:44:35.695 --> 00:44:39.090
versus Afghanistan
local news coverage.

00:44:42.907 --> 00:44:45.240
JOSHUA PARTLOW: I didn't see
a huge difference, I guess.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.760
I mean, we were all
covering the same stories.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.790
I mean, you go to the
press conferences,

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:54.180
it would be 10
foreign correspondents

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.270
and 50 Afghan reporters.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:01.900
So they had a great, really
vibrant media system,

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:06.210
and they were all over all
the battles, all the scandals.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:10.740
So I think I didn't
see a huge perspective.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.260
For example, I
live in Mexico now

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:18.940
and I see a bigger difference
between just the way

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:23.250
Mexican media approaches
covering the government.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.470
There are some stand-out
examples of investigative work,

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:31.600
but for the most
part, you don't really

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.710
get beyond the surface
layer of the government,

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:37.670
and the PRI there is very
good at keeping-- nobody leaks

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.152
anything.

00:45:39.152 --> 00:45:41.360
There's no real insight into
how the government works

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.456
or how the military works.

00:45:44.456 --> 00:45:47.250
And I think that's very
different than the United

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.620
States.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.554
But the Afghan
reporters were-- I mean,

00:45:52.554 --> 00:45:53.970
everything was
just getting going.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:56.010
It still is just
getting going, in a way.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.590
So there are a lot of
successes, and there's

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.720
a lot of great reporting.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.100
And there were
people who-- I think

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.770
one difference that
comes to mind now

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:10.170
is that there were people who
had access to, say, the Taliban

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:15.490
or the insurgency in a way that
a foreigner wouldn't often.

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:19.730
Because that's, I think,
the big, great black hole

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.970
of the whole Afghan
War, is what is

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.720
the Taliban side of this war?

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.190
And we see them as
this faceless group,

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:32.670
but they had their whole
history of their leadership

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:34.590
and the decisions
they made, and why

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.350
people were fighting for them.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:41.170
That was not well covered
in the last 15 years.

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:44.570
And so there were some
American exceptions,

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:47.350
but often people go to meet them
and end up kidnapped or killed.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:51.106
And so it was
Muslim journalists,

00:46:51.106 --> 00:46:53.230
Afghan journalists, other
journals from Middle East

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:56.110
often had a better
time accessing them

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:58.990
and telling people
about who they were

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:01.150
and why they were fighting.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.070
Thank you guys so
much for having me.

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:04.270
I really appreciate it.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.020
[APPLAUSE]
