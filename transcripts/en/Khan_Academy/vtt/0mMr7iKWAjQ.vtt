00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.760
Problem 17.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.280
The three dimensional figure
above has 2 parallel

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.390
bases and 18 edges.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.310
I could try to draw it, but,
well let me draw that.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.620
So their bases are both
hexagons, essentially.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.035
So I have one base that
looks like this.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.510
I have time so let me
draw it properly.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.080
So the base in front looks
something like this.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.090
And then the top base is just
a small version, or smaller

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.430
version, that looks like that.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.680
Whoops.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.370
And then they draw-- these are
the front edges-- look

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.620
something like this.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410
Under the rear edges in a darker
color, so you know,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.660
that they're in the back.

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.280
Rear edge.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.660
I should have drawn that later,
because that's going to

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.955
switch back to this.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.270
And just paint over this,
just so you know,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.520
these are in front.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.550
OK, good enough.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.710
And they tell us that this
point up here is v.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.920
I don't know if that even fit
on the video, but hopefully

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.406
you can see that
point up there.

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:41.770
The three dimensional figure
above has two parallel bases,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.372
this is one base, that's
the other base.

00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:46.390
Two parallel bases
and 18 edges.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.520
Line segments are to be drawn
connecting vertex v with each

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.460
of the other 11 vertices.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.520
Each of the 11 vertices
in the figure.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.790
How many of these segments
will not lie on

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.580
an edge of the figure?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.780
So an edge of the figure is
essentially, well let's see

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.500
what they're saying.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.229
Line segments should be drawn
connecting vertex v with each

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.600
of the other 11 vertices.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.050
So what are the other
11 vertices?

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.300
Let me draw them.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.950
Let me do it in a
brighter color.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:30.810
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.190
And they want to know, how many
of these segments will

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.760
not lie on an edge
of the figure.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.480
And actually I think this is a
little ambiguous, because if

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.510
something is on the face of
the figure, on a base.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.720
OK, well they're saying
the edges.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.470
They're defining the
edges as the lines.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.190
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.080
15, 16, 17, 18 edges.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.880
So it can lie on a face
and still count.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.530
So how many of these line
segments can I draw?

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.690
Well, if I want to draw a line
segment with every point on

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.330
this base that is
not on an edge.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.220
So this one won't count, because
that is on an edge

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.720
right there.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.460
But I can draw 1.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.315
Oh I should use a different
color, because this is going

00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:21.840
to get messy.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.620
I can draw 1, 2, 3, because I'm
connected to the other 2

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.110
with an edge.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.340
So I have three there.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.280
And then how many can I draw a
line segment to in the other

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.820
that I'm not connected
already with an edge?

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.720
Well the way to think about it
is, this point is connected to

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.990
this only here.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.650
So we can't use this as one
of the line segments.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.730
But then there's 5 other points
that it can connect to,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.890
where you're not going
through an edge.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.450
So you're going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.650
So there's 5 more.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.850
3 plus 5 is equal to 8.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.804
And if you wanted to do that
even without drawing it you

00:04:06.804 --> 00:04:09.200
could have said, well, there's
two types of vertices.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.320
There's the ones that are on
the top base, and the ones

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.060
that are on the bottom base.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.630
On the top base, which was the
hexagon, this was our point

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.430
right here.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.850
On the top base with the hexagon
there are 5 other

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.200
vertices, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.440
But you're connected directly
to 2 of them.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.100
So there's only going to be 3
that you can go where you're

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.310
not already connected to them.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.540
And likewise, on the bottom
base, if this was the bottom

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.610
base, vertex v was
only directly

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.080
connected to this one.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.570
It had an edge directly
to that one.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.230
But the other 5, it didn't
have a direct edge to.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.460
So all of those would
have been fair

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.305
game for the problem.

00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:54.610
So 5 on the bottom it can
connect to, and 3 on the top.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.400
And that's where we
got our 8 from.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.650
Next problem.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.550
Alright.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.510
This looks like something
that I need to draw.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.316
That's my x-axis, that's
my y-axis.

00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:19.310
Let me label them, x, y.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.145
And then they drew a rectangle
that I'll do

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:23.647
in a different color.

00:05:23.647 --> 00:05:26.956
It looked something like this.

00:05:26.956 --> 00:05:29.690
It looks like that.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.190
And then how do they label it?

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:42.370
They said that this point, c,
is the point 1/2 comma c.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:52.145
This point b is the point
minus 1/2 comma b.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.062
My microphone is hitting
my sweatshirt.

00:05:57.062 --> 00:06:07.180
And then, let's see, this point
here, a, is minus 1/2 a.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.350
And then finally, this point
here, d, is 1/2 comma d.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.245
And then they drew a graph in
between this whole thing that

00:06:17.245 --> 00:06:18.510
intersects.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.306
It goes from here, then it
starts to flatten out.

00:06:21.306 --> 00:06:23.960
It's already looking kind like
an x cubed graph, if you're

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.560
familiar with what an x cubed
graph looks like.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.045
And it goes through
that point.

00:06:27.045 --> 00:06:30.460
Of course there's
a point here.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.880
Note, figure not
drawn to scale.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.580
In the figure above, abcd
is a rectangle.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.000
Points a and c lie on the graph
of y equals px cubed.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.430
This is y, it looks like,
y equals px cubed.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.100
Fair enough.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.150
Where p is a constant, if the
area of abcd is 4, what is the

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.260
value of p?

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.895
So area is base times height.

00:06:58.895 --> 00:07:01.310
Can we figure out what
the base is?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.730
Well sure.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.360
We know that this is 1/2,
because the coordinates of

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.460
these two, the x coordinate
is 1/2.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.110
We know that this is minus 1/2,
because the coordinates

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.270
of these two are, the x
coordinate's minus 1/2.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.540
So if this length is 1/2, and
this length is 1/2, we know

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.336
this entire base is 1.

00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:27.430
So if we know the area is 4 of
this entire rectangle, what is

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.320
this height?

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.215
This distance is going
to have to equal 4.

00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:36.520
Because 4 times 1 is the area,
and 4 times 1 equals 4.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.300
So this has to have height 4.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.210
And this is symetric, right?

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.670
Well, do we know that
it's a symmetric?

00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:51.950
It's a rectangle, points
lie on the graph.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.150
Do you know how we know
it's symetric?

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.610
Because this is y
equals px cubed.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.410
And anything that is px cubed
would be symmetric like this.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.150
At 1/2, whatever pointed it is
at c, it would be at a similar

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.030
point down here.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.450
But it would just be on
the other side and

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.800
in the third quadrant.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.710
So it's kind of like you're
flipping it over the origin.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.490
But anyway, so if we assume that
that's symetric, then we

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.380
know that this distance is 2,
this distance is minus 2.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.195
If this distance is 2,
then now we know a

00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:24.300
point on this graph.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.920
We know that c must be equal
to 2, because that's the y

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.330
coordinate.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.890
Now we have a point on
the graph, so we can

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.659
substitute it back in.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.750
y equals px cubed.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.190
So let's put 2 for our y,
because we know that that's a

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.490
point of the graph.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.530
We know that point 1/2,
2 is on the graph.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.750
So if we put 2 for y,
we get 2 is equal to

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.640
p times the x value.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.700
p times 1/2 cubed.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.130
So 2 is equal to p over 8.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.260
1/3 cubed, oh sorry
I can't do math.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.030
I did 1/2 over cubed.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.050
1/3 cubed is 27.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.440
3 squared, 9, 27.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.710
So p, multiply both sides
by 27, is equal to 54.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.890
And all we did here is we just
said, well, let's figure out

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.970
what this side is.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.150
We know that this side is 1,
because we can look at the

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.880
minus 1/2 and the 1/2.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.710
So this side has to be 4.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.705
If this side is 4, and it's
symmetric, it goes just as

00:09:28.705 --> 00:09:31.470
much as above the x-axis as
below, and we know that

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.620
because this is an x third,
x cubed function.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.910
We know that this side must
be 2, or that the y

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.140
coordinate is 2.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.810
And then we just substitute into
y is equal to px cubed to

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.460
solve for p.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.710
I'll see you soon.
