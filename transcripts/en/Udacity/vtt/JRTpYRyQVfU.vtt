00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.140
For example, if we have packets arriving in this queue destined

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.660
for the orange queue, at the front of the queue, then

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.360
even with the speed up, there may be packets that are

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.850
sufficiently far behind in the queue that they're waiting behind the

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.940
orange packets. What we'd like to be able to do is

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.980
perform matchings to allow these packets to be sent to the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.080
output ports, and not have to wait for the entire queue

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.000
to be drained of packets destined for the orange output port.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.460
A solution is to create virtual output queues, where instead of having a single

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.780
queue at the input, we have one queue per output port. This prevents packets

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.040
at the front of the queue that are destined for a particular output port

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.620
from blocking packets that could otherwise be

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.990
matched to other output queues in earlier timeslots.
