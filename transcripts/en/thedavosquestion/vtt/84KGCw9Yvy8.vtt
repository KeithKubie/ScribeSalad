00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt; My name is Antonio Guterres, I'm United
Nations high commission for refugees. An answer

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.059
to your question, I think the most important
is for each one of us is to do what we have

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:17.260
to do and to do it based on values, to do
it based on the best of all capacities. And

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.970
then if there are issues that need collective
action, I would select in the present moment,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.509
climate change, and the need to find the medicine
to get, tolerance, the need to make people

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.670
understand that societies are becoming all
multi ethnic multi religious multi cultural.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.250
And we need to respect each other to live
with each other and to be able to make the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.360
most out of it. And finally to understand
that the 21st century will be a century of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.610
people on the move. More and more people will
be moving from one country to the other. Some

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.420
out of choice, some out of necessity and we
need to be able to provide them the same set

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.539
out rights we did for our normal citizens.
