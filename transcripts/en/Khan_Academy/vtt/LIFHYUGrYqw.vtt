00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
- [Instructor] I wanna
do a quick clarification

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.873
on the video on alcohols.

00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:06.690
In that video, I gave this example

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.820
of this alkanol right over here,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.910
it has a triple bond between
the five and six carbons.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.080
And I just wanna clarify that in reality,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.220
it would not ever be drawn this way.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.530
That this was an error to
actually draw it this way.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.720
The way I should have drawn
it is this right over here.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.150
And you see, the only difference
between these two pictures,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.860
starting with the one carbon, two carbon,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.400
three carbon, everything looks the same.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.320
Four carbon attached
to the hydroxyl group,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.470
everything looks the same.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.330
And then we get to the five carbon,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.160
but instead of bending back up,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.560
we just keep going
straight to the six carbon,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.860
that's where we have the triple bond

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.290
between the five and six carbon,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.710
and then we go straight
again to the seven carbon

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.320
that's attached to the two bromo groups.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.800
And then we get to the eighth carbon.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.310
And the whole point why
this right over here,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.640
that this is the correct way to draw it,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.820
the correct way to draw it,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.180
is that triple bonds,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.270
this triple bond right here,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360
it forces a linear configuration.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.300
So on both sides of that triple bond,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.270
you would go straight out.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.176
So whenever you see an,

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:03.960
actually, whenever you see
any type of an alkyne drawn,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.010
the triple bonds should
essentially straighten out.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.753
It should straighten out the molecule.
