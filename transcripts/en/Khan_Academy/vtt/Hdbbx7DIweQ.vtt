00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.570
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.990
is talk about Type I errors

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:09.770
and Type II errors

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.640
and this is in the context
of significance testing.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.520
So just as a little bit of review,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.090
in order to do a significance test,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.090
we first come up with a null

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.720
and an alternative hypothesis.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.850
And we'll do this on some
population in question.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.520
This will say some hypotheses
about a true parameter

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.200
for this population.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.560
And the null hypothesis
tends to be kind of

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.140
what was always assumed or the status quo

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.610
while the alternative hypothesis,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.883
hey, there's news here,

00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:42.060
there's something alternative here.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.290
And to test it, and we're really testing

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.490
the null hypothesis.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.570
We're gonna decide
whether we want to reject

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.010
or fail to reject the null hypothesis,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.800
we take a sample.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.470
We take a sample from this population.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.930
Using that sample, we
calculate a statistic,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.890
we calculate a statistic,
that's trying to estimate

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.810
the parameter in question.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.900
And then using that statistic,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.360
we try to come up with the probability

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.840
of getting that statistic,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.570
the probability of getting that statistic

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.360
that we just calculated from that sample

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.072
of a certain size, given
if we were to assume

00:01:19.072 --> 00:01:22.030
that our null hypothesis,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.370
if our null hypothesis is true.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.660
And if this probability, which
is often known as a p-value,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.150
is below some threshold
that we set ahead of time

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
which is known as the significance level,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.040
then we reject the null hypothesis.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.290
Let me write this down.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.400
So this right over here,
this is our p-value.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.620
This should all be review,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.460
we introduced it in other videos.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.730
We have seen on other
videos if our p-value

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.940
is less than our significance level,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.350
then we reject our null hypothesis,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.010
and if our p-value

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.150
is greater than or equal to
our significance level, alpha,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
then we fail to reject,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.910
fail to reject our null hypothesis.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.390
And when we reject our null hypothesis,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.630
some people will say that might suggest

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.460
the alternative hypothesis.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.950
And the reason why this makes sense is

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.570
if the probability

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.860
of getting the statistic from a sample

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.450
of a certain size, if we assume

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.110
that the null hypothesis is true

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.330
is reasonably low if
it's below a threshold,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.990
maybe this threshold is 5%,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.290
if the probability of that
happening was less than 5%,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.077
then hey, maybe it's
reasonable to reject it.

00:02:34.077 --> 00:02:38.450
But we might be wrong in
either of these scenarios

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.350
and that's where these
errors come into play.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.330
Let's make a grid to make this clear.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.740
So there's the reality,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.030
let me put reality up here,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.870
so the reality is there's two
possible scenarios in reality,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.940
one is the null hypothesis is true

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.860
and the other is that the
null hypothesis is false,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.210
and then based on our significance test,

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.648
there's two things that we might do,

00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:09.400
we might reject the null hypothesis,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.010
or we might fail to

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.970
reject the null hypothesis.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.480
And so let's put a little grid here

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.730
to think about the different combinations,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.500
the different scenarios here.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.020
So in a scenario where the
null hypothesis is true,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.840
but we reject it, that
feels like an error.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.120
We shouldn't reject something that is true

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.140
and that indeed is a Type I error.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.710
Type I error.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.400
You shouldn't reject the null
hypothesis if it was true.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.540
And you can even figure
out what is the probability

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.090
of getting a Type I error.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.170
Well that's gonna be
your significance level

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.366
because if your null hypothesis is true,

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:57.040
let's say that your
significance level is 5%,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.810
well 5% of the time, even if
your null hypothesis is true,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.330
you're going to get a statistic

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.440
that's going to make you
reject the null hypothesis.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.790
So one way to think about the
probability of a Type I error

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.660
is your significance level.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.890
Now, if your null hypothesis is true

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.700
and you failed to reject
it, well that's good.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.440
This we can write this as,
this is a correct conclusion.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.760
The good thing just happened
to happen this time.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.900
Now, if your null hypothesis
is false and you reject it,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.930
that's also good.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.820
That is the correct conclusion.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.410
But if your null hypothesis is false

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.070
and you failed to reject it, well then

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.160
that is a Type II error.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.810
That is a Type II error.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.440
Now with this context,
in the next few videos,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.310
we will actually do some examples

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.720
where we try to identify,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.270
one, whether an error is occurring

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.460
and whether that error
is a Type I or a Type II.
