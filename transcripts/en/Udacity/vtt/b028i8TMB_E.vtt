When the parallel component of force is in the opposite direction

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
as the displacement, work is negative.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here' s a guy climbing up some stairs.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He's sad because he's blue, and here's a lady carrying a bucket down some stairs.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For this question, I just want you to tell me who is doing the positive work

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and who is doing the negative work?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The person going downstairs, check the appropriate box

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the person going upstairs, check the appropriate box.
