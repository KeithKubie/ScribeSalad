00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.580
The problem with David's answer,
in my opinion is that at a certain level

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.080
humans too are just processing
signals and inputs in the right way.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.360
What then makes us intelligent?

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.390
Intelligence is hard to define.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.260
In the life sciences,
scientists study life, but

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.980
don't always agree on
a definition of life.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.050
Similarly, in the cognitive sciences,
we study intelligence, but

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.160
don't necessarily define it.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.380
And knowledge based AI,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.890
will take the view that knowledge is
central to human level intelligence.
