Speaker 1:          00:04:01       the superstition about this day is not to have, I can't do this to have come about. All right. That's enough of that. During the Middle Ages in many have biblical origins, some historians have claimed it was the day on which he bit the apple from the tree of knowledge. Jesus Christ.

Uh, I thought you were done. Sorry. No, I was watching the videos that people sent me this week. What's going on? Or you're going to drop her off? No, I can't do the podcast the way I talk. That's why I was in here with the door closed. It's a pocket door, by the way. If you wonder why you're squeak. Like we live in a haunted house. No, I just found another, I just saw another place that I wanted to show you that maybe you wanted to order from. Yeah, just order me something remotely healthy. Okay. Something to stave off the calories I consume in alcohol. Okay. What'd you like? Some sort of like a, a bowl, like with rice and Tofu and that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       I hate Tofu. It's gotta be a real dead animal that have vegetables. Okay, so you want, you want meat so I shouldn't order from a vegan place then I like, I'm Vegan. As long as there's none of that Tofu, I don't understand what that stuff is. That's like the type of shit that they seal capsule with. So, Tofu. Yes. So liquid doesn't be good. It's not good for you. Tofu is not good for, you know, are you sure you're thinking of Tofu or are you, what is Tofu doesn't come from a tree, does it? There's no Tofu. Food. Trees. I thought TOEFL was made from soybeans. Yeah, but isn't soy bad for you? Not always. I have no, wait, let me get your phone for you. I don't know if you're going to order from a Vegan place. Just get me vegetables, shit that I, I, you know, I know what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       I know what it is. I don't know what Tofu is. It's like fucking algae or something. Okay. All right. Shuffles. Nia. Do you know why Friday the 13th is unlucky. Why?

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       I also don't understand why if it was paradise, why they had a fucking snake in there trying to fuck everything up.

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       What was the devil?

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Yeah, but that's on God.

Speaker 3:          00:06:37       The God and the devil are two separate. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       They're not too safe. God made everything else I made. He also made the contact ball constantly. Not,

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       I don't think. Oh no, but the devil was an angel that got Casco.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       So the devil was basically a bad hire. Yes. That came back and tried to take his company down. All right. Yeah. Okay. Let me finish reading this. Okay. In the New Testament, um, I love how they blame the woman. Like, that's why everything's all fucked up. I mean, without a doubt, if you told abroad did not go over there and eat the fucking apple, she's going to be intrigued.

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:11       You know, like a guy wouldn't, whatever you day. That's still classic thing. Like at substitute teaching, whatever you do, don't laugh. Next person who lapse gets detention. That's it. You're done. You fucking squeeze in your nose doing that fucking little kid laugh. That's it, nick. See, no, you missing a week of research, a recess. That's why you got all these fat fucking kids. The regular teacher takes the day off. The substitute teacher creates the tension though. The, the one skinny kid starts laughing and then he's done. He's eaten that fucking food down the cafeteria that's got all the preservatives in it. Do you know if you fucking kill somebody in the end? Nobody figures it out. You're not in the clear for a good 40 years. That's how let the digging people up from 12 years ago and then that's like, they took a fucking nap. Hey, I'll tell you, these people, they're full of preservatives, you know? All right. And the New Testament, there were 13 people present for Jesus. Jesus, his last supper on Monday. Thursday.

Speaker 3:          00:08:11       Yeah.

Shouldn't be a Felipe like cat, um, arrested hundreds of of the knights Templar and isn't, well, what the forward, what did they do then is novel Davinci Code. Dan Brown cites the 14th century execution. Oh, who gives a fuck? You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       You know something, it's, it's just all bullshit. That's what it is. You always knew it was, I'm trying to think of any bad's ever happened on the 13th, but I pay on Fadiman. You get bad luck today. Fucking old ladies keeping that shit going. That's what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       I don't look like I've been doing smack. I just look like somebody just pinched my fucking inside of my elbow. Really fucking hard. Um, anyway, so I did all that. Ugh. What a shit show that was fucking guys sitting there going did drink it all right. And like, wait, he's got his back to my bar, which I told you his murderer's row, the bottles I have there. I told you I, right now I put it up against the 27 Yankees, the 96 balls. Let's go some underrated teams. The 83 76 hours. Some are lost in history about how fucking great they were. Right. The 86 Celtics, the 85 Lakers, the fucking in 2060 New England patriots, the 98 Yankees, that was a great team for the fucking free agent there waiting. I mean, speaking of which, now that the red sox are doing that this year, that's a good year to get the package. No matter what you're going to be entertained. You, they get to watch like a fucking $900 million team, shit the bed or just, you know, there is no Santa Clause. We're buying one or the other. Either way it's going to be dramatic. Um, so anyways, I got uh, such a funny question. I'm like, drinks, tea. I don't fucking know.

Speaker 2:          00:12:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       Do I have a pocket protector? I don't count them. I like, you know, they, they always, you know what's funny, they fucking say having a glass of wine with your meal is actually good for you. You know what I mean? So I mean, I don't, I don't understand that.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:26       The smoke. Yeah. Yellow a little bit. It's fucking lying your ass off. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       Oh, Jesus. I W can you imagine if he, if can't imagine anybody, even the fucking people who work there, if you answered any of those questions, fucking honestly. You know what I mean? Alright. Uh, Bruins and I probably shouldn't be talking about this. Who gives a shit? There's a comedy podcast. These are all jokes. Everybody. Um, this is what I did today. My fucking dumb ass did today. So, you know, I'm gonna be the person presenter at the writers guild. No, the, the, yeah, the writer's guild awards thing, right? And, uh, so they say it's a black tie thing and I'm, my God, fuck, I gotta get a fucking Tuxedo. So I call up. By the time I call up, it's too late to get one. So Nia, Google sent pictures and everybody seems like relaxed. Like they're just wearing suits with a black tie.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       So I say, fuck it. I wear one of my suits. I pull out a suit, I get the shirt, we do the whole fucking thing. I got it to go in all that. So today I'm dressing up, you know, I'm hanging with my daughter. I'm putting my time in, you know, cause I'm gonna be gone for three, four hours and a Nia is going to be handled by herself and I'm going to go out and go do this, this fucking Hollywood thing, right. And uh, and I'm sitting there and I know, you know, the red carpet and everything's between three or four. And I'm like, can I can't, I don't know when the fuck the car's coming to pick me up. I'm all dressed up, ready to go, you know, two o'clock two oh five to 10 to 15. I'm texting people, hey, once his car coming to get me to 25, I walk outside, I'm looking around, I don't see anybody just sitting there and it finally dawns on me. I'm like, wait a minute. And I just looked up the date of the fucking awards show. It's next Sunday. That hilarious. You know, the funny thing about it is it is Nia got mad at me. What did you write things down? Don't give it up.

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:18       It's not, I didn't miss it. I just was a little early and now I know, you know, I know that you know, I know what I'm going to wear. I'm actually way ahead of the game cause I cause I fucked up. What do you want from me? Um, anyway, speaking of, uh, this is something I've got to let you guys know about. Um, the, uh, the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit, the fifth annual, but Theresa Neil comedy event, uh, benefit, uh, we're actually going to be releasing some, um, some tickets, some a high quality tickets I guess you say some really good seats and we're going to be doing that, uh, Monday today. If you listen to it on Monday, Jesus Christ with the fucking open under the door there because it's ridiculous. That's why. What is ridiculous, Amy, on the podcast? Oh, am I trashing you? Because you were saying like, I got mad at you because you can we come here, come here, come, come in here, come in and come in and don't yell, don't yell. You got the kid there. What? It's absolutely absurd for you to not know when things are anymore. It's like you're a grown ass man and you've got all dressed to go to this. Why is it always grown ass? Why can't you say you're grown up?

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       I can say whatever I want to say and I'm choosing to say that you're a grown ass man who can't seem to write anything down yet because you're a strong woman to the point where you're going to get all dressed up and be like, well, what am I going to wear? There's none the other, and then you come downstairs five minutes later like, well, it's next week with you. You need to get it together. It's not cute.

Speaker 2:          00:15:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       Yeah. That's like the first thing I've screwed up like that a long time. I have a bunch of events in my phone right in the calendar section

Speaker 4:          00:16:01       we're getting when things are, you're always getting the dates wrong and it's frustrating. It's just annoying.

Speaker 2:          00:16:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:07       All right, but how am I doing as a dad?

Speaker 4:          00:16:09       What does that have to do with anything you're doing? Amazingly as all right. We'll stop acting like I'm in some pain shooting heroin in an alley and I'm not acting like get shooting heroin in an alley, but you just need, I just don't understand why you can't ever get your schedule straight. You're always getting the dates wrong. Like, oh, it's tomorrow. Not Today. It's next week. Not this week. Like I don't have them get it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       Yeah, I'm busy, but I don't have an assistant. You will. You should get an assistant. I don't want another person to talk to.

Speaker 4:          00:16:40       I've been telling you to get an assistant for like three years now because of this very reason.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       Yeah. You want to hear all this shit I did this week that I made totally got there on time. No, you don't. Okay. You know why? Because that would prove my point if I was a baseball. What is your, what is your point exactly? At 99% of Shit, I get there on time. 99% well, 98 no. When you did get mad at me, I'm not. I did well then. What's the problem? Why did you have to dramatically open our squeaky pocket door to come in here and cert yourself on the podcast?

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       I Dunno. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       Are you done? Are you kicking me out now? Are you almost done? No, I've just started. Oh, you just started it. Well, people send me a note. I'm 17 minutes in. Oh, Jesus. Oh, I came up here to watch the grammys, but I can't turn the TV on now. Right. It'll go watch the grammys. Okay. I'm going to, is it going to be a bunch of people like right new versus about how Trump's the most evil thing ever. There's some chick that showed up on the red carpet wearing a sparkly dress. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:17:41       Make America great again. And then Trump on the back of it. I don't know who she is, but everyone's already like, what? Oh my God. She's like, just for somebody

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       to show up at a Hollywood event like that and addressed it says like, you know, it's pro Trump is pretty pretty paint by numbers shock, I guess. So. Do you think she'll get some free press out of that? I think she will. Yeah. Was she wearing Madonna's baret no, she was not. I'm going to a protest. What should I wear? Uh, no. She's wearing a pro Trump approach. Trump dress is what I'm saying. I know. I know because that other shit is played out. It's acting like the sky is falling, so now they're going to go the other direction. Yeah, I know, but I feel like that's not going to be like good press for her. You know what I mean? Hey, totes. Any, any press is good. Press. Yeah. Tell this dirty town works. Yeah, I guess so. Okay. Well you could just put out a good album, right? And not rely on your stupid clothes. Yeah. If you put out a good albums, you can keep your clothes on. You don't have to say who you voted for. You can just go up there and a except your shiny thing. That's true. All right, I'm going to take the baby. Okay. Okay. Bye. Okay, bye. Um, anyways. Hi everybody. I'm glad. Yes. All right, Chloe, if you pull the door lower, it doesn't squeak as much. See, there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       See that? No. Well, you almost did it. You could watch the Grammy's near go ahead.

Speaker 2:          00:19:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       Um, anyways, oh, by the way, I'm going to fuck this up. The two fucking best channels right now in my, in my, uh, not humble opinion. Hey, people say in my humble opinion, like you're a humble person. You're not, you're injecting your fucking ideas most likely into a conversation that you just overheard. Or is that just me in my opinion? I don't know when the humble came about, you know, hey, you know, I'm, who am I? Who am I? Who are you? You're the fucking guy that is, is, you know, holding court right now with your opinions is not that fucking humble about this. He's shining a spotlight on yourself. You know, I'm actually in a good mood too. Hang on a second. Let me meet. Let me fucking find this stuff. Um, there's two fucking channels out there. Viceland is the shit. I already told you about that. And now what's his face? Uh, puffy. She has a new network. Puffy. You can't pla fees network. They said net worth revolt. It's another great fucking channel. Both of those channels remind me of the early days of MTV. The early days, the MTV was somewhere between, um, obviously regular television and then just basic cable fucking lunatics, which I really miss. I remember I used to watch this guy. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:20:34       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:37       Damon ZX talks about this a long time ago in the it, it'll be an Anthony show. He used to pretend he was running for office. Damon, Zach's there. It, there it is. This guy was a fucking superstar. I think it was channel eight. There he is. I love this fucking guy. Oh, this is, this isn't gonna translate. Well, d a m. O. N. Z. X. N he used to do this thing where you pretend that he was running for office, this crazy makeup on and just saying all this fucked up shit. And me and Bobby Kelly were living together when stone sober, we would just watch that guy.

Speaker 5:          00:21:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       Like late night after we did our spots, just ordered Chinese food and would just sit there watching the guy laughing our asses off and fucking getting freaked out.

Speaker 5:          00:21:32       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       I dunno. But the early days of MTV was like that and I haven't seen, you know, network television or basic cable be like that in a long time. And I got to tell you those two fucking channels,

Speaker 5:          00:21:44       um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       just great. A bunch of random shit in there. Uh, original shows.

Speaker 5:          00:21:51       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       I don't know, puffy channels more like, I just sat there watching it. And was that guy a, what the fuck's his name? Not Mike Jones guys. Really killer Mike Killer. Mike. And I guess the guy he raps with is white. I don't know anything about, but they fucking just filled them. They just sat around talking about their albums. One Guy Smoking weed, he has like a fucking coughing fit for like 30 seconds. They don't even edit it out. I don't, I was just sitting there and I'm like two hours into this thing going, how the fuck am I still watching this? But it's way more interesting than a lot of, I don't know. I like it. Check it out if he, if he, if you like it, you like it, whatever. What are you going to do? Um, anyways. All right, let's, uh, let's talk about the world of sports as I always do, as I eventually do, as I always make my way back to the old bread and circus here.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       Um, Bruce Cassidy, new coach of the, uh, Boston Bruins, former player, came up with the Blackhawks in like the eighties, and unfortunately had like three or four knee injuries. This is all I know about the guy. And then, um, he paid his fucking dues as a coach coming up. My favorite stop that he had on the way up, he coached for the Jacksonville Lizard Kinks, which, you know, I'm throwing in, I'm throwing my vote and that's one of the best, uh, that's one of the best fucking names from minor league team or the Lizard Kings. It's a reference to the doors. They've got a bunch of reptiles in Florida and fucking Jim Morrison got arrested in Florida for allegedly taking his dick out. Also known in some circles as you lizard.

Speaker 5:          00:23:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:29       And who doesn't want to be a king? You know, you've got the Sacramento Kings, you got the La kings and he got the Jacksonville Lizard Kings. Anyways, he's undefeated so far, you know, granted, you know, we were playing our best hockey I felt to this season when I, when he took over. But, uh, this is a new guy, you know, I got to a support there. Um, what's his face? Pasa knock with the fucking, uh, with the game where against the Vancouver Canucks after you made a very sketchy past in the first period. He makes it up fucking unbelievable. K down the fucking left side, slammed on the brakes, just like I do it. Pick up hockey, except he actually stopped rather than continuing into the boards in hurting himself. Um, and then fucking little, whatever the fuck he didn't, he put it in. It was fantastic. Oh, it was tremendous. Um, but I got to tell you guys about the greatest sporting event I think I've been to since I went to the, uh, New England patriots first Los Angeles Rams when we won our first super bowl and all I can tell you about Duke at Cameron indoor arena.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       It's like how loud the crowd was when Vinod Terry kicked that field goal. It was that loud, the whole fucking game. I've never been to anything like it. And we sat in the low, we was sitting center court. I thought we're going to be behind the bench. Sorry about that. We will send a court, um, not on the student side across from them and the lower area. And Dude, I'll tell you, there's no fucking way to get out of there. There's no way to go to the bathroom. There's no way to fucking, there's nobody coming around to concessions. You are fucked. You are in there. And that is it. Old School, fucking barn.

Speaker 5:          00:25:21       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       you went in, it's so small, I guess it holds like 9,000 people, but you felt like you were in there with like 200 people. And we came in and it was already a, they were already shooting around before the game. And uh, we finally got to our seats. Like you just don't think that your seats are even going to be there because everybody is so jammed in. And um, we didn't sit down for the whole fucking game. I guess I started sitting down during timeouts cause I'm old and I gotta tell you I've never, I'd never seen an atmosphere like that ever. This beats everything. I've been to the a NCAA a, uh, the championship game was in the fucking Georgia dome. So I mean, that's a shitty place to watch your basketball game. Even people going nuts. It just floats up to the top of the, the, the, the domain.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       You don't even hear it. Um, I've, I've just, I, I don't even know why I didn't know where to begin. And then it was an unbelievable gain just back and forth, back and forth when it looked like UNC was going to pull away, Duke would come back. Then it looked like Duke was going to have the game on ice and then UNC would come back. Somebody hit a three, someone else would hit a fucking three was unbelievable. And I was very impressed with both teams. I liked that kid on UNC number 44. He doesn't rattle. He doesn't fucking act like he changed the game of basketball when he hits a shot he gave a fuck about was winning. He had some big three pointer and then they immediately called timeout rather than thumping his own chest and acting like he's in Braveheart. He came back to the bench high five.

Speaker 1:          00:26:54       But you see, he was pissed because they just had just let up an easy bucket before he hit his three. And um, I don't know, I don't know shit about anything, but if I was a scout I would pay attention to that just as much as somebody's actually doing great things out on the court. And, um, it was insane, dude. Fucking coach k coming out. I, I just, I'm reminded me when I, when I went to the kings game, when they wrapped it up one time to win a Stanley Cup and I saw them bring the Stanley Cup out. It was like that except it could walk around talking. So I want to thank, uh, I want to thank my call at the comedy zone in Charlotte for two awesome shows and thank you so much for, uh, getting us in touch with the person that hooked us up with the tickets. Uh, may verzion Barnick we're all sitting there going, I think that might've been

Speaker 3:          00:27:45       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:45       The greatest sporting event I went to, obviously seeing the Patriots win the super bowl was bigger, but um, the level of excitement, like I, I just never been, never been to anything like that. And uh, if you ever get a fucking chance, um, that is definitely one worth stub. Hubbing

Speaker 3:          00:28:03       um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       oh, the college give fucking the students were crazy and they had all these funny chance and I'm sure everybody's going to say all they stole this from you. They stole this from this guy and blah, blah blah blah blah. I don't fucking know. But it was making me laugh, you know, when they were introduced in the UNC players, I'll just use my name. They just say, Ya play in fucking that point guy number fucking zero bill burn. And then the whole student section just goes, hi bill, you suck. And they just did it to the whole thing. It was childish. It was fucking hilarious. They started chanting, I couldn't tell what they were chanting and then gradually figured it out. It was crazy towel guy. I was like, crazy, what the fuck are they saying? Crazy? What? And people start turning around looking at us, and then I realized, I look and be honest. So we look up and all of a sudden this fucking old guy gets up, starts whipping this towel around his head, this old fucking lunatic. I'm like, oh, I guess that's like I said, some crazy towel guy.

Speaker 3:          00:29:01       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:29:03       So it's gone back and forth, back and forth, all these crazy chance you let your whole team down all of this shit. The next thing you know, it's like halftime. We're sitting there going like, dude, what the fuck was that? That was 20 minutes of basketball. That felt like a minute. My ears were ringing. Like I'd gone to a concert and there's still another half to play. Then all of a sudden this Asian lady comes out this Asian way coming out on like a fucking three story unicycle, and she's doing that act where you, you're fucking, you flip the saucer Rania head. Okay. Which I had seen before. I've seen the act done before. I've never seen it live, but it fucking hilarious. Versie barnick had never seen that. That's saying I wasn't blown away. I was definitely blown away. So she, she goes to f like flip it on her head and the first of all, you know when you stop on a Unicycle, you can't just stop.

Speaker 1:          00:29:54       You gotta do that front, back, front, back, front, back to it. Now she's doing that with one foot on the fucking pedal. She's got a goddamn soup bowl on one of our, the end of her feet on a toes. Your feet. A lot of people know it as your toes, right? So everybody's sitting there, right? She fucking flips it. It does like a triple Lindy and lands on the top of her head and everybody's just like, oh shit. Right? So then she fucking, what the thing still on her fucking head, the little soup kitchen. A Cup dare, right. She rides down to another, the other corner of the basketball court. Now she puts two down now for as he starts going, no way. No fucking way. No fuck away air right there, Fred. It fucking lands. Oh crowd. Oh Shit. Then she goes to do three. So she's got one upright, the other's upside down. The others upright just going like right up her fucking Shin and she fucking landed that and first z stood up. You have to see what black people go to church and whether they call it catching the holy ghost. That's what looked like happened to Paul versus

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       everybody was sitting down for, he stood up and applauded. I'm fucking dying laughing. She goes to four balls. Everybody's like, no shit. Four balls go in the air. Land right on her head. One, two, three, four hole crap. What the fuck? Right? Then she goes down, her closing bit, not one, not two, not three or four. She puts five fucking soup bowls. It's all the way up to her knee. Okay. Oh, I forgot to tell you this. This guy's like flipping the bowls. So he flipped one tour and he fucking threw a two short. She dropped it and I was going, I fuck he just jinxed her. He just fucked with their rhythm. It's like calling a time out to ice the kicker. So she's got five flips them up in the fucking air. One, two, three, four, and the fifth one bounced off my head.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       Everybody's like, ah, ah Geez. There is no Santa Claus, right? You know what she said? She said, fuck that. Set him up again. Right? Teaching these kids, these fucking millennials or whatever the fuck you call these kids nowadays, these kids who grew up with knee pads, elbow pads and helmets, when they rode bicycles, they had play dates. They weren't left alone in the company of adults that no one really knew who they were. These, these kids were sheltered. They don't know how to make a comeback. These kids get drunk. They Call Uber, right? Everything's just set up for them. So they don't know how to fucking pull themselves off the mat, you know? Well, let me tell you something. This lady on this one fucking tired bicycle, she showed them how cause she said, hey, fuck it. I don't give a shit that you throw me five more.

Speaker 1:          00:32:47       She sent him up again, right? Flip them in the air. Landed all five fucking place goes nuts. Just as loud as the God damn. Almost as loud as the fucking game. There was no break, there was no break in the excitement that fucking ends. We're looking going, what the fuck did we just see and outcomes, coach k fucking Duke and UNC and it gets loud again. More chanting, more singing, more fucking screaming came all the way down. Duke finally put the game away with like a fucking minute left with a couple of foul shots. And uh, I just sat there in the last few seconds when I knew that Tuk was going to win and I just looked at, looked around, looked at everything I could look at, try to make enough mental pictures as I could to take it in. Cause I knew I was just like, I don't know if I'll ever get back to seeing one of these again. But um, I dunno if that didn't sell you, I'd fucking, you gotta do it. That is a two fuck Madison Square Garden. It's a mecca. Fuck that place. You can go down there and see the fucking ice. Capades save your money. Go on stubhub. All right, go on stuff up and just get yourself some tickets and go there. You will not be disappointed. And you gotta go while coachK is still there. Who by the way, I believe tomorrow the 13th is his 70th birthday.

Speaker 3:          00:34:09       Okay.

This fucking guy came out of fucking nowhere. Then you go over the other guy. What happened? I came out of fucking nowhere. I wasn't even looking. Never happens. It's all fake news. It's all opinions, right?

Speaker 6:          00:42:03       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:42:05       for the most part, other than, you know, if somebody dies, this guy is fucking dead. Okay. You can agree on that. How we died, why he died, who's, who's responsible? Oh, Jesus Christ. But we get it. Okay. That's all I'm saying. That's all. That's all I'm really saying here. All right, let's get to, well, let's get to the content here. Um, you read some, uh, some of your letters here. Alright. Yoko Ono makes Julian Lennon by letters he wrote to his dad at auction. All right, Bill, is there a worst woman in history? I hate to be hacky. I know the Beatles days were numbered. It wasn't just her, but it didn't help. Yeah. But at the end of the day, John Shows her, Jesse, what happened? Something happened between John and his mom and she died or she fucking, I dunno, she beat him with a wooden spoon. I forget how the fucking story went.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       All right. But whatever she did or if she died, it's not her fault. It left him with the psychological makeup to be susceptible to not trying to just find a mate. He also wanted a mom and all she had to do was make some cookies. All right, make him some cookies on his fucking birthday, whatever the fuck he wanted, and then that was it. This guy was done. You know, I think he wouldn't, you know, if he lived the somewhere in his mid forties he just would've been like, all right. You know what? What the fuck was that? Maybe you would've got up. Maybe. Maybe he liked it. I have no idea. But anyways, let's continue. He said, then there's the video. Will you call her out for screeching like a maniac during a powerful moment of history. Now she won't give her husband's son some paper he gave his dad 20 years earlier.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       This story might be a bit old, but it doesn't seem to make, but it doesn't make it any less true. I watched the clip. What it is, was she auctioned off a bunch of his shit is what it is. She's not making him pay for it. She sold it. And Julian wants to get it back, but because Yoko sold it, um, he has to buy it back. Now I'm in defense for what I would say is the cash cow died. It's not like Yoko could go out and fucking cell, take a records like a beetle. So all of a sudden she's gone like, Holy Fuck, how am I still going to be able to live in the, in the Dakota? So she selling all this shit or maybe her husband died. She wanted to fucking move on and didn't want to look at all his old shit. You know what I mean? I have no idea. Um, but yeah, I watched a little, that video. Julianne definitely goes hard on her and says, uh, that you think, see, she's extremely manipulative and that, um, she knew what the fuck she was doing from day one. And I can't remember if that's actually his mother. I Dunno. How was he related? It you, who the fuck knows? I don't know. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       Is there a worse woman in history? Yeah, there's way worse women, those women that ran empires and had people killed, you know, for whatever fucking reason. You know, the, the, the story of Scarface, the second one, the one that Pachino did was based on a, a, you know, there was the original movie, but the stories that they used in, in the second one, uh, were based on a drug dealer of that time who actually was a woman. So I mean, yeah, I would say she was worse. You know, having people shot in the fucking street is probably worse than a sell on some postcards, but, you know, it's all up to interpretation. You know, this is the new me, the new meditating bill, the mood more relaxed bill who's undoing the fucking nuts of anxiety in his mind. I cannot say enough about fucking meditating.

Speaker 5:          00:46:03       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:04       now that I'm not trying to like get good at it, I'm just trying to do it.

Speaker 5:          00:46:09       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       I don't flip out to the level I used to like, I think, you know, say like 10 is the worst flipping out. I think I used to walk around, just walk around on a good day. I was already at a six compared to how most people are when they're just like totally chilling out. So it was a very quick and easy trip up to 10. Uh, now I feel like I walk around at like a three. I feel like I've cut it in half. So now when I flip out I kinda just go to six, which is still totally unacceptable for most social situations. I still flip out and people look over their shoulders startled but not with the level of, of what the fuck, you know what I mean? Reminds you this time I saw I was on like highway eight or something interstate eight, I think I was in Arizona, New Mexico.

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       I don't where the fuck I was at and this bull, it somehow gotten free. I mean I was in the middle of fucking nowhere. I was and there was two cowboys right on horses and these are cowboys. They're trying to fucking rope a Goddamn bull, which I didn't know if you can do. I don't what the fuck they were doing. So one of them is trying to distract the bull is the other one is on a horse that is sneaking up behind it. And the course is sneaking up the way horses sneak up in a fucking cartoon. And this bowl at the last second figured it out and he fucking turned around. You know that look, Bruce Willis always does when he looks over his shoulder and die hard. It's the same thing except it was a fucking bull. That's the look that people, when I would lose my shit prior to meditating, I would get that look. Everyone would fucking turn around. Like, you know, a skyscraper was on fire and it was just some fucking balding redhead flipping out because he couldn't figure out the new operating system on his, on his smart phone.

Speaker 2:          00:48:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:04       Completely unacceptable. So, uh, my temper is, has really reduced and, um, I'm telling you, if I could just not fucking do, I just made this statement out loud. It's like, I'm, my daughter's not going to see me flipping out, you know, I'm not saying I want it every way. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Would, she's fucking drawn on the wall at some point, but, uh, she's not going to see me yelling at computers. It's just not going to happen. Okay. And I say it out loud. When I say it out loud, that means it happens. Right? I hope so many ways. I'm trying. Fuck you guys. I'm trying. Anytime I talk about this too in my standup back, then I'm going to try to fix my temper. People just start laughing. They laugh when they point and they make me feel bad. I'm alright.

Speaker 1:          00:48:45       Italy and the European Union. Hey, their Capitol Hill Bill. I'm just a bill. Yes. I'm only a bill and I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill and okay. I'm a political science professor from a school I won't name to keep with your policy of not naming names a having studied and taught the subject. It's fair to say I look at what goes on today from a much wider scope. A wider scope than who? Me. I would hope so. I would hope so wider than me. Um, all right. And that's not something that is only exclusive to receiving a master's in political science. Could you pat yourself on the back any more? Sir? Did you elbow patch? Fly off your fucking left arm of your sport coat when you reach back to that is all, I love this guy and that's not all these something that is only exclusive to receiving a master's in political science.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       This guy should be wearing a scarf with a nice breeze going. Anyone can read souls in each sin. Thank you for fucking sound spelling that for me and others who have honestly captured an important perspective of history and have a much clearer understanding of how and why governments and socialites have evolved through history. Anyways, there is one thing that has flown under the radar now that I've gotten my resume out of the way. There's one thing that has flown under the radar and I think it should scare the shit out of most European countries. All right. Let me start by saying in short that the European Union parentheses, which in my opinion is run by fascist self interest, can I just stop here and say this is the most well-written fucking email I've ever received on the podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:50:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       This is incredible. Um, let me start by saying in short to the European Union, which my opinion is run by fascist with self interest, tried to take control of Italy's army for the sake of your time. I will spoil the ending. Italy did not vote to allow the EU to take over that move by the EU. Alarmed some of my peers who I in 20 plus years of knowing them have not seen them alarmed by anything in terms of government, in the scheme of things, a banking institution, openly financing legislation that is trying to gain control of a foreign countries, foreign governments. Military is for the lack of a better term, really, really ballsy. Why do I feel like I missed some information here? Okay, so the, the European Union tried to take over Italy's army. Okay. I see that Italy did not vote to allow the EU to take over. So when you joined the European Union,

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       they took take over your army, is that what you're saying? Okay, so that moved by the EU alarm. Some of my peers. What move? Oh, trying to take over the, okay, but you're jumping back and forth here. I can't tell what you're talking about. Can take control of Italy's army case. So them trying to take control of their army. Yeah. How would you do that? Okay. The idea that, let me just finish this, the idea that certain globalist groups are trying to take control of the world is not an incredible idea among people who are versed in political economics or conspiracy theorists like myself. But you know something me, they just go, oh, where do you get your fucking 10 hat on? And a you, if you just started saying what the fuck you just said, you'd probably run into the same problem like you just, I just said it was the best written email ever and I got lost in it cause I'm too fucking stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:52:33       I understand what you're talking about. So it's gotta be hard, man. You just got to hang out with people with the fucking elbow patches on their sport coats. Right. Anyways. The idea that certain globalist groups are trying to take control of the world is not an incredible idea among people who are versed in political economics. I have heard you talk about stuff like this in the context of a conspiracy and so other than this possibly possibly being interesting to you. It's also too, it's also affirm that you are not out of your mind. I attached an article if you'd like to read further, absolutely would look at this. How about that? Everybody all you can't stand. I got a 10 hat on tinfoil hat on. Whatever the fuck that means. Half of you say that you don't even know what it means. You get your tinfoil tinfoil add on.

Speaker 1:          00:53:17       You know, I don't even know what the fuck it means. Is that, is that like my antenna? If I'm doing some sort of pirate radio, tin foil hat meaning I know what it means. Weed you out of your fucking mind, but how did it come about? The tinfoil hat is made from one or more sheets of aluminum foil. I didn't want the exact or a piece of conventional head gear lined with foil worn in the belief or hope that it shields the brain from threats such as electromagnetic fields, mind control in mind. Right. Oh, I see. I see. Well, you know, that's a macgyver shit. I can go with that. Right. Set a bad thing. Anyways. Well, where the fuck was I?

Speaker 5:          00:54:01       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:54:01       I've attached a, I wouldn't, I would actually to relate to how long is this? So is this something I can read? You know, I'll read about this and I'll give you my uninformed opinion, my moronic opinion on the next podcast. How about that? Does that work for you? Does that grab you? I'm all right. Fat guys turns out to not be fat. Billy twinkle Bowes. Um, this guy told, was told by a doctor his whole life that he was fat. He had this huge frontal thing on going on that turned out to not be a giant belly, but 130 pound tumor. How many people do you know will start using the tumor defense?

Speaker 5:          00:54:40       MMM [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       I actually looked this fucking thing up. The guy is fat. He's very fat. Even after the fucking tumor. I mean like he's laying in bed, any has, it's like he is an inner tube of fat going around the like, that's what his neck is. This guy is so fucking fat. He had a 130 pound tumor and he just thought it was part of his love handle. He is fat. Um, I'm glad they got it out of there. Geez. How do you, I didn't get that out of their hundred and 30 pounds. How the fuck do you, I mean, you gotta take it out in sections 10 pounds at a time. You need to make 13 fucking incisions, Jesus Christ and just thrown it over your shoulder, hitting the ground like a fucking bowling ball.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       Jesus Christ. Do you know, I knew a guy

Speaker 5:          00:55:38       dead. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       you know, everybody's talking about probiotics and they talk about the bacteria in your gut that it will, you know, there's bacteria in your gut that's supposed to be there. They try to scare the shit out of you, but it's supposed to be there. It's there for when you die in a begins to did decomposing process provided you're not full of fucking preservatives and you just decompose because you not important and you just become part of the earth again. But we stick ups ourselves in these fancy fucking boxes because we think we're too good to be warm food for whatever fucking reason. But anyways, um, alcohol,

Speaker 2:          00:56:15       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       eats away at the good shit, the good bacteria that you need while you're alive. Like you supposed to be balanced and you're supposed to have more of the good bacteria cause you have more of the bad bacteria, you can actually enter your own fucking way. You beginning to decompose while you're still alive or in a short way you starting to die. This is the way this guy explained it to me. So he started getting a distended belly. They didn't know what the fuck was going on and he wouldn't go to the doctor. And then finally you found out, you know, somebody said maybe you got a tape worn and that freaked them the fuck out. They could've been something alive in him. And he went to the doctor and then they found out that that's what it was. And uh, they gave him some medicine and you know, Eddie had to shit it all out.

Speaker 1:          00:56:53       That's basically what happens. So, um, I don't know. Even then I always buy the Greek yogurt and it goes bad. I always think like, and I'll slam a couple of scotches and the next morning I have two spoonfuls of fucking Greek yogurt yoga and I'll be fine. I was happy in the life insurance, they said on a nice fucking easy, you know, heart rhythm. I was also meditating when they did it. You know, I was being totally present. I was listening to the sounds of the room. I slowed my breathing, I tricked those fuckers. But I also had the Bruins game on in the background. So I was trying not to react to what the fuck was going on. Cause we'd left his fucking cunty goal at the end of the second period with like one second left. All right. Crazy. Sadam story. Crazy. Alright. Hey, bill thought I brighten your day with this crazy account of what went down in Iraq.

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       When Sadam took power, basically the gathered all government officials in one room, the current military leader gets brought out on stage. He clearly, he's clearly been beaten. He admits to having committed treason, but clearly he hasn't. They then start calling out officials one at a time, so everyone was scared shitless that they'd be called out and marched out into a courtyard with the others. Then after half of them were gone, the remaining officials were all taken out to the courtyard and told that if they didn't shoot the traders, they and their families would be killed. That way they all had blood on their hands. Insane. Here's the whole account and did think that u s still did business with Saddam, with them after that. Ha Ha Dude. As far as I know, we kind of put that guy in over there,

Speaker 3:          00:58:33       you know

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       it, and we were cool with the guy until he fucking tried to go around us and start selling oil. The other, I don't know what the fuck he did. We, you know, you know what I mean? Saddam was saying to the United States, he was like one of those fucking a first round draft choices that that's a bust. He was a bust for us, you know, in a very promising college career. And you know, he just, he just didn't have the passion. Actually. He was a very passionate guy. He just wasn't passionate in the wrong, I don't know who the fuck knows. I mean it's all evil shit. That shit is just like,

Speaker 3:          00:59:13       um,

Speaker 1:          00:59:14       it's the most base level evil cause they're not even trying to hide it. But I got to tell you, when Trump was talking to that fucking guy, they're on from Fox News, Bill O'Reilly and Bill O'Reilly's giving him shit that he was friends with Putin, Putin or whatever the fuck his name is. And he goes, the guys that he's a killer to have a fucking standing president go, well look at this country. Look what we'll look what we've done. My jaw hit the fucking ground. Like, is he actually going to say this? You can't say this. Everybody knows it's true. But you can't fucking say this now. We only kill the bad people. The Fuck Outta here. It's all fucking evil. And that goes back to that fake news. That's why they need to take control of the fake news so they can spin it. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:59:56       The Guy, he came out of fucking nowhere. The sedan was saying, where are we at? A green light. He came out of fucking nowhere. Everybody does it. Everybody does it. You know what? And I fucking do it too. We're all spinning it. We're all spinning our own horse shit. We all think we're Fike. I'm not going to speak for you guys, but I'm spinning my own bullshit, right? This is my favorite video anybody's sent me in a long fucking time now. Oh, by the way, if you want to watch that sit down thing, uh, I'll, I'll post all these videos. I don't know if I want to watch it. That stuff. I Dunno. I don't like watching shit like that.

Speaker 5:          01:00:32       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       all right. 109 year old guy smoked cigars and drinks whiskey. Dear Billy F deer farm state bill. I know you have a life insurance policy test, but I thought you might want to see this. This 109 year old guy smoked cigars all day. Not Saying it's great for everyone, but figured you'd want to hear the title. Actually marginalize this guy's life. He's got a great attitude. He still drives. He's the oldest living World War II veteran. You'd really enjoy this. He talks about having a truck for a long time and they show his old school TV with the giant dials. He keeps it all because it works and he likes it. Come to Boston. I fucking love this guy. He said at one point he smokes 12 cigars a day. He goes, I don't inhale. So you inhale, he goes, you get in trouble. The bottom line is, you know, whatever's genetics are, this works for him. Cause I know if I smoked 12 a day, I, first of all, I couldn't physically fucking do it, but he had, it's like a 79 look like a 78 or 79 Ford pickup truck, yet an old square TV that still had the legs on it from like the 70s.

Speaker 5:          01:01:35       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       he built his house in like 1940. He still lives there. He said, I like the shit that I have. It still works so I'm not buying more shit. It's like what I'm trying to do now, get rid of all this extra shit that I bought

Speaker 5:          01:01:47       and um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       I got to tell you, watching this guy watching his life is the life that I'm slowly moving towards. It's the life that I want.

Speaker 5:          01:02:00       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:02:01       after running around like a fucking lunatic, reacting to everything for the first fucking, you know, 40 something years of my life.

Speaker 5:          01:02:13       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       you know, I would like to slow down a little bit is far as of, I mean, look, I'm still, I know all you guys are worried. I got God, he's gonna slow down. He's not going to be fucking far. I'm still going to completely fuck up, still going to do dumb shit. I'm going to be fine, but I don't have to be walking or I basically walked around, stuck in fight or flight mode probably from the age of eight till now. And um, I dunno, it's just stupid with stats. It's funny to observe but it really wears on the people around you and eventually it fucking wears you down. And it's just like the amount of fucking time that I have wasted arguing with people where they're not going to change their mind. I'm not going to change my mind. I've just, I, I've, uh, I've done, uh, past that point my fucking life and it feels fucking great. I just have to believe that I am.

Speaker 5:          01:03:10       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       I'm trying to do now when I flip up, cause I know there's other angry constantly listen to this and you listen to this because I'm an angry conduit. It probably makes you feel better about yourself.

Speaker 5:          01:03:20       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       which is why I love Bobby Knight bought you watch Bobby night and you're like, oh my God, I'm a fucking saint. This guy. Now this guy has got a temper that I'm telling you right now. Yeah. Your wife ever gives you shit for having a temper. It's like you think I got a temper, just cut the yard or you could be married to that. And I love Bobby Knight by the way. Um, so anyways, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       I just now like, uh, I don't know. I try to, in the moment I just try to fucking like, this is funny thing that happens. Like when my daughter, uh, you don't need your diaper changed. It's like, you know, you hear him farting and everything. So you thinking like, okay, that's definitely a, you know, when you, you, I mean, without getting into the gross details, just think you here the farm and you think that's the gun sounding the end of the game. And then when she get into it, you realize that wasn't the gun sounding the end of the game or even the end of the half. That was the sound of the fucking jets flying over the game, over the stadium right after the fucking national anthem. And the game's about ready to begin.

Speaker 5:          01:04:27       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       I left pad save yesterday, block cheese block, saved my wall, took it all on my shirt and all that. It's just like,

Speaker 5:          01:04:39       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       it's fucking unbelievable. And whenever that happens, like a couple of times I went like, Nia, she, why'd you tell me to come in? And she's still going. Like she could tell like there's any way for my wife to know whether my daughter is done going to the bathroom or not. She's got no fucking idea. And I just, I apologized, eh, uh, I just addressed that I was angry and I, and I did it two more fucking times and now, now I got it down. Now he just say something as I walk up to the changing table at three or four in the morning. And I just basically say, if she's not done, and you know, this is not anybody's fault, this is just part of having a kid don't flip out. And I, and I'll see how that works for me tonight. That's just based.

Speaker 1:          01:05:23       I just, before I just kept it all in my head and then it becomes like, it isn't that it's Sorta, sorta real but isn't, I just find when I say it out loud, then I can fucking address it and uh, so we'll see that. But uh, I gotta tell you, I actually fucking really enjoy, uh, changing diapers and everything. We gave my daughter her first bath ever right in the kitchen sink, old school style. I'm sure we were supposed to have like a fucking hazmat suit team come in and disinfect the sink and she's supposed to wear a helmet and some scuba gear, but uh, that's not our bringing her up. We'll go and we'll go on old school. I've been playing music for, on everything. Got this exercise ball and really just kind of puts you to sleep and I just play music and she just totally chills out.

Speaker 5:          01:06:08       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       the stuff that she's enjoyed so far, she's, she likes Herbie Hancock. I was playing some Billy carbons, some of this shit I just been listening to.

Speaker 5:          01:06:20       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       what else has she been listed? Some of the pop stuff she really likes. I think they just liked music in general. They just kind of like, what the, what is that? And uh, I dunno, it's getting to that point. She's just starting to be able to look around and you kind of sit there going like, I think she's actually looking at me right now then right as you make a guy contact, like, hey, are you fucking looking at me or I just kind of drift away and look at something else. I'm like, Eh, I guess I'm still like an acid trip when she looks at me.

Speaker 5:          01:06:49       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:06:51       but anyways, we're having a great time and I, even though I'm not getting any sleep, um, it's totally fucking worth it. And uh, it's, it's, I'll tell you if funeral, if you're an older dad, it's not as fucking hard. They tried to say, oh my God, you're old and going to try to do this. It's like, yeah, I'm old and I have a house. You know, I'm not some fucking struggling 20 something, you know what I mean? Fucking broke kid trying to pay off student loans. And then you have a kid, people in their twenties, if they complain about having a kid, I, I, yeah, without a doubt. I'll listen to that. But if you're in your thirties and forties, ain't could go fuck yourself. All right. That's it. Okay. That's the podcast for, uh, for Monday.
