00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's a man in elevator. This man wants to lose weight.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And he is very happy because he thinks he has found a pretty clever way to lose his weight.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This man is standing on a scale, and as a quick reminder,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
let's talk about the forces acting on this man when the elevator is completely still.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can represent him as a box of mass m. Gravity is pulling down with the strength equal to mg.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And a normal force is pushing up with the exact same strength, because he is motionless.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There is no acceleration. Now remember, the scale doesn't read mg.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It doesn't tell you exactly what your weight is.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It tells you how hard it has to push to keep you from falling through the scale.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So this man's realized that if he can just reduce Fn, then he can reduce his perceived weight.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Of course, this will lead to unbalanced forces meaning he'll have to accelerate downwards.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In order to accelerate downwards, he's going to need an elevator.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This man finds that when he is at rest in the elevator, the scale says 800 N.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
He wants the scale to say 600 N. Now, I have two questions for you.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
First, what must his downward acceleration be

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to actually see this target weight of 600 N on the scale?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Next, if he travels at acceleration for 5 seconds

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and assuming the elevator started at rest, how far will he travel?

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And this is more of a review of unit 2. Enter your answers here and here.
