00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
finally that ability to store replay so
 

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.910 align:start position:0%
finally that ability to store replay so
I<00:10:43.480><c> think</c><00:10:43.690><c> when</c><00:10:43.780><c> I</c><00:10:43.810><c> created</c><00:10:44.140><c> this</c><00:10:44.230><c> we</c><00:10:44.410><c> said</c><00:10:44.830><c> we</c>

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
I think when I created this we said we
 

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.170 align:start position:0%
I think when I created this we said we
were<00:10:45.040><c> storing</c><00:10:45.280><c> a</c><00:10:45.370><c> hundred</c><00:10:45.580><c> shots</c><00:10:45.700><c> which</c><00:10:45.940><c> allow</c>

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:46.180 align:start position:0%
were storing a hundred shots which allow
 

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
were storing a hundred shots which allow
you<00:10:46.240><c> to</c><00:10:46.360><c> do</c><00:10:46.450><c> a</c><00:10:46.480><c> bit</c><00:10:46.630><c> more</c><00:10:46.660><c> than</c><00:10:46.810><c> that</c><00:10:46.960><c> now</c>

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:48.490 align:start position:0%
you to do a bit more than that now
 

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.890 align:start position:0%
you to do a bit more than that now
so<00:10:48.790><c> what</c><00:10:48.940><c> does</c><00:10:49.000><c> it</c><00:10:49.060><c> mean</c><00:10:49.240><c> in</c><00:10:49.390><c> terms</c><00:10:49.570><c> of</c><00:10:49.720><c> data</c>

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:49.900 align:start position:0%
so what does it mean in terms of data
 

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.170 align:start position:0%
so what does it mean in terms of data
sand<00:10:50.230><c> pouring</c><00:10:50.410><c> grass</c><00:10:51.130><c> for</c><00:10:51.340><c> you</c><00:10:51.430><c> but</c><00:10:51.580><c> but</c><00:10:51.910><c> quite</c>

sand pouring grass for you but but quite
 

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
sand pouring grass for you but but quite

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:54.550 align:start position:0%
