00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.940
All of the work we've been
doing so far with line

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.940
integrals has been with
scalar functions or

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.420
scalar-valued functions.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.020
And when I say that, that just
means you give me an x and a y

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.130
and you evaluate the function
at that x and y, and you

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.640
get another scalar value.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.710
You get just a number.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.620
You don't get a vector.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.940
So what I want to do in this
video is start to get ourselves

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.860
warmed up with regards to
vectors so that we can

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.220
understand what it means to
take a line integral with

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.030
vector-valued functions.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.910
So let me write down some
vector-valued functions.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.052
Actually, even a better place
to start, let me draw a curve

00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:36.290
or let me describe a curve.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.440
So let's put that little
f of x, y to the side.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.820
We can ignore it for now.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.525
Let's say I have some curve c
and it's described, it can be

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:50.720
parameterized-- I can't say
that word-- as let's say, x is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.590
equal to x of t, y is equal
to some function y of t.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.440
And let's say that this is
valid for t is between a and b.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.280
So t is greater than or
equal to a and then,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.240
less than or equal to b.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.990
So if I were to just draw
this on-- let me see-- I

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.320
could draw it like this.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.270
I'm staying very
abstract right now.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.740
This is not a very
specific example.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.910
This is the x-axis.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.360
This is the y-axis.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.150
My curve-- let's say this
is when t is equal to a.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.750
And then the curve might
do something like this.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.640
I don't know what it does.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.920
Let's say it's over there.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.510
This is t is equal to b.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.430
This actual point right
here will be x of b.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.560
That would be the x-coordinate.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.270
You evaluate this function
at b and y of b.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.610
And this is, of course,
when t is equal to a.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.370
The actual coordinate in r2 on
the Cartesian coordinates will

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.140
be x of a, which is
this right here.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.840
And then, y of a, which
is that right there.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.050
And we've seen that before.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.770
That's just a standard way
of describing a parametric

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.650
equation or curve using
2 parametric equations.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.350
What I want to do now is
describe this same exact curve

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.340
using a vector-valued function.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.970
So if I define a vector-valued
function-- and if you don't

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.230
remember what those are, we'll
have a little bit

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.910
of review here.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.180
Let me say I have a
vector-valued function, r,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.150
and I'll put a little
vector arrow on top of it.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.670
And a lot of textbooks, they'll
just bold it and they'll

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.940
leave scalar-valued
functions unbolded.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.120
But it's hard to draw bold,
so I'll put a little

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.550
vector on top.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.220
And let's say that r
is a function of t.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.045
And these are going to
be position vectors.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.930
And I'm specifying that
because, in general, when

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.170
someone talks about a vector,
this vector and this vector

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.320
are considered equivalent.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.990
As long as they have the same
magnitude and direction, no one

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.550
really cares about what their
start and end points are as

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.490
long as their direction's
the same and their

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.710
length is the same.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.520
But when you talk about
position vectors you're saying

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.155
no, these vectors are all going
to start at 0, at the origin.

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:12.440
And when you say it's a
position vector, you're

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.000
implicitly saying this is
specifying a unique position.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.710
In this case, it's going
to be in two-dimensional

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.550
space, but it could be in
three-dimensional space.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.260
Or really, even four, five,
whatever-- n dimensional space.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.010
So when you say it's a position
vector, you're literally

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.520
saying, OK, this vector
literally specifies

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.580
that point in space.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.560
So let's see if we can describe
this curve as a position

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.050
vector-valued function.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.110
So we could say r of t.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.750
Let me switch back
to that pink color.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.020
This can stay in green.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.750
Is equal to x of t times the
unit vector in the x direction.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.400
The unit vector gets a little
caret on top-- a little hat.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.750
That's like the arrow for it.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.600
That just says it's
a unit vector.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.870
Plus y of t times j.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.970
If I was dealing with a curve
in three dimensions I would

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.735
have plus z of t times k.

00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:07.270
But we're dealing with two
dimensions right here.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.450
And so the way this works is
you're just taking your-- well,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.690
for any t and still, we're
going to have t is greater

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.610
than or equal to a and then,
less than or equal to b.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.810
And this is the exact
same thing as that.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.105
Let me just redraw it.

00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:24.070
So let me draw our coordinates.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.400
Our coordinates right
here, our axes.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.410
So that's the y-axis and
this is the x-axis.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.765
So when you evaluate r of a,
that's our starting point.

00:04:34.765 --> 00:04:36.180
So let me do that.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.140
So r of a-- maybe I'll
do it right over here.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.860
Our position vector-valued
function evaluated at t is

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.390
equal to a, is going to be
equal to x of a times our unit

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.040
vector in the x direction.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.460
Plus y of a times our unit
vector in the vertical

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.865
direction, or in
the y direction.

00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.500
And what's that
going to look like?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.830
Well, x of a is this thing
right here, so it's x of

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.220
a times a unit vector.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.860
You know, maybe the unit
vector is this long.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.180
It has length 1, so now we're
just going to have a length

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.070
of x of a in that direction.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.520
And then, same thing in y of a.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.240
It's going to be y of a
length in that direction.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.830
But the bottom line, this
vector right here-- if you add

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.910
these scaled values of these
two unit vectors, you're going

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.460
to get r of a looking
something like this.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.070
it's going to be a vector that
looks something like that.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.270
Just like that.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.770
It's a position vector.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.330
That's why we're nailing it
at the origin, but drawing

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.840
it in standard position.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.450
And that right there is r of a.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.980
Now what happens if a
increases a little bit?

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.590
What is r of a plus
a little bit?

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.680
And I don't know, we could
call that r of a plus

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.305
delta or r of a plus h.

00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:56.355
I'll do it in a
different color.

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:59.850
Let's say we increase a
a little bit. r of a

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.070
plus some small h.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.060
Well, that's just going to
be x of a plus h times

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.710
a unit vector i.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.820
Plus y times a plus h
times the unit vector j.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.230
And what's that
going to look like?

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.730
Well, we're going to go
a little bit further

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.370
down the curve.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.100
That's like saying the
coordinate x of a plus

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.980
h and y plus a plus h.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.590
I might be that
point right there.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.640
So it'll be a new unit vector.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.300
Sorry, it'll be a new
vector-- position vector--

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.070
not a unit vector.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.940
These don't necessarily
have length 1.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.470
That might be right here.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.590
Let me do that same
color as this.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.970
So it might be just like that.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.930
So that right here
is r of a plus h.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.270
So you see, as you keep
increasing you value of t until

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.950
you get to b, these position
vectors-- we're going to keep

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.860
specifying points
along this curve.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.160
So the curve-- let me draw the
curve in a different color.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.230
The curve looks
something like this.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.150
It's meant to look exactly like
the curve that I have up here.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.080
And for example, r of b
is going to be a vector

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.180
that looks like this.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.680
It's going to be a vector
that looks like that.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.120
I want to draw it
relatively straight.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.310
That vector right
there is r of b.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.740
So hopefully you realize that,
look, these position vectors

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.910
really are specifying the same
points on this curve as this

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.880
original, I guess, straight
up parameterization that

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.070
we did for this curve.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.880
And I just wanted to that as a
little bit of review because

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.730
we're now going to break in
into the idea of actually

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.860
taking a derivative of this
vector-valued function.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.210
And I'll do that in
the next video.
