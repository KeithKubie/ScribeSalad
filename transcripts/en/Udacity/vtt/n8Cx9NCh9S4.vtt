00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.600
Now let's make sure that we understand the benefits of

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.270
object orientation through a quiz. Imagine that acme corporation decided

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.180
to use an objetory entered approach in its software development

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.230
process. If this is the case what benefits can they expect

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.640
to receive from this decision. And here I'm listing some

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.120
possible benefits. Increased reuse because of the modular cooling style.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.450
Increased maintainability because the system design can accommodate changes more

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.530
easily. Increased speed because object oriented systems tend to run faster.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.770
And increased understandability because the

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.680
design models real world entities. So,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.310
I would like, as usual, for you to mark all that apply.
