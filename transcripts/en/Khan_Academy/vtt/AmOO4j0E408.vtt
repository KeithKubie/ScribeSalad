00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.633
- [Voiceover] As long as
human beings have been around

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:04.442
I could imagine that
they have noticed that

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.400
offspring tend to have traits in common

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.667
with the parent.

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:10.233
For example, someone might have told you,

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.100
"Hey, you walk kind of like your dad,"

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.333
or, "Your smile is kind of like your mom,"

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:18.464
or, "Your eyes are like one of your uncles

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:20.189
"or your grandparents."

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.866
And so there's always been this notion

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.733
of inherited traits.

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:27.366
But it wasn't until the
1800 that that started to be

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.928
studied in a more scientific
way with Gregor Mendel

00:00:30.928 --> 00:00:32.767
the father of genetics.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:34.900
But even then, even Mendel

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.233
who was starting to
understand the mechanisms

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:41.179
or he was trying to understand
how inheritance happened,

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.166
then you even could start to breed

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.646
certain types of things.

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:46.107
Even he didn't know exactly

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:49.433
what was the molecular
basis for inheritance.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.100
And the answer to that
question wasn't figured out

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.593
until fairly recent times,

00:00:53.593 --> 00:00:55.366
until the mid 20th century.

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.933
Not until the structure of DNA

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.633
was established by Watson and Crick

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.592
and their work was based
on the work of many others

00:01:03.592 --> 00:01:05.679
especially folks like Rosalind Franklin

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:07.925
who essentially provided
the bulk of the data

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:09.533
for Watson and Crick's work,

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.100
Maurice Wilkins and many,
many, many other folks.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.900
But it's really the structure of DNA

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.371
that made people say,
"Hey, that looks like

00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:21.264
"the molecule that's
storing the information."

00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:24.100
Just to be clear, DNA
wasn't discovered in 1953.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.474
DNA was discovered in the mid 1800s.

00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:28.492
It was this kind of this molecule

00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:32.100
that was inside of nuclei of cells.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740
And for some time people said,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.133
"Maybe this could be a
molecular basis of inheritance."

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.734
You could imagine what you would need

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.228
to be a molecular basis of inheritance.

00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:41.676
It would have to be a molecule

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:44.347
or a series of molecules that
could contain information,

00:01:44.347 --> 00:01:45.825
that could be replicated,

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:48.333
that could be expressed in some way.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.053
But it wasn't until 1953

00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:52.500
wherein this double helix structure

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.625
of DNA was established.

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:58.194
The people said, "Hey, this
looks like our molecule."

00:01:58.194 --> 00:02:01.133
So first, let's just talk
about the structure here

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.763
and then actually we'll talk
about where this name, DNA,

00:02:03.763 --> 00:02:08.266
deoxyribonucleic acid comes from.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:09.800
And then we'll talk a little bit about

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.167
why this structure lends itself well

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:15.233
to something that stores information,

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.463
that can replicate its information

00:02:17.463 --> 00:02:19.242
and that could express its information.

00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:22.069
We might go in depth on the
expression of information

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.933
in future videos.

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:25.215
So this structure right over here

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:28.158
and this is a visual
depiction of a DNA molecule.

00:02:28.158 --> 00:02:30.166
You can view this as
kind of a twisted ladder.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.846
It has these two, I guess you could say

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:33.800
sides of the ladder that are twister.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.966
That is one side right over there

00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:37.813
and then it is another side.

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:40.466
There is another side right over here.

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:43.566
And in between those two sides

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:46.133
or connecting those two
sides of that twisted ladder

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:48.012
you have these rungs.

00:02:48.012 --> 00:02:49.948
And these rungs are actually where

00:02:49.948 --> 00:02:53.133
the information, the
genetic information is

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:55.366
I guess you could say stored in some way.

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:59.266
Because these rungs it's a
sequence of different bases.

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.066
And when I say bases,
you're gonna say wait.

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:03.966
This says acid, why are you
saying bases right over here?

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:07.033
Well, the word deoxyribonucleic acid

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:09.067
comes from the fact that this backbone

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:13.166
is made up of a combination
of sugar and phosphate.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:16.300
And the sugar that makes up the backbone

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.261
is deoxyribose.

00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:21.100
So that's essentially the D in DNA.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.933
And then the phosphate group is acidic

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:25.507
and that's now where you
get the acid part of it.

00:03:25.507 --> 00:03:27.092
And nucleic is, hey this was found

00:03:27.092 --> 00:03:28.647
in nuclei of cells.

00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:30.500
It is nucleic acid.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:03:35.607 --> 00:03:38.600
It is actually mildly acidic all in total

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.600
but for every acid it
actually also has a base,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.900
and those bases form
the rung of the ladders.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.346
And actually each rung is a pair of bases

00:03:48.346 --> 00:03:50.694
and as I said, that's
where the information

00:03:50.694 --> 00:03:51.658
is actually stored.

00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:53.066
Well what am I talking about?

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.666
Well let me talk about
the four different bases

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:58.867
that make up the rungs of a DNA molecule.

00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:01.600
So, you have adenine.

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:05.007
Adenine.

00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:08.511
And so for example, this
part right over here.

00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:12.600
This section of that
rung might be adenine.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.166
Maybe this right over here is adenine.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:16.365
This right over here.

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:18.902
Remember, each of these
rungs are made up by

00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:20.799
it's a pair of bases.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.510
And that might be adenine.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.400
Maybe this is adenine

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.625
and I could stop there,

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:27.959
I mean I'll do a little more adenine.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:29.792
Maybe that's adenine right over there.

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:34.400
And adenine always pairs
with the base thymine.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.423
So let me write that down.

00:04:35.423 --> 00:04:38.300
So adenine pairs with thymine.

00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:40.900
Thymine.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.767
So, if that's an adenine there

00:04:42.767 --> 00:04:44.866
then this is going to be a thymine.

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:45.804
If this is an adenine

00:04:45.804 --> 00:04:47.600
then this is going to be a thymine.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.066
Or if I drew the thymine first,

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:50.700
well say, okay it's gonna
pair with the adenine.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.365
So this is going to be a
thymine right over here.

00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:55.167
This is going to be a thymine.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:56.241
If I were to draw this,

00:04:56.241 --> 00:04:58.466
this would be a thymine right over here.

00:04:58.466 --> 00:05:00.012
Now the other two bases,

00:05:00.012 --> 00:05:02.546
you have cytosine which pairs with guanine

00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:04.833
or guanine that pairs with cytosine.

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:08.027
So guanine and we're not gonna go into

00:05:08.027 --> 00:05:10.633
the molecular structure
of these bases just yet,

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:12.760
although these are good names to know

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.733
because they show up a lot

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:15.533
and they really form kind of the code,

00:05:15.533 --> 00:05:17.023
your genetic code.

00:05:17.023 --> 00:05:18.776
Guanine.

00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:22.461
Guanine pairs with cytosine.

00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:25.679
Guanine and cytosine.

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:28.033
Cytosine.

00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:29.733
So actually if this is,

00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:31.500
let's say there's some cytosine there,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.169
let's say cytosine right over here.

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.537
Maybe this is a cytosine,
maybe this is cytosine,

00:05:36.537 --> 00:05:39.966
maybe this is cytosine, this is cytosine

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:41.833
and maybe this is cytosine.

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:44.555
Then it always pairs with the guanine.

00:05:44.555 --> 00:05:46.966
So, let's see, this is guanine then

00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:48.871
and this will be guanine.

00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:51.933
This is guanine, this is guanine.

00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:53.333
I actually didn't draw stuff here.

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:56.000
This is guanine, I didn't
say what these could be

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.919
but these would be maybe the pairs of

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.733
they could be adenine-thymine pairs

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:02.076
and it could be adenine on either side

00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:03.325
or the thymine on either side,

00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:05.230
and they could be made
of guanine-cytosine pairs

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.800
where the guanine or the
cytosine is on the other side.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.263
Actually just to make it
a little bit more complete

00:06:09.263 --> 00:06:14.263
let me just color in the
rungs here as best as I can.

00:06:14.717 --> 00:06:16.166
So those are guanines

00:06:16.166 --> 00:06:18.000
so they're gonna pair with cytosine.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.471
Pair with cytosine, pair with cytosine.

00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:21.633
When you straw in this way

00:06:21.633 --> 00:06:24.233
you might start to see how
this is essentially a code,

00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:27.800
the order of which the bases are...

00:06:28.753 --> 00:06:31.367
I guess the order in which we have these

00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:34.927
or the sequence of these
bases essentially in code

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:37.593
the information that make you, you,

00:06:37.593 --> 00:06:38.727
and you could be.

00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:40.467
Well how much of it is
nature versus nurture

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.974
and when people say nature, you know,

00:06:41.974 --> 00:06:43.400
it's literally genetic,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.176
and that's an ongoing
debate, an ongoing debate

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:49.876
but it does code for things
like your hair color.

00:06:50.538 --> 00:06:51.833
When you see that your smile

00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:53.767
is similar to your parents

00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:56.366
it is because that
information to a large degree

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:57.633
is encoded genetically.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:00.300
It affects a lot of what makes you you

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.207
and actually not even
just within a species

00:07:02.207 --> 00:07:05.242
but also across species.

00:07:05.242 --> 00:07:07.433
Humans have more genetic material

00:07:07.433 --> 00:07:08.933
in common with other humans

00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:10.569
than they do with say a plant.

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:12.766
But all living creatures as we know them

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.292
have genetic information.

00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:16.366
This is the basis by which they are

00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:19.348
passing down their actual traits.

00:07:19.348 --> 00:07:20.466
Now you might be saying

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:22.233
well, how much genetic information

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.600
does a human being have?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.266
And the number will either disappoint you

00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:30.066
or you might find it mind-boggling.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:33.634
The human genome and every species

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:35.082
has a different number of base pairs

00:07:35.082 --> 00:07:37.070
to large degree correlated
with how complex they are

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.333
although not always.

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:43.333
But the human genome has 6,000,000.

00:07:43.366 --> 00:07:45.725
Sorry, not 6,000,000, 6,000,000,000.

00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:46.794
6,000,000 would be disappointing,

00:07:46.794 --> 00:07:48.300
even billion might be disappointing.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.900
6,000,000,000 base pairs.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.700
6,000,000,000.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.173
6,000,000,000 base pairs.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:56.119
And when you have your full
complement of chromosomes

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:58.261
and this is in most of
the cells in your body

00:07:58.261 --> 00:08:01.496
and outside of your sex cells,

00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:03.900
the sperm or the egg cells.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.900
This is going to be spread
over 46 chromosomes.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.987
46 chromosomes or I guess you could say

00:08:11.987 --> 00:08:13.346
23 pair of chromosomes.

00:08:13.346 --> 00:08:15.915
If you divide 6,000,000,000 by 46

00:08:15.915 --> 00:08:18.366
you get a little over
on average 100,000,000.

00:08:18.366 --> 00:08:21.294
I think it's a 100 and something million

00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:23.676
base pairs per chromosome.

00:08:23.676 --> 00:08:24.912
And some chromosomes are longer,

00:08:24.912 --> 00:08:27.096
actually the longest are over 200,000,000

00:08:27.096 --> 00:08:28.546
and some might be shorter.

00:08:28.546 --> 00:08:30.033
That's just on average.

00:08:30.033 --> 00:08:32.622
Now this number might to some
of you might be exciting.

00:08:32.622 --> 00:08:34.952
You're like, "I thought
I was a simple creature.

00:08:34.952 --> 00:08:37.033
"I didn't know I was this complex."

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:38.727
6,000,000,000, that's a lot of base pairs.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:40.479
That feels like a lot of information.

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:43.166
For others of you it
might not feel so great.

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:44.581
You might say, "Hey, wait I could store

00:08:44.581 --> 00:08:46.912
"this much information
on a modern thumb drive

00:08:46.912 --> 00:08:47.900
"or on a hard disk.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.333
"I thought I was more unique than that."

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:52.912
And of course we all
are special and unique.

00:08:52.912 --> 00:08:54.415
You're gonna say 6,000,000,000 base pairs.

00:08:54.415 --> 00:08:55.327
I thought I was, you know,

00:08:55.327 --> 00:08:57.533
I was infinitely complex
and whatever else.

00:08:57.533 --> 00:08:58.900
There's some arguments for that

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.067
along some other directions,

00:09:01.067 --> 00:09:05.392
but this is the approximate
length I guess you could say

00:09:05.392 --> 00:09:10.000
or the approximate size of
the actual human genome.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.296
And when we talk about chromosomes

00:09:11.296 --> 00:09:15.150
and we'll talk about
chromosomes in much more depth,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.800
imagine taking this zoomed in thing

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.600
that you have right over here

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.216
and you know, over here, I
don't know how many we have,

00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:22.471
Like one, two, three, four, five,

00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:23.948
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:09:23.948 --> 00:09:27.033
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:29.266
We have about 20 base pairs depicted here.

00:09:29.266 --> 00:09:33.101
Imagine if you had about
200,000,000 of these base pairs

00:09:33.101 --> 00:09:34.496
and then you were to take this thing

00:09:34.496 --> 00:09:36.266
and you were to kind of coil it up

00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:40.600
into that thing is a chromosome.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.294
It is a chromosome and
you're saying, "Wait,

00:09:42.294 --> 00:09:44.207
"I have that much information in

00:09:44.207 --> 00:09:45.927
"most of the cells of my body.

00:09:45.927 --> 00:09:48.761
"This thing must be incredible compact."

00:09:48.761 --> 00:09:50.533
And if you said that I would say,

00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:51.966
"Yes, you are correct."

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:56.966
This, the radius, the
radius of the DNA molecule

00:09:57.133 --> 00:09:59.594
is on the order of one nanometer.

00:09:59.594 --> 00:10:04.066
One nanometer which is
a billionth of a meter.

00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:05.866
So you can start to assess

00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:07.107
kind of the scale of this thing.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.100
This is a very dense way

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.266
to actually store information.

00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:13.754
But just to have an appreciation of

00:10:13.754 --> 00:10:15.800
and you might have seen
it when I was coloring in

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.166
on why the structure lends itself

00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:20.666
to being able to replicate the information

00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:23.782
or even to be able to translate
or express the information.

00:10:23.782 --> 00:10:26.266
Let's think about if you
were to take this ladder

00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:28.392
and you were to just kind
of split all the base pairs.

00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:30.500
So, you just have 1/2 of them.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.367
So you essentially have
half of the ladder.

00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:34.400
And so if you only have
half of the ladder,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.009
you're able to construct the
other half of the ladder.

00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:39.100
Let's take an example, let's say

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.958
and I'll just use the
first letter to abbreviate

00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.276
for each of these bases.

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:44.186
Let's say you have some...

00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:45.507
So let's say this is one of the,

00:10:45.507 --> 00:10:48.094
this is the sugar phosphate
backbone right over here.

00:10:48.094 --> 00:10:50.389
So this could be one of the sides.

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:51.833
Let's say there's some adenine.

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:53.819
Actually we do in the right color.

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:56.900
So you got some adenine, adenine.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.000
Maybe some adenine right over here

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.666
and maybe there's an adenine there.

00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:05.066
And maybe you have some thymine, thymine,

00:11:05.066 --> 00:11:07.266
maybe thymine right over here

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:11.033
and then you have some guanine,

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:13.412
guanine, guanine.

00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:16.000
And then let's say you have some cytosine

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.834
and you have some cytosine.

00:11:17.834 --> 00:11:22.633
So with just half of this
ladder I guess you could say,

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:24.176
you're able to construct the other half,

00:11:24.176 --> 00:11:26.500
and this is actually how DNA replicates.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.500
This ladder splits and then each of those

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.809
two halves of that ladder

00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:32.748
are able to construct
versions of the other half,

00:11:32.748 --> 00:11:33.861
or versions of the other half

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.000
are able to constructed on top of that,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.258
on top of that half.

00:11:37.258 --> 00:11:38.666
So how does that happen?

00:11:38.666 --> 00:11:41.633
Well, it's based on how these bases pair.

00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:43.389
Adenine always pairs with thymine

00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:44.816
if we're talking about DNA.

00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:46.266
So if you have an A there,

00:11:46.266 --> 00:11:48.769
you're gonna have a T on
this end, T on this end.

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:51.966
T's right all over here,
T right over there.

00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:53.200
If you have a T on that end

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.995
you're gonna have an A right over there.

00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:56.992
A, A.

00:11:56.992 --> 00:11:59.592
If you have a G, a guanine on this side,

00:11:59.592 --> 00:12:01.833
you're gonna have a
cytosine on the other side.

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:04.101
Cytosine, cytosine, cytosine.

00:12:04.101 --> 00:12:05.466
And if you have a cytosine

00:12:05.466 --> 00:12:08.000
you're gonna have a
guanine on the other side.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.740
Hopefully that gives you an appreciation

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.066
of how DNA can replicate itself.

00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:14.866
And as we'll see also how
this information can be

00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:17.662
translated to other forms
of either related molecules

00:12:17.676 --> 00:12:20.056
but eventually to proteins.

00:12:20.056 --> 00:12:22.060
And just to kind of round out this video,

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.307
to get a real visual sense

00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:24.729
what the DNA molecule looks like

00:12:24.729 --> 00:12:27.167
or I guess a different
visual depiction from this.

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:31.600
I found this animated gif

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600
that, you know, if you
haven't fully digested

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.467
what a double helix
looks like, this is it.

00:12:36.467 --> 00:12:37.992
And you see here, you see your

00:12:37.992 --> 00:12:39.866
sugar phosphate bases here.

00:12:39.866 --> 00:12:42.063
You see kind of the sugars and phosphate,

00:12:42.063 --> 00:12:43.433
the sugars and the phosphates

00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:45.601
alternating along this backbone,

00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:48.830
and then the rungs of the
ladder are these base pairs.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.066
So this is one of the bases,

00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:51.256
that's the corresponding,

00:12:51.256 --> 00:12:53.394
that's this corresponding,
I guess you can say partner.

00:12:53.394 --> 00:12:56.471
And you can see that along
all the way up and down

00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:58.433
in this molecule.

00:12:58.433 --> 00:12:59.766
Very exciting.
