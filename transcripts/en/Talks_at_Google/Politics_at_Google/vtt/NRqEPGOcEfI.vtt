[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.520
GEORGE S. YIP: OK.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.590
Thanks for coming along to this.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.270
So it's based on this book.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.830
There are still some free copies
left up front if you want them.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.950
So I was doing the
research on this book when

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.450
I was based in China at the top
business school there, China

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:27.610
Europe International Business
School, from 2011 to 2016.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.030
And the subtitle is really
the theme of my talk,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.560
"From Imitation to Innovation."

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.060
You used to hear about how
China is about imitation, now

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.740
it's about innovation.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.280
In the early days, of course,
China was just copying.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.790
From 1978 onwards, they were
copying products were illegal,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.320
sometimes were called shanzhai
which mean mountain bandit.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.080
You see here a product called
the Blockberry endorsed

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.620
by President Obama, probably
without his knowledge.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.850
On the right, something
that surprise you,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.980
this is not a cigarette packet
pretending to be a cell phone;

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.590
it's a cell phone pretending
to be a cigarette packet.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.690
Just to show you how
different the Chinese can be,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.840
they actually love smoking
so much some of them

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.600
wanted to pretend their cell
phone was a cigarette packet.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.630
So then China starts moving
from copying to fit for purpose.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.020
So in the earlier days--

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.460
1980s, 1970s-- China was
poorer, lower per capita income.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.130
So for practical innovations,
such as Guangdong crane

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.750
moving from double
welded to single welded,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.810
so a lot of process innovations.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.590
China, of course, makes more
solar panels than anybody else.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.080
And the critical innovation
there, self-cleaning.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.050
Because if you have
a dusty solar panel,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.300
then that's a massive problem.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.880
So in the beginning,
these are not

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.150
rocket science innovations but
typical Chinese innovations.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.845
They are pragmatic
and profitable.

00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:58.470
Then you start to see-- and I'll
talk a bit more later on about

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.620
Alibaba, Taobao--

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.360
these online systems where we
start seeing innovation online.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.279
Haier, one of their
biggest and probably

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:09.570
the most international company
in major appliances, now

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.460
the world's biggest major
appliance companies.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.960
Lots of initially small
innovations, like early on they

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.840
found that their washing
machines were getting

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.212
clogged up in rural areas.

00:02:20.212 --> 00:02:22.170
They discovered it was
because the farmers were

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.164
using them to wash potatoes,
rather than just clothes.

00:02:25.164 --> 00:02:26.580
Now, a Western
response might have

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.250
been put a label saying,
do not wash crops.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.700
Instead, their innovation was
they changed the filter system

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.000
and added a label saying,
suitable for both clothes

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.650
and crops.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.190
Refrigerators, when they
first moved to the US market,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.040
they went at the lower end,
such as college dorm rooms.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.320
And they realized that
college dorms were small,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.230
so they added a folding
tabletop to double up

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.330
as a desk, a trivial innovation.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.680
Today they have a more
significant innovation,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.600
technical.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.290
They have innovated the
world's first three temperature

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.060
compartments refrigerator.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.800
The third compartment
is designed

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.310
to store the food that is the
most important to Americans.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.392
What food is that?

00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:08.960
No, not pizza.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.990
Anything else?

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.490
Ice cream.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.340
What's wrong when you take the
ice cream out of the icebox?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.930
It's too hard.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.450
And Americans
don't like to wait.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.070
So it took a Chinese
company to have

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.130
this insight and then
typical of Chinese innovation

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.850
to invest the R&amp;D money and
to be able to manufacture it

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.650
in an economical way.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.400
So this is a typical innovation.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.220
But they are now
moving beyond this.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.650
They're moving toward waterless
washing machines, for example.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.700
So genuine technological
innovations.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.589
Chinese are very
customer-focused, as well.

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.130
I'll just talk about
the bottom ones.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.030
We visited a number
of start-ups.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.730
So Suzhou Nano-Micro, world
class nanoproducts; SVG

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.890
Optronics, they make
security films over ID cards

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.160
and so on that are higher than
the quality you find in the USA

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.476
or in the European Union.

00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:03.850
I'll talk about some of these
other companies in a moment

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.600
as well.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.810
The entire ecosystem for
Alibaba I'll talk more about.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.790
GoodBaby makes 80% of the
world's baby carriages.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.240
A typical innovation
now, you hold the baby

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.140
in one arm and one button
that you press folds

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.880
up the baby carriage.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.570
Again, a typical
Chinese innovation.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.640
You have to invest
in it, requires

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.710
significant
manufacturing capability.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.700
Now they start to make things
that are a bit more technically

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.390
advanced, so Tencent, social
networking, instant messaging

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.510
service, online
gaming, and so on.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.860
Medical devices are very big
in China, aging population.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.750
And then the intersection of
online and medical devices

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.990
are going to be a very big
sector in China as well.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.330
Xiaomi, the mobile
phone company,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.030
sends out software
upgrades every week

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.230
based on input from its
millions of customers.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.170
And then the bottom,
Newsoft, an example

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:11.970
of integrating medical devices
and information technology.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.180
And these are organized
to relate to each other.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.350
So of course, with
the solar panels,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.190
we have the wind energy.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.910
The third one, they're
now experimenting

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.600
with roads using solar
power to recharge

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.060
the bus as it drives along.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.290
That also is a typical
Chinese innovation

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.740
in that it requires
a top-down government

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.335
to put in that
kind of innovation.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:37.710
Can you imagine
trying to do that

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.290
in the streets of
Cambridge, Massachusetts,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.120
putting in a system like that?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.450
On the top right, Huawei,
the telecoms company,

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.750
now the largest telecoms
equipment company in the world,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.210
genuine innovation,
creating a product

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.960
that ran 2G, 3G and
4G in one product.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.151
Again, typical Chinese
orientation to the customer

00:05:58.151 --> 00:06:00.150
because this was more
practical for the customer

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.210
to have only one machine.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.630
And now investing
more and more in R&amp;D.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.290
It has R&amp;D centers
around the world.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.350
For example, outside
Milan, Italy,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.720
it has a microwave
research technology center

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.730
hiring Italian
scientists, keeping them

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.830
in the local ecosystem.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.470
The middle row, high-speed
trains, of course

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.020
initially copied.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.110
The Chinese train company was
sued by Siemens and Hitachi

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.430
but has breezed through that.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.460
China, of course, has more
high-speed rail tracks

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.334
than anywhere else in the world.

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:38.750
I don't think the US has a
single mile of high-speed rail,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.992
nor does the United Kingdom.

00:06:39.992 --> 00:06:41.450
And of course, this
means they also

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:48.130
build more trains that they're
now innovating with and selling

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.010
all over the world.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.570
In the middle, aerial drones.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.460
China did not invent
the aerial drones,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.220
but most aerial drones are
now manufactured in China.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.770
And this is a product
that's classically

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.550
suited for Chinese
innovation in that innovation

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.650
for this product happens better
next door to the factory.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.250
Why?

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.950
Because innovations
are to add more rotors,

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.440
to change the carrying
capacity, make it bigger,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.290
make it smaller.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.720
There's now a Chinese one
that can carry a person.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.550
Good luck traveling in
that yourself one day.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.370
And this is opposed to say
something like a mobile, a cell

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.287
phone, where you do the
innovation in California

00:07:25.287 --> 00:07:26.870
and you have it
manufactured in China.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.820
So also, this is a product that
is based on metal, plastics,

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.190
and some electronic
combination, again

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.060
ideal for the lower cost Chinese
engineers and scientists.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.090
And on the right, this
is the mid-sized jet

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.650
that China has just test flown.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.035
It's going to go up
against Boeing and Airbus.

00:07:45.035 --> 00:07:46.550
Why is it able to do that?

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.400
Because China buys
more new jet aircraft

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.630
than any other
country in the world.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.250
It already has 500 advance
orders before it is proven.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.050
And of course, most of
those advance orders

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.610
are coming from
Chinese airlines who

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.510
have to buy from this
state-owned manufacturer.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.240
Initially copying,
but with innovations

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.150
that they're going to add
and with enforced technology

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.860
transfer from the
West, which is why

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.730
we have this tariff war that's
just started in the last week

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.020
or so.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.890
Now, the internet-based
innovations are different.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.970
The traditional
innovations in China

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.830
are based on low cost
engineers for both R&amp;D

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.780
and for manufacturing.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.390
While that is less the case
with internet-based companies,

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.770
or at least my interpretation,
and you know more about it

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.470
than I do, is that
internet-based innovation

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.960
comes from experimentation with
large numbers of customers.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.540
So China has more internet
users than any other country

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.270
in the world, so this is now
a great advantage for them.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.520
And toward the end, I'll
show you some visuals

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.666
about the internet ecosystems.

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:54.290
I won't go through
them all, as I said.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.940
You can just look at
the PDFs yourself.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.450
So our sort of model, our
theory of how this happened,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.720
is that we have four drivers,
the ones in red and pink,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.170
and we have three phases in
yellow that I'll go through.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.970
The first driver, customers.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.740
Initially, the
customers were poorer

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.900
so Chinese companies
and Western companies

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.800
had to innovate in China in
order to develop products

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.689
that were cheap enough.

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:22.730
The other thing we find
is that Chinese customers

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.400
are quite different in many
of their tastes from the West.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.470
So again, different
types of products needed.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.790
Culture.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.780
We have the entrepreneurial
culture of Chinese executive,

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.330
and we include under culture
the drive of the government.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.320
The Chinese government
really wants innovation now,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.290
and the word innovation
has reached the top line

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.320
of the latest five-year plan.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.650
And the Made in
China 2025 initiative

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.720
is all about
innovating in China,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.410
rather than just manufacturing.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.510
On the right, over time, firms
enhance their capabilities

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.390
to innovate, learning
from Western partners

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.700
and also as they
became more profitable,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.720
investing the cash that
they generated in R&amp;D.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.620
And two other uses of the cash
are setting up foreign R&amp;D

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.830
centers and thirdly,
buying foreign companies

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.074
for their technology.

00:10:20.074 --> 00:10:21.740
And I'll show you
some examples of that.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.740
So with this, they moved
from the phase one,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.300
copying to fit for purpose,
to moving from being followers

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.240
to world standard products.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.240
And in the third phase,
global expansion,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.180
including acquisitions.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.980
Early acquisitions
were resources

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.030
like oil fields, property.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.410
But more and more,
they're making

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.260
acquisitions for knowledge.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.970
So here are some famous
Chinese acquisitions.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.530
Of course, the first one was
by IBM's personal computer

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.950
business.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.940
Then another example,
Volvo, bought

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.142
by a mid-level Chinese
company most of you

00:11:02.142 --> 00:11:03.804
have never heard
of called Geely.

00:11:03.804 --> 00:11:05.720
One of the reasons they
were able to buy Volvo

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.120
is that the Chinese
government designated them

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.210
as the only Chinese car company
allowed to bid for Volvo.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.600
They beat off the
non-Chinese competitors.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.970
When they won, the
CEO of Geely said,

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.910
it's like a Chinese peasant
marrying a Hollywood movie

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.645
star.

00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:25.070
And of course, they're starting
to learn technology from Volvo.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.340
Putzmeister, a leading
construction equipment company

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.520
in Germany, bought by now the
world's largest construction

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.900
equipment company, China's Sany.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.770
They've even bought
Club Med, which

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.790
I think is for the
large, evolving leisure

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.350
market in China.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.710
Most controversial,
in the middle, Kuka.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.070
In 2016, a Chinese medical
device company, Midea,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.770
bought one of Germany's
leading robotics companies.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.510
For the first time,
the German government

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.420
said, really, perhaps we
shouldn't let this go.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.950
And the German prime minister
asked a German consortium

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.910
to outbid them, but they
were underbidding 20%

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.110
and it went to China.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.110
Only on the right,
finally, last year

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.800
was one German acquisition
blocked, Aixtron,

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.205
under US pressure because it
makes semiconductors, some

00:12:17.205 --> 00:12:18.330
of which goes into defense.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.230
So the US got Germany to
block that acquisition.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.500
But there will be many
more such acquisitions

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.600
because the Chinese
have a lot of money.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.340
Google is probably safe for now.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.340
So the entire Chinese
innovation ecosystem is growing.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.470
In fact, the Chinese now have
more scientific publications

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.550
than the USA.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:47.270
Of course, so far it's
quantity rather than quality,

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.710
but the quality will follow.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.750
And of course, it is
the US and the West

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.830
that is training ethnic
Chinese scientists.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.780
So if you go into STEM
program-- science, technology,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.370
engineering, mathematics--

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.050
huge numbers of ethnic Chinese.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.660
And China now has special
government programs

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.220
to lure them back.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.080
Also, the market is
luring them back.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:12.010
We visited one company that
makes flexible display screens,

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.230
replacing something
a millimeter thick,

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.540
replacing the entire
dashboard of a car,

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.690
started by a Chinese PhD
in electrical engineering

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.740
from Stanford.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.640
But he goes back to China to
start the company because cars

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.980
are being manufactured in
China and it's the biggest car

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.580
market in the world.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.080
So everything in the
ecosystem is on the up.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.100
And here is the scariest
sight I've ever come across.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.170
It was presented at
Oxford about a year

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.030
and a half ago by
someone representing

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.020
the Chinese Academy of Science.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.430
22 strategic science and
technology initiatives

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.480
that China is pursuing.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.840
I'll just read out some of them.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.110
Dark matter and dark energy;
controlling the structure

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.500
of matter; artificial life
and synthetic biology;

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.080
nano science; space
science exploration;

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.260
ubiquitous sensing based
informationized manufacturing

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:03.830
systems.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.340
So they're actually going
for everything, pretty much.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.670
China certainly has the
world's largest supercomputers,

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.170
for example.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.770
All right.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.130
So summarizing our
research, we found

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.710
that there were 10 major
ways in which Chinese company

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.560
innovation is different
from Western innovation.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.440
And you might think about how
this is the same or different

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.890
at Google, as well.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.280
I've got a slide or two
on each one of these.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.680
The first one is a greater focus
on local needs and customers.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.280
Now, all companies do that,
but the Chinese are really

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.100
focused on local customers.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.960
So on the left, Chinese
like soy products, so

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.934
Joyung makes a soy milk cooker.

00:14:41.934 --> 00:14:43.850
On the right, that's
myself with my co-author.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:48.080
We're at TCL, the world's
largest consumer electronics

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.190
company.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.580
They created a dual TV that
two people can sit side

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.460
by side watching two
completely separate TV

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.860
programs full screen.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.550
You just have to wear these
dark glasses with the earpieces.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.140
And my theory is
that they designed

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.160
this for a special Chinese
need, which is the single child

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.270
policy.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.430
The single child
has grown up selfish

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.080
and doesn't know how to share.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.788
So when they get
married, they don't want

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:15.049
to share TV programs either.

00:15:15.049 --> 00:15:17.090
So this product is designed
to reduce the divorce

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.410
rate in China.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.252
Apologies to the Chinese
in this audience.

00:15:21.252 --> 00:15:23.420
Oh, and again, a typical
Chinese innovation

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.760
is that it's expensive
to design and it's

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.010
expensive to manufacture
but Chinese companies

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.150
can afford to do that.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.070
Initially, number
two, acceptance

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.300
of good enough standards.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.620
This was the first mass market
car in China, Cherry QQ,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.440
under $5,000 US.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.920
It was famous for its
thousands of defects,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.760
but the Chinese accepted it.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.180
And if this had happened in the
West, the brand would be dead.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.100
Cherry is still a
respected brand in China.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.890
So the Chinese are
more forgiving,

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.680
at least initially,
because they're still

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.420
moving up the ladder.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.400
But they didn't stop there.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.080
So by participating in
global supply chains,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.450
they learned, and
furthermore, because

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.970
the competitive
situation is so fierce,

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.740
they're like Alice in
Wonderland with the Red Queen.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.782
They've learned to run very
fast and stay in the same place.

00:16:13.782 --> 00:16:16.730
So we now this concept of Red
Queen competition, and this

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.120
is what happens in China
as a way of enhancing

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.820
their capabilities.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.504
Third one, incremental,
not radical, innovations.

00:16:26.504 --> 00:16:28.170
When I visited the
head office of Haier,

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.090
they showed me their new range,
Casarte, pretending not even

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.710
to be Chinese called Casarte.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.300
The main innovation
is that they've

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.170
embedded Swarovsi crystals on
the fronts of the cabinets.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.780
So the Chinese are not
embarrassed to do anything

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.430
that will sell a product.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.480
Another example of this,
of incremental, Braun,

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.350
which starts out making
gas-fired air conditioners,

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.000
has now gone into
pre-fabricated buildings.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.360
So I was in one of the
buildings that was being built.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.040
Notice they sell it like they
actually talk about LEGO--

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.840
you can buy this shape,
that shape, fully sealed,

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.450
air conditioning systems.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.060
When I stayed at
their on campus hotel,

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.430
you couldn't open the windows
and there were no controls

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.471
for the air conditioning.

00:17:11.471 --> 00:17:15.230
So super energy efficient,
very fast to put up,

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.040
and much cheaper.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.920
So that's, again, typical
Chinese innovation.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.619
Willingness to
supply special needs.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:24.319
A TV company called Hisense has
a big share of the TV market

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.349
in Africa because in Africa,
many villagers are too poor

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:30.080
and can afford only one
TV set, which sometimes

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.310
has to be shown outdoors
for bigger audiences,

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.920
such as for a football match.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.790
This means that you need to
make the screen brighter.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:41.330
So Hisense was willing to invest
in a switch and a capability

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.700
to make the screen
brighter for outdoor use

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.930
and again to manufacture it.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.252
So a typical Chinese innovation.

00:17:48.252 --> 00:17:49.460
Using large numbers of staff.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:54.230
One of our students at CIBS
started a security vehicle

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.980
company.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.990
Now, first, security
vehicles seemed

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.780
to be the opposite of what's
suitable for the Chinese

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.960
because the Chinese approach is
to find a global product that's

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.050
the same all over the
world, manufacturing it

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.790
in large quantities,
standardized at home,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.000
and ship it around.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.990
Well, the problem with security
vehicles, highly regulated

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.750
market so they're very
different in different countries

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.400
and small numbers
batch production.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.990
So what the CEO did, he
assigned 100 engineers

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.380
to spend a year studying
needs all over the world.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.000
At the end of the year,
they came back and said,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.100
you know what, for each
component-- the doors,

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.230
the windows, the engines--

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.240
there are only about
three or four variations.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.790
So what he does now, he
manufactures the three or four

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.340
variations of each
component centrally

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.430
and then ships them around
the world for final assembly.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.470
So he has used large
numbers of engineers

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:50.280
to turn a multi-local industry
into a global industry.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.030
Six, they work their
stuff much harder.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.950
There is no work-life
balance in China.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.090
I love some of these comments
from the CEO of Huawei.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.210
"Huawei people are destined
to work hard for a lifetime

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.400
and to suffer more than others."

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.960
How's that for a
recruiting slogan?

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:15.160
And boot camp, not
much Google-iness

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.940
in Chinese companies.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.000
And you know what's
underneath the?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.420
Desk the sleeping roll.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:31.975
7th-- oh, by the way, I know
about them working hard.

00:19:31.975 --> 00:19:33.600
Well, I'll give you
an example of that.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.170
Fast trial and error,
very pragmatic.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.350
So Dung Xiaoping, the leader,
talked about crossing the river

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.690
by feeling the stones.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.181
The CEO of GM China
talks about failing

00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:47.430
in a government-sponsored
direction, electric vehicle.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.390
By the way, I predict
that China, of course,

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.973
will be the first
country in the world

00:19:50.973 --> 00:19:52.950
to be serious about
electric vehicles.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.580
They have the need because
of their pollution problem,

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.424
they need a lot of
vehicles, and they're

00:19:58.424 --> 00:20:00.840
going to solve the chicken and
egg problem of the charging

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.010
stations because with
a top-down government

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.990
they are installing charging
stations are over the country

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.510
and they'll have
forced incentives

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.720
to make people buy
electric vehicles, rather

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.240
than gasoline-based ones.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.270
Less formal, faster processes.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.970
We found that everything
in China was faster.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.650
A specific example,
we're working

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.010
with a major European
multinational who

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:31.180
bought a Chinese company
in one of its sectors,

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.550
and we helped them compare
the length of the innovation

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.360
process.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.610
The European process
was 24 months,

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.650
the Chinese process
was 12 months.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:44.052
So we then helped them
converge on an 18-month process

00:20:44.052 --> 00:20:46.510
to convince headquarters to
allow them to go from 24 months

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:47.320
to 18 months.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.361
They couldn't go to 12
months because the Chinese

00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:52.120
took too many shortcuts.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.510
Or Tencent's WeChat
the gray release

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.570
one million user experiment so
that they're able to do again,

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.461
large numbers in China.

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:02.710
More intervention by the boss.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.376
As you know, China's
very boss-oriented.

00:21:04.376 --> 00:21:07.070
In the West, it's 90%
process and 10% boss;

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:12.490
in China, it's 30%
process and 70% boss.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.960
On the right the CEO of BROAD.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.690
He actually said to me,
"I'm responsible for 95%

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.670
of the innovations at BROAD."

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.400
That was an
astonishing statement.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.870
One, if it's true; and
two, that he should say it.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.360
Even Steve Jobs
wouldn't have said that.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.620
And I know Chinese bosses.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.850
My father was a Chinese boss.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.210
He once said to me, "Son, you
should never contradict me,

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.530
especially when I'm wrong."

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.550
But interestingly, for those
of you who are not Chinese--

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.950
even for myself, I'm from
Hong Kong originally--

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.560
you may think of the Chinese
as being very obedient.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.950
Well, Chinese are obedient
only under some circumstances.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.230
Chinese are very
obedient when they

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.820
are observed by a superior,
whether in a company

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.530
or in a family setting.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.040
In a family, there's always a
relationship of superiority,

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.050
your parents, et cetera.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.620
So when they're not
supervised, the Chinese

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.165
are very disobedient, hence the
saying, [SPEAKING MANDARIN],,

00:22:08.165 --> 00:22:10.290
"the mountain is high and
the emperor is far away."

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.330
And if you think
about other cultures,

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.857
there are some
cultures where people

00:22:12.857 --> 00:22:14.940
are very obedient whether
or not they're observed.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.439
These are the
cultures, for example,

00:22:16.439 --> 00:22:17.880
where people stand
at a red light

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.700
when there are no cars
around, classic examples being

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.410
Japan and Germany.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.390
And there are other
national cultures

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.700
where people are very
disobedient whether or not

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.324
they're observed, and these
are economic basket cases.

00:22:29.324 --> 00:22:30.990
I don't even need to
name the countries,

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.760
you can figure them
out for yourselves.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.490
But China is on one diagonal.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.950
And indeed, there are
some other cultures

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.290
that I've experienced where
people are obedient if you

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.380
don't observe them too much
and they become disobedient

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.060
if they feel you are
watching them too much.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.360
And I found that to be
true of the Netherlands

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.730
and other Scandinavian cultures.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.680
Which is Google?

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.367
Is it more like the
Scandinavian culture where

00:22:56.367 --> 00:22:57.450
you like to be left alone?

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:57.950
Right.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.527
So the Chinese are
the exact opposite.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.530
Closer to government, of course.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.520
So Chinese companies
benefit from having

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.710
a lot of government support.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:18.030
So if we summarize this, China
has a triple threat winning

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.766
trifecta.

00:23:19.766 --> 00:23:21.390
They have the
manufacturing capability,

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.960
which India doesn't have, even
though India has the second one

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.197
scientific and
technical capacity.

00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:28.530
China has more of that, as well.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.900
So China now, on
the second point,

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.620
can pretty much absorb most new
technological and scientific

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.460
developments.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.170
Yes, they're still
behind the US,

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:42.810
but there is a rapid catch-up,
particularly in digital,

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:43.800
for example.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.062
And a huge domestic
market, as a result

00:23:46.062 --> 00:23:47.520
of which they can
start and improve

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.520
at home before going global
without necessarily bringing

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.880
out world class
products to start with.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.460
And they can challenge
any global incumbents,

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.960
as I've shown in the case, say,
of the commercial aircraft.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.960
Even Japan could not go up
against Boeing and Airbus,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.750
but the Chinese state-owned
company is doing that.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.270
This has happened only
twice before in history.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.460
Which countries have
these advantages?

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.460
First of all, it was
the British empire--

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.140
not Britain on its own,
but the entire empire--

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.370
[INAUDIBLE] the market.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.490
And then, of course,
the United States

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.020
after the Second World War.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:27.210
Now it is China's turn to
have these three advantages.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.630
If we now look at it from the
viewpoint of Western companies,

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.540
we talk about why
learn from China?

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:38.310
Because China is an emerging
lead market; China's customers

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.170
are young and extreme,
you know the concept

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.470
of learning from extreme users.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.342
In China, they'll try anything.

00:24:45.342 --> 00:24:46.800
So for example,
the way the Chinese

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.250
learned to drink wine,
initially the Chinese mixed wine

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.420
with Coca-Cola to
get used to it.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.820
And particularly in
food, we see all kinds

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.140
of innovations like that.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.530
But they're now increasingly
sophisticated or even leading

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.040
demand.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.640
There are now a lot of
very wealthy young Chinese,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.520
and you will see them around
the streets of Boston,

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.100
as well, the fuerdai, the
second generation rich.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.770
They're probably not
working at Google,

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:17.370
but they are the
ones who are buying

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.350
the most expensive fashions.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.060
China's pressing
need for solutions,

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.180
such as in pollution,
starting to lead the world now

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.720
in environmental solutions.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.580
As I said before,
they're more forgiving

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.920
because most people there
are first generation

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.880
or second generation consumers,
so they'll try things,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.210
they don't have to buy
what their parents bought,

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.950
and if you get something wrong
they'll move on and forget.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.124
Market reasons.

00:25:45.124 --> 00:25:47.040
Among the world's biggest
and most categories,

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.690
biggest for cars, biggest for
trains, biggest for airplanes,

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.620
and so on.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.270
And high diversity
in differences,

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.335
even more so than
in the United States

00:25:56.335 --> 00:25:57.960
because of the
temperature differences,

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.876
climactic differences.

00:25:58.876 --> 00:26:02.970
A specific example, Sany, the
construction company said,

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.040
a Western construction
company might

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.880
have two or three
models per product,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.310
such as crawler-loaders.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.670
But because of the diversity
of soil conditions in China

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.590
and because of so many
different building projects,

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.010
we'll have seven or eight
different products instead,

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:22.560
so more innovation.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.870
Because of the size
of the Chinese market,

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.210
the niche in China
can be a whole market

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.830
in some Western countries.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.540
And then reverse
innovation, when

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.740
you invent something
for the Chinese market

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.620
but it could be sent back
to the developed world.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.290
So the most famous
example of that

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:42.860
is General Electric's
ultrasound equipment, initially

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.100
a $150,000 machine that was
too expensive and complicated

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.540
for Chinese hospitals.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.680
So GE put together a team to
create a handheld device that

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.570
was about $20,000.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.460
So it succeeded
in China, but it's

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.160
been reversed back to
the US not to displace

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.420
the $150,000 machine but for
new uses such as in doctor's

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.360
offices and in ambulances.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.520
Thirdly, competitors.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:14.520
Very intense competitors
breeding winners

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.350
and they're starting
to go global as well.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:25.090
So competition in China is
fiercer even than in the USA.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:31.260
So we summarize this by saying
that Western companies must

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.060
learn some capabilities
from China.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.800
The first one, bold
experimentation

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.369
and rapid iteration.

00:27:36.369 --> 00:27:38.160
This is particularly
true, say, for Europe,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.460
where companies have become
too conservative, too

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.600
much regulation.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.190
They need to go to China to
relearn bold experimentation.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:50.880
Secondly, innovation
through creative adaptation,

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.800
adapting to create new products,
new product categories,

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.850
lean value.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.550
I mean, all companies
focus on lean value,

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.910
but even more so in China,
where it's more important.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.580
And the fifth one, that
we're quite surprised by,

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.810
is that while, say, Japan
wasn't much use for developing

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.260
foreign managers because
it was so ethnocentric,

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.204
China is very open
to foreign managers.

00:28:15.204 --> 00:28:16.620
So if you send
someone there, they

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.670
get the chance to manage
Chinese people, people

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:21.970
from other countries.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.860
So we now have a saying, to
paraphrase Frank Sinatra's

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.260
song, Shanghai, Shanghai,
if you can manage there,

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.020
you can manage anywhere.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.940
So I'll just go through a few
brief slides on e-commerce.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.770
China now has a bigger
share of e-retail

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.460
than anybody else in
the world and by 2020,

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.690
it's predicted to have
60% of global e-commerce

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:54.880
because Chinese live on their
mobile phones, cell phones

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.746
much more than other countries.

00:28:57.746 --> 00:28:59.120
I mean, I think
Koreans are more,

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.050
but it's a much smaller country.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.160
Selected percentage
of countries who

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.050
have bought something
in the past 12 months.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.582
China 68%, way ahead.

00:29:08.582 --> 00:29:10.290
I mean, you know some
of these statistics

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.100
because it's your business.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:16.210
So a surge in internet
and mobile payments,

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.600
third party mobile
payments, transaction value,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.420
incredible speed
of growth of this.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.275
Some statistics on the types of
products that they're buying.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.470
And Apple made a
late entry into this

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:37.195
and is not doing that well,
compared with the incumbents.

00:29:37.195 --> 00:29:40.750
There's a comparison here
between Alipay and WeChat.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.020
WeChat is starting to catch
up with Alipay, the green line

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:47.770
below.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.650
There's a comparison
that you can look at.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.730
And the last three sides,
three emerging disruptions.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.820
This was created by one
of my colleagues at CIBS.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.150
Rapid rise of connected
on-demand mobility

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.740
and digital mobility.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.240
So digital mobility
very important in China.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.040
Again, something you
might expect because

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.530
of the cities being so crowded.

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.210
The link between hardware
innovation and the economics

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.060
of the digital ecosystem.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.800
China is more ready for this.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.320
And then thirdly,
data-driven insight.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:26.110
So Chinese service businesses
really mine their data.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.180
And there are emerging
service companies

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.850
that are disrupting, for
example, the automobile

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.060
services.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.730
So won't go through
this, but you

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.130
can see that at
least in mobility,

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.430
a lot of things going on.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:41.410
And you study this
at your leisure.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.230
As most of you
know, Uber lost out

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:50.800
in China, defeated in China
by the incumbent company,

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.170
and they ended up
selling their stake

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.880
to the Chinese
company in exchange

00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:00.250
for a share in the
combined business.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.980
One of the interesting
mistakes that Uber made

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:07.420
was that it was possible for
the drivers to cheat Uber.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.900
Because if they got a friend to
book a ride and then the friend

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.330
canceled the ride,
the driver still

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.710
got a percentage of the fee,
which was really dumb of Uber.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.710
Because if in China there is a
way for someone to cheat you,

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:21.210
they will.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.190
And the last slide,
the famous BAT,

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.770
if you've ever heard that
phrase, Baidu, Alibaba,

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:31.490
Tencent.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.700
This last slide is
about the ecosystems

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.790
that they have built up.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:41.250
So we have 15 to 20
minutes for questions.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:42.936
Thank you for listening to this.

00:31:42.936 --> 00:31:45.426
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:46.892 --> 00:31:49.100
AUDIENCE: So you were just
talking about data mining.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.940
I had a question about that.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.600
How do the privacy
policies of the Chinese

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.210
compare to Western countries?

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:57.980
GEORGE S. YIP: What's privacy?

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.200
AUDIENCE: Ability--

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.130
GEORGE S. YIP: No, no.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.900
No, I'm serious.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.770
The Chinese word for privacy
has negative connotations.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.700
It implies something a bit
shameful that you want to hide.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.470
My wife, who's
English, learned this

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.990
when after we'd been married
we went to Hong Kong.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.290
So there's much less of
the concept of privacy.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:23.595
And of course, the
government in China

00:32:23.595 --> 00:32:26.840
is entitled to look
at any of your data.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.850
All right.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.050
It's just like Facebook.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.797
So privacy is much less.

00:32:34.797 --> 00:32:37.130
Well, I mean, do you guys
know about the new development

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.730
in China of the
good citizen index?

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.880
China is working to create
a good citizen index--

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.260
that's not the exact phrase--

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.660
but based on your behavior.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.590
And after that,
you will be blocked

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:57.140
from buying airline tickets,
renting cars jobs, et cetera

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.070
because you have a bad
citizen behavior rating.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.614
So no privacy.

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:05.030
AUDIENCE: I think
I read somewhere

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.175
that part of the reason
for China's expansion

00:33:08.175 --> 00:33:09.800
on like mobile payments
is because they

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.800
don't have the existing
infrastructure of credit cards.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.410
Are there any other examples
where China kind of skips

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.177
past something into innovation?

00:33:18.177 --> 00:33:19.010
GEORGE S. YIP: Yeah.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:22.005
I mean, that's the best example.

00:33:22.005 --> 00:33:24.380
Not only do they not have the
credit card infrastructure,

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.171
they don't have the
banking infrastructure.

00:33:26.171 --> 00:33:27.920
So many Chinese, a
very high percentage,

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.100
don't have bank accounts.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.070
So they jumped
straight to mobile.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:36.630
So that's a big
advantage for them.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.130
Yeah.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.715
I mean, a related example
of this is bike rentals.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.110
I don't know how much
there are in the US,

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:49.220
but in London and Paris we have
these bike rental services,

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.900
but they have docking stations.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.460
So Chinese companies invented
bikes without docking stations.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.810
It's done entirely digitally.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.690
It locks the bike so you
can leave a bike anywhere.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.160
Now, there have
been huge problems

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.900
because they then get these
mountains of discarded bikes.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.930
But again, that's a
different Chinese solution.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.060
No infrastructure
so they come up

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.510
with a new solution where you
can take the bike anywhere.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.760
So these are some
of the examples

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.210
of the leapfrogging
because they don't have

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:21.570
the previous infrastructure.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:25.050
AUDIENCE: So your slides show
kind of the ecosystem in China,

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.820
but there's a lot of technology
that is forcibly not in China.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.389
For example, lots
of restrictions

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:35.600
on Google in China and we can't
really have a presence due

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.350
to the government.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.889
Have you looked at kind
of the global usage

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:43.348
by Chinese users of
different technology sets?

00:34:43.348 --> 00:34:45.139
GEORGE S. YIP: Well,
I mean, the reason why

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:46.305
Google is blocked in China--

00:34:46.305 --> 00:34:49.409
I mean, there are two reasons
why Google is blocked in China.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.139
One is that China
wanted to protect

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:53.360
its incumbent companies.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.000
And then secondly,
because Google

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.670
was trying to protect
the privacy of its users,

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:01.110
and China doesn't like that.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.220
That's the main thing.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.220
Now, yes.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.830
Not your exact question,
but it is a problem

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.200
for Chinese researchers.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.170
Because of the blocks on
access to the internet,

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.900
they cannot access
everything they need to do.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.460
So one of the
solutions they have

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.280
is that Chinese companies
will open a research office

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.400
in Hong Kong, where
there are no blocks,

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.280
and then they do the
internet search that way.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.340
For a while, researchers,
including business school

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.500
professors, used--

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.360
I just blanked out--

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.480
there's a technology where
you can get past this.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.410
Now, China's what
is it called the--

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.139
AUDIENCE: VPN.

00:35:37.139 --> 00:35:38.180
GEORGE S. YIP: Yeah, VPN.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.638
But now China's
blocking that again

00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:41.980
and it's illegal to have VPN.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.290
So I mean, the astonishing
thing when the internet started

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.260
was that people said, there's
no way China can control this.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.250
But I think there's
up to a million people

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.210
working on controlling
the internet.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.770
So again, this is use
of the large numbers.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.090
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned that
oftentimes, Chinese students

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.640
will come to the
US to get educated

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.410
and then there's incentives
for them to go back to China.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:13.460
And I've heard some people
have the perspective,

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.755
why should we educate
if they're just

00:36:16.755 --> 00:36:20.160
going to take education and
go back to their country

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.800
and not stay here
and contribute?

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.190
How would you respond to
that and what's your stance

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.910
and thoughts on that?

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.630
GEORGE S. YIP: I, mean that
that's a complicated policy

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:33.130
issue.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.700
And luckily, I'm
not a politician

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.710
so I don't have to
make these decisions.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.650
I mean, what we've
found through history

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:43.460
is that you usually improve
relations with a country

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.020
if you educate people.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.770
They go back with very
views of the country.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.400
Although interestingly,
20 years ago,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.670
the Chinese would deliberately
give very small living grants

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:55.900
to the students.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.900
They wanted them to experience
the worst of the USA, not

00:36:58.900 --> 00:36:59.980
the best of USA.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.940
Think about it.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.330
They wanted them to live in
the poorest places in the US

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.370
and not become too
fond of the US.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.400
I mean, Chinese
students are now richer.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.230
More of the ones who come out
often have wealthy parents.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:17.000
So we often see these policy
items the other way around.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.630
Why are countries like the
UK and the US throwing out

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.240
these students after
we've invested in them

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.030
and we want to keep them?

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:29.860
So it's a difficult solution.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.530
Donald Trump hasn't gone
off of that yet, I think,

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.270
of blocking Chinese students.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:36.022
But who knows.

00:37:36.022 --> 00:37:37.480
AUDIENCE: I think
many people would

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:42.190
argue that the long-term
viability of China's innovation

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:48.580
is threatened by the increasing
gap in social inequality

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.330
and even those three
huge companies sucking up

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.200
all of the ecosystem,
whereas perhaps others would

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.070
argue that Western economies
have more room for innovation

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.630
because of less regulation.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:08.410
So I guess could you comment
on the future of China's

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.830
innovation and then
also how you see

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:19.480
a growing divide in the rich
in China and the poor in China?

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.040
GEORGE S. YIP: The
income inequality

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.100
is triggered by what's
called the Hu code

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.430
system, the residency
system, where you're not

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:31.720
allowed to live in a
city without getting

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.280
a special permit.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.770
And in general, the cities
block that because once you're

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.360
allowed, then you can
access all the services--

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.160
medical services,
education, et cetera.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.900
So a lot of the lower
level jobs in China

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.780
are done by people
who are nonresidents

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.340
who are there semi-illegally.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.320
And sadly, their children
cannot go to school.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.945
So they have to leave
the children back

00:38:51.945 --> 00:38:54.620
in the countryside be brought
up by their grandparents.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.715
So this is actually
a massive problem

00:38:56.715 --> 00:38:58.450
that they literally
don't know how

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:02.710
to solve right now affecting
maybe 100 million people.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.290
But I don't think
that's necessarily

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:09.610
going to block innovation per
se because the innovation is

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:14.410
happening at an upper level, the
scientists and the engineers.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:18.880
Secondly, the nature
of China is that it

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.130
is state-driven innovation,
but there are lots

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.700
of private companies as well.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.810
So many of the most innovative
companies like Alibaba;

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.630
Royole, which I mentioned,
the flexible displays, these

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.490
are strictly private
companies that

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:34.520
are sort of benefiting from the
Chinese innovation ecosystem.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.230
And the question I
haven't heard yet,

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:39.130
but people often
ask me is, well,

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.050
if China is like
controlling people,

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:43.360
doesn't that stop innovation?

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:48.240
Well, China doesn't care
so long as you do not

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.090
seek to overthrow
the Communist Party.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:53.940
If you're just innovating
and making money,

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.550
they're happy to support you.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.980
So I really don't necessarily
see that as a problem.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.180
Or even by the dominance
of a few companies.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.596
I mean, if you
look at the history

00:40:02.596 --> 00:40:07.500
of the US, many industries
like the automobile industry

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:12.570
from the 1930s onwards, have
been dominated by two or three

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:14.050
major companies.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:18.390
In fact, in China the problem
isn't too many monopolies,

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.250
it's too many competitors.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:22.920
We actually have coined
a phrase in our next book

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.590
with some different co-authors
about swarm innovation.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.140
We have an article coming
out soon about that.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.015
There are swarms of
Chinese competitors.

00:40:30.015 --> 00:40:31.890
So there aren't too few
Chinese competitors,

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.252
there are actually
too many of them.

00:40:35.252 --> 00:40:37.710
AUDIENCE: What do you think
are some of the challenges that

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:40.200
are facing China in
this space and what

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.542
are their leaders
worrying about the most?

00:40:43.542 --> 00:40:45.750
GEORGE S. YIP: Well, if I
just talk about innovation,

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.270
education system is inferior.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.690
The education system,
top down, traditional.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.400
Of course, that doesn't
stimulate so much innovation.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.880
The PhD student will do the work
of the professor, et cetera.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.960
So they're aware of this.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.789
And guess what,
they're paying the USA

00:41:00.789 --> 00:41:02.080
to help them solve the problem.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.500
So Duke University
has a program in China

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.656
to teach Chinese
university lecturers

00:41:07.656 --> 00:41:09.030
how to teach their
students to be

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.544
innovative like the Americans.

00:41:10.544 --> 00:41:12.210
So once again, America
is teaching China

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.960
how to compete with America.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.030
So that is probably
the biggest problem.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:20.160
A secondary problem is the
Chinese language, which also

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.530
affects the education system.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.030
It's hard for other
people to learn,

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.396
it takes up so much time
and brain space of children.

00:41:27.396 --> 00:41:28.770
I have my own
personal prediction

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.320
that mobile phones are
helping to solve this problem

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.850
because more and
more now, people

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:35.310
are using the cell
phones to spell for them.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.680
Actually, older people are
complaining about this.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.280
I could see this being
outsourced to cell phones.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.240
AUDIENCE: One area where
the US lags pretty severely

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.350
behind the rest of
the developed world

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.790
is the health care system.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.950
And you've mentioned
kind of in passing

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.750
kind of the innovations in
medical technology and health

00:41:55.750 --> 00:42:00.560
in China, and I'm wondering
what can the US learn,

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.750
what can the US take from that?

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.000
GEORGE S. YIP: Well, China
doesn't have a great health

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.480
care system, either.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.790
It's surprisingly private.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:12.070
People have to pay a lot.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:16.880
So the whole state
health care system

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:23.350
has kind of withered away
post-communist economic system.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:27.860
So you can get some services,
but for example, people

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:33.050
have to pay doctors on the side
to get any serious treatment.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.050
There's a terrible incentive
in that doctors make money

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:40.250
by selling medicines, so they
over prescribe their medicines.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.190
But again, going back
to the technology part,

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:48.470
they may start to leapfrog
this by digital, et cetera,

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.036
and making it faster.

00:42:50.036 --> 00:42:51.410
I did have one
experience myself.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:55.340
I had to go through
a health check.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.490
And a typical Chinese approach,
it was like a production line.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.110
Whereas in the
West, I'd have gone

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.810
you know from floor to floor
to the x-ray department,

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:05.500
to the blood department,
and so on, here it

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.060
was a small building
with a corridor.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:11.390
First room, chest x-rays;
second room, blood test;

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.900
third room, eye test.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.740
So it was like production
line and the whole thing

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:21.410
cost $100 US, which would
cost you $1,000 in the US.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:25.580
AUDIENCE: We all know China
has the largest market

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.970
in the world for many things.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:33.770
So many Western companies
tried to enter the market

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:37.230
without much success.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:42.720
What's your view on the top
reasons why Western companies

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.982
often fail in the market?

00:43:44.982 --> 00:43:46.190
GEORGE S. YIP: Good question.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.670
But to be fair, many
companies have also succeeded.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.520
So reasons for failure.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.797
If you go into a
sector where China

00:43:55.797 --> 00:43:57.505
is trying to develop
its own competitors,

00:43:57.505 --> 00:44:01.100
they will make life
very difficult for you.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.380
They have hidden regulations
they can pull out

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.570
to make it difficult for you.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:07.610
So long as you are
contributing something

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.580
that China doesn't have, such
as the Western auto companies

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.600
over the last 30 years,
they're happy to welcome you.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.640
I mean, I teach
international business.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.640
It's the same principle.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.700
You've got to bring
something to the country

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.760
that they don't have.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.010
So if you have that, then
they will welcome you and not

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:31.310
make life too difficult.
Then partners--

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:33.430
for a long time, you
needed a Chinese partner.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:37.070
Some were good
partners, some were bad.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:41.420
There's a Chinese saying,
[SPEAKING MANDARIN],, same bed,

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:42.930
different dreams.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.690
So sometimes the partner was
a nightmare, so to speak,

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:48.060
following that analogy.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.240
So that's a reason
why it could go wrong.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.445
But really, I think
Google's case,

00:44:52.445 --> 00:44:56.690
you actually came right up
against a central policy

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:59.630
of the government, which
is the privacy issue,

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:02.510
and that's why you've
been banned from China.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:07.960
Plus secondarily, other
companies like eBay--

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:14.360
the privacy issue-- they wanted
to protect their emerging

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.450
companies.

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:15.950
That's why.

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:17.930
So there are still
opportunities,

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:20.720
but not in areas like that.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.500
AUDIENCE: So one thing that
I've noticed about competition

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.740
in China is that it's
a very free-wheeling

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.760
from of competition.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.530
If you have an idea, there
will be a million competitors

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:37.340
doing the same thing,
maybe better, maybe not.

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.600
That's a very hard situation
for external companies

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.670
because here in the
US, for example, there

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:52.610
is a strong law field of
patents and IT protection.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:57.170
So how can anyone think of
getting to the market in China

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:00.410
in such a situation where there
is a feeling that everything

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:01.789
will be stolen?

00:46:01.789 --> 00:46:02.580
GEORGE S. YIP: Yes.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.420
Actually, what Western companies
are doing more and more

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.950
is that instead of
selling products,

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:10.770
they're now selling
business models.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.970
So if you're going to embed the
product in a business system,

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:19.370
that is much harder
to imitate against.

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:24.140
So selling the service based
on the product, rather than

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:27.920
the product itself
or rapidly innovating

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:33.854
to keep ahead of the imitators
or having superior technology.

00:46:33.854 --> 00:46:36.020
There are ways to protect
your intellectual property

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.740
so that it can't
be fully imitated.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.900
Interestingly,
the auto companies

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.390
are still ahead in China.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:49.630
This may be a good item
to finish with, actually.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.250
I was told by one of the
German automotive companies,

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:54.410
they said, the reason
we're still ahead

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:59.390
is that in the West, the
auto engineers grew up

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:03.440
being taken to repair
garages by their father

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.640
or their grandfather.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.700
So they've had this
since childhood,

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.110
these automotive engineers.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:12.210
In China, the automotive
engineers are first generation.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.390
They don't have this
deep background.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:17.240
And cars are this very
complex combination

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.620
of being a consumer product
and being a highly engineered

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.460
technical product.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.010
So actually, they're going to
have more difficulty in cars

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:29.660
than they have, say, in
commercial jet aircraft.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.310
And in fact,
interestingly in cars,

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.940
they don't particularly want
the ultimate driving machine,

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.940
like a BMW; they want the
ultimate mobile living room

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:43.230
because that's a different
kind of experience

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.780
that they want in China.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:49.740
There's a great story about
BMW, which is that in China--

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.450
this will be my last comment--

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:53.820
there was a dating
TV program in China,

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.640
just to show you
again Chinese culture.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.410
And a young woman
on the TV program

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:01.500
was asked by a
young man, he said,

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.840
I'm not very rich so would
you go on a date with me

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.270
just on a bicycle?

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:08.790
And she rejected
him and said, I'd

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:14.230
rather cry in the back of a BMW
than smile on top of a bicycle.

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:15.660
So that's Chinese culture.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.070
Thank you very much.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:19.820
