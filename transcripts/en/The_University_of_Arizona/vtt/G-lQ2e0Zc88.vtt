00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.850
So I always have had this
really I guess dual interest,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.100
both in the fields of
technology, and computer

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.340
science, and electronics, as
well as life science research.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.110
Where do we put the balls?

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.680
Pinball definitely feeds
a lot of my interests

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.310
just in terms of being able to
play with physical machines.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.700
And I don't know there's just
something so pure and elegant

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.220
about what a pinball machine
brings to people simply

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.260
because you have two buttons.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.090
You're trying to control one
silver ball bouncing around

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.560
in this environment.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.950
And if I can ever make any
of the software systems

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.670
that I designed for life
science research as easy

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.180
to use as two buttons, and also
be as immersive as a pinball

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.977
machine can bring, then I have
succeeded at doing something.
