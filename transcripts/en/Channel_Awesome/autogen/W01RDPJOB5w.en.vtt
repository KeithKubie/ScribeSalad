00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:14.069 align:start position:0%
part of it but everything else if if you
 

00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:15.859 align:start position:0%
part of it but everything else if if you
enjoy<00:13:14.369><c> the</c><00:13:14.549><c> first</c><00:13:14.699><c> Sin</c><00:13:14.999><c> City</c><00:13:15.240><c> you'll</c><00:13:15.600><c> probably</c>

00:13:15.859 --> 00:13:15.869 align:start position:0%
enjoy the first Sin City you'll probably
 

00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:18.110 align:start position:0%
enjoy the first Sin City you'll probably

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
like this one the only
 

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.260 align:start position:0%
like this one the only
I<00:13:18.150><c> can</c><00:13:18.420><c> think</c><00:13:18.660><c> that</c><00:13:18.750><c> would</c><00:13:18.900><c> also</c><00:13:19.940><c> maybe</c><00:13:20.940><c> be</c><00:13:21.240><c> a</c>

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:21.270 align:start position:0%
I can think that would also maybe be a
 

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
I can think that would also maybe be a
problem<00:13:21.779><c> is</c><00:13:21.960><c> that</c><00:13:22.320><c> a</c><00:13:22.560><c> lot</c><00:13:23.040><c> of</c><00:13:23.070><c> characters</c><00:13:23.490><c> are</c>

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:23.610 align:start position:0%
problem is that a lot of characters are
 

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.660 align:start position:0%
problem is that a lot of characters are
returning<00:13:23.910><c> characters</c><00:13:24.510><c> and</c><00:13:25.279><c> going</c><00:13:26.279><c> into</c><00:13:26.460><c> this</c>

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:26.670 align:start position:0%
returning characters and going into this
 

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.100 align:start position:0%
returning characters and going into this
I<00:13:26.850><c> thought</c><00:13:27.000><c> I</c><00:13:27.029><c> was</c><00:13:27.120><c> gonna</c><00:13:27.270><c> get</c><00:13:27.390><c> all</c><00:13:27.600><c> new</c>

one<00:14:13.350><c> I</c><00:14:13.470><c> wouldn't</c><00:14:13.770><c> recommend</c><00:14:14.040><c> it</c><00:14:14.370><c> you</c><00:14:14.580><c> can</c>

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:15.410 align:start position:0%
one I wouldn't recommend it you can
 

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.500 align:start position:0%
one I wouldn't recommend it you can
technically<00:14:16.410><c> but</c><00:14:16.860><c> a</c><00:14:17.070><c> lot</c><00:14:17.730><c> of</c><00:14:17.760><c> what</c><00:14:18.150><c> makes</c><00:14:18.360><c> it</c>

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:18.510 align:start position:0%
technically but a lot of what makes it
 

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.630 align:start position:0%
technically but a lot of what makes it
work<00:14:18.690><c> is</c><00:14:18.870><c> knowing</c><00:14:19.410><c> who</c><00:14:20.010><c> these</c><00:14:20.190><c> people</c><00:14:20.250><c> are</c>

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
work is knowing who these people are
 

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
work is knowing who these people are
going<00:14:20.790><c> to</c><00:14:21.000><c> be</c><00:14:21.180><c> or</c><00:14:21.420><c> who</c><00:14:21.540><c> they</c><00:14:21.690><c> were</c><00:14:22.010><c> in</c><00:14:23.010><c> the</c>

going to be or who they were in the
 

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
going to be or who they were in the
previous<00:14:23.550><c> film</c><00:14:23.790><c> so</c><00:14:24.029><c> I</c><00:14:24.060><c> think</c><00:14:24.360><c> it</c><00:14:24.420><c> does</c><00:14:24.570><c> make</c><00:14:24.750><c> a</c>

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:24.810 align:start position:0%
previous film so I think it does make a
 

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
previous film so I think it does make a
difference<00:14:24.900><c> you</c><00:14:25.860><c> can</c><00:14:26.010><c> still</c><00:14:26.250><c> follow</c><00:14:26.459><c> it</c>

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:26.730 align:start position:0%
difference you can still follow it
 

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.690 align:start position:0%
difference you can still follow it
enough<00:14:27.029><c> but</c><00:14:27.390><c> it's</c><00:14:27.980><c> it's</c><00:14:28.980><c> better</c><00:14:29.279><c> if</c><00:14:29.400><c> you</c><00:14:29.520><c> see</c>

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
enough but it's it's better if you see
 

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.329 align:start position:0%
enough but it's it's better if you see
the<00:14:29.820><c> first</c><00:14:29.970><c> one</c><00:14:30.150><c> and</c><00:14:30.510><c> I</c><00:14:31.470><c> saw</c><00:14:31.920><c> with</c><00:14:32.070><c> a</c><00:14:32.160><c> great</c>
