00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.593
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.470


00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.350
&gt;&gt; Our author this afternoon
is James McGrath Morris

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.256
and I for one am very
excited to hear from him.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.316
As you may know, the news business
is undergoing some soul searching

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.350
and some financial distress, and so
it's gratifying to talk to someone

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.650
who has had so much success
writing about journalism

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.390
and about the news business

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.650
and the very interesting
characters that have built it.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.396
His books include The Rose Man of
Sing Sing: A True Tale of Life,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.116
Murder, and Redemption in the
Age of Yellow Journalism as well

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.790
as Jailhouse Journalism: The
Fourth Estate Behind Bars.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.276
The book he'll be discussing today
is his most recent work Pulitzer:

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.770
A Life in Politics,
Print, and Power.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.563
It is my great pleasure to
give you James McGrath Morris.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.130
[ Applause ]

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.153
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.433
About six months ago, I was
doing what authors usually do

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.720
which is travel to small towns

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.373
because there are people
who buy and read books.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.070
And I was in a bookstore where a
really kind reader felt my pain

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.130
and asked me a softball question.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.986
So he said to me, "You spent five
years studying this guy's life.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.953
Is there any kind of practical
thing that you learned from it?"

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.203
I thought, had mumbled some
sort of incoherent answer.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.556
Well, six months later
I have the answer.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.160
So if he's out there,
here's the answer.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.093
And if you wanna take
notes, feel free.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.990
The answer is if you make a lot of
money in life and you endow a prize

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.720
like Pulitzer did,
everybody will know the prize,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.600
but they will not remember
who the heck you were.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.560
And for me as an author, this
actually gave me an opportunity

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.156
because there are a lot of giants
in the 19th century, Morgan,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.330
Rockefeller, and we think
they have no connection

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.993
to our lives, but they do.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.153
Most of you drove an oil-powered
automobile to come here.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.193
We're talking about Rockefeller.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.156
Many of you are hopefully
gonna run over and buy a book,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.083
and you're gonna whip out a
credit card which is based

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.376
on a financial system
invented by Morgan.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.510
Well, Pulitzer is one of those
geniuses from the 19th century

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.753
who is the midwife of the modern
mass media who, in a sense,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.993
may have brought you here.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.393
You learned about the
event maybe electronically

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.140
on the Washington Post
website but this whole notion

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.713
of disseminating news and all
of those things are owed to us

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.826
or came to us from Pulitzer.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.090
And so for me as an author,
it's a great opportunity

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.766
because here I'm writing about one
of the giants of the 19th century

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.853
who most people knew nothing about.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.970
So unlike reading about
Morgan or Rockefeller,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.673
everytime you turn the page
it's an opportunity for me

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.893
to tell you something new.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.640
So I wanna leave you with a couple
of aspects of why Pulitzer is

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.003
so important to us, how, in a
sense, his hand is still reaching

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.896
out through the grave and
touching our lives today

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.550
and affecting the way
we communicate,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.816
the way we organize news.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.683
And I'm not gonna tell
you an old story

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.000
about Pulitzer who'd start off
life as a Hungarian immigrant,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.500
came here as a mercenary soldier.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.496
I wanna tell you about how
he reshaped journalism which,

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.236
in a sense, was a boring
craft before the man arrived

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.576
and changed things.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.843
And the first seminal
moment is in 1878

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.176
when he invests his last few dollars
in buying a bankrupt evening paper

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.680
in the City of Saint Louis on the
steps of the Saint Louis courthouse,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.803
the same courthouse that
decided the Dred Scott decision.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.346
And all his friends think he's
nuts, an afternoon paper in a city

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.130
where three afternoon
papers are being published,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.030
none of which are making money
and he's buying a bankrupt paper.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.993
And this is one of the
distinguishing moments in his life

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.116
that will reflect the
characteristics that caused him

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.190
to reshape our society
because he's not an inventor.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.433
He's not like Bell or somebody
who said, "Gee, we need a gadget

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.060
where we can talk to each other."

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.656
What he was is a man who could
perceive huge social trends,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.080
sort of like the Tuckfield
[phonetic] did before.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.000
And the analogy I give and people
think I've really lost my marbles

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.150
when I suddenly asked you to imagine
a surfer, and here I'm talking

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.956
about a 19th century figure.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.276
But I want you to see this
before I talk about Pulitzer.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.093
If you've ever been to the coast
where there are surfers and you look

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.513
out on the waves, far past the
waves where they're breaking,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.300
they'll be young men and
women on their boards

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.226
and they're probably
old surfers, too.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.430
Let's just say, men and
women on their boards.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.490
And they're paddling very slowly
and suddenly they paddle furiously

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.690
and they ride a huge
wave that forms.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.123
Somehow, those good surfers are able
to detect the slight undulations

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.503
in the water and realize
that's the big wave.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.663
Pulitzer did that with our society.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.263
Here he was in Saint
Louis and he realized

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.826
that farmers were leaving their
farms in Illinois and Missouri

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.520
and coming to the city
because of industrialization.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.723
They were becoming factory workers.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.570
So what were they doing?

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.303
They were commuting.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.120
Women who used to be important
economic decision makers

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.153
on the farms were now
becoming housewives.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.090
It's all gonna play into something
you're gonna see in a second.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.353
Gaslight and electric light allowed
people to entertain themselves

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.253
in the evening by reading.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.693
A new printing press
had been invented by Hoe

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.503
that could print papers quickly.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.730
Paper was being made from trees
that had the tensile strength to go

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.050
through these machines at high speed

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.053
and the Victorian Internet
had arrived.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.596
You call it the telegraph bringing
news from New York and Washington

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.830
to Saint Louis as fresh
as that morning.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.966
So he took all of these ingredients
and published an afternoon paper

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.770
with news from Washington and New
York as fresh as that morning,

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.426
sold it to commuters heading home
desperate for entertainment filled

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.966
with entertaining tales
about the city

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.543
and economic decision making
material for the housewives,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.596
advertisements, where can you buy
gingham, where can you buy flower.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.456
And as a result, he created this
new medium of mass communication

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.283
in Saint Louis that
became a huge success.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.536
So now, let's move along
and see why it went

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
from Saint Louis to elsewhere.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.873
New York in the 19th century
was really the capital

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.910
of the United States.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.310
Now, I know you're thinking
here I have come to Washington

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.376
and I'm saying I'm ignorant.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.510
No, no, no.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.256
This was a swamp infested place
that only politicians went.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.690
Broadway and the music and the
theater, that was New York.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.370
Publishing, that was New York.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.036
Media, the newspapers,
that was New York.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.183
And so Pulitzer was waiting
and biding his time to get

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.183
to New York and he did the same.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.653
He came to New York in 1883,
bought a bankrupt newspaper,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.233
brought his western style
of journalism to New York

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.073
and became an instant success
there with a newspaper none

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.313
of us know anymore because
it's gone, the New York World.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.043
And it was such a success instantly

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.456
because he replicated what
he learned in Saint Louis,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.916
but he added something
very important.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.420
As an immigrant, he looked to
the lower East Side of New York

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.600
and saw these vast teeming
waves of new Americans

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.113
and he didn't see them as a threat.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.746
He saw them as a strength, as
something he could like himself,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.800
they're gonna contribute
to the United States.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.066
So he admonished his reporters to
go and write about their lives.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.390
So his reporters descended on the
lower East Side and wrote stories

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.416
about their lives, but not
just about their lives.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.803
They were using Dickens
as their model,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.486
tell stories about their lives.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.403
So the world would come out
with a headline, "Tiny tot falls

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.660
to its death as mother looks on."

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.663
And on the upper reaches of Fifth
Avenue where people drink their tea

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.133
with their little finger up, one
of them said, "Hey, Elizabeth,

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.206
look at this sensationalistic
prattle that's going

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.423
on in the paper."

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.243
And they were missing the
point because if you went

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.960
to the lower East Side and you
went in the Black and Tan bars

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:32.593
or the overcrowded dining
rooms of those tenement houses,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.433
what were those families
talking about?

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.390
They were indeed talking
about the children

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.583
that had fallen off the
roof the night before

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.450
because the tenements were so
hot, something we know today

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.536
in this tent, so hot
that in order to sleep,

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:51.693
people went to the top
floor and children sometimes

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.620
at night rolled off the
roofs to their deaths.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.750
So he wasn't covering
sensationalism.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:00.950
He was writing about their lives.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.950
And as a result, he gave
them a newfound dignity.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.713
Now, if any of you
were to invite me home,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.830
and don't worry this is just an
analogy, you don't have to do this,

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.166
I'm betting that on your
refrigerators you have a clipping,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.200
a clipping of a wedding, your son

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:18.956
and daughter's school
achievements, sports things.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.363
Those events occurred
irregardless of the clipping.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.663
The clipping, the putting it to
print gives that moment a dignity,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.693
a meaningful representation
that you cherish and keep.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.130
Well, imagine in the world
before television and radio,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.516
those stories encapsulated
their lives

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.350
and gave dignity to those people.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.560
And for once, somebody was
paying attention to them.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.853
So they in return would spend their
pennies buying the paper, of course,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.270
making the New York World this
enormous success reaching a

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.716
circulation of a million copies

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.483
when they're only 64 million
people in the United States.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.133
&gt;&gt; So as this goes on,
there's something else

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.326
that relates to their lives.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:05.766
The French have decided to give
us a gift, the Statue of Liberty.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.346
And if you remember your history,
the Statue of Liberty is a gift

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:12.856
of the French people
to the American people,

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.463
not of the French government.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.213
The French people had
raised the money privately

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.206
and in turn we were supposed

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:22.570
to raise the money,
but we were failing.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:25.146
So Pulitzer put it on the front
page of his newspaper that the money

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.133
to build the pedestal for
the statue is not coming in.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.813
He editorialized and said, "We
need to bring this money in."

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.683
And people everyday, poor
people, kids, came to the paper

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.543
and gave a penny or a nickel.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.230
Now, it may not seem
like much but understand.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.223
Pulitzer is like a
rubber baron of that time.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.490
He's a corporate chieftain.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.203
And the poorest people on New York
were coming in and entrusting them

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.183
with their pennies and nickels
for the Statue of Liberty.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.770
And in return, he was putting
their name in the newspaper.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.860
So a kid, what they called
street Arabs or street urchins,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.303
by giving the world a penny would
have his name in the same newspaper

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.356
that covered the Astors,
the Vanderbilts,

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:12.003
and all the great names in society.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.543
So the pedestal was
built with that money.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:16.150
The statue arrived
and it was erected

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.176
with the money of these people.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.126
So Pulitzer was changing the New
York landscape by his new use

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.246
of media and exemplifying
a kind of intimate trust

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:29.830
that no institution
might have today.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.553
I don't think many of you are gonna
rush to some large corporation

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.813
and give them some
change and say I trust you

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.746
to keep it for some project.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.946
We have foundations in 501c3's.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:42.316
So there's another
change that's gonna go

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:43.843
on that's gonna symbolize how he's
changed our lives and created--

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.796
or was the midwife of
the modern mass media.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:50.983
His papers become such a success
it needs a new headquarters

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:54.840
and Pulitzer's life is
becoming a dramatic change

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.660
because he's falling blind.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.436
So like Beethoven who
can't hear his own music,

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.370
Pulitzer can't read his own work,

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.396
but he's creating this
huge media enterprise

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.283
and it needs a new headquarters.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.203
So he chooses a spot in New York

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.343
and this is the second
practical lesson for you.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.716
He buys a hotel called
French's Hotel.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:18.686
French's Hotel was a hotel on
Park Row that had thrown them

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.973
out of the lobby when he
was unemployed veteran.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.246
And if you remember the old adage,

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.380
"Revenge is a dish
best served cold."

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.466
Twenty years later, he
comes back, buys the hotel,

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.313
and tears it down for
his headquarters.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.060
Now, Park Row is significant in
another way in that time period.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.153
This is the world before
Twitter, before CNN,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.946
before any of these
kinds of communications.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.040
So if you wanted to know
who won the election,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:47.913
you would go down to Park
Row and on the buildings,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:51.906
they would have blackboards and
they would write Cleveland is ahead.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:54.506
Well, it wasn't just elections.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.240
Everybody went to Park Row.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.670
When America's cup was waged,
they telegraphed the results

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.810
and they had small
ships that moved across.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:04.870
There was a boxing match
on one of the islands

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:06.900
and they have marionettes reenacting
the fight as the telegraphs came in.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.790
Now, for those of you who are old
enough, you're gonna get this.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.450
Think about it.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.183
The crowd loved it so much
they asked the marionette crew

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.050
to do it all over again.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.850
That is instant replay a century
before ABC's Wide World of Sports.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.060
So Park Row is a terrifically
important aspect

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.923
of life in New York.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.056
It's the Fleet Street.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.093
It's where the Tribune was, a little
unknown newspaper called the New

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.153
York Times, the Herald, and the New
York World was being built there.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.790
So he built the tallest
building on the globe.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.533
And on the top of it was
a dome that was gold leaf.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.766
And in that office was where the
editorial crew that wrote the World

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.113
and produced the paper that
on Sundays was as thick

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.340
as a telephone book with
things like dress patterns.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.840
The greatest invention of that time,
of course, the Color Sunday Comic

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.253
or cartoon, sheet music
that you could use

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:10.580
to play long before we had
iPods and could download music.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.290
You could buy the New York
World and get sheet music

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.350
and play the newest song that
night in your home, recipes,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.070
serialization of novels,
economic instruction.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:26.853
So this immigrant population turned
to the World for all of this kind

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.393
of instruction on Sundays and
got it for just a few pennies.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:36.853
So this building went up and it was
the tallest building in the world

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.140
at that point on the globe, and it
was at the centerpiece of New York.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.513
So just like he was redoing the
American mass media and reshaping,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.263
and he was reshaping the New York
skyline in a way that's so symbolic

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.443
that I wanna finish
telling you this tale.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:55.996
Imagine these immigrants now
coming to the United States

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.850
in the late 19th century,
1890 or so.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.260
And folks, this isn't a casual trip.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.120
They are leaving Ukraine,
Poland, and places like that.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:11.813
When they say goodbye
to their parents,

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.146
there's no cheap Delta
flight home next year

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.730
to come home for the holidays.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.530
They probably never
see their family alive.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:21.246
They're gambling their last pennies
to come to this new land and try

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.346
to get a foothold in
this economic dream.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.020
So they're arriving in the
New York harbor and steerage

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.886
in these overcrowded ships,
and they come up to the deck

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.146
and the first thing they're gonna
see is the Statue of Liberty

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.013
on a pedestal erected by
the pennies and nickels

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:40.963
of the people who came before them.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.383
Now, they may be ignorant
of the pedestal,

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:45.266
but they knew what the
Statue of Liberty is.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.050
At that moment, they turned and
they looked at the New York skyline

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.856
for the first time in their
lives and it's their first view

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.063
of the world in which they are
basing their future hopes on.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:58.640
And if the conditions
are just right,

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.446
the sun is gleaming
off the gold dome.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.416
And so the tallest building,
taller than Trinity Church,

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.476
the thing that's lighting up in
the distance is not a monument

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.276
to comers, not a monument to
banking or retail or agriculture.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.600
It's a monument to the
American mass media,

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.546
the only constitutionally
protected business in our society

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:25.696
and specifically, it's their first
glimpse of the World newspaper

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.703
that will be their key
to economic growth,

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.513
their key to learning
Americanisms of all sorts,

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.330
their key to learning
the English language.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.283
He admonished, Pulitzer
admonished his reporters

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.576
to write short punchy sentences
to tell everything in the form

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.833
of a story because he knew who
his readers were and, of course,

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.680
his interest was political power.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:52.663
So he hoped they would eventually
turn to the editorial page

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:55.763
and learn his suggestions as who to
vote for, and that certainly worked.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:16:59.236
The first Democratic
president elected

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.466
after the civil war was Grover
Cleveland and you can do the math.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.940
It's the paper that got him elected.

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.770
So what Pulitzer left us with after
changing the New York landscape

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.000
physically and changing the American
mass media is a legacy we still have

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.820
today, the notion of news
at its core being a story.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.926
He would tell his reporters that
everyday I want people at dinner

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.096
to say, "Did you read
that in the World today?"

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.333
Producers at NBC or anything are
often saying, "I want my audience

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.050
to say, 'Did you see that
story today?'" And the key

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.630
to that is the story and the
humanization of the story.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.813
Think of all the great
tragedies that have occurred

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.133
in our modern lives, the Haiti
earthquake, famine in Africa.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.743
When you read that millions of
people are hurt by something,

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.263
it becomes a number, but we're
moved to act when we read the story

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:02.176
of the one child who's rescued
under the rubble after three days,

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:02.490
and that's the magic that
he was leaving us with,

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.343
that in our lives exist
essentially a story and the magic

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.583
of the news media is
to capture that story

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.140
to humanize it and to give it to us.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.323
And that's why the World grew to
be the most powerful newspaper

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.883
in America where governors
in the state

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.903
of Oregon would write
all the way to New York

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:24.223
and say, "Would you endorse me?"

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.783
And I bet you today that no
governor of Oregon is writing

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.223
to the New York Times and
saying, "Would you endorse me?"

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.570
And so what I enjoyed about
my five-year journey is it was

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.036
like being an archaeologist.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:38.836
I was uncovering a
world we've forgotten.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.770
The World paper is gone.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:42.746
We now have other papers
that have replaced it.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.060
Pulitzer is remembered as a trivial
pursuit like a name of a prize,

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.276
but no one can tell you what he
did and that was the joy I had

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.236
in the last five years writing,
and that's the joy I've had

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.930
in answering questions from readers.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.416
Now, I have some time.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:00.693
I timed it just right, right,
10 minutes to answer questions

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.273
and there are mics on each side.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:05.710
And I'll try not to
take six months to come

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:07.976
up with the appropriate answer.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:10.910
Thank you.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000


00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.410
[ Applause ]

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.103
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.380
&gt;&gt; What was Pulitzer's
connection to drama, theater,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.760
and the other prizes
that have his name?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:24.743
&gt;&gt; What was the connection
of Pulitzer to drama,

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.643
theater, and other things?

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:29.310
Personal. Pulitzer-- there are a lot

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.976
of reasons why the Pulitzer Prize
was created, one of which is

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.570
that as you probably know in 1898,
he engages in the circulation

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.260
of William Randolph Hearst, yellow
journalism, a pejorative term comes

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.253
about and he feels stained by that.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:46.433
All of his major achievements
are forever linked

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.840
to this awful period much
like certain presidents

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.533
who might have been in office
for eight years always remembered

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.646
for one little moment and
then we forget the rest.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:58.550
So Pulitzer created the
Pulitzer Prize in part

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.133
to cleanse his reputation
and secondly, which I'll get

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:03.676
to in a second about his belief
in journalism that changed.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.856
But the reason there were
prizes for drama, and history,

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.513
and music is a personal reflection
of his love of those things.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.140
When he falls blind, he has
readers who travel with him

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.226
who read him novels,
he loved Dickens,

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.906
who hit a personal
pianist to play music.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.566
He loved opera and he thought
these were important parts

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.026
of a civilized society
to have and a reward.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.273
But back to the major prize,
Pulitzer got into journalism

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.290
because he wanted political power

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:37.510
and journalism was the other
side of that coin back.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.870
Politics and journalism
were just two sides

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.470
of the same coin in
the 19th century.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:44.563
But as he became a publisher
and worked in journalism,

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:48.843
he came to understand that it
was a far more important craft

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.030
than personal political power.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.070
And the most important prize
as far as he was concerned

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.406
and it may sound quaint today is the
Pulitzer Prize for Public Service,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:20:59.493
the notion that journalism
may be a business.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.653
Yes, you gotta pay your
employees, but at the heart

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.386
of it is it's an important part
of American democratic process

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:08.976
and that's part of the
reason for the prize.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.036
Should I-- I guess I should
take turns and go this side.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:15.970
Yes?

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.236
&gt;&gt; You kind of responded
to my question just then,

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:19.036
but maybe you can expand on it.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.436
There's a lot bemoaning now
about the corporate media

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.970
and with the implication being

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.116
that the pre-corporate media
was somehow very altruistic

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:28.090
and just concerned
about public service.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.250
But it's always been
a business, hasn't it?

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:31.930
And can you talk about
the difference

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:33.730
between the corporate media today

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.396
and the corporate media
in the 19th century?

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.530
&gt;&gt; Certainly.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.530
They both have-- this is a
question about the corporate media

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:41.730
in the 19th century versus today.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:44.463
They both have the same
concern and they have

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:45.596
to make money in order to work.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.710
Most of the corporate media, I
think, in my commentary that engages

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.376
in a greater public service
are the family-owned newspapers

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.010
because those publishers
can make the decision not--

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:57.430
that the stockholders
aren't gonna like.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.443
I'm gonna subsidize the paper
while it's losing money.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:03.686
And Pulitzer did that at times.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:05.753
When the paper was losing money,

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.286
he would simply subsidize
the enterprise.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.580
But the problem, the corporate
media, family owned or not owned,

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.593
and something we all face,

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.663
is that news is a terrifically
expensive enterprise

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.413
to take an educated soul,
send them to Afghanistan,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.040
and give us important information

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.240
about the war is not
a cheap process.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:27.890
And now that the news media is
finding a struggle to monetize

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.613
to get that income is not a
problem for the Washington Post.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.740
Yes, it isn't making money.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.596
It's a problem for us because
our society without that kind

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.616
of untethered reporting will
suffer and will become--

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:44.046
will have less and less counter
reviews as to what's going on.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:47.820
So the problem is they're
similar, but the diversity

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.136
in the 19th century was so
much larger than it is today.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.450
Sir?

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.450
&gt;&gt; Excuse me.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.650
You mentioned in passing
William Randolph Hearst.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.450
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:01.783
&gt;&gt; And it seems to be to the extent

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.383
to which Pulitzer is
remembered historically,

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.576
he tends to be paired with Hearst.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.590
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.590
Yeah.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.833
&gt;&gt; Could you perhaps spend a couple
of minutes doing a little compare

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.080
and contrast between the two men?

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.173
&gt;&gt; Question is about
the ying and yang.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:18.190
William Randolph Hearst was
and I'm not belittling Hearst,

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:22.800
but he was ultimately the
best imitator of Pulitzer.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.300
He studied Pulitzer's methods.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.633
He came to New York.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.290
He bought a newspaper that
was interestingly started

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.196
by Pulitzer's younger brother
so everyday when Pulitzer opened

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.103
up the Journal and realized
this competitor might put him

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.426
out of business he was competing
with the work of his brother,

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.860
talk about sibling rivalry.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.173
Hearst, in many ways,
outdid Pulitzer on some

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.913
of the less good aspects
of their journalism,

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.430
engaged in greater
sensationalism than the World did

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.890
and was far more successful at that.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.030
But the key moment comes with
the Spanish-American War.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.170
I'm sure many of you heard Mr.
Thomas talking about his book today.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.160
During the Spanish-American War,
these two papers competed in a way

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.563
that we've never had
that kind of competition

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:12.356
and they began to make up stories.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.920
Now, Pulitzer was blind and
in depression over the loss

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:16.890
of his daughter in Jekyll Island.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.126
So in New York, William Randolph
Hearst was leading his troops

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.460
to compete against the
World and Pulitzer was a--

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.806
had troops that had no general.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:27.530
And they knew if the
paper collapsed,

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:29.530
they couldn't go to work for Hearst.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.003
So every outlandish thing Hearst
did, they tried to do equally so.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.790
To give you an example, Hearst
paper had a story about a colonel

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.743
that was killed in the war
with a really odd last name

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:42.870
like Philippe [inaudible]
or something like that.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.616
The World picked up the story
and reprinted it entirely.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.343
The next day, the Journal announced
that if you look at guy's last name,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.556
it's an anagram for
"We pilfer the news."

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.550
Now, when the Spanish-American
War was over

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.003
and this competition was over,
Pulitzer came back to his senses

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:03.526
and he put out an edict that
they couldn't engage in this kind

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.946
of reprehensible sensationalistic
journalism

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.033
but the damage had been done.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:12.750
So I like to give the comparison
to Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.116
and I hope you all
read the last story

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:18.956
because if not I'm
giving something away.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.973
They fight in Switzerland and
they both fall to their death.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.646
History will always link.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.646
Open up any high school
history textbook.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.176
There's always Hearst and Pulitzer,
yellow journalist linked in this

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.570
and Pulitzer was never
able to escape that.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.996
So all achievements I'm
telling you about are lost

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:38.416
because Pulitzer will
always be linked

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.550
as a yellow sensationalistic
journalist.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.870
Thank you.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.690
I'm sorry.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:50.690
Yes, sir.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.823
&gt;&gt; A few years ago when I was in
the 5th grade, I wrote a paper

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.090
on Pulitzer in the Saint Louis Post.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:56.423
&gt;&gt; I wish I'd found
it during my research.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.956
&gt;&gt; Well, I have talked to
you at politic controls.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:00.090
We both used the same
little pamphlet

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:02.090
on the history of the Post-Dispatch.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.756
Your book was better and
certainly more recent,

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.090
but could you dwell
a little bit more

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.790
on the relationship
with his brother?

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:11.230
Was his brother at all successful
and do they dislike each other

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.723
or just ignore each other?

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.206
&gt;&gt; The question is about
Pulitzer's unknown brother Albert.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.710
Pulitzer came from a large family
in which all the children died

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:23.366
by the time he was 13 except for
his younger brother Albert who came

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:26.643
to the United States after
Joseph Pulitzer and just

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:30.360
like his older brother,
he got into journalism

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.053
and this really infuriated
Joseph who was quite an egomaniac

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.253
that his younger brother
not only got in journalism

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.360
but was doing better than he was.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.300
He started a newspaper in New
York which was nothing but gossip.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:43.660
It was called the chambermaid's
delight.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.313
I mean that was its nickname.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:47.846
But it sold copies and here
was his brother, a millionaire,

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.923
publishing in New York and
he was stuck in Saint Louis

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:53.316
with a respectable paper,
so it really bugged him.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:00.956
When he came to New York, he tried
to force his brother to merge papers

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.190
which of course is habit
and his brother said,

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.190
"Why should I merge with you?"

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.323
Pulitzer stole his entire staff.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.323
It didn't matter.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.190
It continued.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.523
Albert later sold the paper
and it became the paper

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.390
that William Randolph Hearst got.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.923
What was great for me
was my little moment

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.856
of discovery was I
found Albert's memoirs

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.723
with his granddaughter
stored in Paris.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.603
So this book is the first to be able
to offer Albert's side of the story

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:26.343
and trust me, it's not exactly
flattering to his older brother.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.053
And any of you who have siblings
would just love this kind of aspect.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:32.943
I got time for one more
question and I'll answer briefly.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.670
I am watching the clock.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.203
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm sorry.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.070
I missed--

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.470
&gt;&gt; Can you come closer to
the mic so I can hear you?

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.070
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.870
I missed most of your
presentation, but I was just curious

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:51.470
with newspapers versus like media
that, you know, is on television.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.396
I don't really understand why
anybody endorses a candidate.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:57.883
I guess I'd look at the newspaper--

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.616
&gt;&gt; Why they endorse a
candidate, you're saying?

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.226
&gt;&gt; Right, because I look at
it as an objective field,

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:04.606
but I guess I'm missing something.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.206
&gt;&gt; The question is why endorse a
candidate in an objective field.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.806
This may be an issue of my age.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:14.270
See, when I grew up, I
learnt how to be media savvy.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.056
The front page of the
newspaper was news.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:21.650
The owner who owned the editorial
page expressed his or her opinion

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.080
as to who would be elected and
these two things don't always agree.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.660
Any of you who've read the Wall
Street Journal wonder if the people

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.733
in the editorial page are
reading the front page

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.273
because the front page
may talk about, you know,

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.810
how some financial bill is
gonna ruin America and you turn

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:37.900
to the editorial page, it
says we gotta pass this bill.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.133
That was much more common today.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.290
I think what's happening

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.376
with broadcast is those distinctions
are becoming more blurry.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.936
Certain networks, particularly one
that might start with letter F tends

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:55.403
to engage in what we might as older
people feel like editorialization

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.926
in the reporting, and
that's a change.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:28:59.436
That's not the way the
media originally was.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:05.310
There was a cardinal line that
divided the editorial division

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:06.466
from the news division and the
news division often reported stuff

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.396
that the owners in the
editorial page didn't like.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.990
But I'll leave you
with this thought.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:19.390
A leibling said this and this is why
those folks enjoy owning newspapers.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.293
Freedom of the press,
as you remind us,

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.600
belongs to those who
own the presses.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.406
And so if you ever get upset about
an editorial in the Washington Times

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.006
or the Washington Post, there
is an op-ed section edited

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.046
by a wonderful man, get
your voice in there,

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.893
and that would have been the
thing Pulitzer would have liked

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:37.386
because he was one
of the first people

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.043
to ever publish an op-ed article,
meaning an article by an individual

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:43.970
that appeared on the paper that
might not agree with his viewpoint.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.330
Thank you.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.393
You're a delightful group.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000


00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:52.830
[ Applause ]

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.800
&gt;&gt; And thank you on behalf of
all the authors for the kind

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.726
of support you give us as writers.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.230
When we're working
alone for five years,

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:08.263
it's nice to know you're out there.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:10.930
Thank you.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:12.930

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.516
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
