&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.340
&gt;&gt; Johnny Tija: Very
good morning

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.560
to you all ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.960
I am Johnny Tija, I'm
represent Yayasan Sulinama,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.270
Yayasan means basically
foundation in English,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.480
it's in the NGO based in
Ambon, the province of Maluku,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.000
the eastern part of Indonesia.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.420
So, greetings from Indonesia.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.980
First of all, we'd like to say
a very sincere thank you to you,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.430
to the Library of Congress for
granting us this literacy award.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.250
It's really a very big honor for
us and also a big encouragement

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.260
for us to continue our work,
especially in this kind

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.190
of multilingual setting
in this country.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.280
And with this more
than 700 languages,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.650
about 50% are still actively
spoken even by children.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.480
And only about 10% of
the population grow

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.520
up speaking Indonesian,
their national language

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.030
as their modern tongue
or first language.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.340
Whereas, the other 90% grow up
speaking their modern tongue,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.060
which is different from
the national language.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.870
So, children grow up speaking

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.750
in their modern tongue mostly
indigenous languages or kind

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.260
of a lingual franca
and they begin

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.300
to learn speaking
the national language

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.990
when they enter formal
schooling.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.590
So, with this kind

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.020
of sociolinguistics issues
basically language becomes a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.900
barrier when they are
entering formal schooling.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.560
So, we try to -- we have
been trying to help them

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.600
with the language issue.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.130
We started about 10 years ago
doing the modern tongue basic

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.970
education program in
the modern tongue.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.480
So, we started in that
[inaudible] on the small island.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.640
And until now we've been
developing teaching materials

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.220
in the five different
modern tongues.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.570
And every year about 1,000
preschool children enjoy the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.970
education in their
home language.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.340
And for the last seven
years this impact

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.280
that we have been witnessing
that children actively engage

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.950
in the class activities.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.770
They understand the
concepts easier and faster,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.530
they're growing in
their confidence

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.450
and become more mature to
attend higher education.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.690
And also, with the teachers
they are becoming confident

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.840
in teaching, the people
are more acknowledging them

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.840
and respecting them and they
are becoming skilled in leading

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.140
and managing the class.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.590
And all the class activities
are done using the children's

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.720
modern tongue.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.900
And we've been witnessing
really that language used

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.700
as medium instruction does
matter to the children

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.360
and also to the teachers.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.780
The other thing is the teachers
need good teaching materials

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.470
in the modern tongue and
they also need training.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.700
But training alone is not
enough they still need ongoing

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.010
mentoring and coaching.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.480
And until now we've been still
doing advocacy on the importance

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.840
of basic education
and the importance

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.260
of using the modern tongue,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.030
children's modern
tongue in the education.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.990
And it's still a hard issue
actually there in Indonesia

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.250
because it's out
of the mainstream.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.840
But we're getting
more political support

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.180
from the Indonesian government
and also, I might need

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.550
to also say thank
you to the government

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.840
of Finland they've been helping
us with financial support

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.670
for six years to
do these programs.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.320
And the last thing is
children need reading materials

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.590
in their modern tongue and
also in the national language

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.430
to do some kind of [inaudible]
the national language before

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.850
or when they enter
their formal schooling.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.760
And this year we've been
developing a children's book

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.500
with the help from the USAID
and thank you for United States

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:46.660
of America's government and with
a low-cost production approach.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.980
I think that's all I
can share with you yeah.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.280
Thank you.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.710
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.270
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.710
