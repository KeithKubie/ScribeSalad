00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.780
friendship should be one of the high

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.880
points of existence and yet it's also

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.000
the most routinely disappointing thing

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.639
we have to deal with. Too often you're at

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.410
supper at someone's house, there's an

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.969
impressive spread and the hosts have

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.580
evidently gone to a lot of trouble.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.289
But the conversation is meandering and

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.930
devoid of any real interest it flits

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.640
from an overlong description of the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.890
failings of the in-flight service on a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.529
particular airline to a strangely heated

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.840
discussion about the tax code. The

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.790
intentions of the hosts are hugely

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.520
touching, but as so often we go home

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.170
wondering what on earth the whole

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.620
performance was really about. The key to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.600
the problem of friendship is to be found

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.660
in an odd sounding place: a lack of a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.149
sense of purpose. Our attempts at

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.430
friendship tend to go adrift because we

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.320
collectively resist the task of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.360
developing a clear picture of what

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.120
friendship might really be for.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.440
The problem is that we're unfairly

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.120
uncomfortable with the idea of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.730
friendship having any declared purpose,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.430
because we associate purpose with the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.619
least attractive and most cynical of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.320
motives.  Yet purpose doesn't have to ruin

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.720
friendship and in fact the more we

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.580
define what a friendship might be for

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.860
the more we can focus in on what we

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.659
should be doing with every person in our

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.880
lives, or indeed the more we can

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.979
helpfully conclude that we shouldn't be

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.240
with them at all.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.640
There are at least four things we might

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.799
be trying to do with the people we know.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.100
Firstly, networking. It's an unfairly

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.799
maligned idea. We're small, fragile

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.560
creatures in a vast world. Our individual

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.259
capacities are entirely insufficient to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.540
realize the demands of our imaginations.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.060
So of course we need collaborators,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.310
accomplices who can align their

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.380
abilities and energies with ours.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.539
This idea of friendship was given a lot

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.969
of space in classical literature.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.860
Take the Argonauts, the legendary ancient

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.110
Greek tale, which traced how a heroic

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.020
captain called Jason networked in order to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.240
assemble a band of friends to sail on

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.070
the Arkham, in search of the Golden

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.009
Fleece. Later, the same idea emerged when

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.349
Jesus networked, to put together a band of

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.239
twelve disciples with whom he could

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.489
spread one or two world-changing ideas

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.680
about forgiveness and compassion. Rather

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.780
than diminish our own efforts as we hand

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.880
out our business cards, such prestigious

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.190
examples can show how elevated an

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.530
ambitious networking friendships could

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.790
ideally be. Secondly, reassurance. The

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.190
human condition is full of terror. We're

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.470
always on the verge of disgrace, danger

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.840
and disappointment and yet, such are the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.849
rules of polite conduct that we're

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.890
permanently in danger of imagining that

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.620
we are the only ones to be as crazy as

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.200
we know we are. We badly need friends

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.060
because with the people we know only

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.620
superficially, there are few

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.500
confessions of sexual compulsion or of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.200
regret, rage and confusion. These

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.090
superficial acquaintances refuse to

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.100
admit that they, too, are going slightly

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.950
out of their minds. Yet the reassuring

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.260
true friend gives us access to a very

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.420
necessary and accurate sense of their

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.359
own humiliations and follies, insights

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.040
with which we can begin to judge

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.440
ourselves and our sad and compulsive

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.019
lives slightly more compassionately.

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.010
Thirdly, fun. Despite talk of hedonism and

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.380
immediate gratification, life gives us

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.450
constant lessons in the need to be

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.560
serious.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.660
We have to guard our dignity, avoid

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.030
looking like a fool and pass as a mature

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.000
adult. The pressure can become onerous

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.940
and in the end even dangerous. That's why

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.370
we constantly need access to people we

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.799
can trust enough to be silly with them.

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.170
They might most of the time be training

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.420
to be a neurosurgeon or advising middle

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.829
sized companies about their tax

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.500
liabilities, but when we're together we

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.560
can be therapeutically daft. We can put

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.500
on accents, share lewd fantasies or doodle

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.540
on the newspaper, adding a huge nose and

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.100
a missing front tooth to the President

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.440
or giving the fashion model distended

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.630
ears and masses of

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.660
curly hair. The fun friend solves the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.210
problem of shame around important but

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.880
unprestigious sides of ourselves.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.720
Fourthly, clarifying our minds. To a

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.970
surprising degree it's very hard to

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.739
think on our own.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.590
The mind is skittish and squeamish. As a

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.170
result, many issues lie confused within

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.840
us. We feel angry but are not sure why.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.210
Something is wrong with our job but we

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.700
can't pin it down. The thinking friend

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.430
holds us to the task. They ask gentle

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.590
but probing questions which act as a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.110
mirror that assist us with the task of

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.500
knowing ourselves. One side effect of

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.150
getting a bit more precise about what

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.710
we're trying to do with our social lives,

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.140
is that we're likely to conclude that in

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.000
many cases, we're spending time with

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.060
people for no truly identifiable good

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.940
reason. These proto friends share none of

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.920
our professional ambitions or interests,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.410
they aren't reassuring and may indeed be

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.420
secretly really very excited by the

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.700
possibility of failure. We can't be

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.890
catharticly silly around them and they

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.270
aren't the least bit interested in

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.910
furthering our or their path to self

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.370
knowledge. They are, like so many of the

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.890
people in our social lives, simply in our

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.350
orbit as a result of some unhappy

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.390
accident that we've been too sentimental

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.780
to correct. We should dare to be a little

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.120
ruthless in this area. Culling

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.070
acquaintances isn't a sign that we've

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.470
lost belief in friendship, it's evidence

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.630
that we're starting to get clearer and

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.370
therefore more demanding about what a

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.160
friendship could really be. In the best

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.350
way the price of knowing what friendship

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.840
is for may be a few more evenings at home

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.820
in our own company
