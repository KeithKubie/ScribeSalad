00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.740
- [Instructor] We are told
a restaurant owner installed

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.240
a new automated drink machine.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.230
The machine is designed to
dispense 530 milliliters

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.130
of liquid on the medium size setting.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.640
The owner suspects that the
machine may be dispensing

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.990
too much in medium drinks.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.980
They decide to take a
sample of 30 medium drinks

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.900
to see if the average amount

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.690
is significantly greater
than 500 milliliters.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.620
What are appropriate hypotheses for their

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.910
significance test?

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.100
And they actually give
us four choices here.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.303
I'll scroll down a little
bit so that you can see

00:00:35.303 --> 00:00:37.210
all of the choices.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.230
So like always, pause
this video and see if you

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.250
can have a go at it.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.970
Okay now let's do this together.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.830
So let's just remind ourselves
what a null hypothesis is

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.640
and what an alternative hypothesis is.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.730
One way to view a null hypothesis,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.350
this is the hypothesis where

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.110
things are happening as expected.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.550
Sometimes people will describe this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.810
as the no difference hypothesis.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.240
It'll often have a
statement of equality where

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.841
the population parameter

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.650
is equal to a value
where the value is what

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.610
people were kind of assuming all along.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.630
The alternative hypothesis,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.190
this is a claim where if you have evidence

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.110
to back up that claim,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.810
that would be new news.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.970
You are saying hey there's
something interesting

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.803
going on here.

00:01:19.803 --> 00:01:21.200
There is a difference.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.760
And so in this context,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.090
the no difference,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.470
we would say the null hypothesis would be,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.790
we would care about the
population parameter,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.060
and here we care about the
average amount of drink

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.130
dispensed in the medium setting.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.050
So the population parameter
there would be the mean,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.780
and that the mean would be
equal to 530 milliliters.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.660
Because that's what the drink
machine is supposed to do.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.420
And then the alternative hypothesis,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.980
this is what the owner fears,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.130
is that the mean actually
might be larger than that,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.210
larger than 530 milliliters.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.950
And so let's see which
of these choices is this?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.250
Well these first two choices
are talking about proportion,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.860
but it's really the average
amount that we're talking about.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.970
We see it up here.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.880
They decide to take a
sample of 30 medium drinks

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.700
to see if the average amount,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.940
they're not talking
about proportions here,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.600
they're talking about averages,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.080
and in this case we're
talking about estimating

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.010
the population parameter,
the population mean,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.450
for how much drink is
dispensed on that setting.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.310
And so this one is looking
like this right over here.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.920
Only these two are even
dealing with the mean.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.930
And the difference between
this one and this one

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.970
is this says the mean is
greater than 530 milliliters,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.450
and that indeed is the owner's fear.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.590
And this over here, this
alternative hypothesis,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.810
is that the, that it's
dispensing on average

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.520
less than 530 milliliters,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.810
but that's not what
the owner is afraid of.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.010
And so that's not the kind of the news

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.140
that we're trying to
find some evidence for.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.840
So I would definitely pick choice C.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.090
Let's do another example.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.580
The National Sleep Foundation recommends

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.170
that teenagers aged 14 to 17 years old

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.910
get at least eight
hours of sleep per night

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.410
for proper health and wellness.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.370
A statistics class at a
large high school suspects

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.185
that students at their school are getting

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:11.860
less than eight hours of sleep on average.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.480
To test their theory,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.300
they randomly sample 42 of these students

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.120
and ask them how many hours
of sleep they get per night.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.160
The mean from this sample,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.500
the mean from the sample,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.010
is 7.5 hours.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.610
Here's their alternative hypothesis.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.430
The average amount of sleep
students at their school get

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.520
per night is...

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.230
What is an appropriate ending

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.950
to their alternative hypothesis?

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.330
So pause this video and see
if you can think about that.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.470
So let's just first think
about a good null hypothesis.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.010
So the null hypothesis is,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.200
hey there's actually no news here,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.110
that everything is what
people were always assuming.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.490
And so the null hypothesis
here is that no,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.960
the students are getting
at least eight hours

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.140
of sleep per night.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.950
And so that would be,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.390
that remember we care about
the population of students.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.850
And so and we care about
the population of students

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.360
at the school.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.630
And so we would say
well the null hypothesis

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.510
is that the parameter for
the students at that school,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.400
the mean amount of sleep
that they're getting,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.070
is indeed greater than
or equal to eight hours.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.750
And a good clue for the
alternative hypothesis

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.380
is when you see something
like this where they say,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.210
a statistics class at a
large high school suspects,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.530
so they suspect that
things might be different

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.250
than what people have always been assuming

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.840
or actually what's good for students.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.020
And so they suspect that
students at their school

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.430
are getting less than eight
hours of sleep on average.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.510
And so they suspect that
the population parameter,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.100
the population mean, for
their school is actually

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.170
less than eight hours.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.653
And so if you wanted to write this

00:04:50.653 --> 00:04:52.030
out in words,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.890
the average amount of sleep
students at their school get

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.190
per night is less

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.660
than eight hours.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.960
Now one thing to watch out for is one,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.187
you wanna make sure you're
getting the right parameter.

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:09.120
Sometimes it's often a population mean.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.550
Sometimes it's a population proportion.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.580
But the other thing that sometimes

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.610
folks get stuck up on,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.030
but the other thing that
sometimes confuses folks is,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.410
well we are measuring,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.380
is that we are calculating a statistic

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.490
from a sample.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.400
Here we're calculating the sample mean,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.080
but that, the sample
statistics are not what

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.690
should be involved in your hypotheses.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.930
Your hypotheses are claims
about your population

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.763
that you care about,

00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:41.787
here the population is the
students at the high school.
