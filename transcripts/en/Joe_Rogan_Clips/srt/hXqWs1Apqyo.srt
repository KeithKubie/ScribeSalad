1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,451
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:04,440
I think it's like that with the anything
where you're moving your body is a unit

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,550
martial arts stuff or anything you better
as you, as you get older in particular,

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:14,190
you'd better be really aware of all
the moving parts. When you're a kid,

5
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,840
you could just fucking hit the gas.
When you hit 50 you better be,

6
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:21,570
you know you're swinging a tennis
racket or something like that.

7
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:23,830
You better be aware of your
shoulders and your knees.

8
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:26,340
He got where have all these moving parts.
How old are you?

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,290
51 51 well,
why wait for 62 I'm not waiting.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,860
What's up? Here's Tiger Tiger's
back injury or back surgeries.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,040
Oh No. He had another one. I, this
isn't like yesterday or anything,

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,420
but it's from a year or two.

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,930
Why is announced that he had undergone
anterior Lumbar interbody fusion?

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,270
Oh, that's fusing his Dick's. Many
thought. Many thought his disc, excuse me.

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,650
Hello Roy in jail.

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,980
Many thought that is competitive golf
career was over and his fourth surgery

17
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:03,981
since March of 2014 which
involved removing the l five
s one intervertebral disc

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,470
fusion material to connect the
l five and s one vertebral.

19
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,200
What?
Oh my God.

20
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,780
All those apparently recovered
quite well from the operation.

21
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:21,900
That surgery is quite rare
amongst professional golfers.

22
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:25,380
One of the PGA player
deadly heart had also had,

23
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:29,220
had a fusion in the same location
as woods fucking fusions. Rough man,

24
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:33,380
that means there's no disk
left. Right. And he won the uh,

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,520
uh, uh, the whatever
they call the Fedex Cup,

26
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,730
the last tournament of the
year, last year, tiger wanted.

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,390
And so he came back from that and
that's incredible. Oh, it is amazing.

28
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:48,860
And I was there, uh, is it
East Lake and Atlanta and uh,

29
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,980
and I do all their, uh, all
their charity stuff. Yeah.

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,520
That's the footage of him going up the
18th green. He's about to win this thing.

31
00:01:55,521 --> 00:02:00,050
And this is the,
the top 30 golfers in the,

32
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:04,010
on the PGA tour, which is the toughest
tour. There is all these people, Jazz.

33
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:06,830
And now it's a major in sport that
everybody gets some run on the field and

34
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:10,540
follow him. Right. Walk right
next to them. There's no
crowd control there. Have No,

35
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,140
I was right up there that was right
up there above this green. Uh,

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,230
cause I, I walked with him cause I
get to go inside the ropes so, and uh,

37
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,080
and I followed it. A couple
of choked. It didn't matter.

38
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:27,100
This is the one who needs right
here, the Shortland. Yup. Yeah.

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,080
They get a two shot lead
going into that and that's it.

40
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:33,860
And they won and he won the whole thing.
Yeah. And that was the comeback. You know,

41
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:37,610
that was the comeback that people said
would never happen that you would never,

42
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,410
not, especially at this level. That's a
hard tournament to win. I mean that's uh,

43
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,070
that's tough. Tufts up
tiger's back tiger's back.

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,220
I love it. The require a lot
from people. You know, if,

45
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,560
if they get some strange along
the way that guys, he's, he,

46
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:58,180
he got it rough after his whole
divorce and the sex scandal. Me,

47
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:02,650
he had it rough for long time.
People were coming after him.

48
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,920
But the thing is about those
back surgeries is a wonder
why they did the fusion.

49
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,830
Cause I think they do
articulate and discs now.

50
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,000
It seemed to be very effective
at I, you know, I think he tried,

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,340
we have to get yet,
well he had four so

52
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,750
cause people are uh, I know a few
people that are doing those. Um,

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,880
they've got those discs down.

54
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,910
They put like a titanium movable disk
basically takes the place of the disk

55
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:37,960
that's in your back. Eddie Bravo
had that done. What is it that,

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,210
you know, I play all these um, okay.

57
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Pro Ams increasing golfers performance
via via and anterial approach is that it

58
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,280
spares the large muscles of the back
that are critical to golf swing,

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,590
which potentially makes the recovery
for athletes athletes a bit easier. Huh.

60
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,320
I would imagine whoever was looking at
Tiger's back was about the best person in

61
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,480
the world to be looking at it.
So I'm sure they would have,

62
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,190
he had a pretty big budget for
it. Yeah. I mean you would want,

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,840
I mean they must've like really calculated
it. That was the best move was maybe,

64
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:18,520
um, if they put an artificial disc, you
would, he would move funny. I'm good.

65
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,030
I don't know, man. That whole
the back things were rough. One,

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,290
you ever had any back problems?

67
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,510
I don't have a lot of any kind of problems
except that little alcohol thing that

68
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:32,260
I got going that little squeaker and uh,
and,

69
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,970
but I play golf with guys in these pro
am's and most of them are, you know,

70
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,350
football,
basketball players,

71
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,090
and most of them are around my age and
most of them are in pain. You know,

72
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,130
it what? It turns out, smoking pot,
watching cartoons. Good for your knees.
