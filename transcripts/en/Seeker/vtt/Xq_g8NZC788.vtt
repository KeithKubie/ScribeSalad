00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.580
So guys, terrible
news-- turns out I

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.530
didn't win the Powerball
drawing this week.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.755
So close, yet oh, so, so, far.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.360
Hey, folks.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.540
Laci Green here with another
D News Update for you.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.360
We all know the odds
of winning the lottery

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.270
are extremely low-- like
extremely, holy crap,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.060
I've never heard a statistic
so small in my life low.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.872
Powerball reports its current
odds one in 175 million.

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:31.580
That means that you're
more likely to win

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.680
a gold medal in the Olympics,
more likely to win an Academy

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.650
Award, and more likely
to be hit by an asteroid,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.747
but that one sucks, so
let's not think about it.

00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:41.830
People who play the lottery
know the odds are low.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.280
They may not realize how low,
but we know it's not likely.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.770
And yet, more than
half the country

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.830
still plays, which is so
fascinating and bizarre to me.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.720
Why do hundreds of
millions of people

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.180
play a game they'll never
win, a game in which you

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.250
have to completely ignore
logic, reason, and rationale

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.854
to play in the first place?

00:00:59.854 --> 00:01:01.270
be something going
on here, right?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.689
Of course, there always is.

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:04.730
Let's take a look at some
of the leading studies.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.010
Robert Williams, a sociologist
who studies lotteries

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.260
at the University of Lethbridge,
says, one reason we play anyway

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.150
is the sheer brain fart
that these odds cause.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.270
One in 175 million--
our brain just

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.320
can't understand how
small that number is.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.720
It's totally abstract.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.440
But you know what
isn't abstract?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.230
Hopes and dreams, baby--
buying a nice home,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.950
lounging on a tropical
beach forever,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.650
not having to worry about
making next month's rent,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.150
paying off that
enormous health care

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.430
bill, a convenient from
loans or credit card debt,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.460
a convenient escape
from poverty.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.400
It's all very real up
here-- much more real

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.630
than some incomprehensible
statistic.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.750
These fantasies activate
areas of the brain linked

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.480
to motivation and
decision making.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.800
And weighed against your
hope, a dollar or two

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.070
doesn't seem like much.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.236
And shoot, a glitter
of hope sure is fun.

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:53.610
A new study published in the
Journal of Consumer Research

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.600
also found that fantasies
about specific material items,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.272
like a car or a yacht, actually
break down our self control.

00:02:00.272 --> 00:02:02.230
In the study, those who
bought a lottery ticket

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.260
with a specific item
in mind expressed

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.040
a greater affinity for
small, quick rewards

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.470
rather than bigger
but delayed rewards.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.220
This break in self
control leads someone

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.200
who buys one lottery
ticket to buy more of them.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.300
Another study at
Carnegie Mellon found

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.380
that feeling uncertain--
for instance, about

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.690
whether or not you
could be the lucky one--

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.240
cues the brain to
seek resolution.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.580
That little voice
asking what could be,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.590
what might have been
sometimes results

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.160
in what scientists
call magical thinking,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.060
superstitious, the belief that
I personally am above the odds.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.530
Magical thinking means the
brain finds an answer that

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.329
isn't grounded in reality,
but it feels good, anyway.

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.370
When you think about it,
it's applicable to a lot

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.620
of things, not just the lottery.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.470
Pair these factors up with
all that sneaky but aggressive

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.300
marketing prompting
those fantasies,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.395
instilling false
hope, egging you on,

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:55.170
and, well, you got $65 billion
being spent on lottery tickets

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.790
every year.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.290
In the comments or on Twitter
@DNews, let me know-- have you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.289
ever played the lottery?

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:00.720
What are some of
the other reasons

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.694
that we play against
all the odds?

00:03:02.694 --> 00:03:03.860
Thanks for tuning in, folks.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.040
I'll catch you next time.
