00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Prepare for the 50th anniversary of the Bond
franchise

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.270
with a new film by the director

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.500
whose most famous action scene to-date was
this.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.820
Skyfall: the overrated movie that thrilled
audiences worldwide -

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.529
only because it was way better than Quantum
of Solace.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.600
Suit up with 007, the super secret MI-6 agent
who everyone knows by his real name.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.200
"Bond."

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.190
"Mr. Bond."

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.230
"Mr. Bond."

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.260
"James Bond."

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.300
"James Bond."

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.760
In an opening so action-packed, you'll forget
to ask yourself:

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.520
Why didn't the conductor stop this train when
it's entire back carriage was ripped off?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.320
And why aren't these people scared?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.879
When Bond is abruptly killed, it'll only take
the link of one Adele song

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.310
before he anticlimactically pops up in the
most secluded corner of the globe

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.030
that conveniently has CNN in English.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.479
"Within minutes of the explosion."

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.889
But when Bond returns to the high-stakes world
of espionage, he's faced with:

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:17.109
word association,

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.119
"Bird."

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.130
"Sky."

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.020
office politics,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.069
"The prime minister's ordered an inquiry.
You'll have to appear."

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.429
art theory,

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:27.399
Judy Dench frowning

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.090
... a lot,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.090
and absurdly long landscape shots.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.100
Meet Raoul Silva, the Bond villian we've been
waiting for

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.310
... because he doesn't show up until half
way through the movie.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.310
An antagonist with a plan so complex, he
wants to get caught but makes it nearly impossible

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.169
to find him,

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:10.000
knows months ahead of time the exact place
to plant explosives during a chase he didn't

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.060
even know was going to happen,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.870
and makes Bond gay.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800
"Oh, Mr. Bond."

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.970
Discover the latest in super-secret gadgetry
like

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.970
a gun,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.580
a knife,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.670
a shot gun,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.000
an old-timey gun,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.800
dynamite,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.170
and a tracking device larger than the one
Bond used in the 60's.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.890
"Here's a nice little transmitting device.
It's fitted into the heel of your shoe."

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.720
Bond will use these tools to hunt down a terrorist
who stole a list of secret agents.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.819
"The computer drive containing the identity
of almost every NATO agent."

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.230
... which the writers stole from the plot
of Mission Impossible.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.160
A film with action so artsy, you'll strain
to watch fight scenes shot in total darkness.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.160
An ending so goofy, they just ripped it off
from Home Alone.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.380
[goofy music]

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.300
And a hero so sexually aggressive, you'll
wonder:

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.770
isn't he sort of raping that former child
prostitute?

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.710
[gunshot]

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.650
Jesus.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.600
Starring

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.840
Jason Bourne

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.490

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.910

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.819
Random Bond Girl #732

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.140
Miss Moneypenny's black?

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.780
Gollum

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.690
Santa Claus

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.440
and Sexy Voldemort.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.620
Skyfall.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.050
Wait, whatever happened to that hard drive
they were looking for?

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.670
Wasn't that the whole point of the movie?

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.450
No?

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.230
Ok.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.130

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.690
Your feet smell like popcorn.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.609
I sunk your battle ship, b*tch.

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.030
Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Haaa!

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.900
Your belly button taste like broccoli... yummy.
