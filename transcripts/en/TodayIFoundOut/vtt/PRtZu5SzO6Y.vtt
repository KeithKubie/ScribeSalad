00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:09.850
Why is a Dollar Called a "Buck"?

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.740
As with many etymologies, the exact root of
this word is difficult to say with one hundred

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.820
percent certainty.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.619
However, the leading theory is extremely plausible
and backed up by a fair bit of documented

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:22.619
evidence.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.679
Specifically, it is thought that a dollar
is called a “buck” thanks to deer.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.380
One of the earliest references of this was
in 1748, about 44 years before the first U.S.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.700
dollar was minted, where there is a reference
to the exchange rate for a cask of whiskey

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.600
traded to Native Americans being “5 bucks”,
referring to deerskins.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.840
In yet another documented reference from 1748,
Conrad Weiser, while traveling through present

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.500
day Ohio, noted in his journal that someone
had been “robbed of the value of 300 Bucks.”

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.810
At this time, a buck skin was a common medium
of exchange.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.460
There is also evidence that a “buck” didn’t
simply mean one deerskin, but may have meant

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.840
multiple skins, depending on quality.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.740
For instance, skins from deer killed in the
winter were considered superior to those killed

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.560
in the summer, due to the fur being thicker.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.460
It is thought that the highest quality skins
were generally assigned a one to one value

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.780
with one skin equaling one buck.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.910
In contrast, for lower quality skins, it might
take several of them to be valued at a single

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.910
buck.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.380
The specific value for given sets of skins
was then set at trading.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.640
In addition, when the skin was from another
animal, the number of skins required to equal

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.409
a buck varied based on the animal and the
quality of the skins.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.100
For instance, there is one documented trade
where six high quality beaver skins or twelve

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.340
high quality rabbit pelts each equaled one
buck.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.049
This use of skins as a medium of exchange
gradually died off over the next century as

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.840
more and more Europeans moved in and built
towns and cities.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.140
Once the U.S. dollar was officially introduced
after the passing of the Coinage Act of 1792,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.170
it quickly became the leading item used as
a medium of exchange, but the term “buck”

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.160
stuck around and by the mid-nineteenth century
was being used as a slang term for the dollar.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.799
While it may be tempting to think that the
“buck” in this sense is where we also

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.450
get the phrase “pass the buck”, most etymologists
don’t think the two are related.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.260
The leading theory on the origin of the phrase
“pass the buck” is thought to come from

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.829
poker, with one of the earliest known references
of the idea of literally passing a buck being

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.489
found in the 1887 work by J.W. Keller, titled
“Draw Poker”.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.299
In it, Keller states:

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.409
The ‘buck’ is any inanimate object, usually
knife or pencil, which is thrown into a jack

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.569
pot and temporarily taken by the winner of
the pot.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.000
Whenever the deal reaches the holder of the
‘buck,’ a new jack pot must be made.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.909
As to why it is then called a buck, it is
thought that may have arisen from the fact

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.329
that buck-handled knives were once common
and knives were often used as the “buck”

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.359
in this sense.

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.290
As for the figurative sense of passing the
buck, this didn’t start popping up until

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:15.089
the early twentieth century.
