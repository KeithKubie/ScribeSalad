00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.550
We're asked to
divide and simplify.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.590
And we have one
radical expression

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.350
over another radical expression.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.700
The key to simplify
this is to realize

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.850
if I have the principal root of
x over the principal root of y,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.697
this is the same thing as the
principal root of x over y.

00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:22.030
And it really just comes out
of the exponent properties.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.611
If I have two things that
I take to some power--

00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:27.110
and taking the principal root
is the same thing as taking it

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.170
to the 1/2 power-- if
I'm raising each of them

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.580
to some power and
then dividing, that's

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.370
the same thing as
dividing first and then

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.050
raising them to that power.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.844
So let's apply that over here.

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:40.260
This expression
over here is going

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.906
to be the same thing
as the principal root--

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:45.280
it's hard to write
a radical sign

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.700
that big-- the principal root
of 60x squared y over 48x.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.480
And then we can first look
at the coefficients of each

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.390
of these expressions and
try to simplify that.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.224
Both the numerator and the
denominator is divisible by 12.

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:07.706
60 divided by 12 is 5.

00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:10.850
48 divided by 12 is 4.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.776
Both the numerator and the
denominator are divisible by x.

00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:17.755
x squared divided
by x is just x.

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:19.810
x divided by x is 1.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.310
Anything we divide
the numerator by,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.080
we have to divide
the denominator by.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.680
And that's all we have left.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.860
So if we wanted
to simplify this,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.640
this is equal to the--
make a radical sign--

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.087
and then we have 5/4.

00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:43.360
And actually, we can write it
in a slightly different way,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.060
but I'll write it
this way-- 5/4.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.650
And we have nothing left in the
denominator other than that 4.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.010
And in the numerator, we
have an x and we have a y.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.817
And now we could leave
it just like that,

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.400
but we might want to take more
things out of the radical sign.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.450
And so one possibility
that you can do

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.540
is you could say that this is
really the same thing as-- this

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.320
is equal to 1/4 times 5xy, all
of that under the radical sign.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.860
And this is the same
thing as the square root

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.300
of or the principal
root of 1/4 times

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.220
the principal root of 5xy.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.890
And the square root of
1/4, if you think about it,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.360
that's just 1/2 times 1/2.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.985
Or another way you
could think about it

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:30.989
is that this right here
is the same thing as-- so

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.530
you could just say,
hey, this is 1/2.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.390
1/2 times 1/2 is 1/4.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.140
Or if you don't realize
it's 1/2, you say,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.264
hey, this is the same thing
as the square root of 1

00:02:38.264 --> 00:02:42.250
over the square root of 4,
and the square root of 1 is 1

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.520
and the principal root of 4 is
2, so you get 1/2 once again.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.110
And so if you simplify
this right here to 1/2,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.090
then the whole thing can
simplify to 1/2 times

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.280
the principal root--
I'll just write it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.937
all in orange-- times the
principal root of 5xy.

00:03:00.937 --> 00:03:02.770
And there's nothing
else that you can really

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.186
take out of the
radical sign here.

00:03:04.186 --> 00:03:06.750
Nothing else here
is a perfect square.
