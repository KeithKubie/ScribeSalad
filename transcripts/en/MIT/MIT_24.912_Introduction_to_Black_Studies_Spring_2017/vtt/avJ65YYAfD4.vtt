AUDIENCE: What language
issues are particularly

00:00:08.424 --> 00:00:13.127
poignant in today's
political climate

00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:15.412
that they might
talk about today?

00:00:15.412 --> 00:00:20.110
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, one
issue that's critical

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.710
is the right of people
to have their lives,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.710
community affairs conducted
in their own language.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.970
So for example, if
some, say, dictator

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.340
were to take over
the United States

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.290
and produce an edict saying
the official language

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.520
of the country is
Swahili and that we all

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.330
have to talk Swahili from now
on and all official documents

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.390
are in Swahili.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.930
And if you want to get
a driver's license,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.690
you have to ask for it
in Swahili and so on.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.330
I think we'd probably
object, but that's

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.050
the actual situation.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.830
For example, in Haiti,
it's not Swahili.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.249
It's French.

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:05.665
The language that
the people speak

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.110
is a different language, Creole.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.850
So that's kind of a
problem that arises there.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.050
Similar problems arise here.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.820
We have Spanish-speaking
communities.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.860
Do they have a right
to conduct their lives,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.690
to have an elementary school
teaching in the language

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.772
that the children
know and speak?

00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:28.355
Of course, they have
to be assimilated

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.070
into the general society.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.060
But these are not
incompatible goals.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.980
In fact, we know very well
that a multilingual environment

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.600
is actually stimulating.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.720
It doesn't impede.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.470
It improves performance
and understanding,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.730
and being able to
live in your own mind

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.600
certainly has that effect, too.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.302
So when I grew up--

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:56.740
not me personality, but the
communities that I was part of,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.870
the native language was Yiddish.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.090
And they spoke Yiddish,
and that was fine.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.150
And when the kids went to
school, they picked up English.
