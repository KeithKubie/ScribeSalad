00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.290
Let f be a real valued
differentiable function

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.150
on R-- the set of all real
numbers-- such that f of 1

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.850
is equal to 1.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.680
If the y-intercept of the
tangent at any point P-- which

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.900
has the coordinates x
and y-- on the curve y

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.990
equals f of x is equal to
the cube of the abscissa--

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.160
I haven't seen the word
abscissa in a while-- of P,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.420
then the value of f of
negative 3 is equal to.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.170
So let's just decode
what they're saying.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.120
So let me draw a
potential f right here.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.110
So that's our y-axis.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.080
And then, let's call
that our x-axis.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.830
And let me just draw a
simple, potential f of x.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.070
So let's say it looks
something like that.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.900
I don't know what it looks like.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.274
We don't know what
it looks like.

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:47.040
We just know it's some real
valued differentiable function

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.730
on R. So that is f of x.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.610
So what is the tangent
going to look like?

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:00.360
So let's say we have some point
here, which is x, 0 and y, 0.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.720
So it's a particular x and y.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.810
What would the tangent
there look like?

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.300
Well, it would be
a line that has

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.440
the same slope as the
function does at that point.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.710
So it would be a line.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.890
I can draw a better
version than that.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.960
It would be a line
that looks like that.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.290
This line right here
would have the equation

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.760
y is equal to mx plus
b, where m is the slope

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.220
and b is the y-intercept.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.970
Now, we know that
the slope is going

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.160
to be the same as the slope
at this point in the function.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.990
And what is the slope at
that point in the function?

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.010
Well, the slope at that
point in that function

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.440
is the derivative
of the function.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.040
So this is going to
be f prime of x, 0.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.340
So we take the derivative
of valuated x, 0.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.510
That will give us the
slope right at that point.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.620
So this is going to
be y is equal to f

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.500
prime of x, 0 times x plus b.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.780
Now, if we wanted to solve
for the y-intercept-- for b

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.120
right there-- we
just have to find out

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.539
some point that's on this line.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.770
And we know a point that's
on the line. x, 0 and y,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.540
0 is on the line.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.280
So let's substitute x, 0
and y, 0 into this equation

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.990
and then solve for b.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:29.960
So we have y, 0 is
equal to f prime

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.910
of x, 0-- that's just the
slope-- times x, 0-- we're just

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.220
substituting y, 0 and x, 0
into this equation-- plus b.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.350
So I just put x, 0 and y, 0 into
this equation to solve for b.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.460
If you solve for b, you
could just subtract this

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.330
from both sides of the equation.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.055
We get b.

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:59.690
b is equal to y, 0 minus f
prime of x, 0 times x, 0.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.760
Now, that's the
y-intercept of the tangent.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.770
They tell us the y-intercept of
the tangent at any point P x,

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.060
y on the curve y
equals f of x is

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.940
equal to the cube of
the abscissa of P.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.360
An abscissa is just a fancy
way of saying the x-coordinate.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.860
Clearly, they're
just using the word

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.320
to filter out people who don't
know the word "abscissa."

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.940
Abscissa just means
the x-coordinate.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.230
If I tell you I have the point
2 comma 3, the abscissa of this

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.320
is just 2.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.220
It's just the x-coordinate.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.670
So all this sentence is telling
us is that the y-intercept is

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.110
equal to the cube
of the x-coordinate.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.020
So the y-intercept--
it's this-- is

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.670
going to be equal to the
cube of the x-coordinate.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.090
The x-coordinate here is x, 0.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.070
So it's going to be
equal to x, 0 cubed.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.690
So for any x, 0 and y,
0 for any x, 0 and y,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.010
0 that's on the function itself,
we now get this expression.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.480
I'll do it in a new color.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.060
We get y, 0 minus f
prime of x, 0 times x,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.640
0 is equal to x, 0 to the third.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.537
Now, these are
particular x's and y's.

00:04:07.537 --> 00:04:08.870
It's just for a case of example.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.070
It applies to all of them.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.950
So we could say it applies to
all of the points on the curve.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.209
So we could say, for
any point on the curve,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.170
we get y minus f
prime of x times x

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.985
is equal to x to the third.

00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:29.530
And we know that y
is equal to f of x.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.110
Or another way of
thinking about it

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.760
is that y prime is
equal to f prime of x.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.719
So we could write this.

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:37.510
And what we're getting
here is a little bit

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.670
of a differential equation.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:46.200
We get y minus y prime times
x is equal to x to the third.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.700
Let's see.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.270
We can could divide both
sides of this equation by x.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.300
We get y over x minus y
prime is equal to x squared--

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.580
just divided everything by x.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.430
And then we can subtract
this from both sides

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.380
and then add this
to both sides--

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.140
kind of skipping a
step right there.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.390
So we get y over x-- actually,
let me write it this way.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.500
I don't want to skip steps.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.140
So let's subtract y
over x from both sides.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.480
We get negative y prime is
equal to negative y over x

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.942
plus x squared.

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.900
And then, multiply both
sides times negative 1.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.050
We get y prime is equal to
y over x minus x squared.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.160
And so a little bit of a
differential equation here.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.090
And solving any
differential equation

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.474
is really a bit of an art.

00:05:33.474 --> 00:05:34.890
And so we have to
think about it--

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.380
if we could separate the y's
from the x's-- if we could put

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.380
the y's all on this side--
then it would be pretty easy

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.724
to solve, but it's
not so obvious.

00:05:42.724 --> 00:05:44.140
And just to give
an example-- just

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.530
to inform our intuition--
if this was a simpler

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.670
version, if this was
just dy/dx-- which

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.870
is the same thing as y
prime-- if it was just

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.270
equal to y over x,
if it was just that,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.890
so if this negative x
squared term wasn't there,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.550
then this would be a separable
differential equation.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.610
You could divide both sides by
y and multiply both sides times

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.590
dx.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.740
So if you multiplied
this times dx over y

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.040
and you multiplied this times dx
over y, these would cancel out.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.000
Those would cancel out.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.070
And you would get ydy
is equal to x-- sorry.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.940
Not ydy.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.752
You'd get 1 over y.

00:06:20.752 --> 00:06:25.630
1 over y dy is equal
to 1 over x dx.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.510
You integrate both
sides of that.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.930
You would get the
natural log of y--

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.130
that's the antiderivative
of 1 over y--

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:46.830
is equal to the natural log
of x plus some constant.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.400
And we could write any constant
as plus the natural log

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.640
of some constant.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.840
It could just be any
constant over there.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.370
And then this is the same
thing as the natural log of y

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.860
is equal to the natural log
of-- when you add exponents

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.270
like this, that's essentially
what a logarithm is.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.760
It's essentially taking a
product of these two terms.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.150
This is equal to cx or
that y is equal to cx.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.730
Now, this is all just to
inform our intuition here.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.160
If this negative x
squared term wasn't here,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.070
then we would be able
solve it pretty easily.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.650
y would be equal to cx.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.490
If this term wasn't here, taking
the antiderivative of this

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.730
is pretty straightforward.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.335
It would be negative 1/3
x to the third power.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.280
Our intuition here is--
maybe some combination

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.180
of the antiderivatives
of this and this--

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.805
and you can't just
take them separately

00:07:41.805 --> 00:07:43.380
because this y is
going to have to be

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.400
equal to the antiderivative
of the whole thing.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.080
It's not just the antiderivative
of this part over here.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.740
But if this guy
wasn't here, then it

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.979
could be y is equal to cx.

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:53.020
If this guy wasn't here,
you would have something

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.450
to the third power.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.080
So just to try things out-- and
solving differential equations

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.220
is always a bit
of an art-- let's

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.999
just say that y is
equal to-- we know

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:03.540
we're going to have
to have something

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.720
to the third power in there.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.610
So let's call it Ax
to the third power.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.650
And we know we're going to
have a x power in there.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.690
Let's call it plus Bx.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.900
And then, let's call it plus C.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.190
And that's our intuition--
that somehow that this

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.687
will help you get to this
term right over here.

00:08:21.687 --> 00:08:23.770
And then, this term-- when
I take the derivative--

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.190
will help to get
that term over there.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.310
So what would be the
derivative of this?

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.900
The derivative of this--
y prime, in this case--

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.860
would be 3Ax squared plus B.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.409
And now, what would y over x
be? y over x would be equal to--

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.419
notice, I'm just
saying y prime is this.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:50.480
y over x would be Ax squared
plus B plus C over x.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.665
This differential equation
here would reduce to--

00:08:53.665 --> 00:08:55.490
and we just suspect
that this might

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.620
be a solution-- this y prime
is the same thing as this.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:05.930
So we have 3Ax squared plus
B is equal to y over x.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:11.110
It's equal to this thing
over here-- Ax squared plus B

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.063
plus C over x minus
this x squared.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.180
So what does this simplify to?

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.240
If we wanted to
solve this equation,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.034
we could combine
the x squared term.

00:09:26.034 --> 00:09:27.200
So let me write it this way.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.540
We have 3Ax squared
plus B is equal

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.400
to-- we have Ax squared
minus x squared.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.960
So that's equal to A minus 1.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.385
This is equal to A
minus 1 x squared.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.730
And then, I have
plus B plus C over x.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.780
This is what the right-hand
side simplifies to,

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.300
and this is what the
left-hand side is.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.680
In this, we have no constrain
on B. B so far can be anything.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.995
B could be anything.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.350
There's no C term over here.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.210
And actually, more
importantly, there's no 1

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.400
over x term over here.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.610
So C would have
to be equal to 0.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.940
There's no C. C is equal to 0.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.880
This term does not exist.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.570
There is no C.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.500
And then, when you
look at this, this

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.917
coefficient-- the 3A-- the
coefficient of the x squared

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:30.250
on the left-hand side has to
be equal to the coefficient

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.330
of the x squared on the
right-hand side in order

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.590
for these 2 to be equal.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.370
So we'd get 3A is
equal to A minus 1.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.020
Subtract A from both sides.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.200
2A is equal to negative 1.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.670
A is equal to negative 1/2.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.840
So our hunch paid off.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.080
We were able to figure
out A's, B's, and C's

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.620
so that this function does
satisfy our little differential

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.420
equation.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.190
And our value we got
is y is equal to-- I

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.450
keep using that green color.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.510
I don't want to.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:10.300
We get y is equal to
negative 1/2 x to the third.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.250
That's our value for A.
Plus, B could be anything.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.870
Plus Bx.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.160
So this is our value for f of x.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.850
And they gave us
some information.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.790
They told us in the problem
that f of 1 is equal to 1.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.390
We can use that information
to solve for B. f of 1

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.240
is equal to 1.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.930
So when x is equal to
1, y is equal to 1.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.160
So we get 1 is equal
to negative 1/2 times 1

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.980
plus B times 1 is just B. So
we can add 1/2 to both sides.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.240
And we get 3/2 is equal to B.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.680
So we're now able to fully
describe our function.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:02.920
Our function is y is
equal to negative 1/2

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.995
x to the third plus 3/2x.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.100
So that's our function,
but that's not

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.096
what they're asking us.

00:12:15.096 --> 00:12:16.720
They're not asking
us for the function.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.165
They're asking us for the
value of f of negative 3.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.060
f of negative 3 is equal
to negative 1/2 times

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.370
negative 3 to the third is
negative 27 plus 3/2 times

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.090
negative 3.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:37.040
So minus 9/2.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.170
This will simplify to--
well, everything's over 2.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.580
Negative 27 is positive 27.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.320
And then you have a minus 9.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.270
This is 27 over 2, 9 over 2.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.160
negative 9 over 2.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.650
So this is equal to 18 over
2, which is equal to 9.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.180
And we are done.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.090
This is equal to 9.
