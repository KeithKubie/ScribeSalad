00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.300
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.170
&gt;&gt; Michael: Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the 14th Librarian

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.050
of Congress, Doctor
Carla Hayden [applause].

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you, Michael.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.320
I don't know about you, but I am
having a great time [applause,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.240
cheering].

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.690
Welcome to the Library of
Congress National Book Festival,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.640
our premiere public event.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.370
And this is my first book
festival, officiating [applause].

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.740
And, as you can see, I am
pretty thrilled to be here.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.920
Now today is our, and it's an honor
for me to be able to say "our",

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.370
16th annual celebration
of books and reading.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.310
And, as you can see from
the beautiful art behind me

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.750
and throughout the
convention center,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.250
the theme of this year's
festival is Journeys,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.450
because books really do take us

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.660
on journeys we might not,
otherwise, ever go on.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.360
They make us think about
the world we live in,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.560
and also the one that preceded us.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.120
They are our portals
into the future.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.020
As Thomas Jefferson once said,
"I cannot live without books".

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.610
I have been a librarian my entire
career and I could not agree more.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.010
And I would take a bet that
there are a lot of people

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.810
in this room who would agree too.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:39.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.560
I would like to invite a person who
has made this festival possible.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.330
I am pleased to bring to the
stage Mister David Rubenstein

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.180
who will be interviewing our
exciting guest and author.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.650
I would dare to say
that no one cares more

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.350 position:56%
about books and literacy than David.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.520
And we cannot thank him
enough for his support

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.510
of the National Book
Festival every year.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:13.190
[ Applause ]

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.020 position:56%
And, thanks to his generosity, I am
able to announce today that the date

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.280
of next year's National
Book Festival will be

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.820
on Saturday, September 2nd.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.120
So mark your calendars [applause].

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.250
David is a wonderful and
experienced interviewer,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.690
and I know you are looking forward

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.330
to his conversation
for his special guest.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.580
I am too because I get
to sit down and listen.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.880
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Okay, thank you.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.740
So, [applause] country is very
fortunate to have a Librarian

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.930
of Congress from my
hometown of Baltimore and,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.450
[applause] for several
hundred years, we managed never

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.260
to have a female Librarian
of Congress.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.060
That's now been corrected.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.050
[ Applause, Cheering ]

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.350
And for several hundred years, we
never had a person of color serve

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.650
as Librarian of Congress.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.880
That's now been corrected
[applause, cheering].

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.950
So, Carla, everybody is
looking forward to your tenure

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.010
and congratulations on this
position and thank you very much

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.360 position:56%
for taking this position [applause].

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.590
So we have a special treat today.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.600
Somebody who is, I would say, the
most dominant person in television.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.660
What she has done is something
that nobody had done really before.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.830
Now in a profession that is
typically dominated by white males,

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.830
she has been the dominant figure.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.070 position:56%
And that is in television
production and creation and writing.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:08.170
And she has written more
top television shows

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.480
and produced more top
television shows

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.800
than anybody currently,
anybody in history.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.500
Shonda Rhimes is a person who grew
up in Chicago, went to Dartmouth,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.690
went to University of
Southern California,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.160
and then began writing
screenplays for movies.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.320
And then, ultimately, came up with
a little bit of an idea called

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.620
"Grey's Anatomy" [applause,
cheering].

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.490
And that was in 2005
and the rest is history.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.740
So, she's an extraordinary
person in other respects as well.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.580
Not only is she a dominant
figure in television now,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.470
but she's an incredible
mother to her 3 children,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.950
she's also a great philanthropist.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.570
She just came from the African
American History and Culture Museum

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.510
where she donated 10
million dollars.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:03.700
[ Applause ]

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.950
And I have the pleasure
of having her serve

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.250
on the Kennedy Center Board

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.410
of Trustees appointed
by President Obama.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.510
So it's my pleasure to
welcome Shonda Rhimes.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:20.690
[ Applause, Cheering ]

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.610
Okay, thank you.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:30.250
All right, great, thanks so much.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.550
All right, which side?

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.850
Either side?

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.150
Okay, okay, fine.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.450
So.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.750
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Hi, everybody.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.050
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Thank
you very much for coming.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.350
And let's start by asking
you an obvious question.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.220
This is a profession, the one that
you're in that has been dominated,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.280
as I said at the beginning,
by white men.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.230
So, has it been harder to do
what you've done being a woman

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.530
or being a person of color?

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.580
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: That's an
interesting question, actually.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.490
I don't know that I
know the answer to that

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.560
because I haven't been
anything but a woman

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.860
and a person of color [applause].

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.170
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Okay, all right.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.860
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: And, to me,
neither one of those things is hard

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.460
because they've always been there.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.760
That's just who I am.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.920
I don't consider them barriers or
burdens, I consider them assets.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.220
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Okay [applause].

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.990
So right now, you have
on television right now,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.950
4 series, is that correct?

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.250
Four right now?

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.190
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: This season,
4 of my series will air, yes.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.880
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, let's
see, it would be "Grey's Anatomy".

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.120
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: "Grey's
Anatomy", "How To Get Away

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.420
With Murder", [applause] --

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.720
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: -- Okay.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.400
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Those are
on, those are on this fall.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.110
In the spring, well in January,
because of maternity leave,

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.070
we're going to do "Scandal"
[applause, cheering].

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.920
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.210
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: And "The
Catch" will come on again.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.510
So, yeah.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.810
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.660
So you're doing that,
you have 3 children,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.170
you have lots of other
responsibilities.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.030
You have philanthropic
responsibilities.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.070
Have you ever thought
of cutting back

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.790
and just taking life
a little easier?

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.610
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I
think about it a lot.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.660
But I really love my job
and I love what I do.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.670
And it's working right now.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.990
Everything is working.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.630
If it wasn't working,
I wouldn't be doing it.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.900
If it didn't feel right, and
I wasn't enjoying my life,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.680
I would find some way
to cut it back.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.090
I've also, just this year, figured
out how to delegate even more.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.290
I hired a lot more staff
to do a bunch of things

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.080
that I thought had to be my job.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.420
And it turns out that there
are actual full time jobs

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.720
for other people [laughter].

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.860
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.310
So, let's talk about
your background a moment.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.750
So, you grew up in Chicago area.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.050
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.350
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And your parents,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.060
your mother was a university
administrator,

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.160 position:56%
your father was a college professor.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.460
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Flip that.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.760
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Flip,
the other way around.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.060
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: My mother's
a university professor

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.360
and my father was an administrator.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.660
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.960
And you have a fair
number of siblings?

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.260
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I'm
the youngest of 6.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.560
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Youngest of 6, okay.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.100
So it was a very happy family.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.400
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.260
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, very
often, people go into great success

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.250
in Hollywood, or in show business,
they have tortured backgrounds.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.550
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.850
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Which they
love to talk about and talk

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.110
to their psychiatrist
about them and so forth.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.380
So, but you had a loving family,
2 parents who were very nurturing

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.100
and well educated and provided
a good income for the family.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.770
So, where did you get your
motivation [laughter]?

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:28.710
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I don't know,
I mean, I don't think the idea

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.520 position:56%
that you must be damaged in order
to be creative in Hollywood is true.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.820
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.680
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I also just don't
serve [applause], I don't know,

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.230
I don't jump on the train that
being damaged is cool or hot

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.980
or interesting or, I
don't know creative --

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.760
serves a creative purpose.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.200
I'm an optimistic person.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.500
I'm happy.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.800
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.100
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I like what I do.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right, so
you grew up in the Chicago area.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.350
It's a big urban kind of area.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.650
And then you -- .

00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.950
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: -- I
grew up in the suburbs.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.250
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Suburb.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.550
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.850
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But you chose
to go to college at Dartmouth,

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.640
which is an excellent school, but
it's a little isolated compared

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.940
to Chicago, you might say.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.240
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.540
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So how did
you happen to pick Dartmouth

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.650
as the place you wanted
to go to college?

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:17.330
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I have very
overprotective parents and,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.050
when it was time to pick
colleges, I said I wanted

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:21.350
to go to school in New York.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.650
I said I wanted to go
to school in Paris.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.910
I said I wanted to go to
school in San Francisco,

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.880
L.A. And my parents said, "You're
not going to school in a big city,

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.530
like that's not happening".

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.880
And they were right, like, I was
a very naïve 16 year old girl

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.860
who would have been dead
in a week [laughter].

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.160
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.460
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I just didn't
know anything about the world.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.360 position:56%
And, when I went to look at colleges
that weren't in big cities, Hanover,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.690
New Hampshire was beautiful.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.000
And it was small, and
everybody was very welcoming.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.180
And, despite its reputation
for being very conservative,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.740
it actually turned out to be
a fairly liberal cool place.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.040
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All
right, so when you were there,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.750
you were involved in the campus
theater and you were also involved

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.140
in the student newspaper?

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.440
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah,
I wrote a little bit

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.740
for the student newspaper.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.680
Mostly I wrote, I was in
the theater department.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.570
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And did you
realize then, when you looked

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.910
at all the other people, that
you were a slightly better writer

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.210
than other people [laughter]?

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:16.730
No? You can be honest.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.240
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I've known I was
writer since I was 3 years old.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.470
And I've known I was good
at it since I was, I mean,

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.230
I could hold people with a story
since I was a very small child.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.340
That was not a thing that felt new
or surprising or like a discovery.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.640
I truly -- .

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: -- Okay.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: It was like
sitting down at a piano and learning

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.030
that you always knew how to play.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.440
That's one thing that I've
always been lucky about.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.770
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So people
who are good writers often go

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.350
into writing professionally.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.250
You went into one after
college, the advertising world.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.550
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.850
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So you
were writing scripts, I guess,

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.150
for ads or something like that?

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.500
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Mostly
I was a receptionist.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.800
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Receptionist, okay.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.100
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: [Laughter]
I mean it was the lowest,

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.400
the lowest job on the totem pole.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.700
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right, you
were thinking about being a writer.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.000
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.300
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.600
So, what propelled you
to get out of being that,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.900
and going to the University
of Southern California

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.050
to go into a fine arts school?

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.690
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I really
wanted to be a writer.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.460
My parents did not want me to
waste all of the money they'd spent

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.270
on an ivy league education.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.930
And so they really wanted
me to go to graduate school.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.950
And, you know, law school, medical
school, get a PhD in something.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.390
And I read an article on "The New
York Times" that said it was harder

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.730
to get into USC Film School than it
was to get into Harvard Law School.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.740
And so I thought, well they
can't say it's a bad thing

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.190
because it's harder to get
into than Harvard Law School.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.800
So I applied and I
got in and I went.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.100
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.400
And -- .

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.700
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: -- That was
about as much thought as I gave it.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.000
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And you didn't miss,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.340
you didn't miss not going
to law school, right?

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.110
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: No, I
did not miss it at all.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.780
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, when you
were there, you got your degree

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.400 position:56%
and then, after you got your degree,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.730
you started doing screenplays
for motion pictures.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.030
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:53.480
I wrote, you know, you starve for
a while, you work as an assistant

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.900
for a while, and then I got a job.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.590
I sold a spec script and
I got a job and I wrote,

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.370
"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.990
which was the movie starring Halle
Berry which is on HBO [applause].

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.290
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.880
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: And then,
you starve for a while longer.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.380
And I did a lot of movie
rewriting and stuff like that.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.880
And then I wrote, "Crossroads"
starring Britney Spears [applause,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.180
cheering].

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.480
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.780
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.080
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And what was that like

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.380
to work with Britney Spears?

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.680
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: You know
what, it was probably one

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.470
of the most fun experiences I've
ever had in my life because it was,

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.430
literally, somebody turned
to me one day and said,

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.230
"Do you want to write a
movie with Britney Spears?"

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:32.250
And, like, 2 days later, I was on
a plane sitting backstage at one

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.040
of her concerts talking
to her about a movie.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.190
And she was, she was 17.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.080
Like, it was, she was the biggest
pop star in the world at the time.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.440
It was fascinating.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.740
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So, did anybody say,

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.470
"Have you ever written
a screenplay before?"

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.390
Or they didn't ask you if
you've ever done it before?

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.690
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Well,
no, I mean I had.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.930
I mean I'd been writing movies, but
it was mostly just the experience

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.660
of writing something
completely different

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.960
in a completely different world.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.260
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.350
So, how did the idea for
going to television arise

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.710
when you started "Grey's Anatomy"?

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.690
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I'd
become a mother.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.850
And the thing that nobody tells
you when you become a mother is

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.530
that you're no longer allowed
to leave the house [laughter].

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.880
Really. So, literally, I went
from this life where I was going

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.210
out all the time, and hanging
out with my friends to, you know,

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.810
it's illegal to leave your baby
at home by themselves [laughter].

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.530
So I was home with my kid

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.560
and I started watching
a ton of television.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.550
And it was right at the time, like
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" was on

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.940
and "24" was on and there
were all these shows that were

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.230 position:56%
on that you could watch thousands
of episodes at a time, it felt like.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.320
So I watched an entire
season of "24" in 24 hours.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.430
And I watched, you know, an
entire season of "Buffy".

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.060
And it occurred to me that that's

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.020
where all the character
development was happening because,

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.300
after "Crossroads" --
and, plus, its heart,

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.810
I mean it really did a lot for me.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.950
I was writing a lot
of teen girl movies

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.960 position:56%
which were fun and served a purpose.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.460
But movies weren't allowing for
a lot of character development.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.670 position:56%
You know, you got to have a makeover
sequence and there'd be montage

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.140
and then they wanted
the movie to stop.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.680
I wanted to figure out how those
girls grew up, or what happened

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.200
to them later, or what the
darker parts were, always.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.780 position:56%
And those things always got cut out.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.250
And, in writing television, I
realized you could tell a story

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.550
and it could go on forever.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay, so you
started to write "Grey's Anatomy",

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.980
but how did you wind up being
the producer of it as well,

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.030
because usually writers are writers
and not producers, necessarily.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.720
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: In television,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.090
that's the other good
thing about film versus TV.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:40.640
In film, the writer has
absolutely no power I like to say.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.630
The director fires the writer.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.790
In television, the
writer fires the director.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.020
In television, the writer
is the producer always.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.320
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.620
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: There's
never a world

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.920
in which the writer
is not the producer.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.220
If you create your television show,

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.820
you are generally a producer
of your television show.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.850 position:56%
And if your agent and lawyer are
smart, you're the executive producer

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.150
of your television show [laughter].

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.450
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.790
So, when "Grey's Anatomy"
first went on,

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.030
when did you realize it
was going to be a big hit?

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.780
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I'm going to
be honest, and this is going

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.400
to sound crazy, but
probably about season 5.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.700
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Season 5.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.080
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: [Laughter]
I'm not kidding.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.380
Because I was in the
bubble of working so hard,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.030
it took a really long
time for it to sink

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.850
in that it was different
from other shows.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.790 position:56%
Or that the zeitgeist was different.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.250
We were all sort of working inside
the bubble of what the show was.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.130
It felt different around
season 3 but, until then,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.670
none of us were paying attention.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.440
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So do you have
doctors calling you all the time

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.170
saying, "Well, I have
a good idea for you

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.740
or this was inaccurate or this?"

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: We have a team of
surgeons who consult with our shows.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.250
We have doctors who
write on our staff.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.100
We have surgical nurses who
help us create our surgeries.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.980
So we have all these L.A.
doctors sort of around us,

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.770 position:56%
and doctors from all over the world.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.950
We also have people who, you
know, we talk to from like the NAH

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.100
or the CDC who are, like,
willing to help give us research.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.220
So we try really hard to
be accurate because we --

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.540
there's a study that says, like,
75 percent of the medical knowledge

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.430
that people get, they get from
television programs [laughter].

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.730
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Wow.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.030
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: And
that's a terrifying thing.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.860
Like, it feels very much
like a giant responsibility.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.160
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Well, when you meet,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.090
when you have all these doctors,
do you ever say to them, "Well,

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.090
I have a headache or I have
this, what would you recommend?"

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.780
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes, yes.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.080
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So -- .

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.540
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: -- Our doctor
writers on staff, I feel like,

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.670
are tired of treating
me and my children.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.260
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So having 1
hit on TV is a pretty big deal,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.180
but then what propelled
you to have a second show

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.450
and where'd that idea come from?

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.900
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: The second
show came from fear, really.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.150
I created "Private Practice"
because I was afraid that

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.500
"Grey's Anatomy" was
going to get cancelled

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.320
and then I wouldn't
have a job [laughter].

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.470
And really, like, the first
thing that happens to you

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.400
when you become successful
is you become terrified

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.010
that that success is
going to go away.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.690
Like it felt like this
is too good to be true.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.450
This felt like way too easy,
like something's wrong.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.750
They're fooling me somehow.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.120
I was like I have to make another
show so that I have a backup.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.420
That's really what I felt like.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.620
And so "Private Practice"
came out of that.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.650
The network wanted a spinoff, I
was like I will give them one.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.720
This'll be my job security.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.500
And so in season 3
of "Grey's Anatomy",

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.160 position:56%
very foolishly, I planned a spinoff.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.020
And I say foolishly because
I had no idea what 2 shows

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.320
at a time was going to be like.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.620
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
What was it like?

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.780
Then you're doing 2
different jobs and?

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.720
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Doing
2 shows at the same time,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.770
when I had just learned how to do
1, because I had never worked in TV

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.360
when I started "Grey's",
was like being run

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.710
over with a car twice
a day every day.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.090
I mean it was brutal.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.560
And the only thing that saved
me that first season was,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.670
and this is terrible because
everybody lost their jobs,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:48.970
was the writers went on strike.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:53.740 position:56%
So there was a giant writers' strike
and all work stopped in Hollywood.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.610
And if all work had not stopped
in Hollywood, I'm telling you,

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.960
I would be working at the Library

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.440
of Congress right now happily
shelving books somewhere.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.560
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So when I was
growing up, there was a show --

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.300
you're too young to remember this
-- called "The Dick Van Dyke Show".

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.600
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Oh, yeah.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.900
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.880 position:56%
And that was basically about
scriptwriters for a television show.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.790
And they just sat around and kind
of came up with ideas and so forth.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.090
And how does it actually work?

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.650
Do you sit around with a couple
people, come up with ideas,

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.830
or 1 person goes home and
writes it, or how does it work?

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.190
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I think
it depends on the show.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.530
I treat "Grey's" very differently
than I treat "Scandal" just

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.330
because of the kind of show it is.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.200
"Grey's", you know we sit in
a room, we talk about ideas.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.710
I am, at this point,
I am the storyteller

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.360
of that show more than
anything else.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.460
I can walk in the room
and I sit down and I say,

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.790
"Here's what happens next.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.150
Here's what the episode's about.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.810
Here's where all the
characters are."

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.110
And I have writers who've been
on that show for so long that,

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.720
then, they write the episodes.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.400
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: In other
words, you come up with the ideas

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.700
and then they kind
of fill in the -- .

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.100
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: -- I have
to say what happens next

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.570
or else nobody knows
what happens next.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.300
But they can write the
show and then I give tweaks

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.920
and rewrites and it's small.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.660
But we're in season 13.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.970
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But suppose
you don't like a particular actor

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.510
or actress, can you just
write them out pretty easily,

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.850
[laughter] does that happen or?

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:09.490
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I suppose, but
that's not really what happens.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:10.790
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.090
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I
mean, it's interesting.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.920
You fall in love with
your characters.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.470 position:56%
And I have learned really, really --

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.120
I learned really early on to not
hire people that I did not want

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.430
to spend a lot of time with.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:28.840
It's a very interesting thing and
this is rare and weird to have a --

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.160
I've never had a show that's been
on the air less than 6 seasons.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.330
That means that I've been working
with -- anybody I work with,

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.750
I work with for at least 6
seasons, that's a family.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.320
I mean that's going to
work with somebody day in,

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.400
day out intimately for
a really long time.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.460
You better like them.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.110
You know, and I think it's
interesting that, you know,

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.000
people think like, oh, you
didn't like this person.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.370
I was like, how could I not like
them, I've been with them forever.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.260
So you have to like them.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.160
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But how do
you deal with the business aspects?

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.030 position:56%
Let's suppose you like somebody, but
that person has an agent who says,

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.880
"Well, you really need
to like even more or".

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.180
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: You know,
there's, I think there's a lot

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:08.040
of reasons why people exit,
you know, or want to be done

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.820
or negotiations fail, you know
like all of those things happen.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.380
Then, you have to get creative.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.730
You know, every year, I
would ask Sandra Oh, like,

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.580
is this your year,
is this your year?

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.730
Just because she's such
a phenomenal actress

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.880
and you can feel somebody
getting a little bit restless.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.270
And I kept thinking, every year,

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.430
I can't believe I have
Sandra Oh on this show.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.440
Like one day, she's going
to say she's going to quit.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.740
Like one day.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.190
And, finally, in season
10, she said,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.880
"I think this is my final season".

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.940
So you have to figure it out, to
figure out what you're going to do

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.240
and how to exit somebody in a way

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.650
that feels right for
their character.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.750
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, let's
talk about a book you've written.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.340
This is the National Book Festival.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.640
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, you wrote
a book called, "The Year of Yes".

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.320
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.180
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And where
did that title come from?

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.480
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: My sister,
who is in here somewhere,

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.140
I don't know where she is.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.440
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right here.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.740
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: There she is.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.040
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I have this oldest
sister named Dolores who's not old,

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.130
but she's my oldest sister
[laughter] who is amazing,

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.650
but very bossy [laughter].

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.150
And one day, I think it
was Thanksgiving day,

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.600
I was listing for her
all of these reasons,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.320
all of these invitations I had, all
these fancy invitations I had to go

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.890 position:56%
to like all of these amazing places.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.540
You know, I'd been invited
here, I'd been invited there.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.550
This party, this event,
this speaking engagement.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.900
And my sister's sort of
listening and, finally, she said,

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.780
"Are you going to say 'yes'
to any of these things?"

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.080
And I said, "No, obviously".

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.170
And she [laughter] and she listened
to me give all my reasons why.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.730
I have work, I have
kids, I had things.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:43.210
And she said, "You know, you
never say 'yes' to anything".

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.730
And I was really offended.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.030
But the more I thought about it,

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.950
the more I realized she
was absolutely right.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.030
I never said yes to
any invitation I got.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.330
I never said yes to anything

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.850
that made me feel uncomfortable
or nervous.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.080
I was a fairly shy person.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.380
The idea of doing something

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.090
like this would have given
me, like, a panic attack.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.200
I mean there's so many people
in this room right now.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.500
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.110
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: And so I thought,
I'm going to give myself 1 year

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.090
where I say yes to all
the things that scare me,

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.480
not crazy things, but
the things that -- .

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.780
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: -- Okay.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.850
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Other people
do that I think are terrifying.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.450
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: The year
you're writing about is 2014.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.750
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.050
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And, in that year,

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.350
you're asked to give
the commencement address

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.650
at Dartmouth -- .

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:26.950
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: -- Yeah.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.250
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Your alma mater.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.550
So, normally, you would have said.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.850
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: No.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.150
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But
this year, [laughter].

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.450
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.750
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
That year, you said yes.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.050
And how terrifying was it
to prepare that speech?

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.350
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: It
was so terrifying

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.980
that I didn't prepare the
speech, I think, until about 7

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.150
or 8 days before I had to
go and give the speech.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.070
And I chopped it up and rewrote
it on the plane on the way there.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.120
Like I avoided it deeply,
because I was just frightened

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.690
to death about the concept of it.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.270
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So it worked out okay?

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: It did, mainly
because I realized that the only way

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.800
to do it was to just get up there
and not try to give a speech,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.840
to just tell the truth, to
tell them whatever it was

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.220
that I would have wanted to hear
when I was graduating from college.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.650
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Well,
talk about writing the book.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.740
If you're overseeing 4 TV
shows and you have 3 children

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.450 position:56%
and you have other responsibilities,
how do you have time

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.750
to actually write the book?

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.050
When did you do that?

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.580
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I
didn't have a lot of time.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.010
I wrote a lot at 5:00
in the morning.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.930
I would -- I got up early
at 5 am and I'd write from 5

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.640
to 7 before the kids got up.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.740
I tried to do that a lot.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.530 position:56%
That was actually really productive.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:37.120
But I mostly did though
was, I think,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:43.460
3 weeks before the book was due,
I went away and I wrote like mad,

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.670 position:56%
which was the best thing for me to
just sit down and get everything out

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.170
and fix and hone and make -- .

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.470
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: -- Right.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.770
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: All the
notes that I'd written perfect.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:52.070
And do all the real work.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.430
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now,
sometimes, famous people, like you,

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:58.540
have people who are
collaborators on books because,

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.130
you know, they don't have time.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.230
But if you're a writer, you
can't have a collaborator

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:03.530
because that's what you do.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.830
So you had to write
this book, right?

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.130
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah, it
wouldn't have even occurred to me.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.430
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right, okay.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.080
So it took you how long
to actually write it?

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I'm a fast writer.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.790
I don't like to say because
I don't want my publisher

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.340
to know how long it takes me
to write a book [laughter]

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.590
because then they'll expect
the books to be faster.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.890
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.190
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.060
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And, when you
write, some people write long hand,

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.790
some people use a computer,
how do you do it?

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.320
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah, I write
on my laptop with my headphones

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.320
on and that's all I need.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.620
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.000
And so then you edit it over
and over and over again?

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.390
Or how do you do that?

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.920
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I'm like a first,

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.630
second draft person
and then I'm done.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:41.930
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.380
So, when the book came out,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.630
you had to do book tours,
I guess, or did do some?

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.930
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.230
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, was
that terrifying to do that

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.530
or you didn't mind doing that?

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.370
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: That was also,
it was a really new experience

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.900
and it was a little bit of a shock

00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:00.350
to the system, just
being that public.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.850
It was also just the realization

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.110
that I had written this
very, very personal thing.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.730
And the only way I had written it
was thinking nobody was ever going

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.230
to read it.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.620 position:56%
And then, suddenly, it was in print.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.030
And I was going to go
meet a bunch of people

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.410
who had read all these
personal things about me.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.220
That was terrifying.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.700
But it actually turned
out to be wonderful

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.890
because I kept meeting people who
would tell me stories about things

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.190
that they had read in the book,

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.240
and how it had encouraged
them to do something.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.830
And, suddenly, it didn't
feel as terrifying anymore.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.130
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So I've
read the book, of course,

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.710
and I think I highly recommend it.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.250
It's a very pleasurable read.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:34.420
The problem with it is that
it's hard to put it down.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.570 position:56%
And so you need a couple hours or
so but, you know, allocate the time.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.400
It's a very good book.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.650
One of the things in there
that was very personal

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.740
that you obviously wrote
about, you said, at one point,

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.410
you lost 100 plus pounds.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:47.710
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I did.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: A hundred and
twenty seven or something like that?

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.120
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah, that
year I did, yeah [applause].

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.940
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, what's
the secret to losing 127 pounds,

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.300
for those of us who want
to lose some weight?

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.180
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: This is, I
think, this is the worst, like,

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.560
I think everybody hates this, but
the secret to it was, literally,

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.860
realizing that it sucked.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.170
And that I was never going to enjoy
it and that there was never going

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.810
to be a time that I didn't
want to eat the fried chicken.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.390
And that I was always
going to be hungry

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.130
and that there's nothing
fun about it.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.540 position:56%
I think I always expected like there
was going to be some magical moment

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.320
when I was going to
really love running

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.710
and that salads were
going to taste amazing.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:28.010
And I was going to prefer
being a vegan or something.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.700
That's never going to happen to me.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.840
Like I'm always going to
want the fried chicken,

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.780
I'm always going to
want to lay down.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.840
I'm always going to
want to eat the brownie.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.680 position:56%
And, as long as I can accept that,
then I can go, oh, it's not supposed

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.940
to be easy or fun, I don't quit.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.070
Because you know it's
supposed to be work.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.950 position:56%
And, if you want it, then you do it.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.270
And if you don't, then you don't.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.270
So, it got that simple [applause].

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.870
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.110
So, okay, so you describe
in the book that you decided

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.090
to be a single parent
and you have 3 children.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:03.530
And so, being a single parent
with 3 children is not easy.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:04.830
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: No.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.460
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And you
have your career and so forth.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.650
So you describe in the book
something very poignant

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.290
where you say one time
you're going out to an event.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:17.320
You have your gown on and one of
your children says, "Want to play?"

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.620
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.980
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: What
did that mean, want to play?

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:25.650
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah, I have this
-- she's older now, but Emmy was,

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.610
I think, 2 and I -- we used to
call her the southern waitress

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.550
because she called
everybody "Honey".

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.960
Like Honey, I need some
milk in my sippy cup.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.550
Honey, I need my diaper
changed [laughter].

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:42.470
And one day she said, I was leaving
and she said, "Mama, want to play?"

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.160
And I was going to say, "No", and
I realized that A, I was supposed

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.170
to be saying yes to
everything, and B,

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.360
she was not calling
everybody "Honey" anymore.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.660
And I had missed the moment

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.990
when she'd stopped
calling everybody "Honey".

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.970 position:56%
And I had been so busy going out the
door that, you know, running to work

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.270
and running to this
to running to that,

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.580
that like I was missing her life.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.680
And it sort of stopped me cold.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.230
And so I made a pact with myself
that, as much as possible,

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.860
and I'm not perfect at it by
any stretch of the imagination,

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.330
that whenever my kid
said, "Want to play?",

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.520
I would drop what I
was doing and play.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.610
And it sounds really beautiful
and really like I'm Mother Teresa,

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.800
[laughter] but kids only
want to play with you

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.900
for about 15 minutes before
they lose interest in you.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.200
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Right [laughter].

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.610
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: So you get to
feel amazing, and they all know

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.240
that you will give
them your attention.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.030 position:56%
But you don't have to, it's not
like you're killing your whole life.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.520
And you're thinking to yourself,
yeah, like you can do that,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.030
but I have to go to work.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.470
It works.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, in your
book, you also describe a time

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.000
when you have this very busy job,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.870
and one of your children's
teacher says,

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.840
"The children should bring
in homemade cookies".

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.290
Can you explain the difficulty

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:56.000
of making cookies while you
have all these other things?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.300
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.780
And this is, you know, the
mommy wars are something

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.490
that I think really have to go away
because there shouldn't be any.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:07.520
But it was, I will
never forget [applause].

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.280
There really shouldn't, there's no
reason why people should be at war.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.020
But I really clearly remember the
moment of sitting in that meeting

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.760
and listening to the very lovely
mother standing at the front

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.620
of the room who said, "Now,

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.170
all the bake sales are going
to happen every Friday.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.570
And, when it's your turn,

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:31.880
the desserts must be home
baked with your child."

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:37.280
And I, I just remember like an
expletive coming out of my mouth

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.850
that was very loud
and very inappropriate

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.700
for those kinds of meetings.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.880
And being furious at it, not just
for me, but for like anybody else

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.870 position:56%
who A, does not bake anything and
B, does not have time to bake stuff.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.830
Like, you know, if you're going
to work, and you don't cook

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.570
and you don't -- the idea
that like I'm now a bad person

00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:59.990
because I'm not going
to bake brownies

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.850
with my kid was really upsetting

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.180
because that was the
implied message.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.390
Now, for her, that might have been
fine and maybe she'd never thought

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.110 position:56%
of it but, for me, that suddenly
made me feel like a terrible person.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.870
And, you know, screw her for
making me feel that way [laughter].

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:19.480 position:56%
But also like the conversation
around it then goes like the mothers

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.630
who stay at home versus
the mothers who work

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.000
and it shouldn't be
that conversation.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.640
So I just kind of felt like my
brownies are always going to be

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.500
in like some cheap plastic
bag because I bought them

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.620 position:56%
at the supermarket and they're going
to come in like the paper package

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.360
and they're going to have like the
price tag on them because that's

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.830
where my brownies come from.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.420
And yours will be beautifully
home baked and they'll have

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.240
like little bows on them and I will
be jealous and want to eat them

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.040
so I will not judge you for them.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.070
But I'm not going to make them.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:53.290
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So [applause]
now that you're very well known,

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.640
obviously, in around the
country and so forth.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.180
When you get to be famous, do
you have people from high school

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.320
who call you up and say, "I knew
you were going to be famous and,

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.270
by the way, can you
contribute to this

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.320
and can you hire me
or can you do this?"

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.720
Do you get a lot of that?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.570
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: A lot of
people find you again, yeah.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.090
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
your Dartmouth classmates,

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.270
they always say they knew you
were going to be successful?

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.550
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: The beauty of
having been a very introverted nerd

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.860
who wore Coke bottle thick
glasses and spent 90 percent

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.520
of her time reading and most of
her time with her sisters is,

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.520 position:56%
most of the people who contact me
couldn't possibly have ever known me

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.820
at all [laughter].

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.120
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay, okay.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.880
So, well some people do know
you have a number of siblings

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.060
so is it awkward being, you
know, a very, very famous person

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.200
with siblings who are
presumably talented but not quite

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.940
as famous, or is that not awkward?

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.680
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: It's not
awkward for me [laughter].

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.980
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.280
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: And I don't
think it's awkward for them

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.300 position:56%
because they're not impressed by me
in any way shape or form [laughter].

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.600
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.940
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I
mean I think that's kind

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.330
of both incredibly frustrating for
me because I'm like I'm somebody.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.420
And they think, no you're
not interesting at all.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.240
But it's also wonderful
to be surrounded by people

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.360
who are not interested
in any of that stuff.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.180
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So, like your parents.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.720
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah,
my parents don't care.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.020
They love me, but they don't care.

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.510
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But they
don't say, "Well, you know,

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.830
can you do something for us?"

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.580
Or they don't do any --
they don't ask for anything?

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.880
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: No.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.180
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: No.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.480
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: God, my parents,

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.780
my parents are exactly
the same people

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.080
that they have been
our entire lives.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.380
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Do they call and say,

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.680
"Don't do this" or "Don't do that"?

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.980
And you still listen to them or?

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.280
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.580
My parents are in charge.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.880
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, now

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.770
that you have this well
established career.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.930
All right, so how do you do
what everybody wants to do

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.050
in professional careers
top what you're doing?

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.920
How can you do more
than you're doing?

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.460
What's the next vista you could
possibly accomplish or achieve?

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.960
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: You
know, it's interesting

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.470
when you become very
proficient at the thing

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.150
that you have been
working so hard at.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.340
You know, my producing partner,
Betsy Beers and I talk a lot

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.480
about the fact that, now, when
problems pop up with our shows

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.780
and we're producing things

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.160
or I'm writing something,
there's no struggle.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.130
There's no angst of like,
what are we going to do?

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.020
We know what to do now.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.530
When you become very proficient and
you start looking for other ways

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:13.060
to excite yourself, the best
way to do it is to think,

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.170 position:56%
not just what will excite me because
you've stopped looking inward.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.870
You've stopped looking at like
what's going to work for me.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.880
I start looking at like
how can I take what I know

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.540
and make stuff happen
for other people?

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.730
So part of it is making it possible
for other writers to have shows,

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.450
how to bring up the
next generation of women

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.750
of color showrunners
[applause, cheering]

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.760
or women showrunners,
in general [applause].

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.850
That's been really important.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.270
Really helping to raise
that generation

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.240
because the guys aren't doing it.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:47.520
But also what else can I do that's
interesting and exciting and going

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.820
to give something to the world

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:52.590
because there's not much else
I need to give to myself.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.050
How much stuff do you need?

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.770
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, Oprah
Winfrey has her own network,

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.380
have you ever thought of
having your own network?

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.580
I guess it's called ABC, but.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.880
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: No.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.530
I do not want my own network.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.830
Oprah has that covered.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, and you
wouldn't go into screenwriting again

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.380
for movies because television's
better for what you like?

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.770
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: No, I mean, now
I probably would be both producing

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.760
and writing whatever I
did for screenwriting.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.060
So, maybe.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.190
But there's nothing I
want to do right now.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.240
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, you live
in Los Angeles and, obviously,

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.240
a lot of people in Los Angeles
who are in the show business world

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.030
who often make a lot of money.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:29.840
They have found it difficult
to not spoil their children.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.250
In fact, wealthy people
everywhere have that dilemma.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.660
So, how do you deal with, you know,
you've obviously made some money,

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.890
how do you deal with not
spoiling your children.

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.390
How do you deal with that?

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:43.360
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I'm
working really hard at it.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.080
And it's a, it's a struggle.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.660
I think it's a struggle
no matter what

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:49.340
because your child either thinks --

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.430
like my daughter thinks
that she is being abused

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:52.950
at this point, you know.

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:55.250
She's like, what do
you mean I can't have.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.310
And I'm like, when I was your
age, I got 3 dollars for allowance

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.080
and I earned it this way.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.790
And their friends don't have to
do anything to earn any money.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.930
And their friends don't
have to do anything

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:11.130
to understand the value of money.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:14.180
And, to me, it's really important
that they understand that.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.570
It's really important that
they don't grow up thinking

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:18.170
that money is just available.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.940
Because if you don't
know how to work for it

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.920
and you don't appreciate the
value of it, who are you?

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.780
Like what [applause]
what do you have?

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.480
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So your
children are now of the age

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.080
where they are less dependent on
you, so that when they go out,

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.960
do you check out on
them everywhere they go?

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.260
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: One of them is.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.230
I have a 14 year old, a 4
year old and a 3 year old so.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.680
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But you
wouldn't let the 14 year old go

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.770
to a party with a boy
or something like that?

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:45.070
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: No, she
doesn't get to go anywhere.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.440
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Not
going to happen [laughter].

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:51.100
And, as you think of ideas for
scripts, I once mentioned to you

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.670
that maybe you could do a
script about the importance

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:54.970
of private equity people.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:56.270
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yes.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.570
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And do a
script about private equity.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:58.870
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I have been
pitched about private equity.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.170
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You haven't
-- that's not appealing, I guess,

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:01.470
you don't see any [laughter]?

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:02.770
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I'm
still thinking about it.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.850
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay,
all right [laughter].

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:08.360
So, today, you're a more public
person than you used to be.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.230
As you point out in your
book, you were pretty shy.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.530
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:14.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But now, you're
willing to go on television shows.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.510 position:56%
And how terrifying is that, and does
it take away from your being able

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:21.550
to write and oversee the
scripts and the shows?

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:24.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Part of accepting
the popularity of the shows and part

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:30.680
of accepting the reach that
the shows have internationally

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:35.720
with young women, with women of
color, was accepting the idea

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.970
that I am a brand which
was creepy to me, at first.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.050
But then, when you start
to realize that the sight

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.820
of you makes it possible
for somebody else to think

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.600 position:56%
that they can do something, it makes
it feel less terrifying for you

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.410
to stand up and say,
"This is what I do".

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.270
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So your
shows, as you mentioned,

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.620
are popular outside the
United States as well

00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:59.920
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.650
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Is
international as big a market

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.080
as U.S. for television
shows, or almost as big?

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.310
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I think our
shows are in, I want to say,

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:14.470
56 territories, 172 languages or
172 language and 56 territories,

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.890
I can't remember which
one, but it's huge.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.590
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: You go
overseas to promote them,

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.890
or you just don't do that then?

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.440
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I'm about to
actually go overseas next month.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.850
But, yeah, you do go
overseas to promote them.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.830
And we send a lot of
the actors overseas.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.390
They're very, like, Italy
stops on Mondays, I think,

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.780
for "Grey's Anatomy",
like, literally,

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.880
just stops on Mondays [laughter].

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.620
And it's exciting to hear that
the continent of Africa loves

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.920
"Scandal" [applause, cheering].

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.220
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.520
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: You know, like
it's really cool to discover

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.620 position:56%
where the shows are popular and why.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Talk about a
show, when you -- when a show is on,

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.010
let's say it's a half
hour or an hour show,

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.400
how long does it actually
take to shoot that show?

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.150
Do you do the -- take a week
or does it take 2 weeks or?

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.450
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Nine days.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:56.750
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Nine days.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.050
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Nine days.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:59.480
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And the actors
are given the script in advance,

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.850
and they memorize it, more or less.

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:05.400 position:56%
And so you do 1 or 2 takes, or more?

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.820
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Yeah, I mean I
think they probably shoot 6 pages

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.120
a day.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.420
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And do they -- ?

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.720
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: --
Five to 6 pages a day.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And if
an actor says, "You know,

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.500
I know you're a great writer, but I
think this would be a better line",

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.800
what do you say to the actor?

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.260
Do they ever come?

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.950
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Nobody
says that [laughter].

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:23.250
And I don't mean that in some -- .

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.550
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: -- They don't
ever come up with better lines?

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.180
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: That sort
of the emotional contract

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:31.120
that we have is that, here is the
script and then I'm so excited

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.360
to see however you decide
to bring it back to me,

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.070
like I can't wait to see the film.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.590
But I don't tell anybody how to act

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.460
and nobody tells us what
the writing should be.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.250
Because I feel like
that's, like it's text

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.600
and then your acting is,
it is, you know, sacred.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.720
So however you do it.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.490
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And
filming, you never film

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.160
in front of an audience, right?

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.460
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: No.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.610
Although we did make 1
comedy pilot last year

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.670
and that was actually really
fun and we might do that again.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.780
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, when you
have as much success as you have,

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.080
you obviously make some money.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.310
Do you actually get involved in
the business aspects of television

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:11.730
as well, or do you mostly
focus on the creative aspects?

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.870
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: No,
I really learned early

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:16.690
on that there was a
reason and a need

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.650
to understand the business side.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.220
You really have to
be a business person.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:23.170
And part of the thing I'm most
proud of, being a somebody

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:27.140 position:56%
who was fairly shy, was that I sat
down and learned the business parts,

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.240
the leadership parts, the
parts that weren't easy for me.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.480
Because I can sit and
write all day in a corner

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.440
and let somebody else take
care of all that other stuff,

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.910
but I worked really hard
to be a businesswoman

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:38.210
and understand that stuff.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.510
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
You know, sometimes,

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.810
writers say that they get ideas

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.110
in their dreams, or
something like that.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.410
Where do your ideas come from?

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.860
You just, from when you
read, just inspiration, how,

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.320
you obviously didn't like
the private equity idea,

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.010
but where do you get
your ideas from?

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.880
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: We probably,
if we talked long enough,

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.590
I could probably come up
with a private equity,

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:55.890
if you want to do that.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.190
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Okay, all right, well.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.510
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: But it's not
that they come from my dreams

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.640
and it's not that I can
say exactly where they come

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.330
from because they come from
everywhere or anywhere.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:08.130
And, if I knew exactly where they
came from or how to explain it,

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:12.170
then I probably would bottle it
and start giving seminars on it

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.630
and never write again or something
and make a billion dollars.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.960
I don't know where they come from.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.260
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.560
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: You just
know when they're good.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, I mentioned
earlier that you're in town in part

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:23.290
because of the African
American History

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:24.890
and Culture Museum is
opening and you are one

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:26.410
of the largest donors to it.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:33.690
So why did you [applause],
so why did you decide

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:35.040
to make that very large gift.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.600
And how important was
it to be there today?

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.660
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: It was really
important to be here today.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.530
You know, David gave a speech the
other night at the Kennedy Center

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.790 position:56%
and you used the phrase, which I
thought was really lovely, called --

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:49.160
and you called it cultural
patriotism.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.530
Donating to a museum
is cultural patriotism.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:58.690
And part of the reason why I was so
moved to donate and really wanted

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:04.190
to be a part of it was, the idea
of providing the American people

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.670
with a chance to understand
that piece

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:10.000
of history and to be part of that.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.420
To be part of that legacy
felt important to me.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:18.220
And meant -- I mean it's, you know,
it's not a small thing for me.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.380
I'm not like Bill Gates
or something.

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.970
But to be able to do that and
to say to my children and say,

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:30.530
"We helped give this to the
American people" felt important.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:36.130
And it felt like they could
then have that pride of, I mean,

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.200
from where my grandparents came
to to where my children are going

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.690
to be is unimaginable
when you really think

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.150
about where we are
in American history.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:48.420
Like that leap is unimaginable.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:53.290
And that felt like it should
be for a lot of people,

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:56.350
for a lot of children,
made possible.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:00.710
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So when
you explain [applause] so like

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.870 position:56%
in talking to your children, if you
say, "I just gave 10 million dollars

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.450
to this museum" and
they would say, "Well,

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.900
why can't I have a
little money for this

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.220
or that" they understand the
difference, right [laughter]?

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: She actually did
say, "And I can't have nicer shoes",

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.370
then we had a long conversation.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:19.150
I, literally, I said, "Now we're
going to sit down because you asked

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.770
for nicer shoes, now you get to
have a 3 hour conversation with me

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:24.900
about African American history".

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.200
Yeah.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.460
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, you're
very young to be this senior in,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.760
prominent in the television world.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.380
So, what would you like to
do over the next 10 years?

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.250
Would it be to have more
shows or to create a network

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.630
or what do you think you would like
to do 10, be 10 years from today,

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:45.960
where would you like to be?

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.410
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I think about
this a lot and I don't know that I,

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:52.540
I'm ready to say the
answer because, then,

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.960
my bosses at ABC might
have a heart attack.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.080
But I do -- while I do want to
continue to write television,

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.200
and I love it, and I do really --

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.880
I mean writing the book was a
really wonderful experience for me.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.090
I loved that so much that I
really want to do that more.

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:11.690
Part of what I want to do is
simply expand what we are able

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:16.640
to make available to what I
call the citizens of ShondaLand,

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.990
the kind of people and women
and the audience of people

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:22.640
who like to watch our shows.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.280
Who are drawn to the kind
of stories we like to tell.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:30.010
I don't think it necessarily has
to be just Thursday night in TV.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.960
I think there can be other
things that are available,

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.640
that we make available to them.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.380
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, how do
you deal with the issues of fame?

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.900
Let's suppose you want
to go to a restaurant

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.440
in Hollywood or Los Angeles.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.440
Do people come up to you for
autographs or selfies all the time?

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.310
How do you deal with not
being bothered all the time

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:48.030
because you're pretty famous?

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: In L.A., it's fine

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.810
because there's always somebody
50,000 times more famous

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:54.790
than me in Los Angeles, I mean.

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:59.860
It's when you go someplace else,
which I think is interesting.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.440
It's when you're in D.C. or when
you're in Chicago or when you're

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.300
in I don't know where else.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.510
That's the place where you most
meet people who are not used

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.150
to seeing people who they
might know who they are.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.150 position:56%
In L.A., nobody cares about anybody.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:17.490
Most of the time, I am
just excited to hear

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.310
that somebody's watching the shows.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:21.750
And which one and why.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.540
Because everybody always has 1
show that they're addicted to

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.330
and they don't watch the
other ones and they want

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.050
to tell me why they don't
watch the other ones

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:30.000
and why they watch
that particular one.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.300
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.810
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: And, if
it's a guy, he always says,

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:36.930
"I watch 'Grey's Anatomy' with my
daughter and that's how we bonded

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.620
and now she's at college
and now my heart is broken."

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.920
Every time.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.220
And it's beautiful.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.520
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: But it's
wonderful to hear all of the stories

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.370
about what people like
and why they like it.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:49.670
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And while
you've met with the President

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:51.290
and the First Lady, did
they watch your shows?

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:53.730
Did they mention that when you were
at the White House the other day?

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.030
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: [Laughter].

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:58.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: They don't want
to tell what their TV habits are?

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:00.720
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I'm not
going to say [laughter].

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.100
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.360
So, today, as you look
at this audience,

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.000
you obviously can see
people are very enamored

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.970
with what you've written and is
the greatest pleasure making other

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:16.840
people happy, is it telling
a story, is it, you know,

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.540
just showing what you can
do with your intellect,

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:23.550
what is the greatest pleasure you
now get from what you're doing?

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.440
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I think
it's telling a story

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.100
and discovering the connection.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.980
It's the idea that you write
a story and somebody comes up

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.210
and says, "I felt that too".

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.880
And not just that it
connects them to me,

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.150
the idea that like I'm not alone
in my weird thought that I had.

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.640
But that it means that
these 2 people over there,

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.940
they're not alone either.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.310
Like the 2 of them aren't alone.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.820
And those 2 people aren't alone.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:50.910
The idea that the stuff that
I write means that the things

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:55.210
that make us think that we're
all, I don't know, quirky or alone

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:58.400
or individual, things we're not
supposed to be able to think,

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.250
are thought by so many
of us and, therefore,

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.050
that makes us a community.

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:04.510
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So
you're obviously a role model

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:08.700
for many people, but let's suppose
you're a young college student

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:13.040
who wants to be a writer,
what advice would you give

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:17.330
to that college student,
male, female, white, nonwhite,

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:22.180
about how to be a writer and
work your way up the totem pole?

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.210
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: The advice
I always give is that,

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:27.350
if you're not writing every
single day, you are not allowed

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.490
to call yourself a writer.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.180
So a writer writes.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.360
So it's really hard for
me, whenever I meet anybody

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.070
and they say, "I'm a writer too".

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:37.710
And then I say, "What
have you written?"

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.780
And they don't -- they
haven't written anything.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.080
You have to be writing every day.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.870
It's a muscle that
you have to exercise

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.710
and that's how it gets
better and better and better.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.150
And you have to practice it
to be able to access the place

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.500
where the creativity comes faster.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.110
So, to me, my best piece of
advice is write every day,

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.650
whether it's good, whether it's
bad, whether you have a good day

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.990
of writing or a terrible day of
writing, write something every day.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:02.710
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So if you
could meet any great writer ever,

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.590
who would you like
to have met or meet?

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.820
If you could have dinner with
anybody, would it be Shakespeare

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:10.810
or Milton or any writer
that you actually admire?

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:12.780
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I got to have
dinner with Toni Morrison already

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:19.030
and that was pretty much it
for me [applause, cheering].

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:21.230
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So this is
National Book Festival and a lot

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:23.590
of people here want to be writers,
but a lot of people are readers.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.310
So, did you do a lot of
reading when you were younger?

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.610
And do you do a lot of reading?

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:29.320
What kind of books
do you like to read?

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.690
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I
did a ton of reading

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.050
and I probably, I read
almost anything.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:36.260
I mean, in the sense
that I just love stories.

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:39.170
I read every -- I mean I've
read every Stephen King novel

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:40.470
ever written.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:43.390
I've read every Shakespeare
play ever written.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:48.400
I used to love John Irving, I loved
Alice Walker when I was young.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.530
The best thing I think my parents
did for me was my mother used

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.590
to march down to the library
and yell at the librarian

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:57.860
because the librarian would try
to tell me that I was too young

00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.810
to take out some of these books.

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.110
And my parents had a rule that,

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:02.600
if I wanted to read the
book, I could read it.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.300
It didn't matter what it was.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.650
So I'd be like an 8 year old
kid coming up to her with

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:08.790
"The French Lieutenant's Woman"
going, "Mommy, what's a whore?"

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.360
And my mother would be like,
there's the dictionary [laughter].

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:18.720
But what was great about it was
I felt free to read anything.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.420 position:56%
And it made me hungrier and hungrier
and hungrier for more books.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.770 position:56%
I didn't feel like there were things
that were off limits or things

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:27.690
that were above my, like,
reading level or things

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:29.330
that were beneath my reading level.

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:32.080
And so I would go to the
library and, like, clear a shelf,

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.470
throw it in a bag and
take it home and read it.

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:36.900
And it was fantastic.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, as you look
back on your career, the thing --

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.070
was there a role model that you
actually had, was there somebody

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.370
that actually helped
you along the way.

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:45.530
Or was it just the matter of
writing and just keep writing.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.330
Was there one person that
really helped you get

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:48.970
to where you are now or not really?

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:51.520
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I always think
there's a lot of somebodys.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.290
You know, I think everybody
always wants to hear, like,

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.760
there was like 1 mentor, 1
role model, there were so --

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:01.280
there are many interesting
teachers, interesting people,

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.310
interesting examples
of what could be done.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.100
Mostly I think I was really
fortunate to be raised

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:14.310
by amazing parents who truly both
cleared a path, like I always say

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:15.960
like they were my personal
gladiators.

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.240
They did not allow
anybody to allow me

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.360
to believe I couldn't achieve
anything no matter what.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And do they
ever call you and say, "Well,

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.450
this show wasn't as good
as the previous one?"

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:27.900
Or "You should do" do
they ever give you any

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.450
of those constructive criticisms?

00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:31.190
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I don't know
if they call them criticisms.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:34.280
My parents are honest about what
they like and what they don't like.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.190
I don't think they'd ever say
any of the shows aren't good.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.460
But my mother will say like, "I
like this one better than this one"

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:41.460
but she would never say that she
doesn't think something is good.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.540
They're like my biggest
cheerleaders, but they're also

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.830
like they're your parents,
you know what I mean?

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:51.410
Like they're very, they're
responsible for like all

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.490
of my qualities that make me feel
competitive and the qualities

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:57.590
that make me feel proud of
myself and my confidence,

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.860
they truly believe in me.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.760
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So you
obviously must believe, somewhat,

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.110
in the American dream because
you've come from, you know,

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:09.070
modest circumstances and you've
risen up to this great success.

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:12.590
So how do you look at America as a
country where people can do things

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:15.170
and how do you deal with
the challenges we still have

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.950
and you look at all the
problems and so forth?

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:21.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: I think that there
is definitely an American dream

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:25.150
and I think the American dream is
supposed to belong to all of us.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:28.640
I don't know that it currently
always belongs to all of us

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.350
and that there are many things
that can be done to make

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:32.720
that more possible for everybody.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.370
And I think the biggest
problem is that a lot

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:37.270
of people don't believe the
American dream belongs to everyone.

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:39.600
They think it belongs
to some people.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.540
And that there's just stuff
that can be done to make

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.630
that more true for everyone.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:47.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, when you
ultimately retire, 50 years from now

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.740
or something like that,
what would you

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.530
like to look back and
see as your legacy?

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:54.530
What would you like to say,
this is what I did with my life

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:57.570
and have people say about you?

00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:59.110
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Ask me in
50 years, I have no idea.

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:00.710
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Fifty years, okay.

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:03.760
All right, well I would say
you've done a terrific job

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.710
of creating a lot of shows
that people really enjoy.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:10.860 position:56%
I highly recommend your book of
anybody that wants a very good read.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:15.510 position:56%
And I want to thank you for giving a
lot of people a lot of entertainment

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:16.910
and a lot of things to think about

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.920
and being a great role model
for a lot of Americans.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.220
Thank you very much.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.520
&gt;&gt; Shonda Rhimes: Thank you.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.320
Thank you, everybody.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.700
[ Applause ]

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.350
