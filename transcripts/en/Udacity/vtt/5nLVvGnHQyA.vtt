Alright, so if I want to do some class changing, I can right click and inspect

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.654
element. And then let's see, I can open up this container. And,

00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:15.378
[INAUDIBLE] some heading above game.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.069
Yeah there it is. So I'm going to turn restart button into game intro.

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:28.108
[SOUND] And it moved over to the left so what's, what's going on there?

00:00:28.108 --> 00:00:31.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah so the class that was there previously was

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.550
telling the CSS what rules to use. So we change

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.580
it to a different class. So now, it's using those

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.070
rules instead of the rules that Gabrielle [UNKNOWN] originally wanted.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.850
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.
