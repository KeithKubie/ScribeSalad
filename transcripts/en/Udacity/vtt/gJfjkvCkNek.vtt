00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.480
A lot of the important work on neural
networks happened in the 80's and

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.260
in the 90's but back then computers
were slow and datasets very tiny.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.050
The research didn't really find many
applications in the real world.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.480
As a result, in the first decade of
the 21st century neural networks have

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.685
completely disappeared from
the world of machine learning.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:23.890
Working on neural networks
was definitely fringe.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.910
It's only in the last few years, first
seeing speech recognition around 2009,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.900
and then in computer vision around 2012,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.770
that neural networks
made a big comeback.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.160
What changed?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.740
Lots of data and cheap and fast DBU's.

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:40.635
Today, neural networks are everywhere.

00:00:40.635 --> 00:00:43.445
So if you're doing anything with data,
analytics or

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:47.165
prediction, they're definitely something
that you want to get familiar with.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:47.925
So let's get started.
