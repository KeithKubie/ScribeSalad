00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.260
&gt;&gt;Daniel : This book gave me the biggest ah-ha
experience I had since I first came across

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.849
marginal utility which is saying a lot.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.630
I think you'll find the ideas in this book
very provocative. They're quite a, quite different

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.800
from what passes for economic wisdom out of
Washington. You know the discussions about

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:30.419
which group of irresponsible, which irresponsible
institution is going to be able to get its

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.379
money from the public trough to continuing
surviving; quite different from free markets.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.950
Maybe it's time to let the quit, let the quit,
biggest bank robbers in history quit running

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.149
institutions that they've wrecked.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.570
Please join me in welcoming John.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.570
[applause]

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.409
&gt;&gt;John D. Medaille: Thank you, Daniel.

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.489
I'd like to say how happy I am to be here
at the Google Headquarters. This is always,

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.570
it's the second time I've been here, it's
always exciting for me. I just love this place.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.100
I'd like to thank Daniel for inviting me and
y'all for coming.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.670
The, I have to say that this is a new experience
for me because when I speak I normally take

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.149
out my speech and flat-footed I give the speech.
But I, since I've come to the epicenter of

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:23.280
technology here I decided to do a PowerPoint
presentation; actually an OpenOffice IMPRESS

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670
presentation because --

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.070
[applause]

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:37.899
we don't wanna send our money to the wrong
places. But also I like to keep up with technology

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.700
at least within a 20 year window.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.320
[laughter]

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.700
But today I'm here to talk about my book,
Toward a Truly Free Market, a Distributist

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.700
Perspective.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.799
Of course first time I'm using technology
of course naturally it runs into a big problem.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.460
The machine freezes up just as we plug it
in but of course at the center of technology

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.909
we can fix those things.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.759
Well then today I'd like to talk about three
questions.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.670
The first is what is a free market?

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.870
And the second is what is distributism?

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:25.390
And finally, what can we do about our current
problems?

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.730
Now what is a free market?

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.230
There's something very surprising about this.
If you go through standard economic textbooks

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.140
you'll find that they're not actually defined.
They just sort of assume that everybody knows

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.440
what that means.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.590
There is, however, a kind of implied definition.
And that implied definition is, "A free market

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.299
is one that's free from government regulation."

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:01.420
But the odd thing about this definition is
that it's a negative definition. Alright,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.460
it doesn't really tell you what it is. It
indicates the absence of something not the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.000
presence of something.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.090
Now it does allow for function of government
and the sole function of government would

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.560
be to protect private property.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:32.659
So this indicates that if left to itself the
market will take care of itself and it needs

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.330
nothing else outside of its own internal laws.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.329
Let's test that definition.

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:48.060
Let's look at this sterling gentleman: Jay
Gould. Jay Gould was a businessman during

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:59.280
the days of the robber barons, the 19th century,
and Mr. Gould controlled all of the railroads

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:07.709
that went into New York City. And he decided
to use this control of the railroads to establish

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.459
for himself a monopoly in building supplies.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.380
And how did he do this?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.759
He refused to let his railroad carry any competitive
products.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.500
[pause]

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.710
If you were a man-manufacturer of building
supplies you couldn't put 'em on Jay Gould's

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.990
railroad which means you couldn't get 'em
to the City of New York.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:47.020
Now this ended with the imposition when Congress
im-imposed the common carrier rule on railroads.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.470
Common carrier rule means that if you offer
to carry freight you must carry all freight

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.710
on an equal basis and not discriminate against
anybody.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.410
So question: where is freedom in this case?

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.000
[pause]

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.870
Does it lie with unrestricted private property?

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.940
[pause]

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:22.720
Under that system the-the owner can say, let's
say you're a-a producer of Pennsylvania blue

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.860
stone, Jay Gould can say to you, "I will not
carry your products unless you first sell

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:39.530
them to me at a price and quantity that I
dictate."

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.250
[pause]

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.050
Or is freedom with the common carrier rule
which states that you must carry all freight

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.720
that's presented to you?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.061
From Mr. Gould's standpoint, well unrestricted
private property equals the freedom of the

00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:56.061
market.

00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:57.990
[pause]

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:05.490
But from the producers standpoint it equals
tyranny. It equals somebody else telling him

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.360
what he has to make, how much he has to make,
and what he's gonna make.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.389
[pause]

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:20.330
And for buyers and sellers in the market clearly
the common carrier rule equals market freedom

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.210
and without that common carrier rule there
is no market freedom. There's just a bunch

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.210
corporate warlords.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.210
[pause]

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:36.800
So before we can understand the free market
we have to understand freedom.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.080
And what is freedom?

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.020
It's the rule of reason. In other words, freedom
has an object. It's not license. It's not

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:52.699
just the absence of any restraint it's actually
directed toward reason.

00:06:52.699 --> 00:07:02.620
And markets are in fact made by rules. Without
rules, without limits, the invisible hand

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:13.379
of the market becomes the visible fist crushing
all opposition as in the case of Jay Gould.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:17.810
In fact all human relationships are rule bound.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.060
[pause]

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:28.930
Make an analogy to the Internet. Somebody's
not following the protocols, the whole thing

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.990
locks up. In order to have the freedom of
the Internet you have to have a set of rules.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.800
And so, or else this whole marvelous structure
falls apart.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:49.690
Think about a football game. If there's not
a regulator whom we call the referee out there

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:55.960
to throw the yellow fag-flag when somebody
grabs a face mask, nobody's gonna step on

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.080
the field; the mortality rates would simply
be too high.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.030
[pause]

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:15.510
But rules can be reasonable or oppressive
and so rules themselves need a rule.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.580
So what makes a rule reasonable?

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:29.340
Well within the economic realm, economic reason
equals justice. Justice means each person

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.330
gets what is due to them.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.950
Now there's two forms of justice.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:42.440
The first is justice in exchange, which we
call commutative or corrective justice. And

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:48.840
the second is justice in production, which
we call distributive justice.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.010
Let's deal with commutative justice.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:09:00.120
Commutative justice deals with a change of
ownership in existing things. So when you

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:07.910
buy-buy bread for money you're changing the
ownership of two already existing things.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:13.090
And justice in that case consists in equality
and exchange.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:21.900
So we presume that A and B after the exchange
have an equal amount just in different forms.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:27.210
If bread is a dollar, a loaf of bread is a
dollar is, after the exchange, the seller

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.940
has a dollar and you have the loaf of bread,
but in terms of-of wealth you both have the

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.440
same amount.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.760
[pause]

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.160
Now in a free commodity market we generally
assume that that is, that equality is expressed

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:46.410
by the price. This is also called arithmetic
ju-justice because it can in principle be

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.980
calculated.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.560
[coughs]

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:56.330
We should note, however, that market pricing
doesn't work in monopolistic, oligopolistic,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:02.470
or controlled markets. The price may not,
may not be reflective of the true value.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:07.650
Let's go to distributive justice, though.
The fist applies to the production of new

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:15.320
things; where commutative justice cannot solve
the problems of distribution.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:22.880
So when we a take a tree and make some chairs,
we've called something new into-into being;

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.580
something that wasn't there before. Alright?

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.720
[pause]

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.520
How do we distribute these new things? Who
gets them?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.860
Well the rule of justice here is based on
contribution to prod, to the production, quite

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:44.080
obviously. Those who contributed to the production
of the new chairs ought to get a fair share

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:52.080
of the new chairs. And also nobody else, people
who did not contribute to the production ought

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.780
not to have a claim on that production.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.450
[pause]

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.900
But we also have to take into account the
merit of the contribution. So some person's

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:12.070
a carpenter and another person's the janitor.
Now we evaluate those contributions differently;

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.791
that's the merit of the contribution.

00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:22.690
Think about merit of the contribution though.
Is they cannot be calculated even in principle.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.850
You have to make a judgment.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.240
[pause]

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:33.560
Now Aristotle pointed out that this judgment
on the relative merit of contributions will

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:44.860
vary from culture to culture. So how do we
value the different inputs to a product from

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.850
the product engineer, yes sir.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:55.680
&gt;&gt;male in audience #1: [inaudible]

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:05.480
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: No that's the contribution's
production. That is a contribution of production.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:13.070
Of course, you have to understand the owner
of the tree, the tree is made available only

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.320
by labor. The tree in the forest isn't very
useful to anybody, it has to be cut down,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.430
it has to be transported, etcetera.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.710
Okay.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:32.120
The, so in evaluating the various roles: engineer,
marketing, the janitor, the production line

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.810
worker, etcetera, Aristotle pointed out that
aristocratic societies will evaluate those

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:44.500
contributions one way, oligarchic societies
another-another way, demo-democratic societies

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.710
another way.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:54.830
But the point there is that you really don't
have a calculation; you have a cultural judgment.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:00.980
Alright, skip forward to our own cultural
moment: the current problem.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:06.320
We are obviously in the midst of some very
difficult times; more difficult for some of

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.010
us than for others.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:19.450
But it is worth noting that 90% of all economists
missed the coming of this disaster and those

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:27.730
who pointed out what was coming were marginalized
and ridiculed.; called "Dr. Doom" and "Cassandras."

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.610
&gt;&gt;male in audience #2: [inaudible]

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:35.460
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Oh I think it's pretty
accepted but actually 90% is a very optimistic

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:42.100
rating, because there weren't a handful of
economists and I've seen surveys of the literature

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.620
that make the 90% number, in fact, very optimistic.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.620
Okay.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:57.320
But the same was true of the last disaster
and the one before that, and the one before

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:09.216
that, and [whispering] and the one before
that, and the one before that, and the one

00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:10.216
before that.

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:15.020
The truth is if your doctor had the same track
record as your economist you'd be dead by

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:23.320
now. Something is missing in economic science.
It is an incomplete science.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:34.560
In its present state it cannot actually describe
the workings of any actual economy, hence,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:42.870
it cannot be predictive. You can't predict
a course of-of a system that you can't describe.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:49.800
And finally, it is not prescriptive; if you
cannot prescribe a rem, a remedy if you cannot

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.110
predict the course of the disease.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.110
So what is missing?

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.760
[pause]

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:05.820
From Aristotle to Adam Smith economics was
a colony of ethics. And no philosopher or

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:13.980
theologian worth his stipend was without his
political and economic commentary.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:24.510
But it was always a political economy. It
always embedded in a system of laws, of customs,

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:32.460
of political institutions, of social expectations.
And nobody ever looked at it apart from these

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.570
things.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.690
[pause]

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:44.610
But the 19th century political economists
were embarrassed by this connection with justice.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:49.540
Why? They wanted it to be a real science.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:59.780
Or as one commentator put it, "They suffered
from physics envy." Alright.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.860
[pause]

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:09.260
Real science they felt dealt only with pure
number and objective measurement. This is

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.940
empiricism typified by say the Chicago schools.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:21.890
Or else controversy, on the other side, it
dealt only with pure theory; abstract reasoning

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:29.930
from secure axioms, you know. This is the
idealism of the Austrian school.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:38.250
But whatever it must be split from politics,
culture, values, society, everything must

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:45.260
stand on its own which meant of course it
must be self-regulating.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.310
Obviously if you have no connection with the
political process or the social environment

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:55.150
of a culture or anything else, then you must
assume the market itself regulating.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.630
Alright, what are the results of that?

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:03.820
So you have the myth of the self-regulating
market, one of the prime factors in creating

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.809
this current situation.

00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:13.209
You had the divorce of justice and economics;
those were valuating questions.

00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:14.350
[pause]

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:22.069
You had the divorce of the political and economic
order and hence a loss of any real understanding

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:29.530
of both orders. You cannot understand the
political order without understanding its

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:35.520
economic base. And a description of the political
order without that economic base simply makes,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.100
doesn't describe anything.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:43.620
At the same time the economic order is always
inscribed within a political order. And again

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:51.610
you cannot understand it as something separate
and apart because it doesn't exist that way.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:18:01.450
Hence, what we had is a substitution of ideology
for real science. And that is indeed what

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.690
happens in the economic realm.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:10.800
Their disputes can never be resolved because
they have no standard of truth by which to

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.680
arbitrate between the various schools.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.260
[pause]

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.750
However, the most important thing to ask is:
does the theory work?

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:28.822
So I have a very busy chart up here. And reading
charts actually before you read any of the

00:18:28.822 --> 00:18:35.030
actual text it's good to read the, just to
get the lay of the land, the graphics.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:40.920
You'll notice up here that on this side of
the chart you see a lot of gray bands and

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:46.530
on this side of the chart is mainly white.
You see this red line, how erratic it is at

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:53.170
the beginning here and how much smoother it
is toward the end. And this blue line how

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:59.040
flat it is on the first part and then what
a steep slope it has, an exponential slope

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.740
at the end.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.670
Well, those gray bands are recessions and
depressions.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.250
[pause]

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:16.480
That red line is the change in GDP, the quarterly
change in E-GDP.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.910
And that blue line is the growth of the economy
in absolute terms.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:30.990
Notice here, this period here is a period
of pure free market ideology or as nearly

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:41.590
as pure as you can get it. And in that period
1900 to 1946 there were 12 contractions. These

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:48.300
12 contractions occurred almost every four
years; lasted 18 months; and had an average

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.010
decline in GDP approaching 7%.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:20:02.160
But since that time we've had 11 contractions,
including the current one. They occur much

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:10.350
less frequently, every 6 years. They last
almost half as long, 10 months. And the average

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.370
decline is 1.5%.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:18.800
So obviously there was something wrong with
this free market ideology. And that's why

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:33.940
people abandoned it because in this period
from 1853 to 1943 you had, we were in recession

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:44.200
or depression 40% of the time; 40%! Since
then we've been in recession even in-including

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.380
the current recession 15% of the time.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.200
So which economy would you rather live in?

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.100
Yes, sir.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:02.350
&gt;&gt;male in audience #3: [inaudible]

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.711
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Except --

00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:11.310
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.920
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Yep.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.520
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:26.550
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Except the same thing
happened in England when it was a superpower.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:31.280
As a matter of fact England's economy was
more, as it was a superpower, was more unstable

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.730
than the United States is. Yeah.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.470
So it has to be something more than the super,
although superpower status certainly affects

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.220
it, it has to be something more than a superpower
status at work.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.520
But in any case, the free market both in England
and the United States suffered from a chronic

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:54.590
failure of demand. As I said it was in recession
40%of the time, now since then it's been in

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.450
recession 15% of the time.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:02.460
Why? What stabilized the economy? The wrong
thing.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:09.760
Government became the big spender in the middle
that balanced supply and demand. Alright,

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:16.950
before the New Deal government, the federal
government budget was maybe two to 4% of GDP.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:27.400
Since the New Deal it's varied from between
18 and 42% of GDP. That's quite a change.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:33.210
So the free market ideology led to a big state
reality.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.350
[pause]

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:43.810
And not just here, everywhere. There are no
historical exceptions to this. It was true

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.230
for every state; every advanced state is stasis.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.010
[pause]

00:22:49.010 --> 00:23:00.870
Of course the question now is: will this continue?
Have we kind of played this-this-this game

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.290
out?

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.420
Well, let's talk about how we get there.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.550
Okay, here's where my computer skills get
really crude so, oh no, this starts at the

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.090
next slide, okay.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.580
The, talk about justice and economics here.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:24.770
Without distributive justice equity the economy
cannot reach equilibrium that it by itself.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.730
It needs some non-economic help.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:35.350
Now by equilibrium I mean that rough balance
between supply and demand without which people

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:39.850
will not, without-without the expectation
of equilibrium people will not bring goods

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.470
to market.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:51.440
So equilibrium depends on equity, on justice.
It's a purely practical matter. Never mind

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.320
the moral arguments; as a purely practical
matter you've got to have some degree of equity

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.680
in the economy.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:04.530
And I would argue that equity and equilibrium
are almost the same words and practically

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:05.530
the same thing.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.290
Let's see how that actually works.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:16.430
Here's where you have to cut me some slack.
My computer skills on drawing charts are little

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:17.910
bit crude, but.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.840
Okay.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.170
This line represents rising productivity which
is sort of a natural thing as technology improves

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.620
people get more skillful, etcetera, etcetera.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.720
Alright and so in our economy through most
of our history we've had rising productivity

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:41.630
and at the same time we more or less had rising
wages. As productivity improved, wages improved.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.980
Not always easily; sometimes industrial action;
sometimes a lot of social discord, but it

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:53.300
in general at the end of any 10 or 15 year
period productivity and wages came into line.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:25:04.100
Then came the year 1973; a funny thing happened.
Productivity exploded in all categories of

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.920
labor. Wages flat lined.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.660
[pause]

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:21.450
The median wage, the white male worker is
the same today as it was in 1973 and it never

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:24.630
moved up or down very much. As a matter of
fact, its 800 dollars lower today.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:29.380
What was the response to this?

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:37.210
The first response was putting more family
members to work. Men, generally men, but women

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.040
entered the labor market.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.290
In 1973 the median family was a one income
family. A couple of decades later it was a

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:48.360
two income family.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.520
Yes sir.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.840
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.160
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Yeah.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.480
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.370
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:05.300
But that's the problem of addressing the cultural
and economic issues, you see.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.690
It's not so much a matter of cause and effect,
it's a matter of things that happen that reinforced

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:18.510
each other. So a trend towards women's liberation
was also reinforced by the fact that it's

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:25.920
becoming more and more difficult to absorb
the goods and services on one income families.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.809
It really is a mistake to separate the issues.
You never get a full picture.

00:26:30.809 --> 00:26:41.200
However, since 1998 the family wage has flat
lined; the median wage.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.210
So families workin' as hard as they ever did,
but they haven't received, a pay, their pay

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:50.650
has not kept up with the increase in goods
and services.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.090
How did we absorb the output?

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.000
Consumer credit.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.970
The people with money lent it to the people,
to the mass of people, usually at interest

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:09.540
rates of somewhere around 30%, to absorb the
excess goods and services.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:17.040
This also led to the investor's dilemma. The
worker gets too little therefore the consumer

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:25.620
markets are undersupplied. The investor gets
too much; that is capital markets are oversupplied.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:30.920
But this is contradictory because when you
narrow the consumer market you also narrow

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:35.930
true investment opportunities which depend
on the number of solvent consumers in the

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:36.980
market.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.630
So what happened?

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:46.580
The investor turns to speculative instruments.
These are the CDO's, the MBS's, the CD's,

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:53.050
the synthetic CDO's, CDO's cubed, that sort
of thing. Which were pure finance instruments.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:58.730
They didn't actually aid production which
is what finance is supposed to do.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:04.320
So the investor got all that he wanted only
to find that that's not what he wanted at

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.440
all.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:13.570
So I think here we have the conundrum of capitalism
expressed by G. K. Chesterton:

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.040
"Capitalism is contradictory as soon as it
is complete because it is dealing with the

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:24.500
mass of men in two opposite ways at once.
When most men are wage earners, it is more

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:31.450
and more difficult for most men to be customers.
For the capitalist is always trying to cut

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:37.820
down what his servant demands, and in doing
so he is cutting down what his customer can

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:46.970
spend. . . . He is wanting the same man to
be rich and poor at the same time."

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:51.010
So what is distributism?

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:57.440
Distributism is theory of the political economy
which deals with the crucial role of distributive

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:03.770
justice which is precisely the kind of justice
that the political economists, that the new

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:11.480
economists cut out of economics when they
invented their new science of economics.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:19.179
Why? Because it can't be calculated. It can
only be judged. You can make a reasonable

00:29:19.179 --> 00:29:25.000
judgment, but you can't make a calculation.
In their minds that meant it wasn't a science.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
[pause]

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.440
So the distributivist, that's the only thing
that can make it scientific.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:39.000
So it is a political economy. It assumes a
political framework and takes that political

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.780
social framework into account.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:51.220
And as a political economy it measures success
of the economy by the support it gives to

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:57.090
families, communities, small business, small
farmers, etcetera.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:58.220
[pause]

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:04.940
GDP or GNP is an insufficient measurement
of the economy. As a matter of fact, it's

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.900
deceptive because it may actually be a measure
of decline.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:19.920
Take this example: society is collapsing;
leading to an increase in crime which means

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:30.490
we build more prisons. Prisons show up as
an increase in GDP, but it, is it really an

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.690
increase or is just an increase in costs?

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.929
[pause]

00:30:35.929 --> 00:30:47.861
GDP treats negative expenditures as additions
to productivity. Alright, we have to deal

00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:49.850
here with equity in two kinds.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:56.250
Equity in rewards, the pay, and even under
standard economic theory, for the theory to

00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:03.340
work rewards or returns to labor and capital
have to be normalized to each other. That

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:11.211
is neither by working nor by investing could
you earn very much more than one or the other.

00:31:11.211 --> 00:31:15.580
They're sort of normalized to each other.
They're within a reasonable range.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.510
As I say, that's a requirement of standard
theory.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:31.809
There's also equity in property. And by property
we mean land or tools or skills; these are

00:31:31.809 --> 00:31:34.630
all acquired as a property.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:42.590
Now equity in property is very interesting.
Large concentrations of property distort the

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:52.780
market. You get monopolies, oligarchies, cartels.
They also distort the political process. You

00:31:52.780 --> 00:32:01.640
get subsidies, tax breaks, bailouts, privileges.
And they are economically inefficient.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.020
It's very funny Hayek, Friedrich Hayek has
this wonderful critique of socialism. And

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:13.910
he said point by point socialism doesn't work.
But if you look internal to a large multi-divisional

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:22.590
corporation you'll find that Hayek's critiques
apply point by point internal to the corporation.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.850
The major real is, but many reasons but the
major reason I'll point out here is because

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:32.880
you have a large group selling to each other;
one division selling to each other; each division

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:39.340
using corporate services; there's no market.
There's no way to price them.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.340
Yes, sir.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.050
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4: [inaudible]

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.550
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:54.050
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:32:54.050 --> 00:33:02.640
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: I don't know because I
really don't know enough one about the-the

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:11.049
advertising market which is really what Google
is in. And two I-I think we're a little bit

00:33:11.049 --> 00:33:18.640
early in the stage of the computer market
to understand how this is gonna play out.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.160
It's definitely a special case, but I mean
it's a good question. I don't have the right

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160
answer to it.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.450
But I would also say that these things are
they're economically inefficient, but they're

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:35.460
very politically efficient. That is they learn
how to control governments; they learn how

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:41.160
to externalize costs; they learn how to get
subsidies.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:47.510
But they also violate the vast number of firms
hypothesis and the standard theory every commodity

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:53.410
has to be for it to work. Every commodity
is supplied by a vast number of firms such

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:58.760
that no firm has any pricing power in the
market. They're all price takers rather than

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.059
price makers. That's not true when ownership's
concentrated.

00:34:03.059 --> 00:34:08.940
And they displace small businesses. Wal-Mart
moved into a committee, community, all the

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:17.450
small shops close; so there's less opportunity
for people to become their own, their own

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.170
masters as it were.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.700
Alright. Well distributed property then.

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:27.610
Property distributes economic freedom.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:28.940
[pause]

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:35.570
And a person with their own property: land,
tools, skills is always in a much better bargaining

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:40.530
position and always has the option of going
out on his own.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:46.980
Distributes political power. I mean it's,
I think it's useless to talk about democracy

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.139
when all the money's in one place.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:57.740
Having spent my youth, my misspent youth as
a politician and been elected to office five

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:03.470
times, I understand the relationship between
money and politics.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:10.210
It improves the wage because when people,
the wage is a bar, a negotiation. People who

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:17.760
have alternatives are in a better position
to negotiate; it's economically efficient.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:24.800
It fulfills the vast number of firms hypothesis
and it requires less government. When there's

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:30.520
a better distribution of rewards, when people
are more self-reliant, they are less dependent

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.520
upon the state.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.520
Yes, sir.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.890
&gt;&gt;male in audience #5: [inaudible]

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.100
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Ah, actually --

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.670
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:47.030
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: That's an excellent question,
the, and would you hold 'till the end because

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:52.330
I have an example of just that; that addresses
that. Excellent question, though.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:56.859
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:35:56.859 --> 00:36:01.240
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Okay.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:07.480
People are more self-sufficient therefore
they're less dependent upon the government.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:15.180
Now as soon as you talk about a better distribution
of property the first things that pops into

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:21.100
a lot of minds: SOCIALISM! [chuckles] Love,
there you go.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.080
There's a fear of taking property from some
and giving it to others. But let me suggest,

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:34.290
I mean and indeed there are extreme cases
where that's necessary.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.660
Let's not be shy about this.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:42.210
Just take one example: Taiwan's Land to the
Tiller Program, where they took the land from

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:52.270
20 families and gave it to nearly half a million
families. And that led to such an expansion

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:57.570
of agriculture because it turns out people
work their own land better than they work

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:03.020
the master's land. That's just the way it
is.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:10.060
That was the basis of that island's remarkable
movement from a feudal backwater to an industrial

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.990
powerhouse in just one generation.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:17.640
Same thing with, by the way generally true
among the so-called Asian Tigers.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.450
Here's another extreme case that worked the
opposite.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:26.990
The TARP program. I mean these companies were
bankrupt and instead of buying them up and

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:33.350
distributing them to regional banks we gave
them a lot of money. We did the opposite.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:40.800
The five biggest banks before this crash are
now even bigger. So --

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.680
[pause]

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:52.860
it-it turns out I think that distributing
property is not, mostly not about what government

00:37:52.860 --> 00:38:03.320
does, but what about what it should stop doing.
Because government it turns out is the biggest

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:08.540
factor in property accumulation.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:15.420
I mean there're some forms of property accumulation
which would not even be possible without a

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:21.859
legal forum and a government to support it
such as the limited liability corporation.

00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:28.650
Now all of this may sound good to you, may
sound bad, doesn't matter.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:32.780
When people are talking abstract principles
of economics or anything else dealing with

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:41.700
humans be very, very careful. Believe only
what you can see on the ground and working.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.369
Whop.

00:38:45.369 --> 00:38:49.050
[pause]

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:58.540
How do we get there?

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.480
[pause]

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.480
Okay.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.160
So let me talk about some real live examples.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:10.720
First is the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation
of Spain. And this is a 50 year old, 60 year

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:22.510
old collection of cooperatives. There are
80,000 worker-owners and they do 25 billion

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:33.450
per annum in sales. And they do everything
from hunting, smooth bore hunting pieces to

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:45.119
electronic factories built to order. They
do finance; they do retail, mass retail; sixty

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.720
year history.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.340
What-what's interesting about Mondragon is
that from its own resources they built a school

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:59.120
system, training institutes, a social safety
network, R &amp; D facilities, even their own

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.600
university all without government help.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:15.100
Oddly enough, it's the nearest thing to a
working libertarian system that we have in

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.940
captivity.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.770
[pause]

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.310
Another example.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.609
Believe what you can see.

00:40:23.609 --> 00:40:29.800
This is in Emilia Romagna which is the area
around Bologna in Spain. And they have a 125

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:36.990
year history of worker cooperatives. And in
fact 35 to 40% of their GDP comes from worker

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.990
cooperatives.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:43.310
They also have a different model from Mondragon.
Mondragon is, looks, its organization chart

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.680
would like a typical corporation.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.880
But in Emilia Romagna they have a networked
organization. As a matter of fact, I think

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.700
it's more kinda like a, it's more, something
more in tune with those who work with the

00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:05.080
Internet would-would understand because when
they cooperate on big jobs they joined temporary

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.730
alliances among these, all of these small
companies to work on big jobs; arbitrarily

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.920
big jobs.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.570
And when that job, that order is over, then
they form different alliances to do different

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.340
things.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:26.070
So it's interesting that the average wage
in Emilia Romagna is twice the average in

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:36.580
Italy. And they have, their standard of living
is among the highest in Europe.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.820
Ok, believe what you can see.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:47.270
And I think historically distributism goes
from success to success while capitalism goes

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:51.160
from bailout to bailout.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:57.750
Alright, there's other examples: ESOP's, Cooperatives,
Mutual banks, insurance companies, could do

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:01.300
this one all day.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.300
[pause]

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.840
There we go.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:10.710
Alright, so that brings me to the book and
my publisher said I had to push the book.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:16.859
Let me summarize some things.

00:42:16.859 --> 00:42:19.070
[pause]

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:23.400
Man is both an individual and a social being.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:29.500
Current economic theories treat him either
as a pure individual in which we get certain

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:35.770
forms of libertarianism not all of them, or
as a pure social entity which we get socialism

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:38.350
and communism.

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:45.240
Both are incorrect because they start with
an incorrect understanding of man. Human freedom

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.680
is both personal and social, okay.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.220
[pause]

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:59.270
Market freedom then provides the material
base for both personal and social freedom.

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:03.280
In other words this market freedom is not
just an abstract entity it has a practical

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:12.050
purpose. We want it for a reason. And it has
both social and individual aspects. Okay?

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:17.310
That's why merely taking an individual aspect
like Jay Gould's free use of his railroad

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:20.160
is not sufficient to supply a free market.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.820
[pause]

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:32.380
Material freedom is routed in distributed
property of some kind or another.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:40.880
Political freedom works best with free, self-reliant
people in strong communities. And these strong

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.900
communities must have a strong economic base.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:52.440
Material and political freedom are necessary
for market freedom.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.960
[pause]

00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:06.520
In the end, I think the task is to make political
economy accessible to a wide audience and

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.740
that's why I wrote this book.

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:12.119
My first book was a textbook; did very well;
I was very proud of it; got very nice academic

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:13.119
reviews, okay.

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:23.030
But let's say textbook, textbooks tend to
be assigned reading.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:28.071
The, but I did want to write something that
was accessible to the general public, because

00:44:28.071 --> 00:44:34.090
I think without some knowledge of political
economy there's no way out of our current

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.119
problems.

00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:40.430
And I wanted to apply it to our present problems.
I wanted to apply it to the questions involving

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:49.480
taxes or trade or deficits or that health
care since we've just had such a wonderful

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.920
two-year fact free debate.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.690
[laughter]

00:44:55.690 --> 00:45:00.850
And I wanted to do this without the normal
economic jargon that I think puts people off.

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:02.160
[chuckles]

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.410
I talked to somebody yesterday. She said,
"You know reading economics" reminded her

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:16.130
of reading Sartre's Nausea. And Sartre's Nausea
and everything, so everything the protagonist

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:21.540
touched it kind of just melted away and it-it
the whole feeling made him nauseous and she

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.580
said, "Well, reading economics everything
is mushy in that same way," and it just made

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.580
her nauseous.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:34.310
So I'm hoping to write a book that overcomes
economic nausea.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.810
[pause]

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:43.700
Okay, let me suggest something. There are
no solutions to our current problems under

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:49.060
the current institutional arrangements. I
think we've played this string out.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:59.359
We have 15 million unemployed by the most
optimistic estimates, the U3 estimate. We

00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:07.250
have 200,000 new workers that come on stream
each month. There is no combination of industries

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:15.940
that can conceivably grow under current institutional
arrangements to absorb that workforce.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.290
[pause]

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:26.960
Reform is mandatory; collapse is optional.
We will either have collapse and then reform

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:31.650
or we will have reform and avoid collapse.

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:39.100
So the two options for reform: dictatorship
is always one 'cause there's always somebody

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:43.420
with all the answers or whether he has all
the answers or not he managed to get all the

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:51.711
armies; so, which is in the world that often
equates to having all the answers.

00:46:51.711 --> 00:46:57.990
But I think the other option is property;
a better understanding of property; by the

00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.990
way, a discussion that's almost disappeared
from the textbooks.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.990
And, that's all I have.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:03.570
I thank you all for coming.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:04.570
[applause]

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:05.570
Yes sir.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:14.310
&gt;&gt;male in audience #6: Going back to, going
back to my original question before which

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:23.580
how do you handle the case of things that
can only either be manufactured at scale or

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.020
for things or for just generally non-commodity
items?

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.890
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Oh yeah.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:32.630
Well I think that's the-the beauty of the
thing is that there's not one form of ownership;

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:38.180
there's not one form of organization. And
it can be scales any size. That was my point

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.921
in the Mondragon example.

00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:50.280
If you had, it was an American corporation
that would be around 125th, 150th largest

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:55.870
in the United States. So I mean it's scalable
to any arbitrary size.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.609
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So I mean is this more
just encouraging the idea of employee-owned

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:01.490
cooperatives of, in any particular business?

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:08.720
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: I, yeah. Now remember
that's one of the, that's one of the options.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.119
That's one of the options.

00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:17.450
The, a lot of tech companies, and I think
this may be true of Google they-they gave

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:23.540
employees a wonderful sense of ownership through
stock options and through various management

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:31.020
techniques so people really felt that they
owned the space they were working in.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:37.599
The, I've noted, by the way, that there's
a company in Seattle that used to do that,

00:48:37.599 --> 00:48:43.030
the company will remain nameless. But now
I think they've outsourced so much of their

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:48.920
work like the mailroom they went, they sent
to SEM and the printing shop they sent to

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:56.980
Xerox and the-the food service they sent to
some company and now they mostly hire temps.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:04.690
And I think, I think it shows up in their
products. But what do I know? Except for that,

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:13.150
except for that my computer from that company
froze up this morning just when I needed it.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.349
[chuckles]

00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:15.550
[laughter]

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.370
&gt;&gt;male in audience #6: This other question
 --

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:19.660
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Yeah.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.580
&gt;&gt;male in audience: what happens if in the
same market --

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.880
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.920
&gt;&gt;male in audience: or the same society distibu-distributive
portion and current capitalists --

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.920
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.651
&gt;&gt;male in audience: are entities? Wouldn't
that be but, how do they coexist? Because

00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:36.230
the two examples you gave are from Europe
 --

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:37.240
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.030
&gt;&gt;male in audience: different social, different-different
heritage, I would say.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:41.030
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Yes, yes.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:45.370
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I would give for example.
I used to have a life insurance policy with

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:46.370
a mutual life insurance --

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:47.370
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:48.370
&gt;&gt;male in audience: and they decided that
it's not good for them any longer.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.370
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:50.370
&gt;&gt;male in audience: so they gave me --

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.370
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Big mutual --

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.370
&gt;&gt;male in audience: 1800 dollars and we said
back now they're converting the mutual life

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:57.859
insurance into a stock company and it's no
longer mutual.

00:49:57.859 --> 00:50:00.460
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:07.320
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So you, how would you
protect, suppose this is actually better,

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:16.030
the new form is better. But it has to, you
can't switch everything at once. There'll

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.030
be a time when it will be --

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:18.030
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Yes, yes.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.030
&gt;&gt;male in audience: two systems in-in-in the
same society. What will happen then?

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:20.030
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Yeah.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:23.750
Well I mean are you, you've shown me examples
in Europe, but I could have cited examples

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:25.290
in the United States.

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:30.540
One very good book or that I would recommend
is Jack Stack's A Stake in the Outcome about

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:36.380
Springfield Remanufacturing Company. And that's
just a superb, those who are interested in

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:44.470
the management questions, because this enlightens
management as well are advised to read that

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:45.470
book.

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:54.950
The problem you-you raised here of demutualization
depends on the legal framework because in

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:59.369
a mutual the policy holders are supposed to
be the owners, the policy holders are supposed

00:50:59.369 --> 00:51:05.500
to be the owners. However, again whether they
have any real power depends on the charter

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.000
and the legal framework involved.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.490
So, but there's still lots of good mutual
insurance companies like Northwest Mutual

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:17.980
Life, for example, which has always been a
mutual company.

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:24.910
I think Mutual of Omaha is another and they're
very successful.

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:25.910
Yeah.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:33.119
So as far as coexisting, they do coexist.
But I think the law right now and the big

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:42.280
canons of the law are on one side. However,
that's gonna change because everything's gonna

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:48.250
change. The question how much influence and
in what direction will you affect the change?

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:49.250
[pause]

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:51.910
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Okay. I have a follow
up question --

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:53.260
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Yes, sir.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.510
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I'm interested in human
nature. There are some systems that are very

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:57.510
nice --

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:58.510
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:59.510
&gt;&gt;male in audience: in theory but we fail
 --

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:00.510
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Absolutely.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:02.010
&gt;&gt;male in audience: --because it negates human
nature.

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:03.010
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Absolutely.

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.210
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Communism for example.

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:05.210
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Pardon.

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:06.210
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Comminism.

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:07.980
&gt;&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Yes. Or capitalism.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.710
&gt;&gt;male in audience: That's another. I will
give, stick with communism.

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:14.089
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Okay. Your choice. [laughs]

00:52:14.089 --> 00:52:15.089
[laughter]

00:52:15.089 --> 00:52:20.640
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Now suppose you, suppose,
one of the things with-with-with hopefully

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:27.460
good capitalism is if you have very good idea
and you happen to have a good lawyer on your

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:33.520
side, you may become very successful because
you really have the best idea, you have technology,

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.650
you protect yourself, and you begin to become
as successful as you wish, unless you get

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:37.650
taxed to death. But it's a separate thing.

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:42.710
But you can become successful. It means that
you accumulate wealth --

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:43.710
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:47.500
&gt;&gt;male in audience: because you deserve to
accumulate wealth.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.050
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum, um-hum.

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.810
&gt;&gt;male in audience: It will be something new.

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:54.810
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:55.810
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Something better.

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:56.810
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Um-hum.

00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:57.810
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Would that be possible
at all under distributive, in a distributive

00:52:57.810 --> 00:52:58.810
system?

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:00.130
&gt;&gt;John C. Medaille: Well I'm sure, yes it
is because there're people who-who do it.

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:08.650
However, it depends on what you mean by accumulating
wealth. If you mean that one man should have

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:17.810
50 billion dollars that he cannot possibly
spend; Aristotle recommended in those cases,

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:23.820
and Aristotle was no Communist by any means,
Aristotle recommended that a person that rich

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.830
ought to be exiled as a danger to the body
politic.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:33.080
And I only bring that up to say that this
is not a new question and has been discussed

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.080
a while.

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:40.250
People ought to earn their contribution to
production, whatever that contribution is.

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:44.490
But when you find out that it's really a contribution
protected by a government monopoly through

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:52.320
patent, I'm not so sure then if that the government
then in protecting the monopoly doesn't have

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.410
some rights to talk about the distribution.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:57.910
Now if you wanna get government out of it
and say, "Government, we're not enforcing

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:02.930
patent," then we'll how much he accumulates.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:08.570
The, but if the government's in it, you can't
argue both ways. You can't argue, "Government

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:13.710
defend my accumulation," and "Government say
out of my accumulation." You gotta choose

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:21.339
one or the other.

00:54:21.339 --> 00:54:23.240
[pause]

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.150
Okay.

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:32.270
Well you're very kind and you're very patient.
And I do thank you for coming.

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:33.349
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: Thank you very much.

00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.509
[applause]
