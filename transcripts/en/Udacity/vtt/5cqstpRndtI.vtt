00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.720
Sharpe ratio is a metric that
adjusts return for risk.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.190
And it enables us in a quantitative way

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.810
to asses each of these
example compared portfolios.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.820
So Sharpe ratio will show us for
instance, that in this case ABC is

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.760
better because It has about the same
volatility as XYZ, but higher return.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.870
If it were to assess these two, even
though they both have the same return,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.820
it'll say XYZ is better
because it's got lower risk.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.360
And finally, in this case where these
two are very close and it's hard for

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.040
us as humans to determine which
one is better, Sharpe ratio here

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.770
will give us a number that will
help us determine between the two.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.750
So with regard to the numbers that
Sharpe ratio ends up providing us,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.870
all else being equal, lower risk is
better, higher return is better.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.340
Sharpe ratio also considers something
called the risk free rate of return.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.930
That's the interest rate you would get
on your money if you put it in a risk

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.780
free asset like a bank account or
a short term treasury.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.740
The reason that it includes this number,
is we always need to consider,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.350
gee, maybe this asset we've got

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.670
isn't performing as well as the return I
would get it I just put it in the bank.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.670
Now, lately, as of mid-2015,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.170
the risk free rate of
return is about zero.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.900
In other words, if you were to put
your money in the bank or to buy

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.180
very short term treasury bonds, that's
the interest rate they would pay you.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.590
And this is why lately folks have put so
much money into the stock market,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.980
because you can't make money putting
your money in the bank these days.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.960
The Sharpe ratio is named for
William Sharpe.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.120
And he developed something called
the Sharpe ratio that accounts for

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.440
all of these.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.940
Now think about what the form of
that equation would look like.
