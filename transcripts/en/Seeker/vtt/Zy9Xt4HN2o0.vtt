00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.989
A really good scream is a beautiful thing,
evolutionarily speaking.

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.540
It can cause wide-reaching results, and when
paired with a threat?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.679
Ohhhhh man.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.080
Fear can set off what’s called a defense
cascade -- a set of behaviors that cause you

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.160
to... run or defend yourself… - freeze because
you’re so scared… - or keep you from shouting

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.410
or moving at all! - sometimes it can cause
you to fall over - or even faint to protect

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.410
yourself!

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.930
Seriously, fear is really powerful.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.070
The source of this emotional response is buried
deep in your brain; in a set of neurons called

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
the amygdala.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.060
The fear can be emotional like abandonment,
or from physical danger like an attack.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.940
But it can also be triggered by the sound
of screams.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.079
And, new research has found just what about
a scream triggers your amygdala the best (or

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.079
worst)?

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.610
Screams, according to the paper, are a “unique
signal” and exploit distinct features not

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.250
used by regular speech!

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.590
When you hear voices, your brain processes
them -- “Do I know that man or woman?”

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.040
“How old are they?”

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.540
“Are they emotional?”

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.540
Screams?

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.540
Nuh-uh.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.390
They go right from ear to amygdala.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.390
BAM.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.720
For the first time, the study characterized
the scariness of screams, by their roughness.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.800
&lt;pause&gt;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.500
Roughness, is a measure of modulation.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.540
Think of alarm sounds, rougher ones are scarier,
like klaxons or alarm sounds.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.070
If someone screams, you can hear that modulation
-- that’s like a vocal strobe light!

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.360
You can’t ignore it!

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.700
The “acoustic roughness,” they found,
“selectively activates the amygdala” triggering

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.090
fear and danger processing.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.000
Fear feels different from other emotions.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.330
And this is (partly) why.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.630
Without it, we wouldn’t’ve made it this
far in our evolution.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.100
Our brain processes screams differently from
other auditory communications.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.200
As animals, we share this fear response with
other creatures, but as humans?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.050
We can sometimes get stuck in this cascade.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.670
Re-playing the fear again and again in our
minds…

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.350
By learning about how fear works we can help
people suffering trauma overcome it with therapy.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.459
It’s amazing that all this comes back to
two little bits of neuron deep in our ancient

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.459
brains.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.210
Happy Halloween everyone!

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.540
Are you scared yet?

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.540
Why would they even be scary?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.010
Natalia has the science, here.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.550
Final fun fact: these fear emotions were first
analyzed by Darwin in 1872.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.810
He recognized we have emotions to adapt to
our world, just like lower animals do!

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.220
Love that guy.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.860
