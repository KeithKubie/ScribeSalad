00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.780
my sense is that in men many forms of

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790
my sense is that in men many forms of
 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.320
my sense is that in men many forms of
this stimulus are like pushing a string

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330
this stimulus are like pushing a string
 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.150
this stimulus are like pushing a string
and so these banks that took all of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160
and so these banks that took all of
 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.740
and so these banks that took all of
these risks and therefore find

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750
these risks and therefore find
 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.260
these risks and therefore find
themselves and desperately needing

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270
themselves and desperately needing
 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.500
themselves and desperately needing
liquidity you can push the liquidity

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510
liquidity you can push the liquidity
 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.080
liquidity you can push the liquidity
into a bank but you cannot push the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090
into a bank but you cannot push the
 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.870
into a bank but you cannot push the
liquidity out of the bank it can only be

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880
liquidity out of the bank it can only be
 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.560
liquidity out of the bank it can only be
pulled from the other side and in a

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570
pulled from the other side and in a
 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.430
pulled from the other side and in a
similar way you can cut taxes and push

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440
similar way you can cut taxes and push
 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.490
similar way you can cut taxes and push
that liquidity into consumers banking

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500
that liquidity into consumers banking
 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.220
that liquidity into consumers banking
accounts but you can't pull it out the

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230
accounts but you can't pull it out the
 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.639
accounts but you can't pull it out the
other side and one of the dangers in a

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649
other side and one of the dangers in a
 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.669
other side and one of the dangers in a
recession is that the instinct of

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679
recession is that the instinct of
 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.310
recession is that the instinct of
individuals and the instinct of banks is

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320
individuals and the instinct of banks is
 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.340
individuals and the instinct of banks is
to hunker down and preserve their own

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350
to hunker down and preserve their own
 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.610
to hunker down and preserve their own
financial viability not too aggressively

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620
financial viability not too aggressively
 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.330
financial viability not too aggressively
spend the money or loan the money and so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340
spend the money or loan the money and so
 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.120
spend the money or loan the money and so
even though in in normal situations you

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130
even though in in normal situations you
 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.859
even though in in normal situations you
know like Ronald Reagan showed us that a

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869
know like Ronald Reagan showed us that a
 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.700
know like Ronald Reagan showed us that a
big tax cut really could stimulate a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710
big tax cut really could stimulate a
 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.240
big tax cut really could stimulate a
decade of economic growth in this kind

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250
decade of economic growth in this kind
 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.959
decade of economic growth in this kind
of a risky situation I suspect that

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969
of a risky situation I suspect that
 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.450
of a risky situation I suspect that
putting liquidity into banks and putting

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460
putting liquidity into banks and putting
 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.940
putting liquidity into banks and putting
liquidity into people's bank accounts

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950
liquidity into people's bank accounts
 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.230
liquidity into people's bank accounts
through tax cuts the liquidity is likely

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240
through tax cuts the liquidity is likely
 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.139
through tax cuts the liquidity is likely
to stay there and not get pulled out the

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149
to stay there and not get pulled out the
 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.139
to stay there and not get pulled out the
other side and generate employment and

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149
other side and generate employment and
 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.039
other side and generate employment and
so the kinds of things that are part of

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049
so the kinds of things that are part of
 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.920
so the kinds of things that are part of
the stimulus package where the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930
the stimulus package where the
 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.539
the stimulus package where the
government actually goes to the other

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549
government actually goes to the other
 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.510
government actually goes to the other
side and uses the money to create

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520
side and uses the money to create
 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.840
side and uses the money to create
employment so the rebuilding of the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850
employment so the rebuilding of the
 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.450
employment so the rebuilding of the
infrastructure and things like that is

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460
infrastructure and things like that is
 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.200
infrastructure and things like that is
really a great idea because it's it's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210
really a great idea because it's it's
 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.539
really a great idea because it's it's
there is a direct causal link between

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549
there is a direct causal link between
 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.600
there is a direct causal link between
you spending and people going to work

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610
you spending and people going to work
 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.970
you spending and people going to work
and then they're going to work their

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980
and then they're going to work their
 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.630
and then they're going to work their
ability to consume that's where I would

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
ability to consume that's where I would
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.480
ability to consume that's where I would
focus the stimulus money I think the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490
focus the stimulus money I think the
 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.810
focus the stimulus money I think the
other stuff you may want to do it just

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820
other stuff you may want to do it just
 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.280
other stuff you may want to do it just
because you have to prop up

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290
because you have to prop up
 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.250
because you have to prop up
the banks but you should not do it in

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260
the banks but you should not do it in
 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.280
the banks but you should not do it in
the anticipation that it will solve the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290
the anticipation that it will solve the
 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.299
the anticipation that it will solve the
recession's troubles
