So my, my two favorite features in Gmail is first,

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.210
I really like that it's so easy to see my

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.420
conversations, and access you know, the last, the last messages

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.110
that I have and who I'm talking to. I also

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.340
like when you refresh your messages, this really fun little

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.140
color bar up here is to show that it's updating,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.350
and, that's just cute. Things I wish it would do

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.320
better is, I wish that it was more easy to reply

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.040
all and forward. Right now it's kind of hidden behind

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.340
a menu. And, I also would like to know what

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.710
I can do with this app offline since I'm not

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.330
always actually in this building connected to a Wi-Fi source.
