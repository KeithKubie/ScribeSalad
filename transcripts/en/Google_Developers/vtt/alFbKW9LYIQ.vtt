STEVE GROVE: Are we good?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.670
All right.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.470
We're going to start off
with a video here.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.240
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.210
-Everyone good to go?

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.535
-Good.

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:12.860
-Good to go.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.150
-I'm good.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.915
-I'm gonna click on
Start Broadcast.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.149
Hi, everybody.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.430
Once again, we're going to have
our virtual star party

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.780
working the telescopes today.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.000
I love science.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.750
I love communicating
and exploring

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.640
about space and astronomy.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.880
So when Google+ came out, I
thought, wouldn't it be cool

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.600
if we could get a telescope
streaming an image right into

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.625
the Hangout?

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.930
-We've got Mike Phillips, and
he's in North Carolina.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.420
We've got Gary Gonnella.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.430
What's your view, Gary?

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.100
-The Monkey Heads in the
upper part of Orion.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.040
-Before, this was impossible.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.080
But now we're getting people
from Mexico, and South

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.910
America, and South
Africa, Malaysia.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.050
We're starting to capture
the whole Earth.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.115
Because suddenly, there is a way
we are able to bring all

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.292
these people together
and put on a show.

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:56.716
-Oops.

00:00:56.716 --> 00:00:57.140
Too.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.760
Close.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.310
-I think everyone's
ready but Mike.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.750
Oh, I think I see something.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080
Can you move it a little
down, Mike?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.918
There it is.

00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:10.500
Oh, man, look at that.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.300
Being able to look out into
space gives us context for how

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.410
we live in our day to
day experience.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.150
It shows us that we're part
of this bigger universe.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.792
Gary, you've got the
Rosette for me?

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:30.280
-I do.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.960
-I mean, for us.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.790
I mean for us.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.370
For everyone to see.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.930
Not just me.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.670
-Don't kid us.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.230
It's for you, Chris.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.165
-It's for me, yeah.

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:38.932
-Now we have Saturn is green.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.884
You guys are just into
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:42.884 --> 00:01:45.760
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.120
STEVE GROVE: Well,
hello, everyone.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.250
And welcome to our Hangouts
Fireside Chat for all of you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.560
here in the room and for
those of you online.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440
This session is really
about you.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.950
We're here essentially to answer
your questions, hear

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.080
your ideas, and hear your
thoughts about Google+

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.910
Hangouts, arguably one of the
most exciting features on the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:04.810
Google+ platform.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.020
So really excited to make this
an interactive discussion with

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.960
all of you.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.150
To get us started I want to
introduce our panel today.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.520
On the far side over there
is Nikhyl Singhal.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.350
Nikhyl is director of product
for real-time

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.320
communications at Google.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.740
So that's not only Hangouts,
but also Google Voice and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.420
Google Chat.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.020
Nikhyl, before Google, founded
and sold two companies, the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.570
most recent of which
was SayNow.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.950
SayNow, for those of you who
haven't heard of it, was a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.280
real-time social video
conferencing tool that allowed

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.410
celebrities and fans to connect
using telephone

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.540
conferencing and voicemail.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.310
If you haven't heard of it,
it's likely that your

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.920
daughters or sisters have heard
of it because one in

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.060
three teenage girls in the
country was using SayNow when

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.550
Google acquired Nikhyl's
company in 2011.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.210
So that's Nikhyl Singhal
on the far side.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.700
And then next to Nikhyl
is Chee Chew.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.610
Chee is our engineering
director for real-time

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.040
communications at Google.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.190
He is based in Kirkland.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.010
Before he saw the light and came
to Google, he worked for

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.670
14 years at Microsoft, working
on a variety of things.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.630
Most recently, he worked on Xbox
LIVE, particularly on the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.920
Windows Live part of it.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.970
As you explained it to me,
porting the Xbox LIVE

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.110
experience onto other devices.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.980
So this is how it's going
to work for our

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.220
conversation today.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.040
I'm going to start the
conversation with Nikhyl and

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.030
Chee up here for a little bit,
set the groundwork for what

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.050
Hangouts are, where
they came from.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.500
We'll do that for about
10 or 15 minutes.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.080
And then the bulk of the time
really, for the 45 minutes we

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.530
have left, we want to
hear your questions.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.040
You can either ask
them at the mics.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.520
There's one there,
or one there if

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.000
you're here in the room.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.600
Or if you're online and you
want to ask them on our

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.700
Moderator series, use
that link that we

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.230
have up on the screen.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.090
If you're in the room, and
you're also shy, and you want

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.190
to do it via Moderator,
please feel free.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.460
We'll get through as many
of them as we can.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.180
The link is right there.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.500
Just to get a sense for who's in
the crowd before we start,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.480
so we have a sense of who you
all are, how many folks in the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.340
room are developers?

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.990
Let's see a show of hands.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.270
And then how many folks
in the room are media?

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.010
There's some media folks here?

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.530
Good, yeah.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.160
We wanted to put a special call
out to media because we

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.890
think the applications
for Hangouts with

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.870
media are pretty exciting.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.440
And then who here was at the
session right before this on

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.210
Hangout applications?

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.260
Good, so there's a strong group
of folks here who've

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.250
already been thinking about
Hangout applications and some

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.030
of the uses for them
as developers.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.580
That's really useful.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.690
So I'm going to start us out
with one more video to give us

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.076
a sense for the ways in which
Hangouts have been used.

00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:36.326
And then we'll start
our conversation.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.230
I should probably introduce
myself actually, which I

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.380
realize I haven't done.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.810
My name is Steve Grove, and I
run our community partnerships

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.400
team on Google+.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.160
Our mission is to partner with
influential individuals,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.130
organizations, media companies,
et cetera to grow

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.140
the Google+ community.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.260
So we've been using Hangouts a
lot with a lot of different

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.380
partners since we launched
last fall.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.320
So here's a look at some of the
uses of Hangouts that we

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.688
saw early on in the days when
we launched the platform.

00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:20.280
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.256
-Hi.

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:22.750
-Look, grandpa's here.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.110
-Hey, Javin, Chase,
how you doing?

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.050
-Hi, man.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.914
-Oh my gosh.

00:05:27.914 --> 00:05:28.380
-Are you kidding?

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.778
-Oh my god, shut up.

00:05:29.778 --> 00:05:30.710
-Do it, do it.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.770
-Are you wearing an apron?

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.470
-Whoa.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.500
-Whoa.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.770
-You're wearing your sweaters.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.160
-Oh.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.940
-Oh.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.430
-Ugh.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.902
-Her right knee toward the
center of your foot.

00:05:40.902 --> 00:05:41.854
-Moustache.

00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:42.806
-Show the ring.

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:43.282
Show the ring.

00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:44.710
-It is huge.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.662
-It's gorgeous.

00:05:45.662 --> 00:05:48.042
-Touchdown!

-We're having a wedding.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.270
-I know.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.700
-This is gonna be so cool.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.800
STEVE GROVE: Well, Chee,
let's start with you.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.570
Give us a bit of the background
to Hangouts.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.380
Why did Google start Hangouts
as a product?

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.320
And then why did Google think
about putting that product

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.960
within Google+?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.470
CHEE CHEW: Sure.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.630
So actually, at the very
beginning, the team wasn't

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.470
part of Google+.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.750
We were actually the last major
team to join Google+.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.420
Initially, the team was working
on one to one video

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.760
chat in Gmail.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.200
And we were working on the
next version of that.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.160
And the team was in Kirkland
and Sweden.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.230
And one of the things that we
had done was we had set up a

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.380
permanent video link between
the two offices.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.890
And so we had that ongoing.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.700
So we were working on technology
in this area.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.676
Something happened one
day when I came home.

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.830
And my wife was on
the computer.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.610
She was working.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.480
And she had a video window
going, but she wasn't really

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.190
talking to anyone.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.890
It was just there.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.430
And she was doing her work.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.710
I was like, who are you
on a video chat with?

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.590
And she said, it's Arden--

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.870
who's my son.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.150
And I was like, where's Arden?

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.210
And she said, well,
he's upstairs.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.490
So there was a video link
between upstairs and

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.710
downstairs in my house.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.180
I was like, why in the world
are you doing that?

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.210
And he answer was, well, he's
supposed to be studying, so I

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.610
banned him from downstairs
where he gets distracted.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.880
He's supposed to be up in his
room, but he's lonely.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.830
And so they just had a video
link between the two of each

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.390
other just to keep each
other company.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.610
And that made me think about,
when I was in college, I

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.680
couldn't study when I was
sitting alone in my room.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.620
I always went down to the common
room, and I hung around

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.140
with other people.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.370
And we didn't really talk.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.630
We just studied together.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.100
And I was happier and more
productive when I was just

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.100
around people.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.140
And I noticed that in our
engineering teams also.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.510
We would be in video
calls together, and

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.120
we would debug together.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.870
And sometimes there would be
long periods of silence.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.960
But it just worked better when
people were accessible, and

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.970
they could ask something at
a spur of the moment.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.490
So that was the spark of the
idea of video for something

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.650
more than just having a meeting,
but really just to

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.860
hang around with each other,
to keep each other company.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.070
STEVE GROVE: So it wasn't
directed conversation.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.680
This was actually having an
ambient conversation.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.650
CHEE CHEW: Yeah, this ambient
conversation.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.170
So that was, I guess, just
the spark of the idea.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.940
It wasn't really well-formed
by that time.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.360
But about that time, so this is
the end of 2010, about six

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.549
months before we released
Google+ I

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:36.730
was in Mountain View.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:43.190
And Sergey, and Vic, and Bez
called me into a meeting and

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.500
pulled me in to talk to me, to
convince me to help Google+ by

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.900
adding text chat support
to Google+.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.370
Since we weren't part of
Google+, they were asking to

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.400
lend a hand.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.970
And so of course, I said, yeah,
we'll do that, but I had

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.410
this idea I wanted
to run by you.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.270
So I explained this idea of an
ambient video sort of thing,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.000
where most people can
come in and go out.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.470
And they started to get it.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.310
And so I then opened up my
laptop, and I joined into that

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.240
permanent video link.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.080
So I was in California.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.870
I joined into this permanent
link between

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.650
Kirkland and Stockholm.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.760
And then all of a sudden, there
were engineers in those

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.570
two sites having this
conversation with Sergey, and

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.810
Vic, and Bez.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.810
And it was cool.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.090
I

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.430
People were really excited
about that.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.820
And so that little spark turned
into a small flame.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.050
And Sergey said, wow, this is a
neat idea, but we're trying

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.500
to ship in six months.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.470
And you just have this
nugget of idea.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.510
It's going to take us a long
time to even prototype it.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.600
And the team had been
working on it.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.880
So I said, no, it's like
five lines of code.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.250
So Sergey says, well, then go,
and let's do it right now.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.960
I had a flight to catch
in two hours.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.990
So I said, uh, I have to go.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.930
And Sergey said, well, you said
it's like five lines of

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.380
code, so just go do it.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.300
So he was calling my bluff.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.600
So they pulled me over to a
Google+ engineer, and they had

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.140
me explain how to do this.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.250
They never let me
touch the code.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.580
Because I'm the management
overhead, and you don't let me

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.870
near the actual code anymore.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.520
So I explained how to do it.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.690
It was really fast.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.960
And then I said, I really
have to go.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.450
I've got to catch a flight,
but when I land, I'll call

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.880
back, and see how you're
doing, and

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.020
then help from there.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.166
So I took off, and the engineer
hadn't even compiled

00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:31.460
the code yet.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.000
He kept on working on
it, and I left.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.270
I landed in Seattle.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.710
I called him from the airport
just to find the engineer and

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.760
say, how's it going, do
you need any help?

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.355
And in that span of
three hours, that

00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:45.400
engineer had finished.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.460
He had built a new release, and
he had pushed that server

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.280
out to the company.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.830
And as soon as I logged
in, Vic hit me

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.580
with a Hangout invite.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.380
I joined there.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.560
And there was Vic with a dozen
people, this big glass of

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.710
wine, and he goes, Chee,
we're in a Hangout.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.420
And Sergey was there,
and then the Google+

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.220
leadership was there.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.960
And I didn't know them all, so
he introduced me to them.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.220
And I was like, wow, that's
kind of cool.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.610
So I invited in the people from
Sydney in my team, and

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.180
from Stockholm, and Kirkland.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.540
So I invited them in.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.330
And we had this ambient
conversation, where people

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.640
brought other people in.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.240
And that conversation lasted--

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.610
I landed at 9 o'clock.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.015
It lasted at least
until 3:00 AM.

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:32.980
STEVE GROVE: So the first ever
Hangout lasted five hours.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.590
CHEE CHEW: The first
ever Hangout lasted

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.740
more than six hours.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.000
STEVE GROVE: Now you could have
launched this in Gmail or

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.470
in other places at Google.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.220
What about launching Hangouts
within Google+

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.150
makes it really unique?

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.240
CHEE CHEW: Well, I think
part of the magic is

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.220
this ambient one.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.285
You can do the directed
conversation, and I think this

00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:52.290
is really important.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.110
But also, part of the extra
magic that we have, I think,

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.400
is this ability for people to
connect with others and to

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.410
have friends of friends
bring in others.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.200
And the social graph can
grow and spread.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.890
I've met a lot of
amazing people.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.140
And just before the session, I
saw a lot of people I've met

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.430
from around the world
through Hangouts.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.450
And I think that connection
has been really, really

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.320
powerful, and I think
it's been a

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.960
unique part of Hangouts.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.740
STEVE GROVE: As a social
experience?

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.230
CHEE CHEW: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.810
STEVE GROVE: Nikhyl, I'd like to
hear from you a little bit

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.820
about what we've seen in terms
of how Hangouts have been used

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.570
by various groups
since launch.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.120
To get into that topic, let's
play a little clip of one

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.530
group that has used Hangouts a
lot, right from the beginning.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:37.670
And that's the media.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.240
Let's watch a few clips from
media organizations.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.395
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:43.820
-Welcome to the AC360
Google+ page.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.640
Add us to your circle, so you
can get the latest updates and

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.910
behind the scenes look
at the show.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.030
-We're going to be conducting
Google Hangouts from time to

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.730
time to connect people in every
corner of the country to

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.370
talk about topics related
to Campaign 2012.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.210
Sarah, you're the reporter
in this crowd.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.985
What is going on with religion
these days in

00:13:03.985 --> 00:13:05.240
the age of the internet?

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.480
-You were talking about
how religion is

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.895
surviving in this new age.

00:13:08.895 --> 00:13:10.490
And I'd say, it's actually
thriving.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.050
-I'm Maria Bartiromo at the
New York Stock Exchange.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.180
Big shout-out to all my
friends on Google+.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.550
-You think back, Saturday,
semi-finals.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.487
What just pops in your mind?

00:13:18.487 --> 00:13:19.920
-Uneven play.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.700
-The Kentucky-Louisville game
especially was just-- it was

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.420
sloppy all the way around.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.920
-I thought the first game was
totally entertaining.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.650
You guys are all nuts.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.582
-NBC Bay Area's George Kiriyama
is live at SFO, and

00:13:29.582 --> 00:13:31.730
he's live via Google+
with us right now.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.540
Because it's too dangerous to
use our live truck with a mast

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.520
going up there.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.110
So he's talking to us live
over the internet.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.350
George, what can you tell us?

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.030
-We have 61 flights canceled.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.400
-We want to say thanks to
everyone who was on our cyber

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.300
count today.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.020
We hope that you enjoy
your weekend.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.590
-Good evening, I'm
Angie Bailey.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.470
-And I'm Sarah Hill.

KOMU 8's Kristen James working
that story of Bryan Rankin.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.745
-I'm Jake Tapper.

00:13:52.745 --> 00:13:55.000
I'm the senior White House
correspondent for ABC News.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.495
Welcome to this week's inaugural
Google+ Hangout for

00:13:58.495 --> 00:14:00.950
a discussion of election
year politics.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.430
So Emily, I think you
have the next one.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.120
And your question is about
the US Supreme Court.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.370
-If the Supreme Court rules
that all or a portion of

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:13.090
Obamacare is unconstitutional,
are there any positives that

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.700
President Obama could get
out of that decision?

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.420
-I think whatever happens, it's
probably not going to be

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.010
determined with this election.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.220
I think though there's a
benefit, I think, to President

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.480
Obama if that happens.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.822
-Anybody that has Google+
can use it.

00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:27.555
It's sort of the concept of a
watch party at home, where

00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:29.828
you'd be watching a speech on
your couch except you use it

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:30.324
from your laptops.

00:14:30.324 --> 00:14:33.295
-It was definitely the magic of
technology made it happen.

00:14:33.295 --> 00:14:36.080
-If you can bring people in to
be able to talk about the

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.220
issues that are driving
the day--

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.750
-I think this is gonna
be terrific.

00:14:41.594 --> 00:14:42.070
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.590
STEVE GROVE: So Nikhyl, you
launch a product like this,

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.320
you have a sense for how you
think it's going to be used.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.630
And then it's out in the wild,
and people start using it.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.760
What can you tell us about how
Hangouts have been used since

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.280
launch that has been instructive
for you about the

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.060
technology?

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.650
NIKHYL SINGHAL: So we launched
it almost exactly a year ago.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.790
And what attracted me to
Hangouts initially was we

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.450
didn't want to just do
video conferencing.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.390
I think there's a lot
of solutions out

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.040
there for video calling.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.100
Google is very focused
on innovating here.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.040
And I think when you look at
social communities and

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.580
real-time communication,
we're in the

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.160
first and second inning.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.200
There's lots and lots of
interesting use cases.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.320
We saw Chatroulette get born
about three, four years ago.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.000
Clearly interesting.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.830
That's one way to describe it.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.490
There's been lots and lots
of other experiments.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.100
But no one's really
figured it out.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.480
And so I think Chee had
this instinct, the

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.290
team had this instinct.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.200
We launched it.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.920
And within the first few months,
the stories just

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.680
started to come in.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.910
Some of the most notable, I
think, there was a kid who was

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.320
rushed to the emergency room
in a local hospital.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.210
The doctor wasn't able to
perform the surgery.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:54.700
And so the 15-, 16-year-old
kid was in a

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.730
life threatening situation.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.760
And someone had the insight to
actually post to Google+.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.870
And they were able to connect
with a doctor in a local city

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.710
and, actually using video, guide
him through the surgery,

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.660
save the child's life.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.990
Certainly something different
was going on there.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.440
In Calcutta, there is an
orphanage of hundreds and

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.050
hundreds of kids who don't
speak English.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.400
And the way to get out
of an orphanage is

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.830
largely to have language.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.540
And English is not an easy
language to pick up from an

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.800
orphanage, where they don't
really talk to you in English.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.300
And so local university
professors volunteer their

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.400
time to actually teach English
in an auditorium much like

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.850
this to kids using Hangouts.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:44.980
Probably the most memorable one
that I heard was one of

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.160
the father-in-laws of a Hangout
user was diagnosed

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.150
with Parkinson's.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.420
And he knew that his time where
he was able to speak and

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.460
he was able to control his
hands was limited.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.500
And so he pulled together all
of his grandkids into a

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.140
Hangout and taught them
how to tie a bow tie.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.944
And that way, Hangouts has
really struck a nerve, an

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.589
emotional nerve and
a social nerve.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:13.910
And what we've done as a team is
actually we've been blessed

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.040
with the community grabbing
hold and taking it so many

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.430
places that we've essentially
turned into a

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.910
highly reactive team.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.819
And of the first things we
noticed was that as soon as

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.349
these conversations started to
be formed, people wanted the

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.700
ability to share them.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.980
And the concept of sharing a
conversation isn't actually

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.410
possible without a product
like ours.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.310
And so initially, it was
people recording those

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.320
conversations using their own
screen capture software,

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.710
putting them on disk, and
then uploading them.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.620
But then we looked at each
other, and we said, well,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.690
clearly, we're Google.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.260
YouTube is potentially the
best video distribution

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.760
platform in the world.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.730
Why don't we connect those
two things together?

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.530
And what we launched was
Hangouts on Air, which was

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.460
launched last winter essentially
as a way for

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.650
people to have a conversation
and

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:02.920
distribute it on the internet.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.840
And everyday users were able
to do that, for the first

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.780
time, get a stage where they
can actually have a public

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.800
conversation.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.700
But then the media grabbed it.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.500
Because they wanted to find
conversations, elicit

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.380
conversation, and create
new conversations.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.720
And I think that maybe the
mantra that we've started to

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.910
think about is Hangouts are a
great tool to connect you with

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.570
people that you know you want
to have a conversation with.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.090
But also, our goal is to find
conversations you didn't think

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.600
you wanted to have.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.655
And I think that's what's really
magical about what

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:34.815
we've seen so far.

00:18:34.815 --> 00:18:36.500
STEVE GROVE: Discovering these
conversations that you

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.600
wouldn't have otherwise
had access to.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.820
NIKHYL SINGHAL: Absolutely.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.120
STEVE GROVE: Since we've started
and seen media using

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.250
Hangouts more and more, you
and I have had a chance to

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.400
meet with a couple
of broadcasters.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.590
Tell our friends here a little
bit about what you've heard

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.680
from the media and other
partners who clearly have

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.200
video technology to create
conversations, but are really

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.260
grabbing onto Hangouts as a
way to engage audiences.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.785
NIKHYL SINGHAL: So there's two
things that we continue to

00:18:58.785 --> 00:19:01.020
hear, and they have a
lot to do with the

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.030
two things I mentioned.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.710
One is people look at Hangouts
as a way to minimize the

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:07.830
satellite truck.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.760
So it's a satellite truck
in your pocket

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.200
for the first time.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.440
And so as a team, we've been
developing technology to

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.550
improve the quality of the
video, to think about vetting.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.650
So how do I make sure that
the participants and the

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.410
conversation is curated?

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.640
How do I make sure that the
conversation's interactive?

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.980
And I think we're going to show
some things about that.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.610
And so they look at it as a
replacement for being able to

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.650
pull together what they usually
do with studios, and

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.040
cameras, and very
expensive gear.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.140
That's one side.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.130
But then you have a situation
like what Sarah Hill did.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:46.590
She's a very talented
broadcaster that is at a local

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:47.830
affiliate in Missouri.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.700
And she's been using Google+
to find interesting

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.980
conversations.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.090
So during the Montreal protests,
she found someone

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.532
hanging out live in Montreal who
is actually broadcasting

00:20:01.532 --> 00:20:03.460
the protests from their--

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.240
I think it was their laptop
in that case.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.890
Well, people livestream
all the time.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.850
What made this unique was Sarah
jumped in the Hangout,

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:17.090
broadcast it on television, and
had a live conversation.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.810
And so when you think about the
capability of being able

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:25.180
to find a conversation on a
breaking news event and be

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.760
able to push it out to the
rest of the world, that's

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.610
something that, I think, all
broadcasters are excited about

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.500
and they see the potential
there.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.380
STEVE GROVE: Yeah, it's just a
huge possibility for citizen

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.165
reporting there, right?

00:20:36.165 --> 00:20:36.460
NIKHYL SINGHAL: Absolutely.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.410
STEVE GROVE: With mobile.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.750
Well, I want to give folks here
in the audience and folks

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.780
online a chance to
ask questions.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.690
So if you have one, please start
to line up at the mics.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.010
We'll also check the Moderator
queue in a second.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.730
But before I have the audience
questions, Chee, I'd like to

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.840
hear a bit more from you
about Hangout apps.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.090
Because when Hangouts launched,
it was just this

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.940
multi-person video conversation
platform within

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.140
Google+, and then you launched
Hangout apps.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.570
So tell us a little bit about
what does a developer need to

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.040
know to create a really
excellent Hangout app?

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.550
CHEE CHEW: As Nikhyl was saying,
very early on, people

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.880
started using Hangouts in ways
that we didn't imagine that

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.590
they would.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.270
They really pushed the envelope

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.820
of what we had designed.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.270
And so it was very evident very
early on that we would

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.730
need a way of enabling people
to be creative.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.830
Because people think about
things that we

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.110
never thought of.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.990
And the best way of doing that
is to enable this platform.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.060
So the whole intent around that
platform was to allow

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.520
people to take video and their
apps, the apps that they

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.400
already have, and make them
better by adding video to it.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.160
Make them better by making them
more collaborative and

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.800
more real-time.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.630
And the whole platform effort we
had around that is just to

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:57.780
really facilitate new
experiences and new ideas and

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.780
to allow developers to really
enhance their applications.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.880
The biggest takeaway I have
around the whole platform is

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.470
that we tried to make the
Hangout API platform really

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:14.120
simple and built upon the notion
that anything that you

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.420
can do in your app already on
the web, you can keep it and

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.640
just add Hangouts to it.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.750
You don't have to redesign it.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:21.880
You don't have to
re-architect it.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.480
It is just adding.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.460
You can take your app and iFrame
it into a Hangout, and

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.290
then add the multi-person and
the video capabilities onto

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.920
it, and extend it.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.170
We did a session just now
just prior to this one.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.890
And we have a code lab
at 4 o'clock today.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.920
We can help people
go through that.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.380
And then the other thing I'd
have you all developers

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.100
understand for us from this
point, especially here, but

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:50.640
ongoing, is our approach to the
platform is really to find

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.380
out what people are trying
to do and enable that.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.070
So the feedback that you give
us on, hey, I'm trying to do

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:02.130
X, Y, or Z thing really helps
us plan and provide what

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:02.710
people need.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.810
So that feedback loop here
today, but also just online,

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.450
ongoing is incredibly
valuable to us.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.320
STEVE GROVE: So I pulled up
an unofficial site called

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.780
thehangoutapps.com that has a
bunch of these Hangout apps

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:13.770
listed there.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.930
It's a good start for
inspiration for people

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.170
thinking about what types
of apps to develop.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.590
What can you say about the
social dynamics of

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.820
multi-person video chat that a
developer can say, OK, well,

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.640
that's the kind of situation in
which a Hangout makes sense

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.550
around an application.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.630
Do you have some
insight there?

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.330
CHEE CHEW: Well, whenever you
have an app where multiple

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:40.170
people are collaborating or
contributing to and sometimes

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.550
it's asynchronous, where one
person goes in, and another

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.050
person comes in later.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.810
But once in a while,
they come in.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.320
And they start using it, and
modifying it, and contributing

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.430
at the same time.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.260
That sort of flow is a great
candidate for a Hangout.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:59.610
And allowing people to work on
things asynchronously and also

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.240
make it come alive when it's in
a Hangout and then continue

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:03.950
afterwards.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.190
I think from existing apps and
productivity apps, I think

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:08.750
that's really, really
important.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.440
The dynamic for a fun
entertainment app inside a

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.260
Hangout, I think that there are
a couple of things that

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.800
you really have to
think about.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.180
One is oftentimes people are
shooting the breeze, or

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.120
hanging around, and
doing whatever.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.430
And then someone will
start using an app.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.690
And then it will be fun, and it
will spread throughout the

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.540
rest of that Hangout app.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.760
So a great Hangout app allows
for just 1 or 2

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.430
people to use it.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.360
Even in a group of 10, 1 or 2
people to start to use it and

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.690
get some value out of it, and
then have other people see it

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.970
and virally get that.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.530
It also allows people
to come and go.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.040
Because in a Hangout,
someone can leave,

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.490
or someone can join.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.960
So it allows a free flow of
people coming in and out.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.760
If you think about the dynamics
of that-- which

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.150
happens in real life as well.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.715
Two people start playing cards,
someone joins, and then

00:24:58.715 --> 00:25:00.310
someone else comes in later.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.810
Think about those dynamics.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.520
I think facilitating what really
happens in real life.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.132
That's what you want to think
about when you build apps.

00:25:06.132 --> 00:25:09.680
STEVE GROVE: Yeah, I think the
online poker app is one of

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.640
those really natural use cases
for people coming together.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:12.910
CHEE CHEW: Absolutely.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.500
NIKHYL SINGHAL: It's probably
worth pointing out that

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.400
there's two styles of apps
that we've been seeing.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.250
I think one are the YouTube,
poker, kind of mainstream

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.640
activities that if you take a
group of people and you're

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.730
essentially in a room, what
could you give them to keep

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.870
them busy, to keep
them occupied.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.070
The most successful app that
actually we have is our Google

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.080
Effects app.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.800
And we're seeing a lot of
developers build almost tools

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.340
or enhancements to the
video conversation.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.480
And these, if you look at a
Hangout, are the ones that

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.030
show up on the left side.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.285
They're not designed to be a
service or an activity in and

00:25:50.285 --> 00:25:51.280
of themselves.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.020
They're actually designed to
say, well, if you're in a

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.310
conversation, what could we do
with the audio, the video, or

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.970
the management of the
conversation that would really

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.820
make the conversation
more effective?

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.720
And I think that both are going
to be interesting areas

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.270
of exploration as we start to
see developers roll those out.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.980
CHEE CHEW: Those extensions that
extend and enhance the

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.110
existing conversation, I think,
are ones that you don't

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.040
need to get the consensus
of other people.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.820
Any one person can add value.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.720
And everyone sees what's
happening and is like, oh, how

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.980
do I do that?

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.380
Like the Lower Third app or
the Comment Tracker app.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.480
There are a bunch of things like
that which really do well

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.200
in that sort of forum.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.570
STEVE GROVE: One of my favorite
Hangout Effects apps

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.230
was Conan Hair, which we
launched for a Hangout we did

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.830
with Conan O'Brien in which you
can essentially place a

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:35.490
giant frock of orange hair on
top of your head, as you're

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.070
hanging out and play
like you're a late

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.400
night talk show host.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.276
CHEE CHEW: Yeah, of course,
Conan threatened to sue us for

00:26:39.276 --> 00:26:40.891
that one, so you gotta be
careful with those.

00:26:40.891 --> 00:26:42.660
STEVE GROVE: Yeah, indeed.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.300
You're just kidding,
of course.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.140
CHEE CHEW: Yeah.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.220
STEVE GROVE: Let's take
some questions.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.222
What questions do we have in
the audience for Chee and

00:26:47.222 --> 00:26:47.910
Nikhyl on Hangouts?

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.460
Yeah.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:54.000
Breon Nagy with Code
42 software.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.150
Using the webcam's pretty easy,
using your camera on

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.200
your phone's pretty easy.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.170
But what about when you want to

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.320
broadcast a group of people?

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.240
What kind of camera and
interface to a computer would

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.270
you recommend?

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.510
How do you get the image from
a HDMI camcorder into the

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.390
computer to broadcast?

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.990
CHEE CHEW: Well, the interfaces
that we use to

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.350
connect to the camera are the
standard operating system

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.660
interfaces, like WTIA
on Windows.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.680
So we will take in the input
from the operating system.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.220
Sometimes people want to pipe
in other video sources that

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.420
aren't directly cameras.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.000
And there are softcam emulators
that present

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.500
themselves as cameras.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.980
But we'll just have a
standard interface.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.890
There are some high-end tools,
like Blackmagic Intensity Pro,

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.780
which we use very
successfully.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.950
I think there are a bunch
of things like that that

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.080
you can look at.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.060
At the end of the day, at this
point, the resolution of it is

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.945
capped, so we don't
go to HD yet.

00:27:49.945 --> 00:27:53.120
It's certainly something that
we're definitely looking into,

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.144
but I think that those are the
tools that I would look at.

00:27:56.144 --> 00:27:57.132
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:57.132 --> 00:27:58.120
STEVE GROVE: Over here.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:58.970
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.110
Ryan Nichols with Podio.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.390
I'm interested to hear you guys
talk a little bit about

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:06.230
enterprise applications of
Hangouts, both your vision for

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.770
Hangouts in the enterprise, as
well as I'm just curious how

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:09.950
you're using it internally.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.720
I'm curious whether your own
salespeople are hanging out

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.740
with customers and that
sort of thing.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.740
NIKHYL SINGHAL: So I joined
Google about 18 months ago.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:23.220
And probably my first day, I
was struck by the fact that

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.500
almost every conference room
has video conferencing

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.660
equipment, and almost all
meetings are video meetings.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.350
CHEE CHEW: When you joined,
you tried to have a phone

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.760
conversation with me.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.070
NIKHYL SINGHAL: I was like,
can I give you a call?

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.292
CHEE CHEW: And I was like,
I don't have a phone.

00:28:38.292 --> 00:28:40.550
STEVE GROVE: I only hang out.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.090
NIKHYL SINGHAL: They just don't

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.670
give phones to employees.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:47.210
And so I did five phone calls a
day before I joined Google.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.330
I've done four since I've
been at Google.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.820
We just use our video
conferencing systems

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.400
internally, which is one of
the ways we've gotten to

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.320
understand the use cases
that Chee referred to.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.530
So today, just to give you a
sense of how Google uses

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:12.190
Hangouts, we do over 10,000
Hangouts every day at Google

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.280
to connect our company.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.000
CHEE CHEW: We run our business
on Hangouts.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.690
NIKHYL SINGHAL: And so that's
really changed--

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:18.580
STEVE GROVE: 10,000 a day.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.590
NIKHYL SINGHAL: 10,000 a day.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.700
Actually, it's slightly more.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.830
Like I said, that has really
changed the way that people

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.660
have interactions.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.880
It's also made it possible for
the Hangout team to be largely

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.280
in Kirkland and in Stockholm.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.870
And so it's not surprising that
there's a great, great

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.340
pent-up demand on the
enterprise side.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.980
And what we've done is we've
been slowly releasing our

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.380
services to the enterprise
crowd.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:52.040
There's a number of apps that
actually exist within Hangouts

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.810
that are almost what I would
call productivity apps.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.550
Our Google Docs Integrations
First Class.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.790
YouTube has been used
for webinars.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.540
CHEE CHEW: Screen Sharer.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.190
NIKHYL SINGHAL: Screen Sharer
is a very popular case.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.570
So I think that we don't have
anything to announce today.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.390
But I think that it's clear to
say that part of the reason

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.370
why we invest so heavily
internally in technologies

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.230
like Hangouts is to understand
the opportunity for

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.800
enterprises.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.790
And we've been very encouraged
by the initial results.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:20.530
CHEE CHEW: I think that we, for
Google, have found that it

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.110
actually makes our engineering
and our

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.090
business more efficient.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.820
If you do an interview over a
phone, you're missing a lot of

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.045
the nuance of the
conversation.

00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:32.820
You're missing reading
the body language.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.970
You don't have as high quality
a read on the person you're

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:36.490
talking to.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.750
So we firmly believe, especially
as distributed as

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:44.760
Google is, if you use things
like video technology and it's

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.040
high quality, you will make your
business more efficient.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.726
So we think of it as actually
a competitive advantage.

00:30:50.726 --> 00:30:53.280
NIKHYL SINGHAL: And there's
actually an insight that we

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.730
had early in the launch
of Google+.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.240
We always think that there's
the enterprise use case.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.502
And the enterprise use case is
when you're serious, and you

00:31:01.502 --> 00:31:04.060
have directed conversations,
and their private and

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:04.780
access-controlled.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.610
Then there's this, social
lightweight, fun, maybe you

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.190
meet someone new
type of thing.

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:14.870
Well, we started to see people
like Michael Dell actually use

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.010
Hangouts as a way to understand
how people think

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.070
about Dell products.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.780
Customer support apps, where
people would use video calling

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.260
as a way to actually engage
in the public.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.220
So the notion of an unstructured
conversation in

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.800
the enterprise is actually
a really, really

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.180
ripe area to innovate.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.300
And I think you'll see the
blending of social and

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.700
enterprise really delivering
on a new style of

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.460
communication that I think we're
just starting to see

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.140
even internally.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.800
STEVE GROVE: There's an
authenticity you get in that

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.840
conversation face to face about
a product that you just

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.420
don't get in comments and
things like that.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:47.980
NIKHYL SINGHAL: That's right.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.770
STEVE GROVE: The topic of a
question out of Moderator

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.400
right now is really
a good one.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.430
It comes from [? Zyzigu. ?]

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:55.960
And it is the following.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.940
Talk, Google+ Messenger,
Hangouts, and Voice all have

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.095
overlapping features while
remaining separate.

00:32:01.095 --> 00:32:03.570
Can we expect better
consolidation between these

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.700
down the road?

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.190
Nikhyl.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.930
NIKHYL SINGHAL: Yes, I think
we've done an incredibly poor

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.460
job of servicing
our users here.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.630
We have all the code to make
a seamless communication

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.590
experience for end users,
but they live in lots

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:19.730
of different products.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.380
We're going to fix that.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:25.450
We are highly, highly committed
to providing a

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.090
single, clean, beautiful user
experience for having

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.580
real-time communication.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.910
It will happen.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.740
We don't have anything to
announce, but it is an

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.240
investment that we care
deeply about.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.140
CHEE CHEW: Across all these
different surfaces, as well.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:38.730
NIKHYL SINGHAL: Across
all surfaces.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:39.940
CHEE CHEW: Across all devices.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.760
NIKHYL SINGHAL: That's right.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.910
STEVE GROVE: Clearly, both of
your titles are director of

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.830
product engineering for
real-time communications, not

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:47.475
just Hangouts.

00:32:47.475 --> 00:32:47.910
NIKHYL SINGHAL: That's right.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:48.320
STEVE GROVE: Let's
go over here.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.880
Next question.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:49.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.080
My name is Justin Davenport.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.350
I'm with Virginia Tech.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.410
What I'm curious of is on this
same enterprise topic, has

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.520
there been any discussion about
integrating H.323 or SIP

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.320
endpoints into Google+?

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.180
And have you looked
at any teaching or

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.645
education use cases?

00:33:07.645 --> 00:33:11.350
CHEE CHEW: Can I ask you, what
is it that you want out of

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.510
both SIP and H.323?

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.900
AUDIENCE: Well, we have lots
of faculty that are looking

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.470
for more advanced teaching
methods.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.670
And they see the commercial
technology of Google+.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.570
And they expect something like
that in the classroom or

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:31.250
delivered online, something
beyond just a TV and a H.323

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.490
link between two classrooms.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.230
CHEE CHEW: So I'm still not
quite clear on what is it that

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:41.220
you want specifically from
the 323 and also SIP?

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:41.820
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.910
It's two separate issues.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:45.750
I guess the first question
is let's say if we had 20

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:50.190
students sitting at home, a
faculty in their office, do

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.740
you see a use case for that
for Google+ in the future?

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.370
CHEE CHEW: This is actually a
very common thing that we will

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.500
do, where someone will ask
for a specific piece of

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.890
functionality, like, I
want SIP integration.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.320
And what we really want to do
is we want to dig in a layer

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.660
deeper and say, hey, what is
the scenario that you want?

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.670
And what I hear from you is,
we want to have the ability

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:16.860
for teachers to have a
conversation, a class lecture,

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.199
and for people at home, students
to not necessarily

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.130
join in the Hangout, but also to
be able to consume it in a

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:26.230
really cheap, easy, quick way.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.725
And we definitely want to
solve that scenario.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:34.080
Hangouts on Air is sort
of one format of that.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.330
Although currently, Hangouts
on Air require you to

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.550
broadcast to the entire world.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.380
But the notion of wanting to
filter that down to a circle

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.550
and broadcast that to a subset
is definitely something that

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.790
we've heard the request for.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.270
And we definitely recognize
there is a need there.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.230
NIKHYL SINGHAL: So in my
opinion, I think there's

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.800
certain use cases for Hangouts,
where Hangouts is

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.380
always just a better answer.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.900
I think office hours are
somewhat broken today.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.720
And what I mean by that is
when I was in college--

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.580
I know it was a while ago
but-- usually what would

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.470
happen is a professor would
sit in their room or the

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.530
teaching assistant,
and they'd wait.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.420
And then you would essentially
have a student walk in.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.560
And the student would walk in
maybe 20 minutes in, and they

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.720
would ask a question about
problem set number two.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.030
He'd answer the question, and
then the student would leave.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.123
Another guy would come in and
ask the same question, and

00:35:19.123 --> 00:35:20.590
they would repeat the
same question.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.500
And what would happen is then
there was a handful of people

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.450
that actually had gone to office
hours, who seemed to

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.920
have the insight, and the
people that didn't.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:31.250
So in my opinion, every office
hour in the world for every

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.930
institution should be always
run with a Hangout in mind.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:36.790
Because then you
can broadcast.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:39.340
People can jump in, they can
actually ask the questions.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.840
You could record, you
can play it back.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.916
You can clip the section that is
actually interesting, share

00:35:44.916 --> 00:35:45.910
it to the world.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.440
This we are committed
to doing.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.300
The product today actually
does a fairly good job.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.180
We're starting to see
people come in.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.720
There has been some concerns
around privacy.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.220
We haven't heard the technical
concern that you mentioned.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.690
But I suspect there is probably
issues around

00:35:58.690 --> 00:35:58.760
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.100
CHEE CHEW: But the way that
we're doing this, you could

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:05.080
connect to it via a Flash
Player, or a video tag, or

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.670
something really simple
like that.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.110
NIKHYL SINGHAL: So it's an
area that we're really

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.090
interested in investing in.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:11.770
Medicine and education
are two of the

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.650
verticals that we're really--

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.130
I would say-- hyper-investing
in.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:16.610
STEVE GROVE: There's just a lot
of efficiencies when you

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.090
start taking a Hangout from just
being the 10 people there

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.180
and then making it a
broadcast Hangout.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:20.645
NIKHYL SINGHAL: That's right.

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:22.110
STEVE GROVE: Let's
go over here.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:22.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.100
Mike Corbett.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.520
Android Headlines.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:28.170
I was wondering if it would be
possible in the future--

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.640
and I know you can't
talk about some

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.580
future things, but--

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:36.020
if Hangouts on Air was planned
for mobile in the future.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.290
CHEE CHEW: You mean
plan to join?

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:38.820
Broadcast?

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.280
I guess both.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.870
STEVE GROVE: This is also the
number two question on the

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:42.120
Moderator right now.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.620
NIKHYL SINGHAL: Maybe I'll
club them all together.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:52.000
I would say essentially
everything that we do on the

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.510
desktop, the plan and the
intention, is for us to have

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.390
them available on
all surfaces.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:01.390
So as far as I know, we don't
have a single feature that is

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.530
desktop specific.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.620
It turns out from a sequencing
point of view, as you point

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.010
out, both our platform for apps,
as well as our Hangout

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.860
on Air product line and our
feature set are the two that

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.100
we don't currently
have supported.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.740
I think we took a big step today
actually by launching

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.770
our tablet support, which had
Hangouts fully integrated,

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.900
which is one of the most
commonly asked questions, and

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.580
the mobile phone support.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.410
And for those of you that
haven't done a video call on a

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:32.690
tablet, it's very different
than you may think.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.240
Think about where you hold your
phone, where you hold

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.580
your tablet, and where
you hold your

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.570
desktop in your house.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:42.630
So when you hold a tablet, and
you have a video conversation,

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.720
and it's with your friends and
family, particularly those

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.320
that you don't see very often,
you hold it on the left, and

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.530
you hold it on the right.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.990
It's almost like you're hugging
the person, and you're

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.050
in this conversation.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.410
That degree of intimacy changes
the style of the

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.380
conversation.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.100
So we're really excited about
the fact that we're pushing

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.380
now on all of our different
surfaces.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.070
But it is a clear investment
that we will have those

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.400
capabilities.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.966
But we don't have it in a
time frame that we can

00:38:09.966 --> 00:38:10.305
announce right now.

00:38:10.305 --> 00:38:12.370
CHEE CHEW: Anytime when you see
something that's not on

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.300
one of those platforms, the
answer why it's not there is

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.040
almost certainly either a
technical limitation, where we

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.070
can't, but we want to, or our
engineers just aren't typing

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:22.600
fast enough.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.830
And we need to get them
to type faster.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:25.240
NIKHYL SINGHAL: More coffee.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.530
CHEE CHEW: More coffee.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.630
STEVE GROVE: A lot of the
questions on the Moderator are

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.580
asking about television.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.320
And since you mentioned tablet,
it might be a good

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:31.890
time to address this one.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:33.780
AUDIENCE: That was actually my
second question was about the

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:39.082
Q. Would the Q be possible if
you have Hangouts on it?

00:38:39.082 --> 00:38:41.450
NIKHYL SINGHAL: You
can [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:42.700
AUDIENCE: It is running ICS.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.330
CHEE CHEW: I think that's
something we'll have to take a

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:50.310
look at with the
Google TV guys.

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:58.550
NIKHYL SINGHAL: So the iOS
application supports air time

00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:59.900
in a native way.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.480
And so the idea of--

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.590
I think it's embedded in your
question, which is can I take

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:07.060
a Hangout and make it work
on a television.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.940
It's a very classic question.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.530
It's a great question.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.040
With iOS, we're able to
start seeing that.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.510
Clearly, we're committed
to doing that on the

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.450
Googlestack as well.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.070
STEVE GROVE: You can imagine
putting your television or

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:20.900
your tablet at one of the dinner
chairs at dinnertime

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.810
and actually enjoying a meal
with somebody who's

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:23.790
actually not there.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.256
Let's go over here.

00:39:25.256 --> 00:39:25.702
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:25.702 --> 00:39:27.040
I just want to follow up on the

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.120
enterprise question before.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.150
So in large corporations, you
often have this meetings where

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.930
you're broadcasting
to everybody.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:40.730
And it's a really expensive way
to communicate to folks.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.940
Hangouts offer another
solution for us.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.630
And I'm just wondering is there
a way to have folks join

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.600
a Hangout without having to
have the participation?

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.780
So if you can imagine
40,000 people

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.810
needing to join a Hangout.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.970
We don't really want to have
40,000 people join a Hangout

00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:59.780
per se, but we'd love to be
able to broadcast and

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.700
communicate with
them that way.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:08.010
CHEE CHEW: So if I could reframe
your question, I think

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:11.050
what you're asking for is if you
want people to be able to

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.070
join, but not actually
participate, but consume it,

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.950
you're actually asking for
Hangouts on Air, but

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.680
restricted to your company.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.610
Is that fair?

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.120
AUDIENCE: Or maybe in some
ways participate.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.390
Maybe voting or something
like that.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:29.390
Just some ideas to help
out the use cases.

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:32.990
CHEE CHEW: So the notion
of these use cases,

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.820
I think, are great.

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.445
It is a very common thing
that we've had a

00:40:37.445 --> 00:40:39.260
lot of requests for.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:43.030
What Steve has up here
is an app that

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.990
we're actually building.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.280
It is using the platform.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.030
And what this does
is it combines

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.050
Hangouts with Moderator.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.120
So someone can view a Hangout.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.910
And then at same time, over
there on the left side, they

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:58.180
can ask a question.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.490
And then other people can
vote on that question.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.180
Oh, yeah, I want to
ask that question.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.780
And then the people inside the
Hangout, whoever's presenting

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.760
on it, will see those questions,
and they'll see

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.510
them bubble up.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.590
And they can respond to it.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:14.720
And this is a platform aspect
that we want to bring forth to

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.340
allow scenarios that we were
just talking about, as well as

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.160
many others scenarios that the
media has been asking for.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.020
AUDIENCE: So at Google, you say,
you have 10,000 of these

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.820
a day, I guess, right?

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:31.180
Do you see the need for
broadcast ideas?

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.180
CHEE CHEW: We definitely have
the one-to-many meetings.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.565
Right now, Hangouts
are limited to 10.

00:41:36.565 --> 00:41:40.070
But we often have meetings where
there are a few people

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:43.640
speaking, but there may be a
large team of 100 who want to

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.930
attend that meeting
and watch it.

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:47.200
Yeah, there's no question
that we have that.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.550
NIKHYL SINGHAL: The use cases
typically either it's just a

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.910
pure streaming use case, which
is a handful of people want to

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.010
be able to speak, and
they want to be able

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.510
to reach the masses.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.410
We get a lot of questions
around record.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.720
So the ability to have a
conversation, and have it

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.090
recorded, and then be able to
play it back for future use.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.320
And then the third is the key
point that Chee raised which

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.840
was when the audience is able
to be in that view mode, how

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.360
can you have that subtle
interaction?

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.300
Being inside the video
conversation is heavyweight.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.660
And usually you have to
have a speaking role.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.050
Being able to say, I think
that's a great question or

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.610
being able to submit your own
question without coming up to

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.930
the mic in this example, being
able to do that on what we

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:32.260
call Google Moderator, if you
were to club this together,

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.610
this is the number one ask
from broadcasters today.

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.160
We have a product that's
broadcasting, but it's how can

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.330
I engage the audience that's
watching in addition to engage

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.840
the audience that is
participating?

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.390
STEVE GROVE: We did a Hangout
with President Obama in early

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.640
February in which questions were
submitted on Moderator.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.030
But we did that over on YouTube
and had to port those

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:55.490
back over into Google+ to not
only have the five people in

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.550
the Hangout asking questions
of the President, but

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.260
answering some of those
top-voted questions as well.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.570
So with this application, I
think it's going to get a lot

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:03.470
more seamless.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:04.780
Thanks for the question.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.990
It was a really good one.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.070
One of the top-voted questions
here that is somewhat related

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:09.470
is, why only 10?

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:11.510
Why only 10 people
in a Hangout?

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.820
CHEE CHEW: Because it's more
than 5 and less than 15.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.590
STEVE GROVE: That's
a great answer.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:17.840
NIKHYL SINGHAL: Next.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.280
CHEE CHEW: I don't know if
you've ever been at a dinner

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.530
conversation where you had
15 people at the table.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:31.430
When you have 15 people at a
table, you don't have one

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.030
conversation unless it's a
business meeting where there's

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:36.450
order to it and all that
sort of stuff.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:41.010
If this is a social dinner table
of that size, it shards

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.140
into multiple conversations.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:49.950
Our observation, just using the
product, is that somewhere

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:54.760
above 10, the conversation
starts getting cumbersome.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.360
Too many people interrupt each
other, or people feel

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.294
frustrated because they want a
turn to talk, and all that

00:43:59.294 --> 00:43:59.720
sort of stuff.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.470
And when we were using it
ourselves at 15, it wasn't a

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:04.990
great conversation.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:06.820
So it's a social
sort of thing.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.800
STEVE GROVE: It's not
a technical limit.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.470
It's simply--

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:14.220
CHEE CHEW: Well, we had a bug
that accidentally came out a

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:18.405
few months ago where we pushed
the server to where the cap

00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:20.010
was removed.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.360
And we had a 40% Hangout
out in the public.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.640
And people got to experience
that the technology could hold

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.390
up to a pretty large number.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.426
But the conversation just
couldn't handle--

00:44:31.426 --> 00:44:33.300
STEVE GROVE: A shouting match.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.340
CHEE CHEW: Everyone would try
to speak, and it was like

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.780
stepping on each other's toes.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.860
It wasn't a healthy
conversation.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:43.890
Now at the same time, if you
have a room of 10-- and let's

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.740
say our limit was 20--

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.030
and your buddy wants to come in,
you're not really going to

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.690
tell him, no.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.550
So you're going to allow
it to go to 11.

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.010
And then another friend
comes and says, oh,

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:53.970
hey, let me in there.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:55.880
And so you're going to
allow it to go to 12.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.760
And then another person comes in
who wants to get in there,

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.100
and you're going to allow
it to go to 15 and 20.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.740
You're not going to say, no to
your friends, say, oh, hey, we

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.860
have 10 right now, and that's
a little bit too many, so

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.110
please don't come in.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:11.443
So essentially, we'll
help you by--

00:45:11.443 --> 00:45:14.432
STEVE GROVE: Good fences
make good neighbors.

00:45:14.432 --> 00:45:16.510
NIKHYL SINGHAL: I think that
part of the reason why we did

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.880
Hangouts on Air was also to
recognize that when you're in

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.510
that mode, where you are hosted,
is to allow people to

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:24.726
actually participate in
the conversation.

00:45:24.726 --> 00:45:26.660
STEVE GROVE: You look at
broadcasters using Hangouts,

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.800
and it's rare that a broadcaster
like CNN or ABC

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.970
will actually have 10 people.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:33.280
Usually it's 3 to 6.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.300
Because even beyond that, if
you're trying to broadcast a

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.430
conversation that flows with
some kind of regularity, it,

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:41.410
in some ways, mirrors the
talking head format of cable

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:41.780
television.

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.470
When you're watching Fox or
MSNBC, there's never much more

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:46.160
than three or four blocks
on the screen.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.700
There's too much to handle for
an audience once you get past

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.620
that limit.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.010
Let's go over here.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:51.660
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Colin Jones.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.660
I'm interested in where
you're going with HD.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.090
We're starting to see 4K cameras
drop into the prosumer

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:57.840
price range.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.550
And particularly for medical
applications, that type of

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:01.780
resolution's pretty exciting.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:03.680
And even just HD's much--

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.410
well, more is better,
right, in this case?

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:09.300
So I'm interested in both your
short- and long-term plans for

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.090
higher resolutions.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.090
CHEE CHEW: Well, we're always
looking at how we can improve

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:15.070
the media quality.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.340
That's incredibly important.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.510
Not only, I think, more
pixels on the screen,

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:22.550
but also frame rate.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:26.360
Getting up to the 30 frames per
second, it was important

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.050
for the responsiveness and
the overall experience.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.510
It's definitely something
we're looking into.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.090
There are lots of challenges
around doing that.

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:35.610
As you push up the frame rate
and the resolution, you

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.010
challenge the CPU.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.800
You might not be able to hit
certain classes of machines

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:40.680
and that sort of thing.

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.700
So it takes a lot of
tuning on our part.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.180
We don't have anything to
announce right now, but

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.760
there's no question that
we're going to be

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.610
moving in that direction.

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.610
One of the things we do also
recognize is that when you

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:55.760
want to see high resolution
x-rays or something like that,

00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:00.340
where you're then casting
another screen or a window, we

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.740
actually adjust the
resolution.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:05.090
So we'll go HD and above
resolution on a screen cast,

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.640
and we'll drop the frame rate
down to five per second in

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.280
order for you to get that really
nice, crisp HD screen.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.610
So we don't have a specific
time line

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:15.410
or anything to announce.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.010
But the philosophy I'd have
you understand is we're

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:19.590
definitely pushing in
that direction.

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.000
We're going to push the envelope
as hard as we can on

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.640
the overall quality of the
audio and the video.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:30.470
But respecting the broad array
of hardware devices that we

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.166
have to support.

00:47:32.166 --> 00:47:34.610
STEVE GROVE: Here's an
interesting question from Tim.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:37.030
We've been talking a lot about
ambient conversations, but

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.620
what about scheduled
conversations?

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.070
Tim asks, what about Hangouts
integration with Google

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.490
Calendar so that you can
directly schedule a Hangout

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:44.400
and then invite users?

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.970
Is that something that
we're thinking about?

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:47.390
NIKHYL SINGHAL: Yeah, we're
definitely moving in the

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.740
direction of moving the Google
product stack and integrating

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.280
it more thoroughly
with Hangouts.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.050
So I think it's safe to say
that you'll see Hangouts

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.780
appear in your favorite Google
products more readily.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.780
Having said that, one of the
announcements we are making

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:05.360
today is the Google+
Events product.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.010
And so for the first time,
we've made it relatively

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.570
simple for users that, say,
have a family circle to be

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:13.800
able to schedule that using
Google+ Events.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.300
It's literally a click.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.335
Create an event.

00:48:17.335 --> 00:48:19.680
It's the special type called
a Hangout Event.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.550
There'll be a link.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.740
It'll show up in
your calendar.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:22.460
You'll be able to join.

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.090
You'll get notified on mobile.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:26.800
It's a great way of actually
having that scheduled

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.840
conversation.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.610
And it leverages the group's,
then, relationships you've

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.140
already created on Google+.

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.490
CHEE CHEW: And as Nikhyl
said, that does

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:35.950
show up on your calendar.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.510
And so you get all the calendar
functionality there.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.660
And one of the subtle points
that I know was brought out

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:45.470
earlier is that that creates a
Hangout location URL that's

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:47.320
static, persistent.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.860
So at the time that you create
that event, you now have a

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.010
Hangout URL that you can
join at any point.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.590
You don't have to go through
the create at a time and

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:57.010
invite everyone thing that
you do with the ambient

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:57.760
conversations.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.470
NIKHYL SINGHAL: And I think
inherent in that question is

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.990
there has been a deep investment
that you're going

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:06.860
to start seeing come out over
the summer around making that

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.970
directed use case, which is a
very common use case, is I

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:12.390
want to call grandma, I want
to call my brother.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:16.590
Making that simpler, and easier,
reducing the friction,

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.030
making that available on all
services, this has been a big

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:20.970
investment the team has made.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:23.490
We feel like we've done really
interesting work around the

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:25.260
social and the ambient
use case.

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.450
We really want to get that
directed right, and this is

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:28.860
the first step in doing that.

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:30.320
CHEE CHEW: One of the tricks
that some of the folks on our

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.435
team have figured out and used
for the events is if you have

00:49:34.435 --> 00:49:39.720
a recurring Hangout once a
week, you could create an

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.890
event that's actually scheduled
out, say, next year.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:47.010
And that creates a Hangout link
that you can use every

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.930
week, all the time, week
after week after

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:50.610
week, so the same location.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:53.970
So a common request that we've
had is, I'd like to have a

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.745
static URL, so I can just
know where to go.

00:49:56.745 --> 00:49:59.010
I know where to go, and I just
have it posted somewhere.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:00.760
And I can bookmark it.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.950
And so with Events, you can
effectively do that.

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:04.390
STEVE GROVE: So your wife and
your son can have their

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:07.017
homework Hangout always open,
check in, see that he's doing

00:50:07.017 --> 00:50:07.660
his homework.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:08.250
A few more minutes left.

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.630
Let's try to get as many
questions as we can.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:10.430
Next.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.640
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.860
My name is Christopher.

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:15.390
My question has to do with more
of a general in terms of

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:17.160
Hangout environment
for individual.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.926
And the best way I can explain
is through an experience that

00:50:19.926 --> 00:50:23.510
I had using Hangouts, whereby
my wife and I--

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:24.660
I was in Boston at the time.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:25.780
She was in Seattle.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.820
It was our anniversary.

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:29.990
And we thought, oh,
we can hang out

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:31.610
to have dinner together.

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:35.360
But then I have this really
dangly brick wall behind me,

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.004
and she has this really crappy
tree with nothing

00:50:39.004 --> 00:50:40.254
on the back of it.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.610
I was like, oh, I really wish I
could just take a two-minute

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:50.360
clip of where we had dinner once
and have it basically go

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.260
and compress and overlap
upon that video.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:57.570
And so that you have that
general environment of that we

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:01.300
are having dinner in a place
that we can see not only

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.700
ourselves, but in the
background, which is less of a

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.680
distraction, but more of a
visually appealing experience.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.592
And secondly, it would be more
of two, as well as friends and

00:51:09.592 --> 00:51:12.180
I, we love drinking at a bar.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.700
But we're never together.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.070
But it would be nice to go
in and then have in a bar

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:18.070
environment, where we can
just sit there and

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:18.830
have a drink together.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.720
And it actually feel like in a
bar environment in some sense.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.720
And I understand that

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.300
visualizations can be very complex.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.810
But you're Google, so it
shouldn't be impossible.

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:31.890
NIKHYL SINGHAL: If you asked if
you were jumping out of an

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.764
airplane at the same time,
then maybe we would get

00:51:34.764 --> 00:51:35.880
excited about that.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.355
CHEE CHEW: Putting that in
the blimp would be all

00:51:38.355 --> 00:51:39.590
you'd need to do.

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:42.076
It's a good request.

00:51:42.076 --> 00:51:44.561
AUDIENCE: I guess that's a
general request more than a

00:51:44.561 --> 00:51:46.736
question of do you have
anything to do with

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:48.140
[INAUDIBLE].

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:51.450
CHEE CHEW: We're definitely
looking at what interesting

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:53.950
things can you do with
a video stream.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:57.990
Effects was one step along the
way, and we're continuing that

00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.890
foot forward.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:01.175
We don't have any specific,
and I will definitely take

00:52:01.175 --> 00:52:03.480
that as feedback of a request
that we [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.550
NIKHYL SINGHAL: It's
a great use case.

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:06.360
STEVE GROVE: It brings up this
point of context, right?

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.320
The context within which you're
having a conversation

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.160
makes all the difference.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.415
So whether you're starting a
Hangout based off an article

00:52:11.415 --> 00:52:13.414
you've discovered, or in the
context of a bar you've been

00:52:13.414 --> 00:52:16.037
at, or wherever, it's setting
that right tone to have the

00:52:16.037 --> 00:52:17.067
right kind of conversation.

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:19.676
AUDIENCE: Like in the video that
you showed, this girl had

00:52:19.676 --> 00:52:21.043
a bunch of books in
the background.

00:52:21.043 --> 00:52:22.534
I don't have any use for
that personally.

00:52:22.534 --> 00:52:25.516
But [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:25.516 --> 00:52:28.166
I totally am not focused on
the background itself, but

00:52:28.166 --> 00:52:32.000
just more of the personal
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.550
We tend to think that
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:36.110
STEVE GROVE: Yes.

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:36.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:37.840
My name is Brent.

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.640
One of the favorite Hangouts
I've ever done was at the top

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.610
of a hiking trail, where I
happened to catch a 3G signal,

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:47.450
enough to be able to do a
Hangout out to my parents and

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.180
just show them this amazing
view that I saw.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.470
I also know several people who
are in the sign language

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:53.640
interpreting field.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.610
And they see this as being a
good benefit for the deaf and

00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:58.550
harder of hearing community.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.340
The problem I see is, especially
in low bandwidth

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.950
situations, it seems like
Google+ prioritizes audio over

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:08.110
video and tries to keep the
audio connection going as much

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:09.430
as possible.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:11.680
Are there any plans of making it
so that you can potentially

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.180
tell the Hangout to prioritize
the video signal over audio?

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.300
Or maybe that audio isn't needed
at all and put all the

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.660
bandwidth towards the video?

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.470
CHEE CHEW: So that's
very interesting.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:24.450
So I'm hard of hearing
as well.

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:26.990
And so I do sign language,
so I really care a

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:30.120
lot about that scenario.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.760
For the majority of use cases,
it is true that we think that

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.910
audio is extremely important.

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:40.820
If the audio is laggy, or it is
choppy, or it turns into a

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.570
robot-y voice, it's hard
to have a conversation.

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:46.530
If you start dropping video
frames, you can still have a

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:49.070
conversation if the
audio is clean.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:52.030
But I think that what you're
describing is actually a

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:53.780
really important case as well.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.860
There are a few things that
we're doing with that.

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.530
We're experimenting with
the low bandwidth mode.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:04.390
And we drop the resolution, but
keep the frames higher.

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:06.040
We do that in the download, and
we're looking at playing

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:06.880
around with the upload.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.660
And we're playing around with
automatic detection for that.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:13.360
The other thing is if you just
simply mute your microphone,

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.640
then that will give us a signal
that we're going to

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.070
prioritize that.

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.610
And if everyone else does that,
we will adjust that.

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:22.070
Because when we don't detect
audio, we will give that

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:24.030
bandwidth to the video.

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:26.890
There are a few things that
you can do, but we're also

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:28.180
working to make that better.

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:28.890
AUDIENCE: Is that done today?

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.840
If you mute the audio, does it
prioritize video completely?

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.760
CHEE CHEW: It adjusts.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:42.070
So when you aren't sending any
audio, then we don't consume

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:44.106
the bandwidth for that.

00:54:44.106 --> 00:54:45.530
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:48.220
STEVE GROVE: Let's take
one more question.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:48.930
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.050
My name's Andrew.

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.890
I helped organize a 48-hour
code jam among a bunch of

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:53.720
college students.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.260
But we purposely made it so we
weren't at a same place.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.640
We were at a bunch of
different places.

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.320
And we were trying to figure
out something to use.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.700
So we ended up trying
to use Hangouts.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:06.910
But Hangouts on Air, I believe,
was invite only, so

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.620
we couldn't get access
to that.

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:13.220
So we set up this complicated
rebroadcasting thing to try to

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.450
get it to broadcast
to audience.

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:18.930
And in the end, it didn't work
because our listeners for each

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:21.200
Hangout would time-out after--

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.120
I think it was-- an
hour and a half.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.450
And there was also this other
problem of we could only share

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:30.030
one screen at a time, and we
couldn't get multiple people

00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.740
to share screens.

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.395
Because once someone
shares a screen, it

00:55:33.395 --> 00:55:35.180
overrides the main screen.

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.280
And the last thing I just wanted
to mention is it was

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.700
really hard to get recording
to work because we had this

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.240
complicated thing.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.340
I didn't really have
a question.

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.660
It was just a bunch of sharing
my experience with you.

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.380
NIKHYL SINGHAL: So let me
maybe tease that apart a

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:48.640
little bit.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.045
So Hangouts on Air launched a
few months ago generally, and

00:55:53.045 --> 00:55:55.140
it's now at 100% across
the world.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.070
So for most countries in the
world, you actually can have

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:01.200
Hangouts on Air.

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.640
We know we had so much demand.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.570
We really wanted to make sure
that when people are

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.430
broadcasting themselves,
it's important for the

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:07.950
quality to be good.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:09.260
So we feel like we're
there now.

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:10.220
CHEE CHEW: And that includes
recording.

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:11.860
NIKHYL SINGHAL: And that
includes recording.

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.720
So I think if you were to try
it again, you'd be able to

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.570
take advantage of that.

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:21.200
When it comes to being able to
what takes over the main

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:25.280
image, we actually allow the
user to click on what we call

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.320
the film strip, which
is the set of images

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.450
underneath the Hangout.

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:31.200
And any time you click on one
of those images, it actually

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.010
changes the main screen image.

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:36.320
And it actually would affect
what's being broadcast.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.680
So this is a way for President
Obama to be in a Hangout, and

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.750
then you can actually click over
to someone who's talking

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:43.690
if you want to override
the default.

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:46.090
CHEE CHEW: So more people can
screencast at a time.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:47.480
And we do that every day.

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.650
Lots of people will
simultaneously screencast.

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:54.460
AUDIENCE: When we did it, when
we clicked Share Screen, it

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.060
would override the
other person's.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.800
And then it would kick
them back to their

00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.310
webcam when we did it.

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:00.700
CHEE CHEW: You should
give it a try again.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.005
It shouldn't do that anymore.

00:57:02.005 --> 00:57:03.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.750
And then I guess the only other
comment I have is you

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:09.260
said that when you do screen
sharing, it prioritizes the

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.335
quality, but reduces
the frame rate.

00:57:11.335 --> 00:57:13.367
CHEE CHEW: It prioritizes
resolution over frame rate in

00:57:13.367 --> 00:57:14.555
a screencast.

00:57:14.555 --> 00:57:18.100
AUDIENCE: We were also trying
to develop games.

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.890
We were trying to show off this
crazy thing, and it was

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:22.390
running at 2 FPS.

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:26.590
CHEE CHEW: One of the things
that we should actually take a

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:30.890
look at is giving API support
for developers to say, hey, I

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:35.890
want to prioritize or pump up
frames over resolution.

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.390
I think we can take
that as good

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:39.600
feedback for our platform.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.900
STEVE GROVE: We're almost
out of time.

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.020
I want to give each of you 30
seconds to tell us what you're

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:46.360
most excited about for the
future of Hangouts on Google+.

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.330
Let's start with you, Nikhyl.

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:47.723
NIKHYL SINGHAL: Oh.

00:57:47.723 --> 00:57:48.510
CHEE CHEW: Oh.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:49.760
STEVE GROVE: You can flip
a coin if you want.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:54.760
NIKHYL SINGHAL: So as I started
this session, I think

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:59.110
we're in the really early,
early parts of social and

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:00.560
real-time communication.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.430
The thing I'm most excited
about is the pursuit of

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:07.210
enabling users to have
conversations they didn't know

00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:08.430
they could be having.

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:11.170
I think that's a very
Google-like mission.

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:14.390
Google's incredibly good at
finding content that's

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.290
interesting.

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:19.390
I think that Hangouts make it
possible to find people that

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:20.340
are interesting.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:23.505
And I'm looking forward to
coming back next year and

00:58:23.505 --> 00:58:24.610
seeing how we're doing there.

00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:24.960
STEVE GROVE: Very cool.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.240
Chee?

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.500
CHEE CHEW: I think that video
conferencing is still in the

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.660
really early stages.

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:34.540
And not everyone is comfortable
automatically

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.970
doing that.

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:38.700
People are like, oh, but I'm not
wearing anything nice, or

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.000
I don't have my makeup on.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.300
You have all these excuses
right now.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:46.050
And I fully believe that in the
coming years, it will just

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:47.480
come natural.

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.120
People won't think about it.

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.220
In the past, people really
noticed when you had a cell

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:54.730
phone or really noticed when you
were walking and talking

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:55.560
to yourself.

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.490
You looked weird or whatever.

00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:01.090
And today, everyone
has a cell phone.

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:03.990
And video will become
commonplace.

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:07.070
Multiwave video, pulling people
in, that fluidity will

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:08.570
become commonplace.

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:09.810
People aren't there yet.

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:10.910
They're not used to it yet.

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:12.500
But there's no question it's
going to get there.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.830
And I think it's going to open
up a lot of possibilities.

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:15.345
STEVE GROVE: Very cool.

00:59:15.345 --> 00:59:16.290
Well, thank you both.

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:17.540
And thank you to everyone
here for joining us.

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.630
We appreciate it.

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:23.100
I want to mention before you
go that there's a Hangouts

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:26.700
Code Lab, I believe,
in room four.

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:27.245
Room two.

00:59:27.245 --> 00:59:28.290
But this is room two.

00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:29.730
AUDIENCE: The lab.

00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:32.380
STEVE GROVE: Oh, in Code Lab 2
starting at 4 o'clock, which

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:33.360
is 15 minutes from now.

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.040
So lots of folks are
going to be there.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.000
They're going to build
a Hangout app

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:36.660
from the ground up.

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.900
You'll get a real good sense
for how this works.

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:39.740
Thanks again for coming.

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:41.380
Thanks everyone online
for joining us.

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.230
As you leave, we're going to
play a quick highlight reel

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:44.710
from the Hangout we did
with President Obama.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:46.530
It's not often you get the
President to use your

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:47.150
technology.

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.210
We had a lot of fun with it.

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:51.660
We learned a lot about how to
get citizens access to figures

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:52.500
of power in this Hangout.

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.290
So as you head on out,
we'll play a little

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:55.170
highlight reel of that.

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.420
Thanks again for coming,
everybody.
