00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.300
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning
and welcome to Talks at Google

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.110
in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.360
Today it's my great
pleasure to introduce

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.140
one of the most interesting
people I know, Bill Powers.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.840
Bill has worked for two
decades in development aid

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.910
and conservation in Latin
America, Africa and North

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.380
America.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.420
From 2002 to 2004 he managed
the community components

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.340
of a project in
the Bolivian Amazon

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.540
that won a 2003 prize for
environmental innovation

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.040
from the Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.050
He's worked at the
World Bank and holds

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.340
international relations degrees
from Brown and Georgetown.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.930
He's a Senior Fellow at
the World Policy Institute

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.660
and an adjunct faculty member
at New York University.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.810
"New Slow City" is his
fourth book for adults.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.860
They're all excellent, and
you can read more about them

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.830
on his website
www.williampowersbook.com.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.340
So, burned out after years of
doing everything I just listed,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.150
Bill spent a season in
a 12 foot by 12 cabin

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.990
off the grid in North Carolina.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.320
He then attempted to
do something similar

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.030
in New York City.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.360
I suspect we're about to get
an entirely new perspective

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.510
on work life balance, as
well as the benefit of Bill's

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.770
extensive experience in
international affairs.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.072
Please join me in
welcoming, Bill Powers.

00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:43.772
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:43.772 --> 00:01:44.730
BILL POWERS: Thank you.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.030
Thanks very much for
coming on a Monday morning

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.450
to this gathering.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.630
It's just a great pleasure
to be here at Google.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.640
I use your products and I
think they're wonderful.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.410
And, because you're such
an intelligent audience,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.530
I'm going to try to pack
a lot in to this hour we

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.600
have together.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.270
And I'm going to really give
some perspectives on what

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.039
is the philosophical
underpinning for these new slow

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.090
movements and movements towards
minimalism and simplicity

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.110
and work life balance,
and why it's happening now

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.830
with the environmental crisis
and the triple threat that's

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.600
happening.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.820
And I'm also going to share
some personal experiences

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.280
from my own life-- this journey
that Jonathan was talking

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.870
about from New York City,
all around the world,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.150
to a tiny 12 by 12
cabin in North Carolina,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.270
and so on-- as a way of
provoking questions and maybe

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.520
inspiring you to think
about some new things

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.070
that you can do in your
work and your life.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.190
You take from it what you will.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.050
So with that said,
we're in this moment

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.640
of what you might call
the Great Turning,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.950
where there are related
movements around slow issues.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.694
Like fast food is being
replaced by slow food.

00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:02.110
You know about
this slow movement.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.170
There's 6,000 conviviums
around the country.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.150
People get together
and prepare local foods

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.520
and eat them with friends.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.210
Also, of course, having
a more vegetarian diet

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.880
or eating lower on the
food chain, of course,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.300
has less greenhouse gas
emissions, another advantage.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.670
There's also slow
money, which looks

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.300
at how we're
investing our capital.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.310
Is it being invested
in big agribusiness,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.330
for example, that contributes
a lot of chemicals

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.330
and monocultures, or is it going
toward sustainable agriculture?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.140
The issue of work life
balance is actually

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.810
tied into the culture
of "fast and more"

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.340
and the response to it.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.660
So I know here at
Google there's been

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.130
a lot of efforts to have
flextime and other things

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.571
that you're experimenting with.

00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:55.070
You probably know that Carlos
Slim, the world's richest man,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.570
called for a three day work week
recently, and has repeated it

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.150
many times.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.350
He says, it will happen.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.420
He says most recently that he's
realized through his career

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.600
that, really, life is about
more than just working.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.450
And actually you can
get a ton of efficiency

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.310
into these three 11-hour
days, and then have four days

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.490
to refresh yourself,
have creative pursuits

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.100
and come back to work
much more changed.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.154
So I don't know
if you know-- does

00:04:21.154 --> 00:04:23.950
this have a little
pointer on it?

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.580
Yeah, it does.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.280
So the United States,
actually, is the lowest amount

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.250
of leave in the
industrialized world.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.290
We only have 12 days.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.800
And there's this whole Take
Back Your Time movement.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.500
Who's heard of Take Back Your
Time day, October 24 each year?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.347
It's the day when Europeans
could stop working

00:04:43.347 --> 00:04:45.430
and Americans have to work
to the end of the year,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.190
because they get nine
weeks more vacation

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.686
than we do on average a year.

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:51.560
That's how much more.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.530
And these are other
industrialized countries.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.930
So it's a way of saying, I mean,
even medieval peasants worked

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.950
less than we did, in
terms of number of hours.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.330
If you look at how
productivity from 1970-2010

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.630
has actually gone
four folds, including

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.520
using the kind of tools
that you're making, and yet

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.510
our hours have gone up.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.650
Why is it that the
average hour of work

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.780
is four times more
productive, and yet we're

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.250
working more hours,
and much more

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.510
than are industrialized
counterparts?

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.239
Another sort of model
that's out there,

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:22.530
that you may have heard of--
who's heard of transition?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.160
Transition towns?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.470
Very few of you.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.770
Well, basically, the
idea is that we're

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.830
in this era of kind
of fossil fuels

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.550
and we need to get
to more solar, winds.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.480
We're also in an era
of mass organization,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.570
and why not look more at small?

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.627
So small is beautiful.

00:05:43.627 --> 00:05:45.210
Getting back to
models of organization

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.510
at the neighborhood level,
the community level.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.810
So in New York City,
for example there's

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.393
transition neighborhoods in New
York, where you're looking at,

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:54.410
like, how we source our
energy for that neighborhood,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.830
where we get our food.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.830
How can you source
it more effectively?

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.650
So all over the world, and more
so in England than anywhere,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.980
there are these transition
communities really figuring

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.780
out how to be self
sustainable in a world

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.010
where fossil fuels become
less and less viable

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.060
in terms of climate change.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.560
And this is an example of
a sort of transition town

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.170
type of communities
and architecture,

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.210
designing with nature.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.960
Biomimicry, mimicking
the way nature

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.120
creates and creating our
architecture that way,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.160
even in cities-- how we
can look at human well

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.100
being as the basis for how
we're organizing things

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.359
and create around that.

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:33.150
Even walking around
here in Kendall Square,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.680
it's beautiful, MIT is
very nice, all of this,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.727
but what if we
had it even nicer?

00:06:37.727 --> 00:06:39.310
What if there were
more buildings that

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.220
were kind of shaped
around nature?

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.350
There's the whole environmental
psychology, or eco psychology

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.020
area that's out now, that
they're looking at the fact

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.300
that human's
relationship with nature

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.660
is part of our emotional
and social well being.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.220
And when we cut that cord,
we're bound to feel depressed.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.630
And a lot of the kind of
neuroses and bipolar disorders

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.838
and everything is actually
tied to this disconnection

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:02.490
with nature.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.110
E. O. Wilson talks about this
in his biomimicry theory.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.425
So these types of transition and
green architecture activities

00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:10.550
actually help that as well.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.290
So there's all these things
that are in this great turning.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.316
Unfortunately, there is this
culture of fast and more.

00:07:16.316 --> 00:07:18.190
And let me just clarify
that when I say slow,

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.856
I'm not talking about
always going slow.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.356
I'm talking about
being self-paced--

00:07:21.356 --> 00:07:23.522
being able to determine the
rhythm of your own life,

00:07:23.522 --> 00:07:25.270
having the control
of that and to be

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.030
able to vary the
rhythm, the tempo

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.710
gusto, the right speed,
as they say in music.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.420
So we're in this system
where, unfortunately,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.530
the industrial model
of growth is leading

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.360
to this type of water shortage.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.460
Last week in San Paolo they
had massive water shortages,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.510
which caused riots.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.600
This is caused by climate
change and deforestation.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.030
As you know in
China, for example,

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.080
the pollution from
coastal China spreads

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.200
across the rest of Asia.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.140
Their environmental problems
are not respecting boundaries.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.530
And we have, in
Bolivia, where I'm

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.819
currently living-- we left New
York for Bolivia last year,

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:04.360
and that's another story which
I'll tell you about-- but this

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.650
is the example of deep poverty
interacting with cycles

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.980
of slash and burn agriculture,
cutting down the rain forests.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.260
And at the same time
huge monocropping.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.930
So I talked about
slow money, investing

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.510
in sustainable agriculture.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.780
When you just have your
investment in-- this

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.400
is Archer Daniel the
Midlands, ADM in Bolivia,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.970
cutting down huge amounts of
rain forest for our grains

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.680
and so on.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.990
So I mean, you really have to
look at what we're doing here

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.539
and how it's felt
around the world.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.350
For example, this is the
border of Bolivia and Brazil,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.919
where we are right now.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.637
This is Bolivia--
Bolivia, Bolivia, Bolivia.

00:08:44.637 --> 00:08:46.220
And as you can see,
the Brazilian side

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:53.020
is totally cut down for
soy, for chia-- the new crop

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.210
that everyone's growing, for
cattle ranching and so on.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.780
Bolivia is still that
more uninhabited boundary,

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.775
but the same process
is coming there.

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:04.650
Luckily, however, there
is no global warming.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.770
Do you see this?

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.810
Yeah, they just confused
Fahrenheit and Celsius.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.560
There's no problem with global
warming-- not really, of course

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.070
there is.

00:09:16.475 --> 00:09:18.100
I don't have to talk
to you about this.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.058
I'm sure everyone here
knows about the problem.

00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:22.130
I mean, just walk outside today.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.050
Or look at last winter,
how extreme it was.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.070
All of these changes
that we're seeing,

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.380
even here in New England,
is very, very clearly

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.967
even felt more
strongly in places

00:09:31.967 --> 00:09:33.050
like Greenland or Bolivia.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.630
This is Bolivia
Chacaltaya Mountain.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.780
This was Bolivia's
only ski resort.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.630
In just a matter of
decades it's gone

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.996
from being a glacier to nothing.

00:09:42.996 --> 00:09:44.870
So they had to close
the ski resort recently.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.192
It doesn't exist
anymore, because like all

00:09:47.192 --> 00:09:49.150
the other glaciers in
Bolivia, they're melting.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.720
And it's affecting the water
supply for millions of people.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.995
So these are the
types of issues that

00:09:52.995 --> 00:09:54.703
have led even countries
like the Maldives

00:09:54.703 --> 00:09:57.270
to have their cabinet
meetings underwater.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.044
This is the president
of the Maldives,

00:09:59.044 --> 00:10:01.210
and they're actually signing
legislation under water

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.690
to show that their country
is about to go under.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.624
And in my own city in New York,
of course, Hurricane Sandy

00:10:07.624 --> 00:10:09.290
and the effect that
it had, our building

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.120
was out of power for two weeks
and everything was flooded.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.170
There was environmental
refugees in New York.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.045
My students at NYU were in
the Bronx like in shanties.

00:10:17.045 --> 00:10:17.920
It was just terrible.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.790
For two weeks, we
were feeling it there.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.090
And of course, a lot of this
is tied in with, sort of,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.717
subsidies for oil and gas and
hardly anything for renewables.

00:10:25.717 --> 00:10:27.550
But we don't have to
go into that in detail.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.670
So all this anecdotal stuff and
all these different examples

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.400
is tied into a very
stark fact, and that's

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.330
this-- that our
average footprint

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.200
of the average American
is five planets.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.800
This is UN scientists
who say that it

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.650
would take five
planets of resources

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.720
if everyone lived at our
level of consumption.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.480
That is an extreme
point of view.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.270
And the reason is because of
what we call over development.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.310
So there's development,
and then there's

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.170
under development, which is
like maybe 20% of humanity's

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:15.060
underdeveloped, starving,
in war zones without enough.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.500
60% of humanity is
developed, that's

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.385
subsistence, agriculture,
living with enough.

00:11:21.385 --> 00:11:22.760
And then there's
overdevelopment.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.260
Overdevelopment is
taking it too far.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.620
And the kind of mega diversity
that you see in a place

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.950
like Bolivia, unfortunately,
is turning into this.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.000
I just recently
found these photos.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.730
This is the new mall in Santa
Cruz, the first mall in Bolivia

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.347
that's come.

00:11:37.347 --> 00:11:39.680
And it's just amazing to see
the chains, like McDonald's

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.138
and Hard Rock and
everything coming

00:11:41.138 --> 00:11:43.660
into the city and
this enormous mall.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.430
It's really, to
me, quite shocking

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.670
because this is the
Bolivia that I know,

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.990
and this is where
we're going with it.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.950
So I'm talking about a big
philosophical issue that

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.170
actually led me to be
kind of depressed after 10

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.660
years of working.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.565
Yeah, we had prize winning
projects from the JFK school

00:12:02.565 --> 00:12:04.815
in rain forests in Bolivia,
with carbon sequestration.

00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:06.070
We had all kinds of
incredible things

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.560
we were doing that
were successful,

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.910
but with five
planets of resources,

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.020
sometimes it felt
like it was in vain.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.215
So after 10 years of
working abroad-- just

00:12:15.215 --> 00:12:20.330
to tell you a personal story--
I came back to the US in 2007,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.430
and I ended up
living in this cabin.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.180
It was a 12 foot by
12 foot cabin off

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.440
grid in North Carolina.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.620
It's a permaculture farm.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.570
And can you picture what 12
foot by 12 foot is, like how big

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.417
that is?

00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:38.250
AUDIENCE: Less than
what you're standing on.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:38.630
BILL POWERS: Right.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.462
So maybe-- why don't
just do a little thing

00:12:40.462 --> 00:12:41.670
just so we can understand it.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.275
Can you guys, can
you four stand up

00:12:43.275 --> 00:12:45.500
here and try to arrange
yourself 12 by 12.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.920
See if you can do that.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.424
So is that right?

00:12:52.424 --> 00:12:53.870
AUDIENCE: No, [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.352
BILL POWERS: Too big, right!

00:12:55.352 --> 00:12:57.060
I'm probably going
off camera, but let me

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.435
just come down
for a second here.

00:12:58.435 --> 00:13:00.395
So like this is
basically-- yeah,

00:13:00.395 --> 00:13:01.770
maybe you would
have to be here--

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.240
but basically, this was the
12 bu 12 and what it was like.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:04.950
So this is where I lived.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:05.490
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.120
Thank you.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.310
OK.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.726
So just to give
you a visual here,

00:13:07.726 --> 00:13:09.890
I would come into
the house, like this.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:14.640
And there was one bed up
in a loft, a little place

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.751
to cook with natural gas
here, and a rocking chair

00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:21.000
over here in the corner, and
the entrance and candles.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.666
And that was it.

00:13:21.666 --> 00:13:24.960
And this belongs to a physician
in North Carolina, who actually

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.372
downsized from a big house
and moved into this thing.

00:13:27.372 --> 00:13:29.080
And she's been living
in it for 10 years,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.130
and she invited me to
live there for a season.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.365
So you can imagine being
in the middle of American

00:13:34.365 --> 00:13:38.750
and living in this tiny 12
by 12, kind of blew me away.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.900
I was there, actually, spring.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.770
It was like end of
winter into spring.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.890
So even when it's cold,
there's no wood burning stove.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.240
You use more layers.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.430
You know, homo sapiens,
we're a strong species.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.967
We adapt to lots
of environments.

00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:53.300
And that's what I also realized
working around the world

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.232
and living in this
12 by 12, especially,

00:13:55.232 --> 00:13:56.440
was that you can adapt to it.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.300
So this just gives
you a little--

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.880
thank you for showing something.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.130
AUDIENCE: No heat?

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.350
BILL POWERS: No heat at all.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.933
It is North Carolina,
of course, so it

00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:04.747
has to be adapted to whatever
environment you're in.

00:14:04.747 --> 00:14:06.330
And just to give you
some more images,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.920
like this is the model that
this physician, Doctor Jackie

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.820
Benton, is modeling.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:16.560
So there is the 12 by 12, which
only costs $7,000 to build.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.760
$10,000 for her land, two acres
full of permaculture paradise

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.130
of 200 species of crops
and so on, a little no name

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.720
creek over here.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.907
It's this type of a design
with rainwater catchments.

00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:30.990
Yeah, everything off the
grid and she lives there.

00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:36.370
And these are the
types of neighbors,

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.162
you know, you get all
this organic produce.

00:14:38.162 --> 00:14:40.703
It was sort of like what I was
used to experiencing in places

00:14:40.703 --> 00:14:42.620
like Bolivia, but in
the middle of the US.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:48.220
They're designing around open
space and intensive agriculture

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.410
agroforestry, smaller scale.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.400
Just to show you what this
is in terms of the data,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.160
living 12 by 12, or
living more simply,

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.580
it does actually bring joy
because, actually, happiness

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.585
and well-being increases
very quickly if you're poor,

00:15:10.585 --> 00:15:12.782
if you're very poor--
like $9,000 in GDP.

00:15:12.782 --> 00:15:13.990
But then it kind of plateaus.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.930
So this is the basic idea,
that happiness, of course,

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.832
it goes up with money, but
then it plateaus is the idea.

00:15:20.832 --> 00:15:23.290
So when I came back to New York
City after living in the 12

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.060
by 12, I found that
our townhouse that we

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.150
own in Queens, my wife
and I, was just too big.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.190
It was 2000 square feet.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.035
So we moved to this
tiny apartment.

00:15:33.035 --> 00:15:35.160
This is just examples--
this is not our apartment--

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.360
but of a micro apartment in
Manhattan, 340 square feet.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.509
So it was like two 12
by 12s put together.

00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:42.050
And we experimented
for a year living

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.990
very minimalist in the belly
of the beast, New York City.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.480
And it was actually
quite fascinating

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.890
because we started to
see our micro apartment--

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.140
and by the way, this is part
of Bloomberg's initiative

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.080
for everyone to live in smaller
apartments, lower rents and so

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.450
on-- we thought of it as a ship.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.079
We designed it as a ship.

00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:04.120
Everything had its place.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.920
There was no more clutter.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.410
We just felt, in
some ways, happier

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.910
because we knew where everything
was and we had less stuff

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.140
to worry about.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.440
So there was some
advantages to minimalizing

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.270
and you know, lower rents.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.977
I also reduced my working
hours by a lot, basically

00:16:21.977 --> 00:16:23.810
to the three hour work
week that Carlos Slim

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.740
is calling for--
three day work week.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.545
And I just think that these
technologies that you all

00:16:31.545 --> 00:16:34.450
are involved in are beautiful
things if they're your tool

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.610
and you're not their fool.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.110
If you're actually using
them for liberating yourself

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.610
from the work and
spend treadmill,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.480
from giving yourself
more free time

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.990
to enjoy your family,
friends, nature, your hobbies,

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.312
what you love to do.

00:16:49.312 --> 00:16:50.770
Think of things
that you love to do

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.144
and imagine doing them five
times more than you are right

00:16:53.144 --> 00:16:54.316
now.

00:16:54.316 --> 00:16:56.670
I hope this is not too
subversive a thought

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.080
for being in the office
on a Monday morning.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.720
But the idea is that I was
working, honestly, a two

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.750
day work week for the
good part of that year

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.619
that we lived slow,
and just enjoying

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:10.880
so much more about the city.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.010
And just working smarter
instead of harder

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.480
and it was this whole
other philosophy.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.540
Really, just to switch it, what
it comes down to, in some ways,

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.079
is a Greek word
that Aristotle used

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.960
to talk about a lot,
which is eudaimonia.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.558
It's "what is the best life."

00:17:26.558 --> 00:17:28.349
That's what the Greeks
would struggle with,

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.190
and that's what
we don't struggle

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.590
with enough these days.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.390
It's like, what is
the economy for?

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:34.900
What is work for?

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.410
How do we create this best life?

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.720
I'm not going to give you
my entire graduate course

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.850
in economic development
right now, but just

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.840
to let you know that there are
various perspectives on what

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.010
development is.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.460
OK?

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.910
What we think is development
is growth economics.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.874
That's the dominant paradigm.

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:56.290
And then there's
a hybrid of that,

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.970
which is the human development
paradigm, like the HDI

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.867
index, which says, oh we should
bring people into development.

00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:03.450
It's not just about
growing economies.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.030
We have to think about people.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.050
But there are these
wonderful critiques,

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.380
innovators in theory and
practice and development

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.250
who are saying, biocentrism,
post development-- I recommend

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.400
Arturo Escobar.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.450
He has a book called
"Encountering Developments",

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.116
which is genius.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:28.160
David Abrams' work on "The
Spell of the Sensuous",

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.540
more biocentric points of views.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.130
Escobar, for example,
this anthropologist

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.560
says we need to look at
the West, our own culture,

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.870
as exotic.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.600
Very difficult to do,
but this is exotic,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.302
this kind of deforestation,
this is exotic.

00:18:45.302 --> 00:18:46.760
So there's the
country of Nacirema,

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.888
do you know where that is?

00:18:47.888 --> 00:18:49.262
Nacirema, have
you heard of this?

00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:50.875
AUDIENCE: Backwards America.

00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:51.750
BILL POWERS: Exactly.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.300
It's American spelled backwards.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.930
So you just reverse
the way you look

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.710
at our own culture for a second.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.930
It looks very different.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.234
This we talked about,
biocentrism and expanding

00:19:05.234 --> 00:19:06.525
emotional connection to nature.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:17.660
Very key ideas of-- even when
you think about your work

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.290
at Google, or how you
organize your time and so

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.650
on, is it possible
for a second to look

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.820
at things from the
perspective of other species,

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.550
not just an anthropocentric
point of view of how this

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.940
benefits our species, but
how it benefits the whole?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.460
And you immediately have this
shift in your consciousness,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.890
where you just feel more
aligned with the world.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:39.800
You feel happier.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.940
You feel like what you're
doing is more inclusive.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.540
I'm not saying you
have to become a vegan,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.350
and I'm not a vegetarian myself.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.270
But I'm just saying that
there's this way of seeing

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.540
the world that's very
different from how we see it.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:59.240
And these more critical
development theorists

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.280
are pointing that way.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.150
You are now entering
a stress free zone.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.530
So the point of this
is that-- I just want

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.450
to share most recently--
we, my wife and I,

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.740
took another kind
of experimental step

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.101
because we're always
kind of life hacking,

00:20:17.101 --> 00:20:19.600
figuring out how to do things
differently and experimenting.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.016
Because you only
live once and you

00:20:21.016 --> 00:20:23.210
might as well push
your boundaries.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.750
So we actually
moved from New York

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.350
after we were there
for five years.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.070
We moved down to Bolivia.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.910
So now I'm coming to
you here from a town

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.320
of 4,000 people,
where the Andes meets

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.800
the Amazon in central Bolivia.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.220
It's a beautiful town
called called Samaipata.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.330
It's where the Andes
elbows into the Amazon.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.570
So you see it's like
forested-- this is Samaipata--

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:52.130
but also there's
mountainous climate.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:56.129
And there's people
from 30 countries here.

00:20:56.129 --> 00:20:57.670
A lot of people are
innovating around

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.980
different aspects of
what I'm talking about.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.250
Slow money, slow
living, permaculture,

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.660
which is combining
architecture with landscape

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.560
design in harmony with
nature, all these ideas.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.110
And it's a very
beautiful place to be.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.270
Also right now,
in Bolivia, do you

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.430
know that they have the Law
of Mother Earth as their macro

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.050
law?

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.210
It sounds kind of crazy.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.000
But the idea is that the earth
has nine indelible rights,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.920
and you can sue
corporations for violating

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.600
the rights of Pachamama,
as they call it.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.790
So for them the
most important thing

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.730
is Pachamama, because
all life comes from that.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:42.370
And so the right to life and
to exist, vital functions

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.080
of the ecosystem, all
of that is legislated.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.010
Now, they're not perfect
in implementing it,

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.666
but they do have this new
framework that they're saying.

00:21:49.666 --> 00:21:52.290
So a lot of what we're doing at
the local level in a transition

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.584
town relates to the
national policy.

00:21:55.584 --> 00:21:57.500
And Bolivia is kind of
basing some other stuff

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.041
around the fact that-- this is
another way of looking at what

00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:02.540
I showed you before--
as personal income

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.050
increases, the percentage of
people identifying themselves

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.880
as very happy stays the same.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.790
This is in the United
States over the years.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:17.110
So they're saying, OK well
if that's the case then

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.390
how do you have a
living well policy?

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:21.970
And that's, by the
way, what Bolivia

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.100
has as their other sort
of norm is living well.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.058
Have you heard of this?

00:22:25.058 --> 00:22:27.910
Living well, vivir
bien, in Spanish?

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.280
What's our philosophy in the US?

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.350
Is it vivir bien?

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.730
Is it living well, or
what would you say it is?

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.010
What's the dominant ethos?

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.750
AUDIENCE: Work hard, play hard.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.210
BILL POWERS: Work
hard, play hard?

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:44.460
That's probably Google's ethos,
but what about the American--

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.690
maybe work hard, play hard--
but what would you say?

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:47.460
More.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.050
Yeah, more.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.200
Better, right?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.510
Living better.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.386
In Bolivia, it's Quechua,
Aymara, Guarani, Chiquitano,

00:22:54.386 --> 00:22:55.510
it's an indigenous country.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.530
It's 75% indigenous.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.660
Their philosophy is living well.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.160
So you get to a certain
point of development,

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.400
like whatever, you know
like the other graph

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.066
where you get to
certain point, and then

00:23:08.066 --> 00:23:09.569
you have a steady state economy.

00:23:09.569 --> 00:23:11.360
That's what Herman Daly
has been telling us

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.659
for years-- this
famous economist-- that

00:23:13.659 --> 00:23:15.700
just like the human body
grows to a certain level

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.275
and then stops growing
and maintains equilibrium

00:23:18.275 --> 00:23:20.411
and health, so too
should our economy grow

00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:21.910
to a certain level
and then not have

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.100
to have this hyper
development path.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.360
So Bolivia is playing
with that creative edge

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.570
of how to do an economy
at a national level

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.850
according to living
well and not better.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.460
It's an interesting thing.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.370
Just to show you, this is our
house that we just finished.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.650
Small house, we used some
of the minimalism design.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.420
This whole house we built out
of adobe from our own land.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.500
This is where the
adobe was dug up.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.800
It's thermal mass 40 cm.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.560
It maintains 22 degrees Celsius
all year round with no heating

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.030
or cooling because of the adobe.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.030
There was no embedded
carbon because it was just

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.380
baked by the sun right
there on our property.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.480
And it's beautiful.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.500
We have beautiful
windows and double doors,

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.250
but it's minimalist,
beautiful and ecological.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.400
Like all of our waste is
reused, it goes to banana trees.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.260
The sewage goes into a
tank that gets filtered

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.070
through different
plants and everything.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.670
And the grey water is
going to a composting area.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.430
So this is what we're kind
of experimenting with there,

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.430
another example of
ecological architecture.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.740
I like this cartoon.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.660
So you know, what if we created
a better world for nothing?

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.540
That's almost like
the best you can say.

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.110
I think we need to just keep
pushing our boundaries, just

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.600
to sum up what I've
been talking about.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.800
Getting more creative,
keeping in mind

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.940
the Earth's biophysical
limits in our decisions,

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.660
having a more ecocentric
point of view,

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.312
trying to find more happiness
and joy in work life balance,

00:24:54.312 --> 00:24:55.520
all of this is tied together.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.310
All of it's tied to the big
challenge of our time, which

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.590
is confronting this
culture of fast and more

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.070
that's contributing to ecocide,
or the destruction of life's

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:09.520
vital processes, and
finding new system.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.600
A system that's based more in
principles of a steady state

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.800
economy, of transition towns,
of a slower, saner, fit

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.060
for the future type of a life.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.880
And I think every single
one of us has a role.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.220
Like in this room,
whatever you're

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.740
doing here or in your
civic organizations

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.080
in your free time or whatever,
you have a role in this change.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.370
And I would just
encourage you to think

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.390
about what that role could be.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.400
And I hope that you read
my book "New Slow City",

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.290
which Jonathan was nice
enough to get for all of you.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.870
The book is not really lecturing
as to what you should do,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.590
but I think it's opening
up a lot of questions

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.310
about ways that we
can push ourselves

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.720
to think about these things more
deeply, enjoy life more fully,

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.020
be less tethered to
other people's agendas

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.365
and to big systems of control.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.150
And I hope that you
enjoyed this presentation.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.230
I'm happy to answer
any questions you have.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.186
So thank you.

00:26:17.186 --> 00:26:20.042
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:21.370
BILL POWERS: Yes?

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.203
AUDIENCE: On the previous
slide, what are we

00:26:23.203 --> 00:26:24.820
looking at on the bottom right?

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.800
BILL POWERS: Well this is what's
called skyscraper agriculture.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.110
So in just one
recycled tower like

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.800
that you can produce food
for like 50 square blocks.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.900
This is Brooklyn Grange,
it's an idea, it's a model.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.700
This is Brooklyn Grange in
Long Island City, New York,

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.809
where I take my
students for NYU.

00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:45.100
It was started by NYU students.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.500
It's the world's largest
rooftop organic farm.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.000
So on the old
Standard Oil building,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.370
they produce well over an
acre of intensively cropped

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.970
organic agriculture that
just goes on the subway

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.304
and goes to the restaurants
in New York City.

00:26:59.304 --> 00:27:00.220
It's a brilliant idea.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.880
It's employing all these people.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.240
They're outside working.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.140
They're on the
roof of a building.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.950
They have all these
new ultralight soils

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:07.490
that can go on the roof.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.214
So this is what
exists now, and one

00:27:09.214 --> 00:27:10.380
of the ideas for the future.

00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:13.490
Yeah?

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.905
AUDIENCE: What do you think
of vertical agriculture

00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:18.320
and how far has it come.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.200
How close is it
[INAUDIBLE] being achieved?

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.920
BILL POWERS: It's
expanding rapidly.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.050
Like in New York,
this Brooklyn Grange

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:30.260
expanded 150 percent last
year to the Brooklyn Navy Yard

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.360
rooftops that they've
now taken over.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.330
On a commercial level there's
greenhouse rooftop agriculture

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.050
coming in.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:42.410
This is soil farms, that's
even more productive.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.170
These new soils that
they have, and it's

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.230
easy to use a variety
of roofs-- if they just

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.480
used 10% of New York's
roofs they could feed

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.050
the entire city-- but
there's also, let's

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.652
not forget, 600 green
thumb community gardens

00:27:54.652 --> 00:27:56.860
that are provided sometimes
by the city, where people

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.960
are doing urban agriculture in
lots and producing lots of food

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.050
on the ground, too.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.050
So that's another important
part of the picture.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:07.850
Yeah, OK.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:08.350
So?

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.542
AUDIENCE: I just had a question.

00:28:09.542 --> 00:28:10.958
How do you make
money while you're

00:28:10.958 --> 00:28:13.885
living in Bolivia [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:13.885 --> 00:28:15.260
BILL POWERS: How
do I make money?

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.240
Well, so do you
know Juliet Schor

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.280
the economist at Boston College?

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.110
She wrote a lot about this.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.380
She has a book
called "True Wealth",

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.600
where she talks about
self-provisioning.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.444
So in the new economy, those
of us sitting in this room

00:28:32.444 --> 00:28:34.360
are lucky enough to have
these types of skills

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.190
that be done anywhere.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.314
Like that photo I have of
the woman with her laptop

00:28:37.314 --> 00:28:38.724
and her feet in
the water, that's

00:28:38.724 --> 00:28:40.640
what I love about these
wonderful tools is you

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.350
can be anywhere.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.580
For me personally, I have
multiple income streams from

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.000
different things-- from speaking
engagements, from writing,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.450
from teaching, from--

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.030
AUDIENCE: --travel to the
place where you write, then

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.280
you had to have power
to power your device.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.613
BILL POWERS: Right, that's true.

00:28:57.613 --> 00:29:02.630
Well so power, we're
actually set up for solar,

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.580
but, as of now,
we're using the town

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:09.070
power, which is natural gas.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.570
Yeah.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:10.945
So we're not saying
that you have

00:29:10.945 --> 00:29:15.380
to be a radical, off the grid,
self sufficient lifestyle.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.700
I mean, that's possible,
but I talk about it

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.680
as part of being
self sufficient-ish.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.380
Right?

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.420
Kind of self sufficient.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.170
So we're able to produce
a lot of our food

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.670
just right there in front of
that little house that you saw.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.200
We produce a lot of
our food year round.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.530
And we have 30 kinds
of fruit trees growing

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.550
and everything else.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.660
We're developing a
little cottage industry

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.035
kind of on the land,
as one income stream.

00:29:37.035 --> 00:29:39.535
There's the writing, my wife
does a little bit of consulting

00:29:39.535 --> 00:29:41.190
at the UN, like
three months a year.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:44.410
So you piece that all together
and it adds up to plenty.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:49.319
And if you've minimized
your expenses, too you know.

00:29:49.319 --> 00:29:50.360
And that's another thing.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.310
I recommend Vicki Robin
and Joe Dominguez's book

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:55.060
"Your Money or Your
Life", which shows you

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:59.430
how to really look at
what expenses in your life

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.870
don't give you the proper
joy to stuff ratio.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:03.540
You know?

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.750
Like how much joy
are you getting out

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.708
of a particular purchase,
that type of an idea.

00:30:06.708 --> 00:30:07.296
We did that.

00:30:07.296 --> 00:30:09.670
We analyzed it very carefully
and we reduced our expenses

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:10.836
by lot.

00:30:10.836 --> 00:30:12.210
And we also look
at, like OK, how

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.674
do you increase
your hourly income

00:30:14.674 --> 00:30:15.840
in a certain amount of time.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.660
Even some of the
Tim Ferriss stuff

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:22.850
about like 80/20 principle,
that you get 20% of your results

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.870
from 80% of your activity.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.870
So why not do more
in the 20% that

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.919
gives you 80% of the results?

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:31.210
So working smarter in that way.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.710
So these are all a
package of things

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.650
that we've applied to
achieve an independence

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.895
from the typical work system.

00:30:37.895 --> 00:30:38.395
Yeah?

00:30:38.395 --> 00:30:39.950
AUDIENCE: Do you have
children to support?

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:40.866
BILL POWERS: Yes I do.

00:30:40.866 --> 00:30:42.200
I've got two children.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:47.170
Two daughters, ages one
and a half, and nine.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.630
Yeah, I think like, for
example, raising them

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.910
in Bolivia versus New
York City is, for me,

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.350
far better because
you're in a culture that

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.320
is more ecocentric,
more indigenous.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.050
They're very nature-based.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.900
And quite frankly,
we're not tied to work,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.401
so we're with our
kids all the time.

00:31:05.401 --> 00:31:06.983
You know, it's like
we're able to just

00:31:06.983 --> 00:31:08.180
be with them a lot more.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.500
And they're very in-tuned
to our little creek

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:18.236
and to the fruit trees, and
they're growing up bilingual.

00:31:18.236 --> 00:31:19.360
There's lots of advantages.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.120
I'm not saying that everyone
has to move to Bolivia,

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.595
and you're probably
not going to,

00:31:22.595 --> 00:31:25.687
but for us, that
was one edge to push

00:31:25.687 --> 00:31:27.270
that I thought was
really interesting.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.978
AUDIENCE: I was actually
going to ask you

00:31:28.978 --> 00:31:30.700
what led you to that
town in Bolivia?

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.150
And were there other
places you considered?

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.410
BILL POWERS: Well,
you know, Samaipata,

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:39.560
which is a Quechua word for
resting in the highlands,

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.819
happened to just really
attract both of us.

00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:45.360
I think that everyone would have
their own place in the world

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.050
that they feel best.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.750
But for us, I had a
writing fellowship there

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.490
once that they had this
artist's house there that I went

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.660
and, wow!

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.050
Just like, low cost of
living, relatively speaking,

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:01.240
which is true anywhere
in the developing world.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.792
And just beautiful national
park and Inca ruins,

00:32:04.792 --> 00:32:06.750
and just this gorgeous
kind of a place to live,

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.090
good climate year round.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.650
But also just the fact
that you can kind of,

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.250
we call it decolonizing--
sorry that's

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.810
a very academic
term-- decolonizing

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.620
some of our ingrained
habits of over consumption

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.450
and competitiveness
that we found.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.900
We're both from Ivy League
colleges and all this stuff,

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.100
and from a certain background.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.550
But we're kinds of decolonizing
a little bit of that ethos.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.050
And we thought that Samaipata
would be a good place to do it

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:35.880
and it is.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.422
It really is.

00:32:36.422 --> 00:32:38.838
AUDIENCE: Are there other
people sharing your [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:38.838 --> 00:32:39.920
BILL POWERS: Absolutely.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.450
There are.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:41.560
Yeah there are.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.240
In fact, like I said,
there are people

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.864
from 30 countries
that have come there.

00:32:43.864 --> 00:32:46.600
It's still only 5% of the
village is foreigners, mostly

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.100
Bolivian, which is
nice, nice balance.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.210
But there's
definitely a community

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.284
of like-- our friends are
ecological architects,

00:32:53.284 --> 00:32:55.200
like the one who designed
our house-- everyone

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.949
lives in the town.

00:32:55.949 --> 00:33:00.630
And 80% of what we consume is
produced there in the town.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:05.989
So it's very local and
organic and everything else.

00:33:05.989 --> 00:33:07.280
There are hardships, of course.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.488
Not easy, it's not like here.

00:33:08.488 --> 00:33:10.660
I come back to the
States and you pop up

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.560
on the T in Kendall
Square and it

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.810
has all those beautiful
buildings and stuff like that.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.750
It's harder.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:16.915
It's on the land.

00:33:16.915 --> 00:33:18.540
There's a dirt road
going to our house,

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.248
even though we live
right by the village.

00:33:20.248 --> 00:33:22.340
You're working more,
but like I said,

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.790
humans are a tough species.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.340
We can adapt to these things.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.970
Actually, harder is better.

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.950
I can do hard.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:29.500
I like that.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.291
I like having to struggle
a little bit more

00:33:31.291 --> 00:33:33.040
and not having it be too easy.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.316
That's my perspective.

00:33:34.316 --> 00:33:34.815
Yeah?

00:33:34.815 --> 00:33:37.135
AUDIENCE: So especially
with multiple jobs

00:33:37.135 --> 00:33:38.888
and you say you work harder.

00:33:38.888 --> 00:33:40.760
I'm having a difficult
time balancing that

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.982
with your statement of
working three days, not four.

00:33:44.982 --> 00:33:49.045
What does working
mean and what do you

00:33:49.045 --> 00:33:50.232
do with those other four?

00:33:50.232 --> 00:33:51.690
Are they really
not-- just curious.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.648
BILL POWERS: So did
everyone hear that question

00:33:53.648 --> 00:33:55.460
about what am I doing
the other four days?

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.220
Oh you didn't hear it?

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.490
He's just saying
how is it possible--

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.770
I'm mentioning all these
different things that I'm

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.353
doing, how is it possible that
there's actually the free time?

00:34:01.353 --> 00:34:01.865
Right?

00:34:01.865 --> 00:34:02.948
AUDIENCE: Well, just yeah.

00:34:02.948 --> 00:34:05.939
What are you defining
the free time as?

00:34:05.939 --> 00:34:07.480
BILL POWERS: That's
a great question.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.592
But I definitely, when I
was doing the two day work

00:34:10.592 --> 00:34:12.800
week-- which went to a four
day work week in New York

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.080
halfway through the book, kind
of had to change, but still

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.600
three day weekends-- I clocked
in every five minute interval.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.270
Whenever I was an a laptop at
all or doing anything related

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.535
to an income stream,
that was work,

00:34:27.535 --> 00:34:29.909
and it counted towards my two,
or three, or four day work

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:30.580
week.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.650
OK?

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.870
Now, because we take
these big creativity

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.095
sabbaticals where we're
not doing anything

00:34:37.095 --> 00:34:38.719
and we disconnect
from devices and take

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:41.889
these internet sabbaticals
and so on, and vacation auto

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:43.360
response, and we just tune out.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.250
Like a lot of times we're just
like concentrated on growing

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.330
food, hiking, going back
to beautiful places hiking,

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:52.550
we love to be outside,
being with family

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.199
in a non-connected
way through work.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.850
The problem is the
work constantly

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:57.850
comes through the phone.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:01.130
AUDIENCE: So you call growing
food part of the non work?

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.410
BILL POWERS: Yes, definitely.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:02.910
Yeah.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:09.530
AUDIENCE: That's what I
was going to ask you, too.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.460
So food production is not
part of your income stream?

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:17.000
BILL POWERS: Well it is in
the sense that it's, yeah,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.700
it is self-provisioning.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.420
But it just doesn't
feel like work

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.594
at the level we're doing it.

00:35:23.594 --> 00:35:25.135
It's not like we
have this huge farm.

00:35:25.135 --> 00:35:28.630
We're producing it just
intensively around the house

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.180
and fruit tree
production, and so on,

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.260
like maybe 10 hours
a week or less

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.760
that we're actually
putting into it.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.050
We're not turning
into this big thing.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.550
I guess what I didn't say is a
lot of really what this comes

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.966
down to-- and I don't know if
this appeals to you or not--

00:35:40.966 --> 00:35:44.460
but for me and for my wife and
our kids, what appeals to us

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.819
is doing nothing, too.

00:35:45.819 --> 00:35:47.360
I mean, oh god, it
sounds so radical.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.760
But taking four or five hours
a day and just doing nothing,

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:56.570
like just walking behind our
house, or just meditation.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.857
Or literally, and
this sounds crazy,

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:02.440
like walking to your neighbors
and just hanging out with them.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.060
Like people do that
in this village.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.340
You just stop by and
have tea with someone.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.580
Or you just sit in your
hammock for a couple hours,

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.666
like all of these things.

00:36:11.666 --> 00:36:13.040
It's like the way
we used to live

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.730
when I was a kid in the
'70s, or something like that.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:19.121
Before we got into this
culture of a lot of speed,

00:36:19.121 --> 00:36:21.246
it's that more relaxed
summer vacation type of feel

00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:22.660
that we bring to
our whole lives.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.534
Does that make sense?

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.390
So we consciously
integrate all of that

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:31.227
into our lives, that free
time and that nothing time.

00:36:31.227 --> 00:36:32.560
It comes actually out of Africa.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.870
I lived in Africa for a couple
years, and what I realized

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.120
was that people had to spend
four or five hours a day

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.500
doing nothing, playing soccer,
sitting in the hammocks,

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.860
or they weren't happy.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.090
They have this leisure ethic
instead of a work ethic.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:45.465
And that's kind
of what taught me

00:36:45.465 --> 00:36:47.924
about this idea of not
always being-- yeah?

00:36:47.924 --> 00:36:50.460
AUDIENCE: Why no wood
stove in the cabin?

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.750
BILL POWERS: Why no wood
stove in the 12 by 12?

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.860
There is a space
for a wood stove,

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.670
and the physician that
lives there to this day

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:01.290
could've put one
in, but she did not.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.440
She decided that she
was just perfectly happy

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.610
being cold when it got cold
and putting on extra layers

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.434
and making more tea.

00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:10.210
AUDIENCE: Cold when
it's 10 below outside?

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.209
BILL POWERS: Well, I mean,
it is North Carolina.

00:37:12.209 --> 00:37:15.580
So it's not Boston.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.280
So it gets down to 20,
sometimes, at the coldest.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.966
But it's usually like 30s
or 40s at the very coldest.

00:37:24.966 --> 00:37:26.900
AUDIENCE: Is there a washroom?

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.360
BILL POWERS: In the 12 by 12?

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:28.925
OK.

00:37:28.925 --> 00:37:31.760
The 12 by 12 has two porches
in the front the back.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.040
And the back porch has
a composting toilet.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.320
There's this-- have you
heard of, you probably

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.403
haven't-- but it's called
the "Humanure Handbook."

00:37:37.403 --> 00:37:41.176
It's a contraction of human
manure, "Humanure Handbook."

00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:43.550
Teaches you all the different
types of composting toilets

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:44.040
you can make.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.081
That was right there on
the shelf when I arrived.

00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:48.430
And I had to figure
how to use this thing.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:50.221
But basically, you go
out on the back porch

00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:52.830
and it's like a five
gallon bucket, hidden,

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.410
and then there's a toilet seat.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.320
And there are cedar
chips beside it.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.100
And when it fills up, you
just dump it in a compost pile

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.950
and it becomes compost.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:01.830
That's it.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:02.640
It's very simple.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.550
It doesn't smell at all.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.107
And then the water for
washing was a solar shower

00:38:08.107 --> 00:38:09.440
that I'd put out in the morning.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.481
The sun would heat it up.

00:38:10.481 --> 00:38:12.785
You hang it from a
tree and you shower.

00:38:12.785 --> 00:38:14.910
And then, the water for
washing up dishes and stuff

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.034
was also on the back porch.

00:38:16.034 --> 00:38:18.780
And that's just from rainwater
catchment from the house.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.380
So she's got this whole system
that she applies and lives off

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:21.880
of.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.229
It liberates her time.

00:38:23.229 --> 00:38:24.770
She donates her time
as a doctor now.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.302
She doesn't even have to
really work for money.

00:38:27.302 --> 00:38:28.264
Yeah?

00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:30.669
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
this is a legitimate question.

00:38:30.669 --> 00:38:34.517
Help me form it into a question.

00:38:34.517 --> 00:38:36.441
How much land do you
need of agriculture

00:38:36.441 --> 00:38:37.890
for a person to live off of?

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.502
BILL POWERS: That's
a great question.

00:38:39.502 --> 00:38:40.960
Jonathan, is it
possible to pass me

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.670
that-- I guess I
could just grab it.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.690
If you'll just pass me
that bottle of water?

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.160
Four and 1/2 acres is
what-- OK, the question

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.990
is how much land you need
to live off of, right?

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.310
Thanks a lot.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.550
Agronomists have said that with
four and a half acres, which

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:59.570
is a little bit-- we
have five, five and 1/2--

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.070
every person on the
planet, even all

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:04.140
seven billion people
organized in families--

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.160
could have 4 and 1/2 acres each
and live very sustainably off

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.236
of that.

00:39:09.236 --> 00:39:10.860
And there would be
lots of wild forests

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.901
and lots of conservation.

00:39:11.901 --> 00:39:15.432
Doesn't sound
realistic, but it is.

00:39:15.432 --> 00:39:17.140
There's a lot of
acreage we're using just

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.184
in ridiculously
ineffective ways.

00:39:19.184 --> 00:39:21.100
AUDIENCE: So 4 and 1/2
per person, per family?

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.035
BILL POWERS: Per family.

00:39:22.035 --> 00:39:22.534
Yeah.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.316
We could easily
live off our land.

00:39:27.316 --> 00:39:29.635
I mean, the soil
is so productive--

00:39:29.635 --> 00:39:31.317
AUDIENCE: Not living
in Somerville.

00:39:31.317 --> 00:39:32.900
BILL POWERS: Not
living in Somerville.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:33.400
Yeah.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.490
I'm just saying you could, think
about it, anyone in this room,

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:39.540
either this year or
within five years easily,

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.530
could do what we did
if you wanted to.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.200
You could liquidate
what you have here

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.550
and get something so
beautiful somewhere else where

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.170
the cost of living is
lower and you could do it.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.310
I'm not saying you're gonna.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:56.500
But you have that power
and the resources.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.000
Yeah?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.297
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
you were [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:03.520
Is that the case?

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.360
BILL POWERS: I still am on
the adjunct faculty at NYU

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.920
and I bring students to Bolivia
and I teach the sustainable

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.170
development global
field intensive,

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.432
where we look at models of
how to develop sustainably.

00:40:14.432 --> 00:40:15.890
Like with these
graduates students.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:19.660
So I'm not on a sabbatical.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.660
I meant like I'm on a
creativity sabbatical that

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.802
means-- we come up
with our own lexicon.

00:40:23.802 --> 00:40:26.260
I don't know if you ever read
"Mountains Beyond Mountains",

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.130
Paul Farmer, the
physician at Harvard.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.200
They created the whole lexicon
around poverty, reduction,

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:33.700
and so on.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.616
We have a whole lexicon
around all this stuff.

00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:38.270
So creativity
sabbaticals just means

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:41.120
I'm not going to work
for, like, two months,

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.080
and we're going to
just develop new ideas.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.940
Whatever we want.

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.065
Like in other words, we're
not tied to anyone else.

00:40:47.065 --> 00:40:49.450
So we're going to come up
with new-- that's what it is.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.022
So writing a new book.

00:40:52.022 --> 00:40:53.480
Whatever creative
project, starting

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.570
some kind of cottage industry.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.611
Whatever it is, that's
our creativity sabbatical.

00:40:56.611 --> 00:40:59.687
AUDIENCE: I was asking do
you have an end date to leave

00:40:59.687 --> 00:41:01.584
your life over
there and come back?

00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:03.000
BILL POWERS: Do I
have an end date

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.880
to leave my life over
there and come back?

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.750
No.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.580
Not really.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.410
I mean, we do have
our place in New York.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.140
We just rent it out.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.510
Another income stream.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:16.940
But--

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.440
AUDIENCE: I was asking because
your approach to your life

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.420
could have been different if
you had a time limit applied.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:22.920
OK.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.395
I will live there like
two years and then

00:41:25.395 --> 00:41:26.880
I will go back to my other life.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:32.600
BILL POWERS: As far
as we're concerned,

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.240
I've never been happier
than I am now in this town,

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.480
living at this smallest
beautiful scale with community.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.700
Everyone knows me.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.160
We have beautiful nature.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.620
It's like, what
more could we want?

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.420
In terms of having the absolute
best schools and so on,

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.150
I mean, again that's
another idea in our heads

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.460
that you have to have
the perfect everything

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.540
for your kids.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.710
So I'm notching that down.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:59.110
I'm realizing that
Amaya and Clea may not

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:02.140
have the absolute
best of everything.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.745
We're going to give them a
wonderful life and education

00:42:04.745 --> 00:42:06.900
and basis and they
can go from there.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:12.500
But maybe it won't be even
the level my wife and I had.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.240
But it's like, I do think that
this kind of disease-- you

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.896
might even call it a disease--
around kind of over educating

00:42:21.896 --> 00:42:23.270
our kids or
overstimulating them.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:25.320
Like this sort of
helicopter parenting

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.867
and over scheduling kids is not
going in the right direction,

00:42:28.867 --> 00:42:29.450
in my opinion.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:33.030
Yeah?

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.404
AUDIENCE: What are some of
the most surprising things you

00:42:35.404 --> 00:42:38.321
learned about yourself in this
transition to live slowly?

00:42:38.321 --> 00:42:40.320
BILL POWERS: What are the
most surprising things

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.445
I learned about myself in
this transition to living

00:42:42.445 --> 00:42:43.650
more slowly?

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:48.420
That you can find a lot
more happiness and joy

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.470
in unexpected ways.

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:55.480
That when you tie your
self esteem and everything

00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:00.420
to your position in life
and your amount of income

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.780
and your status, you're
bound to always be unhappy

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.960
because there's
always someone higher.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.730
As soon as you get
rid of that idea,

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.980
and you step out of this culture
and into a culture like Bolivia

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.712
where nobody has those ideas,
or it's a very low idea.

00:43:13.712 --> 00:43:15.420
Much higher is how
interconnected are you

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.400
with others.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.680
It's like people are people
through other people.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.220
It surprised me that,
oh, I get self esteem

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.540
from just being
helpful to people

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.120
and being part of this group.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.580
So that's one of the things.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:30.528
Yeah?

00:43:30.528 --> 00:43:31.950
AUDIENCE: Just one thought.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.742
A couple family friends
who sort of downsized,

00:43:35.742 --> 00:43:39.450
one challenge, especially in the
US, is their medical expenses.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.940
Say you reduce
your income and you

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.332
live-- I have a friend who's
a captain on a boat, lives

00:43:44.332 --> 00:43:45.075
on a boat.

00:43:45.075 --> 00:43:45.926
Very low income.

00:43:45.926 --> 00:43:47.550
Another one a
perpetually touring band,

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:49.530
another one in a small cabin.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:50.520
You know?

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.995
And it's great, but
the US is particularly

00:43:52.995 --> 00:43:56.960
challenged because the
medical system we have.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.425
You see anything in
different cultures that

00:43:59.425 --> 00:44:02.140
or are economists
thinking about that?

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.640
BILL POWERS: I'm amazed at how
a country like Bolivia, which

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.180
is the second poorest,
economically, in Latin America

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.560
has almost a better
medical system than we do.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.875
For our baby daughter,
a doctor would

00:44:13.875 --> 00:44:16.810
come like every two months to
our house and check up on her

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:17.990
and then give her the
shots there with the nurse.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.770
This whole team would come.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:20.980
They'd go around to
everyone's house and do it.

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.669
How are they able to do that?

00:44:22.669 --> 00:44:23.710
My mom was down visiting.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:24.543
She had an accident.

00:44:24.543 --> 00:44:26.364
We went to the hospital
in Samaipata there.

00:44:26.364 --> 00:44:27.780
They treated her
right away and it

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.300
was 30 Bolivianos was the bill.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.760
Four dollars.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.434
I don't understand.

00:44:32.434 --> 00:44:33.600
It's a socialist government.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.110
The government is socialist.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:38.670
And they have these policies
they're redistributing.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.780
They tax the companys
at high levels,

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.030
like the oil and gas companies,
the mining companies,

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.330
and they just redistribute
to health and education.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.430
So that's part of it.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.830
And so it's
universal, basically.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:53.080
The care, obviously, is not
the Harvard Medical School

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.370
facility, obviously.

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:56.520
Again, we've seen
it as accepting

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.400
a slightly lower level of care.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.490
You know, we can go to
Santa Cruz two hours away

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.950
if we really needed
something that

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:07.250
was US level or close to it.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.410
But on a daily
basis, we're not tied

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:13.110
into super high powered medical.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.400
We do have insurance.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.490
Someone like us
living-- you can have

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.960
an evacuation plan, very cheap.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.780
And you can have
catastrophic, like where

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.607
you pay a deductible,
and then for a couple

00:45:26.607 --> 00:45:28.190
hundred dollars a
month or, something,

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:29.481
you're covered for your family.

00:45:29.481 --> 00:45:31.574
So it's totally doable.

00:45:31.574 --> 00:45:34.014
AUDIENCE: How much of this
is made possible by the fact

00:45:34.014 --> 00:45:36.454
that on a global
scale you're wealthy.

00:45:36.454 --> 00:45:37.918
You were born in the US.

00:45:37.918 --> 00:45:39.870
So therefore, on a
global scale, you

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.310
have resources that a
lot of people don't have.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:47.250
How much would this be possible
for everyone in the world.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.080
BILL POWERS: OK.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.000
This is not a transferable
model to anyone in the world.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.667
It's a transfer model
to anyone in this room.

00:45:53.667 --> 00:45:55.500
And I'm talking to you
about it in this way.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.070
But there's a whole
other conversation

00:45:58.070 --> 00:45:59.980
that we could be having.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.740
Which is the fact that
people in Bolivia,

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:07.020
like in this town of
4,000 people, for example,

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.130
the well being levels,
the happiness levels which

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.590
we looked at are very high.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.610
It's like 90%.

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:14.400
OK?

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.840
And people are living at very
low levels of consumption

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.310
without having to
decolonize their thoughts

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:22.610
or simplify or anything.

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:24.410
They're already there.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:29.222
So it's this myth we have of
we equate subsistence living,

00:46:29.222 --> 00:46:32.569
living sustainably and
simply, with poverty.

00:46:32.569 --> 00:46:34.110
It was one of the
greatest injustices

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.510
of defining under development
in that way, in that we have

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:39.960
to bring this gift of
development to the third world,

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.460
and so on.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:40.960
No.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.450
Part of this is
like a south north

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.830
education of looking at the
gifts and the ways of life

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.870
people have in countries
that are indigenous,

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:54.090
and what we can learn
from it and take from it.

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.960
So it's a different
type of a way

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.410
of thinking about it that's hard
to explain in a short lecture.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:02.840
But there's all kinds of books
about this, too, and films.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:07.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] do
they want to come to America?

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:09.080
BILL POWERS: It's a combination.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.010
I mean, as you know,
everything's complex.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.810
But in Santa Cruz in
the city, the capital

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:15.290
where the mall is, and
everything like that, obviously

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:19.860
people look towards
Miami and towards the US.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.812
And then there's
another group of lots

00:47:21.812 --> 00:47:23.520
of people who are
quite content and happy

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.580
and not looking that way.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.700
So it's hybrid.

00:47:29.002 --> 00:47:29.710
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:30.955
BILL POWERS: Sure.

00:47:30.955 --> 00:47:32.580
Any other questions
maybe from somebody

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.270
who hasn't had one yet?

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.640
What do you all think?

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.480
Were there any thoughts, ideas?

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:44.706
AUDIENCE: The graphs
you showed earlier

00:47:44.706 --> 00:47:46.340
that showed the
amount of money people

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.280
earned over the last 50
or 60 years in the US,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.730
are they taking into
account inflation?

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:52.440
BILL POWERS: Yes.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.730
It was adjusted for inflation.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:59.120
Right, so the happiness studies,
or the well-being studies

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.870
that are done through
various universities

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:03.152
are like, how happy do you feel?

00:48:03.152 --> 00:48:04.860
How satisfied do you
feel with your life?

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.402
And people say how
satisfied they are.

00:48:09.402 --> 00:48:10.610
And you just do it each year.

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.120
And then you look at the trend.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.890
And it's just showing that, when
you look at wealth increase,

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:21.300
it's not making you happier
after a certain point.

00:48:24.055 --> 00:48:25.180
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.929
You were talking about
writing a new book.

00:48:26.929 --> 00:48:29.592
What technology are
you using to write it?

00:48:29.592 --> 00:48:30.550
BILL POWERS: I'm sorry?

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.990
AUDIENCE: What technology
are you using to write it?

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.285
BILL POWERS: Oh!

00:48:33.285 --> 00:48:33.580
OK.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:34.720
What technology am
I using to write it?

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.470
Yeah.

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:39.300
I mean, this is my
laptop right here.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:43.860
I use just a regular PC laptop.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:48.300
I often will dictate things
onto a digital voice recorder

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.490
and then my intern
will transcribe it,

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:54.080
or I'll-- well usually
my intern will do it.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:59.755
And then I use like
right-brained activities.

00:48:59.755 --> 00:49:01.630
Like, there's this book
"Writing on the Right

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:04.260
Side of the Brain", which
I got many years ago.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:07.500
And it's like, you do
clustering, mind mapping.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.917
I guess you guys use tools
for that on the internet,

00:49:09.917 --> 00:49:11.000
but I just use a notebook.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.090
You have different
colored pens and stuff,

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:17.140
and you write the concepts and
you branch out into new ideas.

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.160
Yeah, you guys do this right,
like on whiteboards and stuff.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.600
Then you hit an idea
that's a purple patch

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.631
or like an energized
stream of ideas.

00:49:25.631 --> 00:49:27.880
And then that's your idea
you're going to write about.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.129
And you branch out from there.

00:49:29.129 --> 00:49:32.412
So it's a right brained way of
generating ideas and material.

00:49:32.412 --> 00:49:34.496
AUDIENCE: More generally,
what's the level

00:49:34.496 --> 00:49:36.426
of technology penetration
in your village?

00:49:36.426 --> 00:49:37.550
BILL POWERS: Oh my village!

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:45.940
OK, so low, I would
say, but growing.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.420
I mean it's a mix.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.234
I don't use a
smartphone in Bolivia.

00:49:50.234 --> 00:49:51.400
Just a line that I've drawn.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.180
I don't want to model
too much connectedness.

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:56.260
I have one here.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:00.410
But my wife and
I don't use that.

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.070
There is Wi-Fi in
our village, so we're

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:03.778
able to-- like there's
Wi-Fi everywhere--

00:50:03.778 --> 00:50:05.845
so we're able to
work and stream Skype

00:50:05.845 --> 00:50:06.970
and so on from the village.

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.590
But I would say
95% of the people

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:11.720
don't have computers
in their homes.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.790
Only 10% of people,
no less, have cars.

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:15.470
5% of people have
cars in our village.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:16.900
We don't have a car.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.260
Another wonderful thing
about this small living

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.495
and dense living like that,
is you don't need cars.

00:50:21.495 --> 00:50:22.745
Lots of public transportation.

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:26.345
So I don't know.

00:50:26.345 --> 00:50:28.220
It's like one of those
questions for you all.

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.300
What do you think about
the way that technology

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.970
is starting to penetrate
a village like Samaipata?

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:38.750
It's bringing video games
in, very violent video games

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:42.020
into the internet
cafes in the center.

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:44.027
There's a lot of
commercial content,

00:50:44.027 --> 00:50:45.110
lots of it coming through.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:47.680
Like the DeVargas
mall I showed you,

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:51.010
they are advertising like
crazy over the web, too.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:52.580
Facebook ads and
everything else.

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.680
So I mean, there's
that question,

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.240
that double edged
sword where it can

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.119
be very liberating for people,
of course, to have these tools.

00:50:58.119 --> 00:50:59.660
But on the other
hand it's definitely

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.872
changing their whole way
of life and their ethos.

00:51:02.872 --> 00:51:05.080
So I'm not sure if you guys
ever have that discussion

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.560
about the ethics of creating
certain technologies

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.710
and exporting them to places.

00:51:15.094 --> 00:51:16.260
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:16.520
BILL POWERS: Yeah.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:16.820
OK.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.611
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
Carlos Slim talking

00:51:18.611 --> 00:51:20.660
about the three
day or four day--

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.860
BILL POWERS: He's advocating
for a three day work week.

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:24.360
Yeah.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.710
AUDIENCE: And so that's
very interesting to hear.

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.075
What led him to
that declaration?

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:36.050
BILL POWERS: How many
people have heard of this?

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:36.830
Did you read about this?

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:38.170
Was it on CNN and everything?

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:39.150
Did anyone hear about
the three day work week?

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.040
OK you did.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.745
All right.

00:51:41.745 --> 00:51:44.370
AUDIENCE: I've actually proposed
it to people that I work with.

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:44.950
BILL POWERS: Oh you have?

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:45.160
Really?

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.483
And what's been the feedback?

00:51:46.483 --> 00:51:48.680
AUDIENCE: They think I'm crazy.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.915
BILL POWERS: We'll just say
the world's richest man--

00:51:51.915 --> 00:51:52.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.469
If you're Carlos Slim you can
propose just about anything.

00:51:55.469 --> 00:51:56.760
BILL POWERS: He's an older man.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.760
AUDIENCE: What is it that
he's like advocating for,

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.260
like everyone and--

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.310
BILL POWERS: Yeah,
universal policy, he

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:04.560
wants a three day work week.

00:52:07.059 --> 00:52:08.350
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering.

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:09.100
BILL POWERS: Yeah.

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.512
I mean he's Mexican.

00:52:10.512 --> 00:52:12.470
So first of all he's
Mexican, isn't that right?

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:13.565
He's Mexican.

00:52:13.565 --> 00:52:15.690
Latin America, by the way,
the happiness indicators

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:19.229
are much higher than in
other areas of the world.

00:52:19.229 --> 00:52:20.645
I think he just
realizes that life

00:52:20.645 --> 00:52:23.657
is about extended family,
about time, and other things

00:52:23.657 --> 00:52:24.740
besides just making money.

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.810
He's like, oh crap, I'm
like whatever, 70 years old

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:29.100
and now I'm realizing.

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:32.230
And he wants to give that gift
to people of, like, free time.

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:34.490
I think he also sees
it as more efficient.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.280
Like you get your work
done, and then you're done.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.750
You refresh, and you come back.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.524
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
three day work week,

00:52:41.524 --> 00:52:43.107
but you have two
shifts, and so you're

00:52:43.107 --> 00:52:44.460
getting six day work weeks.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:44.920
BILL POWERS: But like--

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:45.930
AUDIENCE: I'm not
trying to be cynical.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:47.820
BILL POWERS: But isn't it
great to batch your work?

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.010
Like I love batching stuff.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.675
I love to work in
intensive periods,

00:52:50.675 --> 00:52:52.050
and then you're
done for a while.

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:53.720
I think that's part of the idea.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.555
AUDIENCE: The appeal of mine
was we could work five days

00:52:58.555 --> 00:52:59.780
and be off for two.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.680
Or we could do like
50/50. [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.128
as a better balance.

00:53:07.128 --> 00:53:10.544
Like I don't even know what
led to a five day work week.

00:53:10.544 --> 00:53:16.156
I know that legislation went
to [INAUDIBLE] labor laws

00:53:16.156 --> 00:53:17.376
in the US.

00:53:17.376 --> 00:53:20.966
Now it just seems like something
that businesses get to decide.

00:53:20.966 --> 00:53:21.840
BILL POWERS: Exactly.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.470
And labor movement's
pushed very hard like,

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:27.010
did you know the big slogan in
the American labor movement,

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:30.040
when there actually were
unions a hundred years ago?

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.320
Bread and roses, that
was on the banners.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.930
And do you know what that meant?

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:38.260
Give us bread, yes
give us higher pay.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.940
But also time to
smell the roses.

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.070
That's really what they
were advocating for.

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:46.174
And unfortunately,
we lost the roses.

00:53:46.174 --> 00:53:47.590
As I showed you,
the working hours

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:51.560
have gone up considerably, and
all that benefit of free time.

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.620
And unions are only, what,
9% right now of the country

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.380
or less.

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.880
They've lost that.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.820
I know that there's some battles
about vacation time going on

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:01.320
now.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.210
Like I just saw how
the Tribune, which

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:09.230
owns the "LA Times," there was
a revolt in the whole workforce

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:12.790
because they tried to push
through this other vacation,

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:15.980
like taking away the
discretionary days, sick days,

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.060
and vacation days, and just
have it all packaged into one.

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.047
But it was a subtle
way of taking away

00:54:21.047 --> 00:54:21.880
their vacation time.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:26.920
Anyway, this erosion of what
is the idea of time off.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.586
AUDIENCE: I very clearly
remember that the day I

00:54:29.586 --> 00:54:31.920
met someone who was from
Europe working [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.850
And he was like, oh yeah, we
get like by default six weeks

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:35.350
vacation.

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:37.310
And then like my
head spun around.

00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:40.250
That's when I was very
young in my technical career

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:44.170
and it was like two weeks.

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:46.130
I think the chart about
the number of days

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:49.512
people are taking off
is very interesting.

00:54:49.512 --> 00:54:51.470
BILL POWERS: How many
weeks off do you all get?

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:54.470
AUDIENCE: A lot.

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:57.372
AUDIENCE: I'm at six weeks now,
but I've been on for ten years.

00:54:57.372 --> 00:54:58.080
BILL POWERS: Wow.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.621
That's great.

00:54:58.621 --> 00:54:59.663
AUDIENCE: Entry is three.

00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:00.454
BILL POWERS: Three?

00:55:00.454 --> 00:55:01.390
Three Is the entry?

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.270
OK.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:05.910
But still, three weeks
is a very small amount.

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:09.990
And do people actually take
even all of their vacation days

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.980
here?

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.800
Because 40% of Americans
don't even take their full

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.160
2 and 1/2 weeks of vacation.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.880
They lose those days.

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.120
41%, it's amazing.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.350
But people here actually
take your six weeks?

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:26.300
OK.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.457
Try to, OK.

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:28.415
At least you're honest.

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:39.031
All right.

00:55:39.031 --> 00:55:40.530
Well if there's
nothing else, I just

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:44.787
wanted to say just in
conclusion that I'm just

00:55:44.787 --> 00:55:46.620
very happy to have been
here with you today.

00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:49.244
And I just think this is some of
the most intelligent questions

00:55:49.244 --> 00:55:51.630
I've had in a while, which
I think is really great.

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:54.046
And I can tell that you all
are thinking a lot about this.

00:55:54.046 --> 00:55:56.540
Even the fact that you came
here today on a Monday morning

00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:00.310
to talk about these
ideas of slow and finding

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:02.367
more happiness and
work life balance,

00:56:02.367 --> 00:56:04.700
and thinking about your role
in the environmental crisis

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:05.533
and everything else.

00:56:05.533 --> 00:56:09.780
Like that's just phenomenal and
shows that you guys are leaders

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.024
here at Google.

00:56:12.024 --> 00:56:13.690
I appreciated very
much that opportunity

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:15.040
to be here with you.

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.400
Thank you for inviting me.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.280
And I hope that
you enjoy the book.

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.487
Also, oh, you do
have some books here.

00:56:20.487 --> 00:56:21.820
Oh wow, they just came just now.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.320
OK.

00:56:25.072 --> 00:56:26.780
Sometimes when you
get something for free

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.760
maybe you don't
appreciate it as much,

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.550
but hopefully you'll
actually read it and then

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:34.590
pass it on to
somebody else to read.

00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:39.590
Thank you so much.

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:40.580
Have a great day.

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:43.630
[APPLAUSE]
