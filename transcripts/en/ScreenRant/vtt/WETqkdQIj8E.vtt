00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.010
Actors can play superheroes, wizards, and
even gods, so sometimes it’s easy to forget

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.590
that they’re just human beings.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.020
And like everyone else, the most famous faces
in Hollywood are prone to making their fair

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.280
share of mistakes.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.180
As the old saying goes, nobody’s perfect,
and numerous stars have had plenty of run-ins

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.460
with the law during their lifetimes.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.370
It’s true that some of them managed to turn
things around after their incidents, but that

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.910
still doesn’t change what they did.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.960
Here are 10 famous actors who committed real
life crimes.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.039
Lindsay Lohan

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.670
After Mean Girls, Lohan seemed destined to
become the hottest starlet in the industry,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.410
but the wheels came off pretty quickly and
her downward spiral ruined her career.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.910
That’s in large part due to her extensive
rap sheet that includes multiple DUI arrests,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.180
drug abuse, and more than one stint in jail.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
Lohan has also been to rehab on several occasions
and was frequently on probation.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.580
May 2015 became the first time in 8 years
the actress was probation free, after she

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.110
completed community service from a reckless
driving charge.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.760
She may not be able to turn her career around,
but hopefully Lohan can get her life in order.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.760
Charlie Sheen

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.909
The infamous bad boy made all sorts of headlines
for his wild antics in 2011, but he was getting

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.530
into trouble well before then.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.319
On Christmas Day 2009, Sheen was arrested
for assaulting his third wife, Brooke Mueller.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.049
She claimed that Sheen had pinned her down
in bed and held a knife to her throat.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.590
The actor was released on bail later that
same day.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.810
He was later charged with felony menacing,
third degree assault and criminal mischief.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.439
As part of a plea bargain to dismiss other
charges, Sheen pled guilty to misdemeanor

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.200
assault and spent a month in rehab and on
probation, in addition to attending anger

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.180
management courses.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.180
Hugh Grant

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.799
Hugh Grant is a charming and likable lead
in many romantic comedies, playing a man that

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.719
many women would want to spend the rest of
their life with.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.390
But his biggest fans may be shocked to hear
about the time Grant was arrested for soliciting

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.390
prostitution.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.609
While promoting his movie Nine Months, the
actor was found engaging in oral sex in public.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:56.209
He was fined $1,180, placed on two years summary
probation, and had to attend an AIDS educational

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:57.209
program.

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.219
Shortly after, Grant was quizzed about the
incident on The Tonight Show, saying, “I

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:01.619
did a bad thing.”

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.249
Fortunately for him, the public forgave him
and he’s done very well for a number of

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:06.249
years.

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.529
O.J. Simpson

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:11.560
The football Hall of Famer turned Naked Gun
star is infamous for the 1994 murder trial

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.310
where he was acquitted of charges, but Simpson
couldn’t outrun the law in 2007.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.700
He was arrested for robbing a Las Vegas casino.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.200
Simpson admitted to committing the crime,
saying he led a group to steal sports memorabilia

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.880
because the items belonged – and were stolen
from – him.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.620
In 2008, Simpson was sentenced to 33 years
in prison, with a minimum of nine without

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.620
parole.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.970
He did a number of great things throughout
his multi-faceted career and earned legions

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.860
of fans, so it’s sad that he wasn’t able
to stay on the straight path.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.020
Wesley Snipes

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.890
Tax season is a grind for all of us, and no
matter how much we hate it, we have to pay

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.290
Uncle Sam when he comes knocking.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.310
No matter how hard one tries, there’s no
way to buck the system and the IRS will catch

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.140
anyone who tries to slip past them.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.200
Blade star Wesley Snipes was convicted of
tax fraud in 2006, making $23 million for

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.560
himself by falsifying documents prior to his
arrest.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.220
In 2008, he was sentenced to three years in
prison for failure to pay his income taxes.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.570
He served from 2010-2013 and resumed his acting
career by appearing in The Expendables 3 one

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.570
year later.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.660
Hopefully he knows now to visit H&amp;R Block
before April 15.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.670
Mickey Rourke

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.210
Rourke has had a decades-long acting career
that includes roles in popular films such

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.040
as The Wrestler and Iron Man 2.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.510
But before he was on the screen, Rourke spent
his time in the ring as an amateur boxer.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.400
During this time, the future actor was arrested
in 1994, accused of abusing his then-wife

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400
Carrie Otis.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.720
The charges were later dropped.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.150
Rourke was also arrested in 2007 for DUI.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.270
He has a checkered past, but Rourke revived
his career recently, crediting a newfound

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:45.020
commitment to religious faith for steering
him on the right course.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.530
His fans are hoping he’s put his problems
behind him and he can keep making movies.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.530
Winona Ryder

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.060
While not as egregious a crime as others on
this list, shoplifting is still against the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.319
law and can have serious penalties.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.150
Actress Winona Ryder learned this the hard
way in 2001 when she was arrested in Beverly

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.319
Hills, accused of stealing $5,500 worth of
designer clothes and accessories.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.560
Ryder agreed to pay to Civil Demands to fully
reimburse the store.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.500
During a trial associated to the charges,
Ryder was ultimately convicted of grand theft,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.070
shoplifting, and vandalism.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.880
She was sentenced to three years probation,
480 hours of community service, and had to

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.150
pay $3,700 in fines.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.060
Ryder said she was depressed during the incident,
but she’s back on top now as a standout

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.090
on Netflix’s series Stranger Things.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.090
Will Smith

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.680
The Fresh Prince of Bel Air is so charming
and charismatic, it’s difficult to envision

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.240
him ever being in the wrong, but that wasn’t
the case in 1989.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.520
Smith was arrested and charged with aggravated
assault, reckless endangerment, simple assault,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.389
and criminal conspiracy for his involvement
in an altercation that almost left record

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.360
promoter William Hendricks blind.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.690
Smith claims he was innocent, saying in a
2005 interview that the incident was not his

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.690
fault.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.620
According to him, “One of my buddies beat
up this dude, and I was there.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.540
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it.”

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:04.120
It’s a non-issue now, as Smith remains one
of the top draws in Hollywood.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120
Matthew Broderick

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.379
It’s a well-known story by now.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.729
In 1987, Matthew Broderick was vacationing
in Ireland with Jennifer Grey, who he met

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.759
during filming Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.310
In his rental car, the actor forgot he was
in a different country and was driving on

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.740
the wrong side of the road.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.800
He collided head on with another vehicle,
which led to a truly upsetting tragedy.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.520
The two people in the other car did not survive
the crash.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.969
Broderick got away with numerous injuries
and Grey suffered whiplash.

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.680
Broderick faced up to five years in prison,
but the charges were reduced to careless driving

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
with a $175 fine.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.500
The family of the victims called it a travesty
of justice.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.620
Lane Garrison

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.900
Garrison is best known for his role on the
TV series Prison Break, where he appeared

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.460
in 17 episodes as the character Tweener.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.749
His time on the show ended in 2007, right
when the actor was sentenced to 40 months

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:50.749
in jail.

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:55.030
In 2006, Garrison pled guilty to vehicular
manslaughter, as well as providing alcohol

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.400
to a minor as he drove with cocaine and alcohol
in his system.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.860
The passenger of his car didn’t survive
a crash Garrison caused.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.310
Garrison was released in April 2009.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.509
Tweener was killed in season 2 of Prison Break,
so Garrison can’t return for the followup

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:09.509
series.

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.789
He can be seen in the 2016 miniseries Roots.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.949
Those are just some of the actors who have
committed real-life crimes.

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.190
Which ones did we miss?

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.069
