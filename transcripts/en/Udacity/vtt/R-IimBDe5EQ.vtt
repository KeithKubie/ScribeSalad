00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Before we jump into the next question, let's talk about Newton's Third Law.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The easiest way to remember this one is that forces occur in equal and opposite pairs.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now, that's easy to say but a little harder to understand what it means.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The easiest way to get a feel for what this means is to go push on a wall.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I mean it. Really push on that wall. What do you feel?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well as was you exert a force to the left on the wall.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll call that the force of you on the wall.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You can feel in your hands that force pushing back. Call that the force of the wall on you.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And the amazing thing is every single force in physics occurs in pairs like this.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Whenever there's a force of A on B, there's an equal but opposite direction force of B on A.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, one of the really amazing implications of this has to do with objects in free fall.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If I look at this object as it's falling to the ground, I can draw a force diagram for you,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and if we're ignoring air resistance, the only force is this downwards force of mg.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But that's a lone force. There's no partner to it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I thought forces always occurred in equal and opposite pairs.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well, as a matter of fact, they do. In fact, this force is the force of gravity.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We could rephrase it as the force of earth on the ball, F earth-on-ball.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There's actually a corresponding upwards force of the ball pulling on the earth and this is truly amazing.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Right now, you are tugging on the earth with the force exactly equal to your weight.

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Pretty amazing, and that is what this next question deals with.
