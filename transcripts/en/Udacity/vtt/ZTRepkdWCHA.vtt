00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Consider a ball that is kicked by a mean of 10 feet in this direction

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and with a standard deviation of 1 foot.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It is then kicked back in the opposite direction towards where it started by 5 feet,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but this time with a standard deviation of 0.5.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What are the mean and standard deviation of this distribution of the distance

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
between the initial position and the final position?
