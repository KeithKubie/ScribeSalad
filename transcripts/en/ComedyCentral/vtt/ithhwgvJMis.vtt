00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.030
Let them out
of your sex dungeon.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.940
According to our friends
at the FBI crime lab,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.080
between 7 and 14 people
watching this right now

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.520
are keeping a prison
in a sex dungeon.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.060
Whether it's an abandoned
warehouse

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.710
where some dudes naked body
is chained to a radiator.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.960
Or just a student nurse duct
tapes to the floor of your van.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.090
But it's the new year
and it's the perfect time

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.000
to call olly olly oxen free!
And

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.310
Let
them out of your sex dungeon.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.510
Sure, you've got a soft spot
for that young lady.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.640
And it's fun to read from her
from the book of Revelation

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.690
while you stroke
your tiny genitals and weep.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.980
And we know
what you're thinking.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.290
Hey, if I let her go,
they're going to catch me,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.400
lock me up,
and throw away the key.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.210
Well, in many states,
that would be true.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.410
But in Washoe County,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.800
our clearing crimes percentage
is about 3%.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.580
So there's a very good chance
we will never find you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.830
or even being to know
where to look.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.190
And Junior, why don't you tell
the nice folks with sex dungeons

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.470
out there

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.360
what our sheriff's department
DNA crime lab is like.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.110
The Reno sheriff's department
does not have a DNA crime lab.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.510
We do have a mimeograph machine

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.880
but we're not allowed
to touch it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.530
because somebody broke it
with their genitalia.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.390
When it comes to letting
someone out of your sex dungeon

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.190
The fun is contagious.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.040
Oh why hello America. We here
at the Reno sheriff's department

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010
know that the worst part
of the holiday

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.040
is spending time
with your family.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.930
Lucky for me,
this year I'm alone.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.480
My Uncle Buzzy went missing.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.010
I'm pretty sure he just holed
himself up

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.990
in his bunker in Truckie.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.070
Oh well, more sweet potato
casserole for me and the cats.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.440
If you weren't able to get out
of being around your relatives

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.640
this holiday season,
we have some tips

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.890
on how to get
through it peacefully

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.430
so things don't escalate

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.280
and you don't end up
having to call on us.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.040
That's right, Jim.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.030
Once we've scarfed down
our Christmas pudding

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.100
and slipped
into our house pants,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.750
the last thing we want to do
is come break up a fight

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.530
between you
and your toothless cousin Ricky

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.600
over who's going to drive
grandma to her dialysis

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.970
appointment next week.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.990
And now deputies will show you
how a typical holiday scenario

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.720
could easily get out of hand
and how to resolve it peaceably.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.250
Could you please pass
the butter, grandma?

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.660
Hey what the fuck? Why do you
always start shit with me?

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.240
Get him off me! Get him off me!

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.230
So this holiday, always have
fresh batteries in your taser.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.000
Or fuck it.
Just call the fire department.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.390
I am the ghost
of Christmas DUIs past.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.590
DUIs you've got
in previous holiday seasons.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.410
Drunk driving
or buzzed driving.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.050
And those DUIs have come back
to haunt you,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.770
ruing your resume,
your chances at child custody,

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.470
and your credit rating.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.980
I am the ghost of DUIs future.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.710
If you get one more
DUI next year drunk driving

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.210
or even worse,
buzzed driving,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.120
you will lose
your drivers license,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.350
your car, your livelihood.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.300
I am the ghost of DUIs present.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.550
Did you know there are a million
DUI check points out there

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.080
this very night to catch you
with your drunk driving.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.390
Or a million times
worse buzzed driving.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.410
Hey guys? Hey guys?

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.450
How does somebody change their
ways and not drunk drive again

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.930
if we have no Ebenezer
Scrooge and three ghosts?

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.190
Not it.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.400
Not it.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.600
You can't not it.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.310
I don't look good in the hat.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.690
I did it last year
and they put Ebenezer

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.510
Screwed on the ...
that's not funny.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.730
It's a little bit funny.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.970
Come on, do it.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.250
Come on, give me the hat.
Fine. I'll be the thing.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.150
Okay.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.400
Oh no, ghosts, you spirits,
show me no more.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.000
I will change my ways.
I will not drunk drive

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.500
or a million
times worse buzzed driving.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.990
Wait, stop it. Did they put
the caption up again?

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.890
Yep. Ebenezer Screwed.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.590
You think that's funny?
