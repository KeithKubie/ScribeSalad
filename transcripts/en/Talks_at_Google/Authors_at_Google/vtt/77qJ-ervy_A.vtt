00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.290
&gt;&gt; Okay everyone, thanks very much for coming
and it's my good pleasure to introduce Cory

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.320
Doctorow and Cory is a very prolific member
of the Internet community as I know, I could

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.620
describe it that way. He's probably known
to most people in this room and someone that

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.380
I would like to see more of at Google here
today but he's going to speak a little bit

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.500
about his latest book, "Makers", and some
other issues that are on his mind. Cory?

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.449
Cory Doctorow &gt;&gt; Thanks. So I thought I would
start by - oh and thank you all for coming.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.900
I thought I would start a little by reading
something from "Makers" which is the book

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.140
that's just out from Harper Collins here in
the UK and touring the US and available for

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.089
free online. Has anyone here actually read
any of it or all of it? Okay, that's good.

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.609
So it's available for free online, as with
all my books, Creative Commons License, Craphound.com.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:52.079
I'm easy to find, I'm the first Cory in Google
so relatively straightforward to find if you'd

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.159
like to read some more, you can always buy
the book and it's a book about economic collapse

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.949
and rebirth so I wrote it as a parable about
the dot com years which I lived through in

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.490
San Francisco which I found really kind of
inspiring and also grim. I moved there at

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.930
the peak of the boom. I was spending a lot
of money on a very small half of an illegal

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.804
sublet to live in and my window looked at
over the yard for the flat I was living in,

00:01:17.804 --> 00:01:24.020
in which there was a man who was paying $900
a month to live in a Sears shed without a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.560
toilet. The reason he took that is because
it had a place to park his Jag so this was

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.770
all he could find and then all the money left
the Valley in like a hot second. It just vanished

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.909
and a lot of people went home. It was kind
of a ghost town. You could walk down the streets

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.229
and find people having essentially car boot
sales of Aeron chairs and dot com t-shirts,

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.100
kind of make an offer going back to Oklahoma
in the morning and then the interesting thing

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.659
was that it was kind of like that last scene
in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" because

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.100
people kept on making stuff. All the money
had disappeared and it turned out that all

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.130
you needed to make interesting things was
a laptop and someone's WiFi connection, even

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.830
if it wasn't your WiFi connection and all
kinds of really interesting start ups emerged

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.390
from the Valley, driven not by some kind of
crazy search for market opportunity but just

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.701
for scratching an itch, doing that classic
free software thing, doing something that

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:25.739
just seemed right, that seemed ethical, that
seemed interesting, that seemed like good

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.349
art and you got everything from Flickr to
Twitter to lots of other kinds of web 2.0

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.510
stuff out of it. Lots of stuff that didn't
go anywhere too but it was amazing to see

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.220
that it turned out,
you know not withstanding your wonderful cafeteria

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.120
here, that you could create all kinds of amazing
things on the Internet without a Foosball

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.800
table and that was kind of a revelation I
think for a lot of us. So I wrote this book

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.750
as a kind of parable about it and for various
reasons, it was delayed in publication and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.739
another book my publisher wanted to get out
first and I luckily happened into the circumstance

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.819
that the economy collapsed before the book
was published so it seems not so much a parable

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.409
about the dot com years anymore as a prescient
prediction of the economic collapse that we

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.850
just lived through and are living through
indeed today. The premise of the story is

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.030
that some Silicon Valley venture capitalists
have bought up a bunch of rust belt companies

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.110
that had more money on hand then their market
capitalizations so there's essentially free

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.989
money if you just broke them up for parts.
They took that money and used it to fund little

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.530
tech start ups in dead Wal-Marts and malls
in the suburbs of America, which have largely

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.750
been abandoned thanks to fuel crisis, and
in those places inventors just invent interesting

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.349
stuff and the idea is - I'll give you $10,000,
you invent something, we sell it for six weeks

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.420
and then it's cloned. We take $30,000 out
of the company. That's an incredible 200%

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.590
ROI and then we do it again. Invent something
new every six weeks. New business every six

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.099
weeks and won't that be interesting and cool,
and that's where the story starts. The journalist

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.640
for the San Jose Mercury News, Suzanne Church,
has gone to Hollywood, Florida, where the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.359
first of these start ups is to interview the
two people and to serve as a kind of embedded

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.040
journalist through this period and that's
where the bit that I'm going to read to you

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.540
today starts.
Perry gestured with an arm, deep into the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.530
center of the junk pile,“All right,
check this stuff out as we go.” He stuck

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.370
his hand through the unglazed window of a
never-built shop and plucked out a toy in

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.980
a battered box. “I love these things,”
he said, handing it to her.She took it. It

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.330
was a Sesame Street Elmo doll, labeled BOOGIE
WOOGIE ELMO. “That’s from the great Elmo

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.990
Crash,” Perry said, taking back the box
and expertly extracting the Elmo like he was

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.790
shelling a nut. “The last and greatest generation
of Elmoid technology, cast into an uncaring

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.610
world that bought millions of Li’l Tagger
washable graffiti kits instead after Rosie

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.900
gave them two thumbs up on her Christmas shopping
guide. “Poor Elmo was an orphan, and every

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.870
junkyard in the world has millions of mint-in-package
BWEs, getting rained on, waiting to start

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.560
their long, half-million-year decomposition.“But
check this out.” He flicked a multitool

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.190
off his belt and extracted a short, sharp
scalpel-blade. He slit the grinning, disco

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.080
suited Elmo open from chin to groin and shucked
its furry exterior and the foam tissue that

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.670
overlaid its skeleton. He slide the blade
under the plastic cover on its ass and revealed

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.070
a little printed circuit board.“That’s
an entire Atom processor on a chip, there,”

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.310
he said. "Every limb and head have their own
subcontrollers and there's a high powered

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.240
digital-to-analog ring for letting him sing
and dance to new songs, and an analog-to-digital

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.130
converter for converting spoken and danced
commands to motions. Basically, you sing and

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.740
dance for Elmo and he'll dance and sing back
for you." Suzanne nodded. She’d missed that

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.680
toy, which was a pity. She had a five year
old goddaughter in Minneapolis who would have

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.510
loved a Boogie Woogie Elmo. They'd come to
a giant barn, sat on the edge of a story-and-a-half’s

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.300
worth of half built anchor store. “This
used to be where the contractors kept their

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.730
heavy equipment,” Lester rumbled, aiming
a car-door remote at the door, which queeped

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.110
and opened. Inside, it was cool and bright,
the chugging air-conditioners efficiently

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.940
blasting purified air over
the many work-surfaces. The barn was a good

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.870
25 feet tall, with a loft and a catwalk circling
it halfway up. It was lined with metallic

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.350
shelves stacked neatly with labeled boxes
of parts scrounged from the junkyard. Perry

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.530
set Elmo down on a workbench and worked a
miniature USB cable into it's chest cavity.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.570
The other end terminated with a PDA with a
small rubberized photovoltaic cell on the

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.071
front. “This thing is running InstallParty
 - it can recognize any hardware and build

00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:37.580
a Linux distro for it on the fly without any
human intervention. They used a ton of different

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.610
suppliers for the BWE, so every one is a little
different, depending on who was offering the

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.950
cheapest components the day it was built.
InstallParty doesn’t care though: one click

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.480
and away it goes.” The PDA was doing all
kinds of funny dances on its screen, montages

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.230
of playful photoshopping of public figures
matted into historical fine art.“All done.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.620
Now, have a look - this is a Linux computer
with some of the most advanced robotics ever

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.320
engineered. No sweatshop stuff, either, see
this? The solder is too precise to be done

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.910
by hand—that’s because it’s from India.
If it had come from Cambodia, you’d see

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.950
all kinds of wobble in the solder: that means
that clever, tiny hands were used to create

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.130
it, which means that somewhere in the device’s
karmic history, there’s a sweatshop full

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.860
of crippled children inhaling solder fumes
until they keel over and are dumped in a ditch

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.840
but this is the good stuff. “So here we
have this karmically clean robot with infinitely

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.220
malleable computation and a bunch of robotic
capabilities. I’ve turned these things into

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.240
wall-climbing monkeys; I’ve modded them
for a woman at the University of Miami at

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.050
the Jackson Memorial who used their capability
to ape human motions in physiotherapy programs

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:49.320
with nerve-damage cases. But the best thing
I’ve done with them so far is the Distributed

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.810
Boogie Woogie Elmo Motor Vehicle Operations
Cluster. Come on,” he said, and took off

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:00.050
deeper into the barn’s depths. They came
to a dusty, stripped-down Smart car, one of

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.470
those tiny two-seat electrical cars that you
could literally buy out of a vending machine

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.620
in Europe. It was barely recognizable, having
been reduced to its roll cage, drivetrain

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.680
and a control panel. A gang of naked Elmos
were piled into it. “Wake up boys, time

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.010
for a demo!” Perry shouted, and they sat
up and made canned, tinny Elmo “oh boy”

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:24.270
noises, climbing into position on the pedals,
around the wheel, and on the gear tree. “I

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.610
got the idea when I was teaching some Elmos
to play Super Mario Brothers. I thought it’d

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.610
get a decent diggdotting. I could get it to
speed run all of the first level using an

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.500
old paddle I’d found and rehabilitated,
and I was trying to figure out what to do

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.909
next. The dead mall across the way is a drive
in and I was out front watching the silent

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.670
movies one night, and one of them showed all
these cute little furry animated whatevers

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:50.399
collectively driving a car. It’s a really
old sight gag, I mean, like racial memory

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:55.170
old. I’d seen the Little Rascals do that
same bit, with Alfalfa on the wheel and Buckwheat

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.680
and Spanky on the brake and clutch and the
doggy working the gearshift. “And I thought,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.800
Shit, I could do that with Elmos. They don’t
have any networking capability, but they can

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.379
talk and they can parse spoken commands, so
all I need to do is designate one for left

00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:13.379
and one for right and one for fast and one
for slow and one to be the eyes, barking orders

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:17.959
and they should be able to do this. And it
works! They even adjust their balance and

00:09:17.959 --> 00:09:21.899
centers of gravity for when the car swerves
to stay upright at their posts. Check this

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:27.420
out." He turned to the car. “Driving Elmos,
ten-HUT!” They snapped upright and ticked

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:33.399
salutes off their naked plastic noggins. “In
circles, DRIVE!" The Elmos scrambled into

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:37.340
position and fired up the car and in short
order they were doing donuts in the car’s

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.839
little indoor pasture. “Elmos, HALT” Perry
shouted and the car stopped silently, rocking

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:49.050
gently. “Stand DOWN.” The Elmos sat down
with a series of tiny thumps. Suzanne found

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.720
herself applauding. “That was amazing,”
she said. “Really impressive. So that’s

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.550
what you’re going to do for Kodacell?" The
companies that they bought and liquidated

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.990
are Kodak and Duracell, they call them Kodacell.
"That's what you're going to do for Kodacell,

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:07.709
make these things out of recycled toys?”
Lester chuckled. “Nope, not quite. That’s

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:12.600
just for starters. The Elmos are all about
the universal availability of cycles and apparatus.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.120
Everywhere you look, there’s devices for
free that have everything you need to make

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.170
anything do anything. “But have a look at
part two, c’mere.” He lumbered off in

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:26.730
another direction, and Suzanne and Perry trailed
along behind him. “This is Lester’s workshop,”

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.889
Perry said, as they passed through a set of
swinging double doors and into a cluttered

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:36.120
wonderland. Where Perry’s domain had been
clean and neatly organized, Lester’s area

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.519
was a happy shambles. His shelves weren’t
orderly, but rather, crammed with looming

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:45.550
piles of amazing junk: thrift-store wedding
dresses, plaster statues of bowling monkeys,

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:50.040
box kites, knee-high tin knights-in-armor,
seashells painted with the American flag,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.930
presidential action-figures, paste jewelry
and antique cough-drop tins. “You know how

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.279
they say a sculptor starts with a block of
marble and chips away everything that doesn’t

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:04.149
look like a statue? Like he can see the statue
in the block? I get like that with garbage:

00:11:04.149 --> 00:11:09.100
I see the pieces on the heaps and in the roadside
trash and I can just see how it'll go together,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:14.439
like this." He reached down behind a work
table and hoisted up a huge triptych made

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:19.079
out of three hinged car doors stood on end.
Carefully, he unfolded it and stood it like

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:24.339
a screen on the cracked concrete floor. The
inside of the car doors had been stripped

00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:29.880
clean and polished to a high metal gleam that
glowed like sterling silver. Spot welded to

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.600
it were all manner of soda tin cans, pounded
flat and cut into gears, chutes, springs and

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.439
other mechanical apparatus. “It’s a mechanical
calculator,” he said proudly. “About half

00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:45.290
as powerful as Univac. I milled all the parts
using a laser cutter. What you do is, you

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:50.149
fill this hopper with GI Joe heads, and
this hopper with Barbie heads. You crank this

00:11:50.149 --> 00:11:54.949
wheel and it will drop a number of M&amp;Ms equal
to the product of the two values into this

00:11:54.949 --> 00:12:01.079
hopper, here.” He put three scuffed GI Joe
heads in one hopper and four scrofulous Barbies

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:06.600
in another and began to crank, slowly. A musicbox
beside the crank played a slow, irregular

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.290
rendition of “Pop Goes the Weasel” while
hundreds of little coin shaped gears turned,

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.750
flipping switches and adding and removing
tension to the springs. After the weasel had

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.990
popped a few times, twelve brown M&amp;Ms fell
into the outstretched rubber hand. He picked

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.730
them out carefully and offered them to her.
“It’s OK. They’re not from the trash,”

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.610
he said. “I buy them in bulk.” He turned
his broad back to her and heaved a huge galvanized

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:35.620
tin washtub full of brown M&amp;Ms in her direction.
“See, it’s a bit bucket!” he said. Suzanne

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.029
giggled in spite of herself. “You guys are
hilarious,” she said. “This is really

00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:44.660
good, exciting nerdy stuff.” The gears on
the mechanical computer were very sharp and

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.019
precise; they looked like you could cut yourself
on them. When they ground over the polished

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:54.019
surfaces on the car doors, they made a sound
like a box of toothpicks falling to the floor:

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:59.480
click-click, clickclickclick, click. She turned
the crank until twelve more brown M&amp;Ms fell

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.329
out. “Who’s the Van Halen fan?” Lester
beamed. “Might as well jump, JUMP!” He

00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:10.019
mimed heavy metal air guitar and thrashed
his shorn head up and down as though he were

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:14.329
head banging with a mighty mane of hair band
locks. “You’re the first one to get the

00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:18.910
joke!” he said. “Even Perry didn’t get
it!” “Get what?” Perry said, also grinning.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.019
“Van Halen had this thing where if there
were any brown M&amp;Ms in their dressing room

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:25.699
they’d
trash it and refuse to play. When I was a

00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:30.459
kid, I used to dream about being so famous
that I could act like that much of a prick.

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:35.389
Ever since, I’ve afforded a great personal
significance to the brown M&amp;M.” She laughed

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:39.430
again. Then she frowned a little. “Look,
I hate to break this party up, but I came

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.559
here because Kettlewell said that you guys
exemplified everything that he wanted to do

00:13:43.559 --> 00:13:47.959
with Kodacell. This stuff you're doing is
very interesting, I mean, it's killer art

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:51.860
but I don’t see the business angle. So,
could you help me out here?” “That’s

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.269
step three,” Perry said. “C’mere.”
He led her back to his workspace, to a platform

00:13:56.269 --> 00:14:01.779
surrounded by articulated arms that terminated
in webcams, like a grocery scale in the embrace

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:06.869
of a metal spider. "The 3D scanner," he said,
producing a Barbie head from Lester’s machine

00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:11.160
and dropping it on the scales. He prodded
a button and a nearby screen filled with a

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.579
three dimensional model of the head, flattened
on the side where it touched the surface.

00:14:15.579 --> 00:14:19.490
He turned the head over and scanned again
and now there were two digital versions of

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.600
the head on the screen. He moused on over
the other one until they lined up, right clicked

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.769
a drop-down menu, selected an option and then
they were merged, rotating. "Once we've got

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:33.550
the 3D scan, it’s basically Plasticine.”
He distorted the Barbie head, stretching it

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.249
and squeezing it with the mouse. “So we
can take a real object and make this kind

00:14:37.249 --> 00:14:41.860
of protean hyper object out of it, or drop
it down to a wireframe and skin it with any

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:47.189
bitmap, like this.” More fast mousing, Barbie’s
head turned into a gridded mesh, fine filaments

00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:51.360
stretching off along each mussed strand of
plastic hair. Then a Campbell’s Cream of

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.509
Mushroom Soup label wrapped around her like
a stocking being pulled over her head. There

00:14:55.509 --> 00:15:00.509
was something stupendously weird and simultaneously
very comic about the sight, the kind of inherent

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:05.519
comedy in a cartoon stretched out on a blob
of Silly Putty. “So we can build anything

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:09.379
out of interesting junk, with any shape, and
then we can digitize the shape and then we

00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:14.139
can do anything with the shape and then we
can output the shape." He typed quickly and

00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:18.560
another machine, sealed and mammoth like an
outsized photocopier, started to grunt and

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:24.839
churn. The air filled with a smell like Saran
Wrap in a microwave. “The goop we use in

00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:28.269
this thing is epoxy-based. You wouldn’t
want to build a car out of it, but it makes

00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:32.129
a mean dollhouse. The last stage of the output
switches to inks, so you

00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:35.649
get whatever bitmap you’ve skinned your
object with baked right in. It does about

00:15:35.649 --> 00:15:40.209
one cubic inch per minute, so this job should
be almost done now.” He drummed his fingers

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:45.019
on top of the machine and then it'd start
chunking and something inside it went clunk.

00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:49.470
He lifted a lid and reached inside and plucked
out the Barbie head, stretched and distorted,

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:53.950
skinned with a Campbell’s Soup label. He
handed it to Suzanne. She expected it to be

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:58.250
warm, like a squashed penny from a machine
on Fisherman’s Wharf, but it was cool and

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:03.559
had the seamless texture of a plastic margarine
tub and the heft of a paperweight. “So,

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:07.119
that’s the business,” Lester said. “Or
so we’re told. We’ve been making cool

00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:11.490
stuff and selling it to collectors on the
web for you know, gigantic bucks. We move

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:16.519
one or two pieces a month at about ten grand
per. But Kettlewell says he’s going to industrialize

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:21.300
us, alienate us from the product of our labor,
and turn us into an assembly line.” “He

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.189
didn’t say any such thing,” Perry said.
Suzanne was aware that her ears had grown

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:30.420
points. Perry gave Lester an affectionate
slug in the shoulder. “Lester’s only kidding.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.800
What we need is a couple of dogsbodies and
some bigger printers and we’ll be able to

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.379
turn out more modest devices by the hundreds
or possibly the thousands. We can tweak the

00:16:38.379 --> 00:16:42.519
designs really easily because nothing is coming
off a mold, so there’s no setup charge,

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:46.890
and so we can do limited runs of a hundred,
redesign, do another hundred. We can make

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:52.600
them to order." So, that's the reading.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.110
So I thought I would talk briefly about some
of the ideas that went into "Makers" and into

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:03.550
the way that I publish my work, and specifically
about copyright and the way that it regulated

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.250
around the world and here in the UK because
"Makers" really is a story about a kind of

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:17.380
enterprise that is built around the idea of
cheap coordination over the Internet. And

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.800
it's also a parable about what happens when
people who don't think about the value of

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.380
cheap coordination over the Internet but only
about what businesses are being displaced

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:32.500
by it get to make policy for the Internet.
So, I used to worry a lot about copyright

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.520
in terms of what it would do to artist income
and I would get embroiled, as I still do,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.570
in these endless fights about whether or not,
without strong copyright, artists can earn

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.900
a living or they can't. We'd argue about whether
Madonna going to a concert promoter and leaving

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.360
her record label meant that artist's could
figure out how to earn a living from live

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.030
performance instead of recordings, or we'd
argue about whether or not free software was

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:59.060
a good model for music or books or movies.
We'd argue about all these things but I've

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:04.430
come to realize that limiting the copyright
discussion to whether or not it's good for

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:10.590
artists is a deeply parochial way of thinking
about copyright. Think of everything else

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:18.380
we do on the net. You know, Google is a confessor,
right? Look at that amazing, terrible thing

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.270
that AOL released when they released all that
search corpus and I'm sure some of you have

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:27.730
had a look at your raw search corpus and think
about just how much we use our information

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:33.301
tools for things that go well beyond downloading
the occasional mp3, whether in the AOL case

00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:38.380
it's how to kill our husbands, or just what
to do if we have disease or what to do if

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.250
we're having lifestyle problems or if we're
depressed or how we'll find a maid or what

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.950
have you. Think of how we use the net to get
our education. I teach both at the Open University

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:53.250
and University of Waterloo in Canada. Collectively,
I've visited both campuses four times in two

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:59.060
years. All of my students I connect to over
the Internet but it's also how we learn, obviously.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:04.240
My continuing education is all built around
the Internet. I basically use the Internet

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.600
as an outboard brain these days. I don't have
to remember anything interesting; my Google

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.770
phone finds it for me. Think of how we use
it for love. The first six months that I knew

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.490
my wife we were conducting a long distance
relationship with me in San Francisco and

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:23.000
she here in London, and how many of us have
met our loved ones over the Internet and how

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.910
many of us use the Internet as part of how
we stay in touch with our loved ones, not

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:31.660
just our spouses but everybody we love in
the world and how the network has strengthened

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.780
our connections to all those people we love.
Think of how we use it for employment. I mean,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.770
obviously no one here could earn a living
without the Internet but that's increasingly

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.790
true of everyone, whether you're on a university
campus, whether you're an engineer working

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:48.230
on a job site, whether you are someone who
is teaching a classroom full of five year

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.190
olds. The number of people who can earn a
living without the Internet has shrunk to

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:57.010
an insignificant slice, I think it gets smaller
every day and also think about how we use

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.510
it for political action. I mean, many of you
I'm sure have signed up for the Open Rights

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.170
Group mailing list and if you haven't, I'll
talk to you about that at the end of this

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:10.370
talk but you may have also used something
like the Number 10 petition site or any number

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:16.410
of other political tools to contact your legislatores,
to weigh in on issues of the day, to organize

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:20.250
with other people around you on anything that
you care about politically, and certainly

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:25.340
in the US we recently saw how an entire election
could be swung based on grassroots organizing,

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:31.220
grassroots fundraising, and moving away from
that centralized top down political infrastructure,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.390
and even civic process. I mean, it's very
hard these days to get a permit from the council

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:40.180
to build a new shed without the
Internet. Almost all of the stuff takes place

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.290
over the network and when it doesn't we get
understandably very vexed and we call up the

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.780
council and we demand to know why we can't
register our marriage over the Internet like

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.780
a sensible person might, and eventually the
councils will cave to us. So policy is being

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.630
written though not with any of those things
in mind, it's being written essentially by

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:03.520
people who think of the Internet as a glorified
tool for delivering TV, movies, and music,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.760
and so they don't take any of that stuff into
consideration and they don't really worry

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.020
if any of that stuff is implicated as collateral
damage in the way that they intend to regulate

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:18.150
the net so look at Peter Mandelson's latest
digital economy bill, which I've been calling

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:23.090
"The Analog Economy Bill" because it's really
built around the idea of preserving businesses

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:30.650
whose entire model is built around the difficulty
of copying things. The inherent limitations

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:35.790
on copying. Those inherent limitations on
copying are fast falling away and I'd say

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:41.360
at this point they've basically been completely
put paid to, there are no more real good inherent

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.000
limitations on copying the way the record
industry understands them. You know, hard

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.850
drives are going to get less capacious to
more and more expensive, networks aren't going

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.890
to get harder to use, libraries won't have
taught fewer OAP's to type 'Batman Returns

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:57.530
bit torrent' into Google, right? Our general
capacity to copy things is only going to go

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.680
up from here. As I said in an article that
was in "The Guardian" yesterday, this is the

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.980
hardest that copying will ever be. Here today,
November 27, 2009, is as hard as copying will

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:13.350
ever be. On November 28th, copying will be
incrementally easier. A year from now, copying

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:18.400
will be vastly easier. A year after that,
copying will be easier still and yet we have

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.130
the digital economy bill that kind of comes
in two parts. The first part is here are some

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.260
kind of feel good measures we are going to
do. We are going to spawn everyone's Internet

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.000
connection and send angry letters to people
who we think are copying the wrong things.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.130
We are going to do that for a year and if
in a year copying in Britain hasn't fallen

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:41.520
by 70%, we are going to do a bunch of other
bad stuff. Now let's just examine this 70%

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:47.970
business for a minute. I mean, is there anyone
whose ever enacted any measure on any Internet

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:52.110
connection, anywhere in the world, that has
substantially reduced copying over any lasting

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.860
period? I think the answer is generally no.
There was a little blip when they got rid

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.620
of the Pirate Bay and brought in IPRED in
Sweden. Swedish Internet traffic is higher

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.920
then it was before IPRED was introduced in
Sweden. It took about four or five months.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.460
As far as we can tell, the trajectory of the
digital society is more copying, not less,

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.730
forever, and there is no legislative measure
short of maybe turning off all the nuclear

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:21.650
reactors and plunging us into the dark, that
we can use to shut down copying. So digital

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.780
businesses, the businesses that are really
built around the digital economy, don't assume

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:32.010
that copying will slow down. These are the
businesses that profit no matter what happens

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:37.210
with copying. One of the most inspiring things
about Google's history, to my mind, is by

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:42.610
in large as Google has done its acquisitions,
especially the weird ones like this gentleman

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.350
in his "Blogger" shirt. I remember when Google
bought "Blogger" and no one could really figure

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.590
out why they'd done it and I asked around
and I was writing for Business 2.0 then and

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.280
I talked to a lot of people on and off the
record and there were a couple of answers

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.400
that really run true for me about why Google
had bought "Blogger". The first was that it

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.980
would just be a crying shame for it to disappear
and Ev and his team were smart and it was

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.700
a pretty cheap way to hire them. But the other
one was that generally speaking, the more

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.210
people used the Internet, the more money Google
would make, right? Google had a business model

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:16.730
that was based on Internet use going up and
Google's income going up at the same time.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.890
They'd figure that out. That's what a digital
business looks like. It's not a business that

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:26.030
relies on the totally ahistorical and vastly
improbable proposition that Internet use will

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:34.060
decline. So the problem with ascribing liability
as the digital economy bill does to intermediaries,

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:39.770
so that's companies like Blogger and YouTube
but also any company that hosts or makes copies

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:45.130
of user generated content, is that it basically
destroys the business model for everyone who

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.790
allows anyone to put anything on the Internet
without a copyright lawyer reviewing it first,

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.990
right? If you're on the hook for any infringing
material that shows up on YouTube, not on

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.110
the hook for taking it down but on the hook
as a participant in the infringement itself,

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:04.520
and in the US that would be $150,000 per download
of that infringing YouTube clip, you can't

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.450
run YouTube, right? For all that, YouTube's
bandwidth bill may be very high, and if you

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.650
believe the trade press they say a million
and a half dollars a day or something being

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:15.230
lost on YouTube. I don't know if that's true
or not but I do know that there aren't enough

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.570
lawyer hours remaining between now and the
heat death of the Universe to vent 16 hours

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:25.560
of video every sixty seconds, right? And that
even if you could manage to raise that many

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.880
lawyers, graduate them from university, and
fill a boiler room with them, that the cost

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:35.260
of paying them all would outstrip the entire
income available to Google and probably all

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:39.120
Internet businesses put together and it's
not just Google, of course. It's everyone

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.960
who has user generated material so many of
you have probably seen MOO cards, those little

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.080
business cards that you can get your Flickr
photos on the back of. So what would it do

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.630
to MOO, which is a relatively profitable small
business based here in Clark , well they've

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:56.860
actually just moved up to Silicon Roundabout
at Old Street. What would it do to MOO if

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.400
they had to hire a copyright lawyer to ensure
that every photo they printed on the back

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.620
of every business card didn't contain any
copyright infringement? What would it do to

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.650
Last.fm if they had to ensure that every song
that they streamed didn't contribute to a

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.460
copyright infringement? Basically what we're
talking about is eliminating the internet

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:17.390
in favor of something a lot more like cable
television. Cable television where if you

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:22.110
want to put a program on Sky, first you go
to Rupert Murdoch's lawyers and you show him

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.940
the material and they go over it with a fine
tooth comb with your insurers, you get clearances

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.920
for anything that may or may not create a
copyright liability, and then you get to put

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.460
it on and you get a hundred channels, five
hundred channels in some places. You remember

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.790
the five hundred channel universe about ten
years ago? Everyone's talking about how cable

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.560
television would deliver the five hundred
channel universe and how amazing that is.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.680
Think of how poor five hundred websites sounds
like as the entire

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:52.430
Internet today, right? The one trillion channel
universe is a little more like it. I think

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:57.700
I'd be okay with a one trillion channel universe
but a five hundred channel universe is an

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.960
extremely poor one and of course from going
back to this parochial artistic cultural perspective,

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.101
the purpose of copyright isn't to ensure that
last years winners in the digital economy

00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:13.270
or in the creative economy remain on top forever.
The purpose of copyright is to ensure the

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:18.030
broadest, most diverse participation in culture
as possible, right? So more channels equals

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:23.940
good as far as copyright is concerned. So
it's the collateral damage that I'm really

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.110
starting to worry about. It's not culture,
it's not the arts. It's what happens to everything

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:32.950
else that we do because everything else that
we do on the Internet involves copying and

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:38.110
because copying always triggers copyright
law. Copyright law is a regulation and like

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:43.680
any regulation, it has to figure out somewhere
in it's makeup when it applies and when it

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.640
doesn't. Who should be bound by copyright
law and who shouldn't. An easy heuristic for

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.240
determining who was doing something that came
under the purview of copyright law historically

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.990
has been, "Are they making copies?" Specifically
are they making lots of copies because making

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:01.870
lots of copies of a record involved buying
a 400 million dollar record press and if you

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.470
are going to spend that kind of money on a
giant

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:07.630
printing plan and a global distribution network,
you can pay a lawyer a couple of hundred thousand

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.470
dollars a year to make sure that everything
you do on it is legal. If you are going to

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:16.030
make copies of movies, you need a giant film
lab, no more. You and I, we make thousands

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:21.240
of copies every morning before breakfast.
Every I.M, every click, every email involves

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:27.450
hundreds if not thousands of copies. So the
problem is that we're left with this heuristic,

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:32.340
when should we treat copying as industrial
and subject to regulation when mass copying

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:37.180
occurs? But that heuristic no longer applies
in contemporary society. My friend Jamie Boyle,

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:42.370
who is at the Duke Center for Public Domain,
says that copyright used to be like a tank

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.460
mine. It only went off if you drove over it
with a giant factory, right? You'd need a

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.970
huge printing press, a huge record press,
a huge film lab for copyright to really come

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:54.650
to bear on you. But now it's become the kind
of land mine that blows the legs off of children,

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:59.780
right? Now copyright is triggered when your
kid puts up a Harry Potter fan site. Now copyright

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.090
is
triggered when your kid grabs a little bit

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:08.160
of video and turns it into an icon on LiveJournal
or Twitter, right? So copyright no longer

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.950
makes sense, not because there's anything
inherently wrong with regulating the creative

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:16.780
industries and their supply chain using a
system of government regulation, but because

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:22.620
that regulation is supremely unsuited to regulating
for example how we get an education or how

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:28.320
we deal with our relatives or how we monitor
our children from abroad or how we get our

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.970
health information or how we do any of those
other things that we do on the Internet. Copyright

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:36.740
is very unsuited to it. For the same reason
that you don't have to file papers with the

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:41.630
FSA if you take a friend out for lunch, you
shouldn't have to concern yourself with copyright

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.650
if you make some personal copies or share
them around your office or around with your

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:50.240
colleagues, right? The process of putting
a Dilbert cartoon or an XKCD cartoon on your

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.970
cubicle and allowing your coworkers to see
it doesn't trigger copyright because no copying

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:59.261
is made, but if you take a photo of that and
put it on Flickr and your coworkers see it,

00:29:59.261 --> 00:30:04.690
you are suddenly in deep dutch because you
violated copyright law because that same transaction

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.110
that involves a network business like Google
with offices all over the world where your

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:13.200
coworkers may not be in the next cubicle but
may be on a different continent triggers copyright

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:19.880
because we have a bad heuristic for copyright.
So copyright has become the de facto regulator

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.480
of everything we do in the information society
and copyright policy is not being made with

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.530
that in mind. Instead, it's being made by
people like Peter Mandelson who get all expense

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:33.160
paid vacations from entertainment executives
like David Geffen and come back with copyright

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.860
fire in their hearts. You know among the other
things that we've heard proposed from Mr.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.740
Mandelson is that he would like to have a
three strikes regime for the Internet here,

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.280
like they've passed in France, and the way
that that would work is if anyone in your

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.380
household was accused of three acts of infringement,
not convicted of three acts of infringement,

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.430
there needn't be any due process or evidence,
just the say so of a copyright enforcer, your

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:01.520
whole household loses access to the Internet
and the way this works in France is your household's

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.530
name is added to a list of people for whom
it's illegal to provide Internet access and

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:11.520
no one in the country can hook you up anymore,
right? So imagine if we reversed this. There

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.001
is an ex-Googler named Kevin Marks who has
just gone to work for BT who many of you probably

00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:18.510
know and when Kevin heard this he said, "What
if we

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:22.170
reversed that?" Like we know that Universal,
for example, sends all kinds of ridiculous

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:27.580
copyright notices, you know? Prince and Universal
sent a copyright notice to YouTube over a

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:33.030
clip of an adorable two year old dancing in
the kitchen and for a few seconds in the background

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.680
you could hear Prince's "Let's Go Crazy".
This is, you know, canonical fair dealing,

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.330
canonical fair use and yet they filed a copyright
complaint and asked YouTube to take it down.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.510
We know they're very sloppy about this because
there's no penalty for doing it so what if

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:47.470
we turned it around? What if we said, "Okay,
you can have three strikes but it goes both

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:52.820
ways." The day that Universal makes three
erroneous copyright claims, we go to every

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.640
Universal office all over the world with a
big set of bolt cutters and we go to their

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.970
wiring closet and we take them offline and
Universal can be the record label that does

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:07.430
all of its business from now on by fax. But
we know that that record label would immediately

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:11.750
go bust, right? It is the death penalty for
a company to take it off the Internet and

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.380
it's the death
penalty for our digital lives to take our

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.860
households off the Internet. Collective punishment,
the idea that you can terminate an entire

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.260
group of people's access to the Internet or
punish them otherwise because one person has

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:28.690
done it, it may prevail in the wrong kind
of gym classes but its certainly not something

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.250
that we think of as fundamental to justice.
You know, the Geneva Conventions prohibit

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.990
it so for the idea that this might become
the law of the land and it's not just here,

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:42.260
it's all over the world - there's an international
copyright treaty under way called ACTA, the

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.890
Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which
has moved copyright negotiations from the

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:52.130
UN, from the World Intellectual Property Organization
or WIPO. I sometimes say it has the same relationship

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:57.630
to bad copyright law that Mordor has to evil
but WIPO has one single virtue which is that

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:01.350
non-governmental organizations are allowed
in. They have rules, their the UN, so we went

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.770
in and we started writing down everything
they said and blogging it twice a day and

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:08.230
it got slashed on it and it got picked up
by lots of people and all of a sudden people

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:11.430
all over the world started calling up their
elected representatives and saying, "What

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:16.630
the hell are you doing in Geneva?" And the
treaty collapsed and millions of dollars worth

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:22.470
of entertainment industry lobbying went down
the drain and they reconvened, not at the

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:27.340
United Nations, but in a closed door meeting,
that only rich countries are invited to, although

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.430
every country would eventually be bound to
it through other trade agreements, right?

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:37.270
If you want to stay in the WTO, you have to
adopt the ACTA provisions and they declared

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.530
the text of the treaty a secret, although
we've seen drafts of it because it leaks like

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.850
a sieve because there's, you know, hundreds
of negotiators there and they all share them

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:47.210
with executives from various industries in
their countries. You know there's a list of

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.710
people who are allowed to see the US Trade
representatives documents, it's quite long

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:57.100
and it includes things like a beer executive,
a car executive, a guy who's a fertilizer

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:01.670
executive, so once you start telling fertilizer
executives top secrets, they no longer remain

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:07.830
secret for very long. So we've seen it and
it includes things like three strikes, it

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:12.829
also includes criminal penalties for simple
infringement, noncommercial infringement so

00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:17.509
your kids no longer just stand to use their
life savings but to go to jail for sharing

00:34:17.509 --> 00:34:20.490
files the way we all did when we were kids.
I mean I don't know about you but if it wasn't

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:27.649
for mix tapes, my entire adolescence would
have been celibate, you know? So this is a

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:31.389
disaster. It also includes a burden for those
of you who travel, it includes a burden on

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:36.639
every country's customs officers to search
hard drives and any other storage media that

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:40.220
could be capable of carrying something that
would be a substantial copyright infringement,

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:44.029
and at first they said, "Oh, well this wouldn't
include iPods and personal stereos because

00:34:44.029 --> 00:34:47.609
they don't carry enough music to be a substantial
infringement." And then someone kind of pointed

00:34:47.609 --> 00:34:52.970
out to them that 80 gigs is a lot of music
and that it's going up from there every year

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:59.680
and I think iPods are kind of back in the
definition here. So, this is where it's headed

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.530
because we're not making copyright law with
an eye to all the other things that happen

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:10.970
on the Internet. You know, a burden on ISP's
to surveil their customers won't really stop

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.670
pirates. I mean, you and I can figure out
a hundred ways to encrypt your traffic so

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:20.140
that an ISP's depacket inspection would be
completely incapable of discovering it, right?

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:25.380
When they sued Napster and started to interdict
Napster servers and declared victory on the

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:30.009
war on file sharing, everyone who looked at
it said, "Well, no. Now that you sued Napster,

00:35:30.009 --> 00:35:33.559
they'll just reimplement Newtella and make
it a little better." And then when they started

00:35:33.559 --> 00:35:37.849
to sue Newtella trackers, they said, "Well,
okay. They're just going to tracker list Newtella's

00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:41.240
and then they'll start ding tracker list bit
torrent." I mean, you're just evolving the

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:45.160
world's most perfect antibiotic resistant
bacterium here. You know, this isn't going

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:50.510
to actually stop it. The only reason that
it's possible to eavesdrop on file sharing

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:54.930
traffic is because no can be arsed to encrypt
it. It's not because encrypting traffic is

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.450
a particularly challenging problem, we do
it every day. Bankers manage to do it. If

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:06.880
bankers can do it, anyone can do it. [laughing]
So, I'm an artist and copyright does effect

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.839
my livelihood and I'm pretty sure that I can
make a living in a freely copied world. You

00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:15.009
know, my books are all available for free
for download. You can buy them in shops and

00:36:15.009 --> 00:36:21.420
they do very well. "Little Brother", the last
one that came out, 17 languages and film rights

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.700
sold to the guy who made "Transformers" and
you know, video game rights and CD rights

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:30.339
under discussion and so on and so forth, New
York Times Bestseller. I just got a huge check

00:36:30.339 --> 00:36:33.940
for it and I'm going to pay off most of my
mortgage with it. I mean, generally speaking,

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:39.460
I think I can make a living in a copy native
world but even if I couldn't, I'd still be

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.019
a copy fighter and I would be because I'm
also a father and I'm a citizen, I'm an immigrant,

00:36:44.019 --> 00:36:48.049
I'm a son, I'm a husband, I'm a volunteer,
I'm a student, and I'm a teacher, and I don't

00:36:48.049 --> 00:36:52.980
want all those rules to be sacrificed on copyrights'
altar. Principle is the thing that you stand

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.279
on, even when it's not convenient for you
personally and it's time that we take principle

00:36:57.279 --> 00:37:02.670
stands on these issues, even if they may eat
some of our lunch. So there's lot of organizations

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.599
you can join. I talked about the Open Rights
Group. I co-founded that here in the UK although

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:09.849
I have very little to do with running it.
I'm on the advisory board, along with Ben

00:37:09.849 --> 00:37:15.250
Laurie, who works out of this office and many
other interesting and good people. Also, Alan

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:21.961
Cox who you may know from old Linux kernel
maintenance, although he's not doing that

00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:26.240
anymore famously. But there's also groups
like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, EDRI,

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.799
all around the world and we are making serious
headway, not just by shutting down bad laws

00:37:31.799 --> 00:37:35.440
although we've done plenty of that but also
by holding them at bay long enough for people

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:40.059
to understand what's at stake because as soon
as the civilians among us, the people who

00:37:40.059 --> 00:37:44.400
don't work with computers every day, the people
who don't understand that cryptography is

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.900
easy, the people that don't understand that
the Internet is for more then MP3's. As soon

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.269
as they come to realize all the things that
they can do with the net, then our fight becomes

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:57.460
exponentially easier because it's not just
a few anarachs calling up their MP's and saying

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.319
you are going to do something that you don't
understand to something else that you don't

00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:04.289
understand and that will be bad in a way that
you don't understand but it's everyone going

00:38:04.289 --> 00:38:08.619
down to their MP surgeries and saying you
can't do this. You can't do this because we

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:12.309
won't vote for you, you can't do this because
it will destroy fundamental and important

00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:15.980
things about our civil society. So that's
what I'd like to ask you to do. I mean, you

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.881
can buy my book if you want, you can download
it for free from the Internet if you want.

00:38:18.881 --> 00:38:25.880
That'd be nice, I'm not bothered because it
sells pretty well, although I'll mention it's

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:31.309
a 'tenner' today which is a very stellar deal
but what I hope you'll do at the end of this

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:35.640
talk is that if you're not already an ORG
member, you'll join. It's a 'fiver' a month

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.869
but you'll get involved with the Electronic
Frontier Foundation with Free Software Foundation

00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:41.470
Europe. I hope that you'll talk to your MP's
and the people in your life because Googlers

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:47.781
have a lot of moral authority in this world,
going to your personal MP at your MP's next

00:38:47.781 --> 00:38:53.240
surgery and talking to her or him about Mandelson's
proposal will make a huge difference as an

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.499
employee of Google so I hope that you'll do
that and I hope that you'll continue to take

00:38:57.499 --> 00:39:01.619
action on this and I hope that you won't make
the mistake of thinking that superior technology

00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:05.769
will make inferior laws irrelevant because
the Internet isn't free because it's inherently

00:39:05.769 --> 00:39:09.040
free. It's free because we fought it to keep
it that way. Thank you.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.040
[applause]

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:16.470
&gt;&gt; So, we have about 20 minutes for questions.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.660
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I am losing my voice a little. I'm
coming down with a cold or coming over a cold.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.660
We have a mic in the back too.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.660
&gt;&gt; Who has questions?

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.660
&gt;&gt; Thanks Cory. Because you give your books
away online for free and you still have a

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:28.580
print business, do you have to butt heads
with your publishers in every country every

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:43.170
time you do this or are they just now know
it's you and they're okay with it? You're

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:45.140
actually the, you know, minority.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:50.019
Cory Doctorow &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was really lucky
in that my editor who bought my first novel,

00:39:50.019 --> 00:39:53.310
Patrick Nielsen Hayden at Tor Books in New
York, who runs the largest science fiction

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:57.930
line in the world and is the most senior editor
there. I've known him since I was 17. I met

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:02.700
him on a BBS. He maintains his own Linux boxes,
he writes his own movable type plugins and

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:06.319
when I sat down and said, "There's this new
thing coming out called a Creative Commons

00:40:06.319 --> 00:40:11.650
License and I want to try releasing a book
under it." He said, "E-books have the worst

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:16.800
ratio of hours in meetings to dollars in income
generated of anything this publisher has ever

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.859
done. Why don't we try it, right? What's the
worst that can happen?" Publishing like every

00:40:21.859 --> 00:40:26.359
other business is essentially an IT business
these days. You know, Walmart isn't a Chinese

00:40:26.359 --> 00:40:32.040
manufacturer of goods business, Walmart is
an IT business that uses IT to manage a supply

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:39.480
chain that moves a shipping container once
per second from China to America so they're

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.369
an IT company too and they've experienced
great benefits from IT and among those is

00:40:43.369 --> 00:40:47.829
that they can do very short run hard covers
so they can print four to six thousand copies

00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:51.130
of a first novel to hard cover. This is great
for first novelists because it used to be

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.140
that first novels were always in mass market
paperback and they do 50,000 so unless they

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:58.060
felt they could 50,000, they wouldn't take
a chance on it. Now they are publishing tons

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.510
of first novels because they can do it. You
know, I come from a big Ashkenazi family.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:07.559
If everyone of my relatives buys a copy, we've
earned out. So it's a very low risk experiment,

00:41:07.559 --> 00:41:11.859
which we did and it worked really well. Everybody
was happy and they reprinted the book a whole

00:41:11.859 --> 00:41:15.599
ton and it generated a lot of publicity which
is nice because it was the first thing but

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:20.309
it also generated a lot of secondary publicity
which was not the publicity of "Oh my God,

00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:23.670
this is a Creative Commons License book. I'm
a slashed out reader. I support them inherently,

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:27.519
you should read it", it was the publicity
that went "Oh my God, I love this book and

00:41:27.519 --> 00:41:31.859
I'd like to press it into your hands the way
that we have done with books since time in

00:41:31.859 --> 00:41:35.339
memorial except I can press it into your hands
even though you live in a different country

00:41:35.339 --> 00:41:39.859
and I can press it into your hands without
parting with it", and so that magnification

00:41:39.859 --> 00:41:44.180
of the good feeling people had about my book
on its own merits was selling lots of books

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:49.119
too. So that kind of set the tone for things,
right? By the time I'd done three novels that

00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:53.619
were CC licensed and sold "Little Brother",
both here and in the US, was the first novel

00:41:53.619 --> 00:41:59.119
I sold in both countries, it was pretty straightforward.
There wasn't really anything that Harper Collins

00:41:59.119 --> 00:42:02.859
could say or do because it was already CC
licensed, right? We weren't going to be able

00:42:02.859 --> 00:42:08.360
to take that back and so they kind of came
onboard and they were very good about it.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.279
The woman who is running it, she is very kind
of IT centric, very Internet savvy and she

00:42:12.279 --> 00:42:16.500
invited me in to talk to the whole business
about copyright, technology, DRM and why it

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:24.079
doesn't work. You know, to publishers who
believe in DRM I say, "Behold: the typist",

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:29.490
and it went great. Now my foreign publishers
have been a little more complicated only because

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:36.460
the relationship tends to be more attenuated
so its my agent's sub-agent dealing with an

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:42.880
editor and so I often times don't even know
who the editor at a foreign publisher is and

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.519
every now and again, I'll get an email from
a reader saying, "You know, we just translated

00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:49.239
your book into Bulgarian and your Bulgarian
publisher is going crazy." It's not a real

00:42:49.239 --> 00:42:55.310
example. I won't narc on the real publisher
who did this and I write to my agent and my

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.609
agent writes his sub-agent and his sub-agent
writes to the publisher and the publisher

00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:03.140
writes back and says, "We had no idea. We
thought that they were violating copyright.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.210
If you're okay with it, I guess we're okay
with it too. It seems like it's working pretty

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:10.299
well." So I mean, I think foreign publishers
are a lot more worried about the fact that

00:43:10.299 --> 00:43:14.970
for science fiction, in translation, a good
portion that audience reads English and they

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:18.799
will buy the books from Amazon before the
foreign edition comes out so I think they're

00:43:18.799 --> 00:43:25.989
way more interested in doing day and dates
so now I'm taking pitches of my books and

00:43:25.989 --> 00:43:30.269
even the roughs of the books and giving them
to my agent's foreign agent to take to Frankfurt

00:43:30.269 --> 00:43:33.480
to the book fair and to London to the book
fair to sell the foreign rights so they can

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:38.740
come out at the same time, not for the CC
but just because so many kind of geeky science

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.299
fiction readers in whatever country read enough
English that they'll just happily order the

00:43:42.299 --> 00:43:48.660
American or British edition off of Amazon
unless there's an edition in their native

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.660
language.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.480
&gt;&gt; Thanks. So you say basically for books
it's a little bit less free because it's harder

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.819
to consume digitally. What about other media?
I mean, it's a lot easier to consume music

00:43:57.819 --> 00:44:04.609
and TV or TV shows online. Is your opinion
a little bit differentiated?

00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:10.849
Cory Doctorow &gt;&gt; Well, I actually say arguably
that music is better online than it is in

00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:14.609
CD, at least if you live in London, right?
Every centimeter I give over to a CD is a

00:44:14.609 --> 00:44:19.220
centimeter I can't give over to my daughter,
you know? In my tiny London flat so yeah I

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:23.789
mean, we took all the DVD's out of the sitting
room and ripped them and all of the sudden

00:44:23.789 --> 00:44:27.680
we got like three more shelves we could use
for books. It was fantastic, right? And we

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.869
compressed them down to a hard drive about
'yay big', right? This is brilliant. So yeah,

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:39.259
arguably it's much better. Now seventy years
ago, Vaudeville and live performance were

00:44:39.259 --> 00:44:44.880
all but destroyed by the radio and the record
player and the Vaudeville artists of the day

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.990
said you know, yes, there may be a business
opportunity for the kind of people who sound

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:53.640
good on a record but some of us aren't recording
artists, we're performers, right? You lose

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.799
something when you move our performance to
a record. We are not going to be mere clerks

00:44:57.799 --> 00:45:02.239
who sit in a backroom and let you intervene
with our audiences on our behalf, we are doing

00:45:02.239 --> 00:45:06.710
something old and holy, you know? This is
as old as stories told in front of fire so

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:11.190
you have no right to tell us how to earn our
living. Those people ended up driving taxis.

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:14.589
Seventy years later, the people who put them
out of business and their spiritual descendents

00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:19.170
are saying, "What do you mean I have to be
a performer? I'm not a performer. I'm a white

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.880
collar worker. I labor indoors and when I'm
done, I slide my work under the door and some

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.849
bourgeois man of commerce takes it out to
my audience. You have no right to turn me

00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:32.589
into a trained monkey." And the ones who say
that will end up driving taxis because that's

00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:36.420
the way it goes. Technology giveth and technology
taketh away. The point of copyright shouldn't

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:41.950
be to ensure that one particular kind of creation,
right, music performed in music halls, music

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:45.960
performed in record studios, music performed
in large venues, music performed in small

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.529
studios, that one particular kind thrives
at whatever expense it takes, it should be

00:45:50.529 --> 00:45:54.650
to ensure that the largest number of people
can participate at the lowest cost and that's

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:58.910
what you get when you move to a 'give your
recordings away for free on the Internet and

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:02.599
solicit donations to do live performance'
model which is working for everyone from Jonathan

00:46:02.599 --> 00:46:07.819
Coulton down at the bottom to Madonna up at
the top, and frankly replacing the record

00:46:07.819 --> 00:46:12.400
industry's opportunities for artists is pretty
trivial because 97% of the artists in the

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.680
United States with a record deal earn $600
a year or less from it. You can probably make

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.839
that on AdSense on a lot of those pages, right?
So this is, you know, doing as well as the

00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:26.359
record industry has done for artists, not
hard. I mean, I'd like to set the bar a little

00:46:26.359 --> 00:46:32.400
higher then that frankly but not hard to at
least do that. As to films, I like seeing

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.980
robots throwing buildings at each other as
much as the next guy but maybe we've reached

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:40.150
the end of the 300 million dollar movie. You
know, does that mean that we've reached the

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:44.220
end of movie making? I think YouTube says
no because for all that, there's a few Jon

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:49.660
Stewart clips and what have you on the net,
on Youtube there is so much more stuff out

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:54.900
there that represents the kind of movies that
people can make outside of a studio system

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.130
and their values are different, right? They're
not about the resolution of the CGI, they

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:03.160
are about the intimacy and the importance
to the small but critical audience for whom

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:08.660
the movie was made, right? It's not about
reaching a million people with a beautiful

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:12.509
movie, it's about reaching six people with
a movie that's so personal that it touches

00:47:12.509 --> 00:47:17.330
every one of them in a way that's completely
unforeseen and unprecedented in the history

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:21.979
of film making and again, if we lose one to
get the other, c'est la vie, right? The Protestant

00:47:21.979 --> 00:47:26.019
Reformation got rid of all the cathedral buildings
and we got lots and lots of little wee kirks

00:47:26.019 --> 00:47:30.420
on the hill. Religion didn't end, right? So
yeah, there's lots of different things that

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.932
is going to happen to a lot of different kinds
of creative enterprise and actually one of

00:47:33.932 --> 00:47:38.979
the great lies of copyright is that there's
such a thing as a copyrighted work. That you

00:47:38.979 --> 00:47:43.029
can apply the same regulation incentives to
the creation of crossword puzzles, needlepoint

00:47:43.029 --> 00:47:49.900
patterns, 300 million dollar movies, cake
decorations, one off sculptures, mass market

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:54.109
novels, and pornography and that you'll get
the same outcomes in all of them, right? This

00:47:54.109 --> 00:48:01.720
is a crazy idea and you know it's kind of
a consequence of a bunch of historical anomalies,

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.651
that all these things have been grouped under
this odious umbrella we call intellectual

00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:12.349
property. The actual like on the ground reality
is that they all respond to different incentives,

00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:17.249
they all have different market characteristics
and none of them as a class are threatened,

00:48:17.249 --> 00:48:23.579
although members of the class are and you
know I weep for the lost poets of days gone

00:48:23.579 --> 00:48:27.819
by and I miss the days where the man would
walk down the street with his bell and a knife

00:48:27.819 --> 00:48:31.480
sharpener but technology giveth and technology
taketh away and so long as we've got sharp

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:36.049
knives and poetry, we're okay. Other questions?

00:48:36.049 --> 00:48:45.489
&gt;&gt; 
So I tend to like the user experience that

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:52.540
Spotify has built. I am a Spotify fan. I'm
not sure in your kind of view of principle

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.789
to copyright if Spotify is a good thing or
a bad thing.

00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:59.630
Cory Doctorow &gt;&gt; I think Spotify is a great
thing as far as it goes, although I think

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:03.999
that you know streaming is the flawgicine
of the 21st century. There is no such thing

00:49:03.999 --> 00:49:07.240
as 'streaming', right? There's just downloading
and then sometimes your computer keeps the

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.910
bits and sometimes it doesn't. So the illusion
that Spotify is not giving you copies of the

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:19.039
music that it sends to you is a kind of mass
hysteria among record executives and I worry

00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:22.109
that eventually they are going to wake up
and go, "Wait a second. You told us that there

00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:25.519
was a thing called streaming. It turns out
it's just downloading where the client throws

00:49:25.519 --> 00:49:29.700
away the bits and you can write a client that
doesn't throw away the bits!" And I also worry

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:34.369
that that might lead you on a path to saying,
"Well, there should be regulations saying

00:49:34.369 --> 00:49:37.680
that people can't write their own clients."
But networks protocols, or that there should

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.920
be non user accessible components on their
computer, all of which are not particularly

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.829
plausible technical premises, right? You know,
I'm going to hide a key somewhere on your

00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:48.819
computer, I'm going to give that computer
to anyone who wants to buy one and trust that

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:53.319
no one in the entire world has an electron
tunneling microscope and wants to take their

00:49:53.319 --> 00:49:57.770
computer and look at it, right? It's just
not a really plausible premise and yet we

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:02.569
kind of build on that anyway but what I think
the problem with Spotify, to the extent that

00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:07.269
there is one, is that people are saying, "Well,
we've got Spotify so we solve file sharing."

00:50:07.269 --> 00:50:11.420
And the problem isn't that Spotify isn't good,
the problem is that people haven't voluntarily

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:18.549
stopped using P2P MP3 technologies and moved
over to Spotify and there's not really any

00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:22.220
reason to believe, I think, that they're going
to in great numbers which leaves you with

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:27.420
this bizarre circumstance where kind of everyone
is a copyright criminal to some value of everyone,

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:31.109
even though Spotify is going great guns and
when everyone is presumptively a criminal,

00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:36.680
it's really bad for society. So in America,
at Swarthmore College, there was a kid who

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:42.759
was maintaining a piece of free software called
Flatland. Flatland indexed Samba shares on

00:50:42.759 --> 00:50:49.009
the network, in the same way that Google indexes
HTP shares on the Web and it got all the things

00:50:49.009 --> 00:50:52.400
that you would find on a Samba share on a
university network. It got profs lectures

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.549
and their notes and all the rest of it but
also you know games, movies, music, porn,

00:50:56.549 --> 00:51:00.579
whatever kids had so the record industry sued
this kid, not for maintaining a search engine

00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:04.839
which is of course totally illegal or you'd
all be clapped in irons, they sued him for

00:51:04.839 --> 00:51:08.859
being a music downloader and they knew he
was a music downloader because he is an American

00:51:08.859 --> 00:51:12.829
university student and they are all music
downloaders and because the penalty for being

00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:16.810
a downloader is a 150 thousand dollars per
infringement, they were able to exert enormous

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:21.250
leverage over him so they said, "We not only
want your entire life savings, as we ask for

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:24.979
all the students we go after, we want you
to change majors. We don't want you to get

00:51:24.979 --> 00:51:28.319
a computer science degree because we don't
want people like you programming computers.

00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:32.559
We want to make an example out of you." Now
this was not very good strategy on their part

00:51:32.559 --> 00:51:35.829
because it was so obnoxious that we were able
to make a huge stink out of it and they had

00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:40.579
to back off on the demand but that's the leverage
you get over people when they're presumptively

00:51:40.579 --> 00:51:45.369
guilty of something, is that you can go after
them for things that aren't unlawful and you

00:51:45.369 --> 00:51:49.979
can use the leverage that they're all criminals
in some other realm to force them to give

00:51:49.979 --> 00:51:54.650
up things that merely upset your apple cart
so that's what I worry about Spotify. Spotify

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:58.579
doesn't solve the big problem, that we're
all criminals, right? You know, we could have

00:51:58.579 --> 00:52:02.680
a thousand Spotify's, it'd be great. I'd be
delighted to see it but it still wouldn't

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.259
solve the important problem.

00:52:05.259 --> 00:52:10.220
&gt;&gt; I wondered if the movie rights to your
books are given away as freely as the books

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.970
themselves and whether there were any issues
when you discussed making "Little Brother".

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:17.650
Cory Doctorow &gt;&gt; It kind of depends on what
you mean by the movie rights. So the Noncommercial

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:23.680
Creative Commons Movie Right, the CCNCSA,
are given away. Anyone can make a movie. There

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.859
have been a couple of nice little student
films based on it. The commercial movie rights

00:52:28.859 --> 00:52:33.749
are negotiated through a system of regulation
that has been reasonably good at moderating

00:52:33.749 --> 00:52:37.930
the supply chain of the entertainment industry.
Copyright, right? So here I am, an industrial

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:41.970
player, right? I have a lawyer, I have an
agent, I have a publisher, they have lawyers,

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:45.960
I have a film company and they have lawyers
and agents, and they all sit down and they

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:52.759
talk to each other and they use a system of
regulation devised to bound those negotiations

00:52:52.759 --> 00:52:59.250
and that's how we make the movie, right? But
if you're 16 years old or 36 years old or

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:04.059
56 years old and you've just got a Flip camera
and you want to spend your Christmas break

00:53:04.059 --> 00:53:08.019
making a little film out of "Little Brother"
that you're going to put on YouTube and not

00:53:08.019 --> 00:53:11.470
charge any money for, you don't need to talk
to copyright because it doesn't make any sense

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:15.279
for you to talk to copyright. You don't have
a lawyer, my lawyer doesn't want to talk to

00:53:15.279 --> 00:53:21.150
you, right? I'm not going to pay my lawyer
$400 an hour to talk to you to find out to

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.849
basically make sure that the thing that you're
making that won't make me any money is going

00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:27.670
to be good. This is the other tragedy, of
course, of copyright. It's not just that it

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:31.529
makes no sense for a 12 year old to call Warner's
and find out whether or not she can make a

00:53:31.529 --> 00:53:35.000
Harry Potter fan site; it's that no one at
Warner's will answer the phone when she does,

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.099
right? Because it makes no sense for Warner's
to negotiate this with a 12 year old, right?

00:53:40.099 --> 00:53:44.289
So yeah, I have the same deal for every filmmaker
that I have for everyone who wants to use

00:53:44.289 --> 00:53:49.480
my books which is commercial deal: talk to
my agent; noncommercial deal: go crazy and

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.539
share alike. Let other people do stuff with
your stuff and you know, it's working for

00:53:53.539 --> 00:53:58.200
me. It puts me in this great position where
you know financially, I'm doing great but

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.509
artistically, I'm doing great. I'm not insisting
that my art made in the 21st century not be

00:54:03.509 --> 00:54:10.930
copied which is such a crazy un-21st century
proposition, right? It's kind of cool that

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:16.339
someone is like the blacksmith at the reenactment
of the Battle of 1066 once a year but that's

00:54:16.339 --> 00:54:20.869
not exactly contemporary art, you know? I
like to make contemporary art because it's

00:54:20.869 --> 00:54:24.510
science fiction and contemporary art has to
assume that it's going to be copied because

00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:28.880
it's the 21st century. So I get to do the
thing that's artistically right and morally

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.089
right because I don't have to go around telling
people not to copy when I copy all day long.

00:54:33.089 --> 00:54:39.579
I don't have to go around pretending that,
you know, I live in some great moral Olympus

00:54:39.579 --> 00:54:43.880
and that they're all doing something that's
wrong. You know, every movie company, every

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:49.690
publisher, every record company, they all
copy their asses off, right? No movie starts

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:54.059
without someone going out and making a mood
book by scanning and copying and photocopying

00:54:54.059 --> 00:54:58.450
bits and pieces of visual stuff that they
want to put together to instruct the design

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:03.160
team, right? When Kirby Dick, who is a wonderful
documentary filmmaker, made a movie called

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:08.700
"This Film Was Not Yet Rated" about the American
Film Rating system which is shrouded in secrecy,

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.940
no one really knows. You know, you go now
and it's like to the cinema here, you know

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:17.460
Quentin Thomas says you are allowed to watch
this movie but when you go to a movie in the

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.710
US, it just says the MPAA has rated this whatever,
PG, and the identities of the people on the

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:25.049
MPAA's rating board are kept a secret and
they're supposed to be rotated every few years

00:55:25.049 --> 00:55:28.170
and it's supposed to be parents of young kids
and Kirby didn't think they were so he hired

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:31.769
a private eye to follow them around and he
made a documentary about it. He found out

00:55:31.769 --> 00:55:36.789
all their identities and submitted it to the
Ratings Board for a rating. So he gets a phone

00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:40.690
call from the MPAA's chief lobbyist who is
an ex-Congressman living in Washington, DC

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:45.039
and the man says, "Kirby, I've seen your movie.",
and he says, "Really? That's interesting because

00:55:45.039 --> 00:55:48.220
as far I know, it's in Los Angeles and you're
in Washington." He says, "Well, one of them

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.109
sent me a copy." And Kirby says, "Well, what
do you mean they sent you a copy? I didn't

00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:56.420
authorize them to make a copy." And he said,
"Oh don't worry. It's in my vault." Like I

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.749
don't know if we can get away with that. "Yes,
I've got a hard drive with twenty thousand

00:55:59.749 --> 00:56:07.529
infringing MP3's, I keep it in vault though."
But they copy all day long. We all copy all

00:56:07.529 --> 00:56:12.299
day long. The rest of the movie is about incidentally
about what happens with Kirby and the MPAA.

00:56:12.299 --> 00:56:15.750
It's very good movie. It's called "This Film
Is Not Yet Rated". It's absolutely brilliant

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:20.960
and I think it's a CC download at this point
so there's no excuse not to watch it and he's

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:26.279
just done a new movie called "Outrageous".
That's where he outs gay American right wing

00:56:26.279 --> 00:56:31.521
senators who oppose gay marriage and gay rights
which is quite an amazing bit of film as well.

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:36.740
Anyway, so that was my talk. Thank you very
much. As I said, these are only a 'tenner'

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:45.259
according to my publisher which at the cover
price is fifteen quid so it's a 30% discount

00:56:45.259 --> 00:56:51.390
and I'm not sure who takes the money. Is that
you guys? Yeah, I think so and you can also

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.309
download them for free and it was very nice
to meet you all. If you need to get in touch

00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:56.200
with me, I am the first Cory in Google. Thanks.

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:56.470
[applause]
