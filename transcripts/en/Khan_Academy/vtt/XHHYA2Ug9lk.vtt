00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
- [Voiceover] When we first learned

00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.078
to multiply and divide
positive and negative numbers,

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:05.132
we saw, well look, if you have

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:08.360
a positive number times a positive number.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.682
I'm just writing "pos" short for positive.

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:11.626
Well that, of course, is going

00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:13.143
to be equal to a positive number

00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:14.180
that you saw that even before

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.720
you learned about negative numbers.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.375
There's also true if
you had the same sign,

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:21.153
a negative times a negative,
that that was also going

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:23.173
to be equal to a positive number.

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:25.310
And that the way that you
get a negative number,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.932
is if you multiply or divide
something of different signs.

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:32.670
So if you have a positive times a negative

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.965
that would give you a negative number.

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:38.982
Or if you had a negative,
negative times a positive,

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:40.955
that also would give
you a negative number.

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:42.752
And here I wrote it for multiplication,

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:44.435
but it also applies to division.

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:47.946
A negative divided by
a negative is positive.

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:51.586
A negative divided by a
positive would be negative.

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:52.700
Now all of these, we thought about

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.255
if we're only multiplying
or dividing two things.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.578
But I was just thinking about what happens

00:00:56.578 --> 00:00:58.051
if we multiply or divide three things,

00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.491
or four things, or five things,

00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:03.742
or n things together,
what we might expect?

00:01:03.742 --> 00:01:08.107
So let's say that we
were to multiply a times,

00:01:08.107 --> 00:01:10.155
and now I'm going to
write the dot for times.

00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:15.155
A times b times c,

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.581
a times b times c.

00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:21.716
Now if I told you that these
were all positive numbers,

00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:23.364
then you say, "OK a
times b times c is going

00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:24.220
"to be positive."

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.974
"A times b would be positive,
and that times c is positive."

00:01:27.497 --> 00:01:29.796
Now what would happen
if I were to tell you

00:01:29.796 --> 00:01:31.862
that they were all negative numbers.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:34.858
What if a, b, and c were all negative?

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:36.354
Well if there were all negative,
let me write it that way.

00:01:36.354 --> 00:01:38.080
Let me actually write,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.222
let me write, a, b, and c,

00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:46.026
a, b, and c, they're all
going to be negative.

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:47.698
So if that's the case,
what is this product

00:01:47.698 --> 00:01:49.462
going to be equal to?

00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:53.340
Well you're going to have a
negative here, times a negative.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.940
So a negative times a negative, a times b,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.402
if you do that first, and we can

00:01:58.402 --> 00:01:59.725
when we multiply these numbers.

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:01.490
That's going to give you a positive.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.183
So a times b is going
to give you a positive.

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:06.598
But then you're going to
multiply that times c.

00:02:06.598 --> 00:02:09.616
You're going to multiply that
times c, which is a negative.

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:12.379
So you're going to have a
positive times a negative,

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.491
which is going to be a negative.

00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:20.277
So this one, if a, b, and
c are all less than zero,

00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:22.782
then the product, a, b, c is going

00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:25.939
to be less than zero as well.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.888
This whole thing is going to be negative.

00:02:28.888 --> 00:02:30.444
Now, if I did something else.

00:02:30.444 --> 00:02:32.061
If I said, "There's other ways

00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:33.811
"that I can make the product negative."

00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:37.282
If a is, let's say that a,

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.328
actually let me just write it this way.

00:02:38.328 --> 00:02:42.968
Let's say that a is
positive, b is negative.

00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:47.473
B is negative, and c is positive.

00:02:47.473 --> 00:02:49.458
And c is positive.

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:54.458
Well here, positive times a
negative, if you do this first.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.515
Positive times a negative is
going to give you a negative.

00:02:57.515 --> 00:02:59.025
And then a negative times a positive,

00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:01.486
different signs, is going
to give you a negative.

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:03.088
So this whole thing,

00:03:03.088 --> 00:03:06.176
this whole thing is
going to be a negative.

00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:07.384
But let's keep on doing, we said,

00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:08.893
look if all of them are negative,

00:03:08.893 --> 00:03:10.100
then this thing would be negative,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.331
but that's because I
had three numbers here.

00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:12.863
What if I had four numbers here?

00:03:12.863 --> 00:03:17.182
What if I had times,

00:03:17.182 --> 00:03:19.736
What if I had times d here?

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:22.453
And if I told you all of
these numbers were negative?

00:03:22.453 --> 00:03:24.357
Let's think about it, if negative,

00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:27.979
negative, negative, negative.

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.929
And I can do the
multiplication in any order,

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.624
but I'll just go left to right.

00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:34.318
A times b, negative times a negative.

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:36.268
That would yield a positive.

00:03:36.268 --> 00:03:39.472
Now if you multiply that product times c,

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:43.605
positive times a negative,
positive times a negative,

00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:47.159
positive times a negative that
would give you a negative.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.969
And then you multiply this
negative times this negative,

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.476
so this whole product, a, b,
c, is going to be negative.

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:54.543
But then we multiply it times a negative.

00:03:54.543 --> 00:03:56.818
Well a negative times a negative
is going to be a positive.

00:03:56.818 --> 00:03:59.697
So this whole thing is
going to be a positive.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:03.018
And so you're probably
seeing a pattern here.

00:04:03.018 --> 00:04:05.734
If you're multiplying a bunch of numbers,

00:04:05.734 --> 00:04:07.685
if you're multiplying a bunch of numbers,

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.531
and if you have an odd
number of negatives,

00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:13.930
odd number of negatives

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.298
being multiplied, and or divided.

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:17.841
I just did multiplication here,

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.072
but this would have also been true

00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:20.837
if these were all division symbols.

00:04:20.837 --> 00:04:22.810
If these were all division symbols,

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.945
we would've been able to
say the exact same thing.

00:04:25.945 --> 00:04:29.056
If you have an odd number
of negative numbers

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:31.169
in your product or in your quotient,

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.778
well then you're going to have a negative,

00:04:33.778 --> 00:04:35.467
you're going to have a negative

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:37.986
value for the entire expression.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:41.090
If you have an even, if you have an even

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.348
number of negative,

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:47.286
well then the whole thing is going to be,

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:49.712
the whole thing is going to be positive.

00:04:49.712 --> 00:04:51.685
And so you can view
these as generalizations

00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:53.148
of what we just saw here.

00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:55.014
Positive times a positive.

00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:55.842
You have zero negative.

00:04:55.842 --> 00:04:59.052
Zero is actually an even number,
so this would be positive.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.857
Negative times a negative.

00:05:00.857 --> 00:05:02.436
Well that's an even number of negatives.

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:04.956
You have two negatives,
so that's this case again.

00:05:04.956 --> 00:05:08.171
That's this case again, so
you're going to be positive.

00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.957
Either of these cases,
you have one negative.

00:05:10.957 --> 00:05:13.179
You have one negative in
either of these cases,

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.774
so it's going to be this
case, odd number of negatives.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.410
So that's going to be a negative.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.287
And so, we can use this
knowledge to start dealing

00:05:19.287 --> 00:05:20.912
with negative numbers and exponents.

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:25.858
So if I were to say,
I would have a to the,

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:28.726
let me throw out a wild number here,

00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:31.442
A to the 101st power,

00:05:31.442 --> 00:05:36.272
And we know that a is less than zero.

00:05:36.272 --> 00:05:37.990
What is this going to be?

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.030
Well this is taking 101 A's
and multiplying them together.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.095
You have an odd number, an odd number

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.696
of negatives being multiplied together?

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:50.089
Well this whole then is going,

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:52.514
this whole thing is going
to be less than zero.

00:05:52.514 --> 00:05:54.749
If we knew what a was, we
could calculate it somehow,

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:57.401
but we know that this thing
is going to be negative.

00:05:57.401 --> 00:06:00.605
Let's do something, so, and
we could do it other ways.

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:02.607
We could say something like this.

00:06:02.607 --> 00:06:03.740
Actually, let me try another one.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.443
What if I tell you that
a is less than zero,

00:06:08.443 --> 00:06:11.402
and b is also less than zero,

00:06:11.402 --> 00:06:13.193
and if I had a

00:06:13.193 --> 00:06:16.708
to the 101 power,

00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:19.690
divided by b to the seventh power,

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.809
what would this expression be?

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:22.666
Would it be positive or negative?

00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:24.942
Or zero, maybe?

00:06:24.942 --> 00:06:27.705
Well you see here, a to the 101st power.

00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:30.422
You have an odd number of,

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:34.908
you have an odd number of
negative numbers being multiplied.

00:06:34.908 --> 00:06:39.682
So this whole thing is
going to be negative.

00:06:39.682 --> 00:06:41.029
And the same thing applies here.

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:42.863
You have a negative
number to an odd power.

00:06:42.863 --> 00:06:43.978
You have an odd number of this

00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:46.230
negative number being multiplied together.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.088
So that's going to be negative,

00:06:48.088 --> 00:06:50.897
but then you have a negative
divided by a negative.

00:06:50.897 --> 00:06:54.775
A negative divided by a negative
is going to be a positive.

00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:58.699
So this thing, right here,
is going to be positive.

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.137
So this is just the beginning,
and in the next few videos

00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:02.483
we'll actually do a bunch of examples

00:07:02.483 --> 00:07:05.143
that really test our
understanding of this.
