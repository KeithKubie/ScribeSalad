00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.620
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So
I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.300
I'm Director for the
Center for the Book here

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.600
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.330
And I'd like to welcome
you to our Books

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.930
and Beyond Series
this afternoon.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.370
It is our final one of this
season, so we're thrilled,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.550
very thrilled with the
special conversation we have

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.250
for you today to
complete our season

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.750
and to thank you
guys for being here.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.550
You know, at the
Library of Congress,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.010
we are America's first
cultural institution.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.250
And with that, we, you know,
we live inside our mission,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.710
you know, and it's to provide
a rich and enduring source

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.580
of knowledge, one that's
designed and intended for people

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.130
to create, to endeavor
intellectually,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.500
to prosper and thrive.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.470
And it's a very awesome,
awesome opportunity

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.350
to live inside that mission.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530
And at the Center for the
Book, which includes the Poetry

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.050
and Literature Center, we
promote books and libraries,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.320
reading and literacy, poetry and
literature, and we do so knowing

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.160
that they are very
significant components

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.050
of having an informed
and engaged society.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.690
And that is the Center
for the Book's mission.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.600
And in fulfilling that, we
have talks like we have today.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.000
Today's talk is a culmination
of a couple of things

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.520
that really matter
to the library.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.470
First and foremost,
it's scholarship.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.730
We care a lot about people
knowing what the collections are

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.680
here at the Library of Congress,
and that they can be used,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.800
that they can be researched,
that they can be engaged

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.510
with for the purpose of
a variety of reasons,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.620
including scholarship
publishing,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.740
and celebrating books is
part of what the Books

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.180
and Beyond series does.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.950
So today's event is
a very special one

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.800
with a special author because
it's not just about research

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.890
that was conducted here at
the Library of Congress,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.050
which we encourage, and
invite people to do,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.780
but it's also a result of a
Library of Congress employee,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.160
a very special one at that.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.500
So I should mention a couple
things before I introduce her,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.610
one of which is to
give us a moment now

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.120
to avoid unnecessary
distractions.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.260
Take another distraction,
check on your devices,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.660
make sure you're on silent,
if you would, please.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.430
And that's also because we
are recording today's event.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.240
And should you participate in
the question and answer period

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.770
that does follow
the author's talk,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.490
you'll be recorded
on our webcast.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.650
And so we do invite you to
participate knowing that.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.200
And we encourage you
to visit us at read.gov

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.780
where you can find more than
250 author talks of a variety

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.830
and diversity of topics and
individuals who have been

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.800
with us in this program.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.910
So today's author.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.620
Oh, and the book is for sale.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.840
So here in the back of the
room, make sure that you stop

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.780
by that table and
make your purchase.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.690
And there will be an
opportunity for signing after.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.580
Now, so, today's author, you
know, the chief criterion

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.240
for the Books and Beyond
series, as I mentioned,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.190
is we really want to feature
books that are related

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.830
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.360
Primarily, we focus on those
that are published as a result

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.330
of research done conducted here
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.970
But more significantly today,
we have an author and a scholar

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.050
who is an employee of
the Library of Congress

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.350
who is a long-serving and
dedicated and special employee.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.430
And I just, I've had the
pleasure of knowing you

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.600
for a bit and experiencing
your scholarship.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.430
There are two other
major Library

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.880
of Congress reference works
that Peggy Wagner has produced,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.520
one of which is the Library

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.230
of Congress Civil War desk
reference, and also the Library

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.110
of Congress World
War II companion.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.120
She's also the author
of five other books,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.750
including Maxfield Parrish
and the Illustrators

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.810
of the Golden Age,
and the Library

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.190
of Congress illustrated
timeline of the Civil War.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.920
She, Peggy, excuse me, is
a part of our publishing--

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.860
she is a publisher and
editor with us here

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.160
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.640
And she's going to talk
to us today about America

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.830
and the Great War, a Library of
Congress Illustrated History.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.730
And it's a very,
very marvelous piece.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.280
If you haven't had
a chance to see it

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.740
or read it, it is fabulous.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.890
It's both inspiring.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.400
It's candid and kind
of straight talk.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.040
And also very inspiring.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.060
I feel like I was
there at that time

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.360
as a result of your writing.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.730
So I honor you and
appreciate you.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.160
And let us all bring honor
and acknowledge Peggy Wagner

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.510
as she comes to the stage.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:09.570
[ Applause ]

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.980
&gt;&gt; Margaret Wagner:
Thank you, Pam.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.780
Let's see if I can see
over the microphone.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.300
Can you hear me?

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.170
Okay. And thank you
all for coming

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.450
to hear me talk a little bit
about America and the Great War,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.680
the book and the era
that it describes.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.300
As anyone who has known me for
or who has been with me for more

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.580
than five minutes
over the past five

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.050
or six years knows
this era is one

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.280
that I find incredibly
intriguing.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.000
And I also feel that it's one

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
of the most important
eras to understand.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.310
It's important not just
for the understanding

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.840
of general world history,
but it's also important

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.540
to understand American history.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.640
It's also an era for
which the Library

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.830
of Congress collections
are amazingly almost

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.740
mind-bogglingly rich.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.990
I am the author of
the book, yes,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.160
but I consider this volume
an epic collaboration,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.970
something that you will find
reflected in the two pages

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.120
of acknowledgements at
the back of the book.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.950
You'll find the names there
of many of the Library

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.150
of Congress specialists
and curators who served

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.020
as my professors and guides,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.190
as in this long enterprise
of creating the book.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.380
Several of you are sitting here

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.760
in this room, and
I thank you all.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.330
I would also like to salute the
most talented picture editor

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.150
with whom I've worked
on a number of projects.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.450
Pardon me.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.950
I am having a frog in my
throat perpetually these days.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.350
Athena Angelos, who
is sitting right here.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.270
And I would like to salute
especially, before we go to war,

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.900
my colleagues in the publishing
office who have helped me

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.150
and supported me
through many projects.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.460
Aimee Hess, Peter Devereaux and
Susan Reyburn took time away

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.410
from their own projects to
read and comment on the text.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:34.100
Susan wrote The Battle Boxes
that are a part of the book.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.870
And she also collaborated
with staff around the library

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.270
to produce the appendix
at the end of the book

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.400
on World War I collections
in the Library of Congress

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.290
that I feel is a great
resource for everyone

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.560
who consults the book.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.310
I'd also like to thank the
new director of publishing.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.490
Well, not new anymore.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.560
Becky Clark, who has been
very supportive, gracious

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.870
and good-humored
throughout this project.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.800
So America and the Great War.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.860
This is a huge topic.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:19.130
And the book explores both,
explores military history,

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.020
political and social history,
and it intertwines them.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.620
It is, if you will, a tapestry
of stories within stories.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.160
This makes it very complicated.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.910
So what I thought I'd do
today was present as many

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.020
of the images from the book as I
could possibly cram onto slides.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.110
And there are many of them.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:48.230
And then just try and sort
of hopscotch through the book

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.020
and describe to you some
of the points it makes,

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.130
some of the questions
it addresses.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:00.600
And so we go to war.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:09.270
If you go to today, to what was
100 years ago, the western front

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.190
on which almost all,
but not all,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.140
of American expeditionary
forces served,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.970
you will find many artifacts and
scars from a hundred years ago.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:28.350
You'll also find many
cemeteries, all large and small,

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.720
all perfectly preserved.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.780
In France, you'll
find many memorials

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:41.670
and nine cemeteries devoted to
the commemoration of the brief,

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.720
but very important, American
military involvement in the war.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.050
But the United States was
affected and affected,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.700
itself affected the
war from 1914

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.510
to well after the armistice.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.900
And this book looks at
that entire experience.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.520
The prologue describes
the United States

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.670
in the two years
leading up to the war.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.980
The election of Woodrow Wilson

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.760
and the prevalent
belief among European

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.650
and American progressives,
including Wilson's Secretary

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.070
of State, William J.
Bryan, that the era

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:34.000
of major military conflict
was over, that arbitration

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.090
of international disputes was
the wave of the present time

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.040
and the wave of the future.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.580
It was the apex of
the progressive era,

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.430
and the prologue introduces
the major domestic problems

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.170
that the nation will continue
to confront, argue over,

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.540
and attempt to ameliorate
through the war,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.320
the years, and well beyond.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.990
One of the major problem areas,

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:07.070
as represented here,
was labor relations.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.880
Another, which many
white progressives,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.870
including President
Wilson, preferred to ignore,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.040
was the country's
troubled race relations.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.090
The portrait at the upper right
is the outspoken civil rights

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.010
activist William Monroe
Trotter, the spokesman

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.530
who so offended President Wilson

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.580
that Wilson effectively
banned him

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.050
from the White House in 1914.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.670
Despite the nation's and
Wilson's preferred concentration

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.580
on domestic improvements,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.110
Americans could not avoid
foreign relations concerns.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.950
The most immediate impressing

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:52.060
in spring 1914 was the
ongoing revolution in Mexico,

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.080
the southern neighbor
in which more

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.270
than 40,000 Americans lived,

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.980
and Americans had
significant financial holdings.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.450
Wilson dispatched U.S.
troops to Veracruz in April.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.750
They were still there

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.000
when papers reported the
assassination of Franz Ferdinand

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.530
and his wife, Sophie,
on June 28th.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:19.530
Similar political assassinations
had happened in Europe before

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.270
without major international
consequences.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.840
Few Americans, or
Europeans, for that matter,

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.500
suspected these murders
would be the small spark

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.740
that would ignite full
scale European war.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.500
When the war came,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.530
it immediately affected
the United States.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.320
Stock markets closed and
remained closed for months.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.440
U.S. trade with Europe
came to a temporary,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.560
but tremendously costly, halt.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:57.110
130,000 Americans were stranded
in Europe without access

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.530
to funds or transportation home.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.630
And one of my favorite stories

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.190
in this book is the
rescue mission mounted

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.690
by the United States
government and private partners

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.480
to bring those Americans home.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.180
10,000 of the Americans
approximately who were stranded

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.480
over there were teachers.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.700
And the young gentleman
at the middle

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.690
of the cartoon is the student
who's absolutely delighted

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.640
that school is going
to be delayed.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.410
What's so bad about
this war, he's saying.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.150
The U.S. thought, and people all

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:37.180
around the world thought
everything was bad with the war.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.410
The United States instantly
declared its neutrality.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.740
And President Wilson would
soon embark on a quest

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.620
to guide the warring nations
to the conference table

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.840
to find a negotiated
settlement for the war.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:59.990
In October, 1914, a dent in
perfect U.S. neutrality occurs.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.530
When the Wilson administration
allows private U.S. banks

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.900
to provide substantial loans
to belligerent countries

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.590
in the event most of the money
wound up going to the allies,

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.090
but some did go to
Germany in the beginning.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.890
Those monies would flow back
into the American conference

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.420
in the form of orders
for war material.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.150
And those orders would
help end the recession

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:32.290
and put the entire
country in the black.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:37.580
The book traces the
beginning and progress

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.570
of an absolutely unprecedented
outpouring of American aid

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.840
to war victims, initially on
both sides of the conflict.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.550
And it touches on the
experiences of some

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.530
of the American men who
flouted U.S. neutrality

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.740
to join belligerent forces.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.210
Almost all of them, although
I have found at least two

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.640
who didn't, but almost
all of them serving

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.040
in the allied armed
forces, for the conflict,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.850
at least for Americans,
was beginning to shape

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:19.560
up as a contest between
militarism, autocracy,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.760
evil and democracy,
enlightened democracy.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:32.900
By the end of 1914, expectations
for a short war were dashed.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.650
There are always, by
the way, expectations

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.550
that a war will be short.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.680
And they're almost
never fulfilled.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.090
The land war became an
industrial age nightmare

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:49.970
that introduced a host of new
and supposedly improved weapons.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.600
It was the maritime aspect
of the conflict, however,

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.900
that most immediately
concerned Americans.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.610
The allied surface navy blockade
of the central powers, which,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.220
as it expanded, violated
the accepted rules

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.740
for naval blockading, was
a near constant irritant,

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.760
but an irritant generally offset

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.370
by the incoming allied
war orders.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:21.150
The U-boat counter blockade
on which the Germans embarked

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.260
in February, 1915, and for

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.630
which there were no
governing rules of war.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:32.720
Put American lives and
property in great peril.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.960
The first major crisis came

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:42.360
when 123 Americans were among
the 1,198 people who died

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.100
when a U-boat sank the
British liner Lusitania

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.400
without warning in May, 1915.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.080
From then until April, 1917,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.900
President Wilson still
determined to bring both sides

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.840
to the negotiating table and
keep America out of the war.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.070
He walked a challenging
diplomatic tightrope.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.580
It's so well illustrated here.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.530
While facing increased
political pleasures at home.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.700
The American Peace Movement
remained very strong.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.370
The preparedness movement,
primarily concerned

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:25.130
with national defense rather
than intervention, was growing.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.700
This is one of my favorite
slides because of the caricature

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.950
of Kaiser Bill at the center.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:37.520
It's by a French artist
that I know only as Weal,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.780
and it's from the Willard
Straight Collection

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.690
in the Princeton
Photographs Division.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:49.330
From first Germany, and
soon thereafter, Britain,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.580
produced huge amounts of
propaganda during the war,

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.120
much of it aimed at
the United States.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:03.640
By late 1915, American papers
began publishing verified

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.940
details of German

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.000
and Austro-Hungarian
espionage in the United States.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.520
All sorts of espionage from
the relatively peaceful

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.860
to placing bombs on ships
bound for the allies.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.370
Reports also confirmed that
German agents were seeking

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.420
to increase the turmoil
in Mexico,

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.050
to distract American
attention and resources,

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.340
and lessen the possibility

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.920
that the United States
would join the allies.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.910
To decrease Mexican turmoil,
the Wilson Administration

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:44.800
in October, 1915, turned away
from supporting Pancho Villa,

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.870
who at first had seemed
the strongest candidate

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.120
to bring peace, relative
peace to Mexico,

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.340
and recognized the government
of the new [inaudible].

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.770
This, of course,
infuriated Villa.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.820
And I should mention that George
Viereck, who is pictured here,

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.520
was a German-American editor

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.860
who established a newspaper
called The Fatherland

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.850
as soon as the war began.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.990
And it turned out that
The Fatherland was totally

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.410
subsidized by the
German government.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.070
David Lloyd George at the upper
left-hand corner was a cabinet

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.370
officer at this time.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.870
And it was at his instigation

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:33.300
that the British government
establish what was known

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.870
as Wellington House, which was
their propaganda department,

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:43.650
which the United States later,
committee on public information,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.380
would echo in many ways.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.190
And Wellington House had a
very special department aimed

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.730
directly at influencing
American opinion.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:02.700
In 1916, in January,
the American Review

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.820
of Reviews burst forth
with the following.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.130
ROA for Europe is meaning
devastation and death.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.530
For America, a bumper
crop of new millionaires

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.740
and a hectic hastening
of prosperity revival.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.340
This was not an exaggeration.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.850
And 1916 would be another
financially profitable year.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:30.600
But pressures from beyond
U.S. borders were increasing.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.730
The U-boat dangers, which waned
and waxed, and waned again

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.340
in March, when, for the second
time, the Germans pledged

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.440
that their submarines
would abide by the rules

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.840
of surface warfare, they would
not sink any merchant vessels

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.750
without prior warning,

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:54.120
or without seeing
passengers and crew to safety.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.850
This was restricted
submarine warfare.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.920
That same month, Pancho Villa

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.000
and his [inaudible] raided
Columbus, New Mexico,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.590
murdering 17 Americans,

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.900
and infuriating their
entire country.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.200
General John J. Pershing
led several thousand troops

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.660
into Mexico just
a week or so later

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.700
on a month's long
punitive expedition

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.800
that did not find Villa,
but did increase tensions

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.650
with the Carranza government,

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.370
and did demonstrate how
ill-prepared the United States

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:36.830
Army was for participation
in any major conflict.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:41.520
Britain also incurred American
anger when despite U.S. pleas

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.650
for mercy, it executed the
leaders of the east arising

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:50.340
in Ireland in April, 1916.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.340
And again, when the British
government issued a black list

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.620
of more than 80 American firms
and individuals suspected

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.410
of selling materials
to the central powers.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.620
In Europe, the horrors
of war seemed

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.630
to be growing exponentially
with the Battles of Verdun

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:17.130
and the Somme, two long bloody
destructive slugfests occurring

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.730
in this year.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:24.410
Americans served in the allied
ranks during both battles.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:29.770
Poet Alan Seeger was killed
during the Battle of the Somme.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.240
And Americans were also in
the skies above these battles.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.390
1916, so the official debut

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.390
of a discrete American
flying unit serving

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.260
in the French forces,

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.840
the soon-to-be celebrated
Lafayette Escadrille.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.790
At home, preparedness
forces were gaining,

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.470
now with the assistance
of President Wilson,

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:59.070
who said in one speech, all the
rest of the world is on fire,

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.360
but our own house
is not fireproof.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:08.230
The Naval Appropriations
Act of 1916 called

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:14.950
for a massive expansion
of the U.S. Navy by 1925.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.840
The National Defense Act

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.320
of the same year made some
small improvements in the Army,

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.950
increasing it to the
tremendous number of 175,000,

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:32.610
and made some improvements
in the National Guard,

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.130
including allowing the
president, for the first time,

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:41.200
to deploy National Guard troops
overseas in case of emergency.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.880
On May 27th, Wilson also
announced a major shift

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.620
in U.S. foreign policy,

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.990
declaring the U.S.
a full partner

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.630
in international affairs.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:00.890
We are participants whether
we would or not in the life

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.150
of the world, he said.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:08.700
What affects mankind is
inevitably our affair.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.690
While all of this was
happening, the American Union

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:17.510
against militarism was touring
American cities, making speeches

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.150
against what they saw

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.590
as the American march toward
European style militarism,

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:25.300
and eventual disaster.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.000
AUAM speakers were accompanied

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.790
by a giant paper mache
dinosaur named Jingo, which was,

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:38.970
and I quote, all armor
plate, no brains.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:45.430
1916 was also a presidential
election year.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.930
Wilson versus former
Supreme Court Justice Charles

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.720
Evans Hughes.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.150
And it became a very close race.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.280
Teddy Roosevelt, who had aspired

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.280
to the nomination,
did not get it.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.390
And he support ed Hughes,
whom he referred to privately,

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:09.540
I trust, at the time,
as the bearded iceberg.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.900
It was a close race,
and not just

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.660
because Wilson still refused

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.180
to endorse a constitutional
amendment

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.820
for women's suffrage,
which he did.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.900
Once reelected, Wilson
turned again to diplomacy,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.190
first asking belligerent
leaders to state their war aims,

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.180
and defending both sides.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.100
When he mentioned in his note

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.060
that from what both sides had
been saying through the war,

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.320
it seemed their war aims
were exactly the same.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:45.460
And later, in January, in his
speech that came to be known

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:51.030
as The Peace Without Victory
Speech, in that aeration,

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:55.660
he asked whether this war was
quote a struggle for a just

00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:01.270
and secure peace, or only for
a new balance of power unquote.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:05.870
And he predicted very
accurately, as it turns out,

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.240
that if one side gained
victory over the other,

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.730
that would mean quote peace
forced upon the loser,

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.790
and it would leave a sting, a
resentment, a bitter memory upon

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:22.040
which terms of peace would
rest, not permanently,

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.410
but as only as upon quicksand.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.590
Neither side was in
the mood for peace

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.730
without victory at this time.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.530
And Germany had already
decided to return,

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:39.230
and returned forcefully to
unrestricted submarine warfare.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.800
All belligerent and neutral
ships encountered in wide swabs

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.870
of the Atlantic Ocean

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:51.660
and Mediterranean Sea would
be sunk without warning.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:57.380
On January 31st, Ambassador Von
Bernstorff informed Secretary

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.110
of State Robert Lansing

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:04.630
that this unrestricted warfare
would begin the next morning.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:08.390
As insurance to protect
themselves

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.260
against the possibility

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.250
that this would bring the
United States into the war,

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:20.220
the new foreign minister of
Germany, Arthur Zimmerman,

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.770
sent a coded telegram to Mexico,

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:27.260
the soon-to-be infamous
Zimmerman telegram,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:32.580
which promised Mexico a
rewarding alliance should it

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.850
join the war against the United
States should the United States

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.150
declare war.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.200
The German announcement
did move the U.S.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.380
to sever diplomatic
relations on February 3rd.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.690
But it did not immediately
push the nation into war.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:59.410
Many Americans were still
devoted to the cause of peace,

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.790
although opinion was
definitely turning.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:07.200
America and the Great War
examines the last few weeks

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.810
of events and debates
in Congress

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:12.460
and among civilian
organizations,

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.970
some of which will divide
over the question of war.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.700
It also reports on the
celebrations in March

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.140
when Tsar Nicholas of Russia,

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.510
the only autocrat
leading an allied nation,

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:31.990
and the only non-American on
this slide, was deposed in favor

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.460
of a liberal government that
pledged to stay in the war.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.260
And the book traces
the tricky U.S. Russian

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.700
relations thereafter.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.230
Jeannette Rankin, the first
woman elected to Congress,

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:51.880
and a dedicated pacifist, is
among 56 members of Congress

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.580
who voted against a
declaration of war.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.680
She was also the only
member of Congress who voted

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:06.650
against the war declaration
in World War II.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:11.220
Some of the organizations
that were divided

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.730
over the war question
included the socialists headed

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:20.880
by Eugene Debs who remained
a staunch anti-war person,

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.710
while other socialists
decided to further their cause

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.410
by supporting the war, and
the woman's suffrage movement,

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.020
the mainstream, the
more mainstream suffrage

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.610
organizations also decided

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.350
that war support would
benefit their cause,

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.630
and they were correct
about that.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.100
But more radical
people, like Alice Paul,

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:49.550
continued to aim directly and
immediately at women's suffrage.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:53.330
Alice palm and Eugene V.
Debs were jailed during the

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:54.950
American War.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:30:00.160
W.E.B. Du Bois was a leading
African-American voice

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:07.230
for war support, believing
that war support, in this war,

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:12.450
as had not happened when
blacks fought in the Civil War

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:16.750
and in the frontier
and in the War of 1898,

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.890
but in this great war,

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.900
war support might
help support the cause

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.860
of African-American equality.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.650
There were differences
of opinion.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:36.960
The book has a quote from A.
Phillip Randolph, who said,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.990
rather than winning the
world for democracy,

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:45.420
making the world safe for
democracy, wouldn't it be better

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.300
to make Georgia safe
for the Negro?

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.960
The book contemplates the
many major questions raised

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.020
by the declaration of war.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.700
And whoops.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:06.460
Too far. Would it be necessary
to send an army overseas?

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:10.060
And that was not
apparent immediately.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.580
Many people in government
figured that naval support

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.320
and financial support
and building an army just

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.260
to defend the United
States would be enough.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.500
This turned out quickly
not to be the case.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.650
How large an army would
be needed, whether

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:30.940
or not we went overseas
or stayed home?

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.650
How would it be raised?

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.110
How would the war
effort be funded?

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.310
What roles should women play?

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.400
How would U.S. forces
coordinate with the larger

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.410
and more experienced and more
numerous allied Armed Forces?

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:50.160
It discusses the heated civilian
debate over conscription,

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.990
and the determination to build

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.680
and maintain a distinct
American army rather

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.460
than place U.S. recruits
within allied ranks.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:07.240
Now we get to questions
of civil liberties,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.980
and I will take this moment
to say that there is going

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:15.390
to be a symposium on that
question this afternoon at 2:00

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:17.690
in the Montpelier Room.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.960
The book considers the
pressing question regarding

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.610
civil liberties.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.480
How much freedom of
expression and freedom

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.290
of information can
be allowed even

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.510
in a proud democracy
during a time of crisis?

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.250
And this is a question

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:42.670
that democracies face
over and over again.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:46.650
Figures in this debate include
George Creel, named in April

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.830
to head the newly formed
committee on public information;

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.330
Postmaster General
Albert Burleson,

00:32:53.330 --> 00:33:00.480
to whom the Espionage Act passed
in June, 1917, gave wide powers

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.240
to refuse to mail
suspect material

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.260
without definite criteria for
what made materials suspect.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.600
And peace activist and Wellesley
College professor, Emily Balch,

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.160
who spoke against a broadly
worded provision of the act

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.530
that restricted freedom
of speech.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:27.230
I should add that we've put
the vigilantes' placard there.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.930
The vigilantes were not
actually vigilantes.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.200
They were an organization
of writers and artists

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.830
that devoted their
talents to war support.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:42.460
But at this time, there was
a great deal of vigilance,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:47.680
vigilante societies,
that was often supported

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.270
by the United States government.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:54.170
And the book delves into
that quite deeply as well.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.240
America and the Great
War also looks

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.460
at the mobilization
expectations and actualities.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.800
Overall, the American war effort
was an astonishing success.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:17.850
An army of 128,000 grew to one
of approximately 4 million,

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.190
2 million of whom
were sent overseas.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:27.380
But there were epic problems
for this nation inexperienced

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:31.390
in doing anything
like this so quickly.

00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:36.900
And the problems existed in
war department organization,

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.680
in manufacturing and
distribution of supplies

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:44.500
for the AEF, in transportation,
in regulating resources.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.190
There were congressional
investigations.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.880
Senator George Chamberlain,

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.090
a member of the president's
own political party,

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:57.000
became one of the severest
critics of war effort failures.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.580
We are still unprepared
without a definite war program,

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.730
and still without trained men,

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:07.090
he roared in a public
speech in December, 1917.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.390
He raised presidential hackles

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.800
by suggesting the American
war effort be directed

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.370
by a war cabinet of three
distinguished civilians

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.900
of private ability.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.200
This did not happen.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.400
And gradually, the
problems did not disappear.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.030
They were reduced
to manageable size.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:33.690
In November, 1917, the second
Russian revolution brought the

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.260
Bolsheviks to power.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.100
And the Bolsheviks declared an
armistice that allowed Germany

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:43.260
to transfer combat divisions
to the western fronts.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:49.590
More were transferred after
the Bolsheviks signed the

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.660
Brest-Litovsk Peace
Treaty in March, 1918.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.440
By the third week in March,

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.890
as U.S. forces still requiring
training or slowly arriving,

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.590
but were not present
in sufficient numbers

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:07.760
to tip the scale, German forces
outnumbered allied troops

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.330
on the western front
by about two to one.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.600
On March 21st, General
Erich Ludendorff,

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.610
not a very likeable
person, by the way,

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:21.190
launched a massive
five stage offensive.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.210
And the first big blow
sent allied troops

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.290
with some ill-prepared
Americans in training mixed in,

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.600
reeling backwards
dozens of miles.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.810
In the U.S., this frightening
news sparked measures

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.510
to get Doughboys to Europe
at a much faster pace,

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.800
many with very little training.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.970
It also sparked an
upsurge in vigilantism,

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:46.780
and questionable actions by
combinations of local officials

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.090
and so-called agents
of vigilant societies.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.450
March saw the first
so-called slacker raids,

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.450
general the attention of any man

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:59.440
who wasn't carrying his draft
registration card to be held

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.580
without recourse until
it was determined

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.440
that he wasn't a draft dodger.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.270
It's probable that the bad news

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.890
from the western front also
helped pass the Sedition Act

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.190
in May.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:16.070
Legislation so out of tune with
American traditions of freedom

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:20.970
of expression that it was
repealed shortly after the war.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:27.240
America and the Great War tells
of stateside military training,

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.940
an the further training
Doughboys needed once they got

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.340
to France.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.240
It addresses the very different
treatment accorded the nation's

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.590
white and black soldiers,

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.290
including the two black
combat divisions, the 92nd,

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.220
which served unhappily
under U.S. command,

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.180
and the under strength
93rd division, which fought

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.310
with distinction
under French command.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:55.790
It tells of significant
American battle action,

00:37:55.790 --> 00:38:00.260
including Seicheprey, Cantigny,
Belleau Wood, Chateau-Thierry,

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.890
the French-led the
Marne Offensive,

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:08.820
and the two major U.S.-led
offensives, Saint-Mihiel

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.940
in September, 1918, and the
four-stage Meuse-Argonne

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.350
Offensive, that lasted from late
September to the end of the war.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:22.150
It provides glimpses of the
experiences of individuals,

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:26.420
some of whom, like future World
War II Army Chief of Staff

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.500
and post-war Secretary,
post-World War II Secretary

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.070
of State, George
Marshall, are familiar.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.870
Others are relatively unknown.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:39.870
General Pershing called the much
decorated Sam Woodfill the most

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:43.120
outstanding U.S.
soldier of the war.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.290
John Lang, whose papers are in
the Veterans History Project,

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.800
was one of 300 men of the sixth,

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.810
U.S. sixth engineers
completely untrained in combat,

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:57.050
who were caught in the
first phase, the first wave

00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:02.160
of the March, 1918 German
Offensive, and mainly joined

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.620
with British units to
fight their way out.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.490
Born in Scotland, Lang became
an American citizen shortly

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.370
after the war.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:16.650
The book also follows 4,000
U.S. troops to Archangel

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.340
in the frozen north of Russia.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.970
And 9,000 Russian,
9,000 U.S. troops

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:26.080
to Vladivostok in Siberia.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.760
And it follows the newly formed
U.S. third army into Germany

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.680
after the November
11th armistice

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.410
to begin occupation duties.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:41.040
The book follows the continuing
and amazing war support effort

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.660
at home and events that
affected that effort,

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:49.620
including the sudden appearance
of U-boats just off the coast

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:53.060
of the east coast that briefly
placed the Navy Department

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.530
under siege from
concerned citizens.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.670
In late August, the Spanish flu
pandemic hit the United States

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:07.430
in force, taking an estimated
500,000 American lives before

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.570
it abated.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.480
The book's epilogue describes
the multiple questions

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.480
and problems resulting
from bringing

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.270
to a rapid halt a war effort
that was just beginning

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:25.170
to hit its peak in efficiency
and in emotional fervor.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.240
It goes abroad with
Woodrow Wilson,

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.440
the first sitting president
to travel to Europe,

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.710
and touches on the vast hopes
and bitter disappointments

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.400
that resulted from that journey.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.570
It describes post-war
violence in the United States,

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:43.790
as labor lost many
of its wartime gains

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.800
in the bloody strike
torn year of 1919.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.300
And African-American
hopes that their support

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:54.720
for the war would advance the
cause of equality were dashed

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.690
in a period of racial violence.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:02.540
Bolshevism replaced Prussianism
as a prime target of vigilantism

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.760
in the country, as
the country went

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.390
through its first red scare,
the second would happen

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.450
after the second world war.

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.890
On a more positive note,

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:17.290
Congress finally did
pass the 19th amendment

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:20.580
to the Constitution
after it had languished

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.500
for many months in the Senate.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:29.940
Its ratification on August 18th,
1920, meant that after decades

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:34.670
of struggle, American women
had the constitutional right

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.860
to vote.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.380
Women were among the voters who
heeded Warren Harding's call

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.500
for a return to normalcy

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.940
that gained him the
White House in 1920.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.700
By then, the United States,

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.740
facing no discernible
military threat,

00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:00.360
had reduced its army
to 137,000 men.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.020
In other vastly significant
ways, however,

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.980
there could be no turning back.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.730
The United States had emerged

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.530
from the war the
world's leading economic

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:16.230
and a premier political power,
with demonstrated potential

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:20.300
for projecting military
might abroad.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.860
It had failed to join
the League of Nations,

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.520
but it was soon working
unofficially

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:30.050
with league committees to
assure the continuing peace

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.790
and stability that was so
vital to U.S. interests.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:39.600
In 1921, the United States
organized a successful five

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.140
nation naval disarmament
conference.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:47.470
Shortly thereafter, recognizing
the country's new position

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:52.880
in the world and the truth
of Wilson's 1916 statement

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.830
that we are participants
whether we would or not

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.000
in the life of the world.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.690
A number of prominent
Americans formed the council

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.470
on foreign relations
to be better prepared,

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:10.910
as the council history notes,
for significant responsibilities

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.420
and decisionmakings
in world affairs.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.590
As venerable American
statesman Elihu Root,

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:24.360
one of the council's
founders, stated in 1922,

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.690
I suppose that the people of the
United States have learned more

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:31.230
about international relations
within the past eight years

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:35.010
than they have learned in
the preceding 80 years.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:40.630
They are, however, only at
the beginning of the task.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:42.510
Thank you.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:50.070
[ Applause ]

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:53.780
I think we may have some time
for questions if anyone has any,

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.460
preferably ones that
I can answer.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.770
Yes?

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:08.920
&gt;&gt; What surprised you most as
you were doing your research?

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.700
&gt;&gt; Oh my. So many
things surprised me.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.790
Individual people surprised me.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:16.130
I discovered many
interesting characters.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:20.020
But I think the depth of
American, of the effect

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:24.930
of the war on America right from
the very beginning surprised me.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.360
The first world war, as people

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.620
who knew me have heard me say ad
infinitum has been an interest

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.540
of mine since I was
a little girl.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.250
But it was mostly interest

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:41.860
in what I consider the
appallingly futile war effort

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.370
that killed so many
people uselessly.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:48.680
I did not really delve into the
political or social history,

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.140
and certainly not the way it
affected the United States.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.640
So this was sort of a gradual
and continuing surprise

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.360
as to how deeply it
reached into our society.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.980
Sir?

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:11.270
&gt;&gt; Could you talk about how
your view of Woodrow Wilson?

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:14.260
&gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.560
Now there's a question.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:19.220
&gt;&gt; If you can answer it.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:23.490
&gt;&gt; Well, how much
time do you have?

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:27.390
I find Woodrow Wilson to be
a very frustrating individual

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:28.900
to understand.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.380
He is a person of deep

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.970
and abiding ideals
and religious faith.

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:36.970
He is a product of
his time and place.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:40.280
He was a Virginian who
remembered the Civil War

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.020
when he was a little boy.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:48.560
He was-- his ideals and his
idealistic speech are very

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.690
moving, but then he also
could be a very small man.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:58.970
And I think in some ways,
his unwillingness to listen

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:04.250
to criticism is what helped
do American participation

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:06.240
in the League of Nations.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.410
Whether that would have
helped the league survive,

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:11.320
I don't know, but I
believe it would have.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:18.640
So I feel more closely
acquainted with Woodrow Wilson,

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.350
or slightly more closely
acquainted, but with each step

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:29.750
of closer acquaintance, I feel
more frustrated by the man.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:32.530
Sir?

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:43.490
&gt;&gt; One of the more surprising
things I learned was the amount

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:51.240
of industry in the treaty that
was going on between the U.S.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:59.140
and Baltimore, and
I was wondering

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:03.910
if you could talk
a little bit more

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:08.190
about what specific
commodities were being shipped

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:12.690
over to the belligerents,
and then the sort

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:15.510
of delicate response
of U.S. government

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.680
when the allies expressed
their frustration.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.770
&gt;&gt; Well, even during a
period of neutrality,

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:25.690
because of the blockage,

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:31.960
almost much of the American
supply line was heading directly

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.960
to allied nations.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.190
Things that were regarded as
contraband could be confiscated

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:41.590
under the rules of blockaded
by the allied navies.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.260
The British Navy basically
controlled the Atlantic.

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.520
There was an episode in
the book, the Germans,

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.670
and in real life, incidentally,

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.000
where the Germans developed
commerce submarines.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.690
They were huge submarines
that could be packed

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:55.990
with a lot of supplies.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.170
And only one of them
made it to America.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:47:59.670
Came over here twice.

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.610
It was the Deutschland.

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:05.910
And it was a very happy occasion
because it brought over,

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:09.500
from both the Germans and the
Americans, because it brought

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.460
over [inaudible] that we
had been getting exclusively

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:12.760
from Germany.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.190
And our industries
were suffering.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:20.950
And it took back feeling
under the blockade,

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:22.900
it took back contraband
materials.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.930
When some supplies did go to
Germany and Austria-Hungry,

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:32.950
I think most of those were
considered relief supplies.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:37.320
I don't know if that sort
of answers your question.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.620
Sir?

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.250
&gt;&gt; There seems to be a lot
of vague considerations

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:43.760
of why we went to war.

[ Inaudible ]

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:50.790
Some people say that the most
definite was the financial

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:55.730
complications of
the British coming

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:00.530
to natural institutions
in the United States.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.460
Do you have an opinion on that?

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a toughy.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.570
A lot of the people
who still objected

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:10.060
to the United States' entry
into the war, several of them

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:16.190
like Robert La Follette, Eugene
Debs, they objected to our entry

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:19.420
because they felt it was
for financial reasons,

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.840
to increase our prosperity.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.440
I think it was a
mixture of reasons.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.500
I think there was
an emotional factor.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.250
I think many Americans,
and Americans

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:35.290
at that time were remarkably,
many of them, idealistic.

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:39.350
Many Americans really
did see the war,

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:43.820
especially once Russia
lost the Tsar,

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.600
as a fight of good against evil.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.690
A lot of this stemmed
from allied propaganda,

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:54.150
some of it accurate and some of
it not, about German atrocities.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:58.590
But a lot of it stemmed
from German espionage

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:02.700
in the United States
and the U-boat wars.

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:08.490
I think also that Woodrow
Wilson led the country into war,

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:11.870
in part because he felt
that that was the only way

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:16.310
that America and he, as the
head of the United States,

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:19.690
could influence a
post-war peace.

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:24.330
As a matter of fact, in February
of 1917, he got a letter

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:30.130
from David Lloyd George with a
tremendously flattering letter

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:35.150
that said we're not urging
the United States to go to war

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:38.850
for your military assistance or
for your financial assistance,

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:42.130
though those things are
important, but to earn you,

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:45.740
Woodrow Wilson, a seat at
the table as the leader

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:49.460
of the disinterested country,
a country that has no interest

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.510
in securing territory,
a country not so warped

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:55.400
by these years of war.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.930
It's a letter calculated
to turn anyone's head.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:01.960
Whether it turned his head,

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.210
I think that was the
sort of thinking he had.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.670
He was very much an idealist,

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:11.520
an infuriating idealist,
but an idealist.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.410
Yes?

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:24.540
&gt;&gt; I loved all-- in the exhibit,

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:36.270
I loved all of the personal
stories from individuals.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:40.210
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:41.510
&gt;&gt; And some of them say
like veteran project.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.230
&gt;&gt; Veterans History Project.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:44.700
&gt;&gt; Now, how do you
guys get those?

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.410
Because I thought the Library
of Congress was just, you know,

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:54.610
wasn't really for private
citizens to have stuff in there.

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:56.670
&gt;&gt; Private citizens have
a lot of stuff in here.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:57.970
Yes, and if you go

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:01.200
to the Veterans History
Project website,

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.750
there's a whole instruction
to tell you how to go

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:06.270
about donating materials, and
how to interview veterans.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:13.430
But the library accepts
donations all the time.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:24.330
I am not a curator, so I cannot
speak to the rules of donations,

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:29.520
but if you turn around and talk
to the two women behind you,

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.930
they could probably
help you out.

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:34.490
I can take one more question.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.790
Yes?

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:41.360
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us a little
more about the fighting

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:45.500
in eastern Europe and
the impact of the war

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.870
on immigrant relations
in the United States?

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:50.290
&gt;&gt; That is a huge question.

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:54.090
I did concentrate on
the war in the west,

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:58.510
although I did follow our
relations with Russia,

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:01.400
from right when we
entered the war.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:06.420
The war on the east was
particularly difficult

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.720
and savage.

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.740
It was particularly hard

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.140
on the Russian nation,
which lost territory.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:18.360
The war on the east helped
tear the Austria-Hungarian

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.660
Empire apart.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.070
Many, and as to the
impact on immigrants

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:26.670
in the United States,
that varied so much.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:30.530
Some recent immigrants
returned when they could

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:33.680
to their home countries,

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.390
whichever they may
have happened to be.

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:40.470
Many immigrants, many
recent immigrants,

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:44.140
many first generation
Americans fought

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.800
on the allied side
in the American army.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.770
There were, I can't remember
the percentage right now,

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:57.380
of immigrant Americans
that comprised the AEF.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.490
Many of them could
not speak English,

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.050
and there's a little
anecdote in the book

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:04.350
about Polish-American officer
visiting a training camp,

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:05.930
and where there were
a lot of Polish,

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:08.470
recent Polish immigrants.

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:10.880
And they had not gotten any
of the training down pat,

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.830
because none of their officers,

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:15.230
none of their training
officers could speak any Polish,

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:18.780
and they didn't understand
any English.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:22.080
And episodes like that
led to the development

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.790
of training units with
bilingual officers

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:30.710
to train American soldiers, AEF
soldiers, both in the language,

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:33.220
and also in the arts of war.

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.690
That's a partial answer,
but it's a big question.

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:36.040
Okay, I think if that's-- if
there are no more questions,

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.840
thank you again very
much for coming.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.490
[ Applause ]

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:44.140
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
