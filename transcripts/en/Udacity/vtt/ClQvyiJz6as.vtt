00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.580
So how would you use generate and

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.200
test to actually solve
Raven's Progressive Matrices?

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.780
We've talked about this
a little bit already, but

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.490
take it a little bit further and talk
about how you would actually implement

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.640
the problem solving
approach you've seen today.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.510
We talked about a couple
different ways of going about it.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.480
We talked about generating
multiple answers and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.250
testing them against the answer options.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.570
Or generating one answer and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.820
testing it more intelligently against
the different options available to you.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.160
So talk about which one you would do and
how you would actually implement it.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.090
In doing so, make sure to think of
three by three problems as well.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.560
With more transformations and
more figures going on,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.570
it can be a lot more difficult
to figure out what to generate,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.700
and the problem space can
explode very quickly.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.560
Also make sure to think about how you're
actually going to infer the mapping

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.310
between different
figures in the problem.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.100
How do you know which shape in
one frame maps up to a different

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.870
shape in another frame?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.620
And then talk about how you
would use that information

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.230
to generate what you
think the answer is.
