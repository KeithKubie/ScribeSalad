[music]

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.890
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Wow, you got your oven back.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.890
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I got my oven back.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:04.890
That's good.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.890
[applause]

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.669
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Good morning.

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:10.620
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Good morning everyone.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.150
I'd like to welcome back probably one of our
most famous most popular guests, Alton Brown.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.150
[applause]

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.150
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Thanks.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.470
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I'm one of the Google chefs,
Jeff Freburg, and we're really happy to have

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.470
him back.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.470
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Thank you very much.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.119
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: You have some specials coming
up soon on the Food Network?

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.119
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.450
I've got a two-hour, we're doing a two-hour
Thanksgiving special, live, the Sunday before

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.450
Thanksgiving.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.890
Live, not live to tape, really live, so you
know if we cuss it goes out.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.890
[laughter]

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.800
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You know, so that's, that's,
that's gonna be a lot of fun.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.539
And we've got Next Iron Chef, which starts
on October 30th, which is scary good this

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:45.539
time.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.700
I've got that and I've got a new Good Eats
special, a new Thanksgiving special that'll

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.970
be out in November, a one-hour.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.420
Our final Thanksgiv, our final statement on
Thanksgiving, which is kind of cool because

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.690
there's only one recipe in the whole show
and it makes the entire Thanksgiving dinner,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.379
so it's kind of cool, all in one massive kind
of recipe.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.590
So that's kind of groovy.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.850
And then let's see, another, another Good
Eats special, the final of the Good Eats specials

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.340
because Good Eats is no more.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.340
[audience groans]

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.340
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah, I know.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.340
I made it for 13 years.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.340
Give me a break.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.540
I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do new stuff that's
better, that's better.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.590
But I had to, I had to let it go in order
to do new stuff.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.220
But we have one more uber-crazy special that
I think will probably be around Valentine's

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.220
Day on dark chocolate.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.220
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.220
Great.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.220
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I'll turn up the dark.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.220
So there's, there's plenty going on.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.220
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Alright.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.220
And then you're in Mountain View tonight.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.340
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I'm in Mountain View signing
copies of Good Eats 3: The Later Years tonight.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.310
Anybody have that in their hot little hand?

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.310
Anybody got one?

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.310
[audience cheering]

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.310
[applause]

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.829
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Those things right there, those
four pound piles of paper.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.829
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:39.829
Alright.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.590
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Which I'm, I'm pretty proud
of 'cause the entire Good Eats book set is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.750
actually a little different from most cookbooks
from shows because we take the recipes, the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.590
applications from the shows, tear them down
and completely rebuild them from scratch because

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.219
cooking from a book is very different than
cooking from a, from a show and so they're

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:58.799
completely re-mastered and re-tweaked.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.469
So you should have 100% success.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.579
If not, it's your fault.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.579
[laughter]

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.549
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: 'Cause I've, I've taken care
of stuff.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.870
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Alright.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.870
Well, Alton.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.080
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yes.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.879
Alright, so I wanted to spend some time drinking
coffee.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.200
We've got questions that have come in from
that world wide web thing.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Right.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Is that, is that still called
that?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Do you want to sit this year
or you wanna roam?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I don't, you know, I'm, I'm,
you sit.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.200
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And I'll perch.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
Alright.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I'll perch from time to time.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200
That's fine.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Is that?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200
Well before we move on are these actually?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: These are.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Questions for us?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Would you like to start with
some questions?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: No, I want to start with questions
from you guys.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.150
I mean I could, I could give a speech about
things, but it'd probably be boring.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
I'd rather hear what you guys have to say,
answer questions.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.511
Since Good Eats has kind of come to a close,
I'm happy to talk about that, but I might

00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:44.511
cry just a little bit.

00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:45.511
[laughter]

00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.920
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: This is hard.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.670
You know and I'm happy to scoop dirt on Food
Network people, only problem is I don't have

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.420
any 'cause I live in Atlanta and they all
live in New York, so I don't know a whole

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.080
lot, but I'd like to take the time that we
have and answer questions and get kind of

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.480
a general conversation about food or TV or
communications or the future of food or whatever

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.540
you want to talk about, I'm, I'm happy to
chime in.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.780
So yeah we've got microphones, let's see there's
a microphone there, there's a microphone here,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.489
I guess that's, well we could only afford
two.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.489
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: There's two.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.500
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well that's the way it goes.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.500
Two will do.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.040
Or you can just hold up your hand and scream
at me, I don't mind that either.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.040
Go ahead sir.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.010
&gt;&gt;male #1: Alton, thank you for coming to
Google again.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.520
Thank you for teaching me how to cook.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You're welcome.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.570
&gt;&gt;male #1: I've been watching you, so basically
since I was 10.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.570
[laughter]

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.710
&gt;&gt;male #1: But I'm really sad to hear Good
Eats is

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.689
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And I have to tell you, I've
gotten to a point in my career where I, where

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.379
I, I'll have like really hot college girls
come up to me to sign books and they'll say,

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.150
"Yeah, I've been watching you since I was
a little girl, this tall."

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.349
And I'm like, "Great."

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.349
[laughter]

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.770
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Takes the wind right out of
it, let me tell you.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.760
&gt;&gt;male #1: But you know being an engineer
you, the way you present food makes it great.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.910
But we're gonna talk about Iron Chef.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.720
Who was your favorite battle guest chef to
telecast to comment on?

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.720
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Wow.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.600
There have been so many, you know, before
I knew it I think we've crossed the 200 battle

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.629
line on, on Iron Chef America.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.400
I would probably have to say that one of my
very favorites was the Rathbun Brothers.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.390
It was a brother battle.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.020
And the, the Rathbuns out of Atlanta where
I live came and I think it was, it was whole

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.020
boar.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.020
It was like whole boar.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.530
The thing that made the battle so much fun
is that you know we got a good bit of space

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.670
in, in, in kitchen stadium, but these guys
are so freaking fat, they can't really move

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.260
around the kitchen, they're like bumping into
stuff, you know, and it was, it was like watching

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.890
guys in sumo suits cooking.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.700
That was kind of, they're gonna be really
pissed that I said that.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.700
[laughter]

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.820
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But there were these huge,
these immense pieces of meat.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.500
I like the battles where the ingredient's
really big, because you gotta really, a lot

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.450
of time goes into kind of tearing it down
to get it into cookable pieces.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.000
We have an upcoming battle, Battle Yak, which
is pretty exciting.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.410
I'm not gonna tell you who's in it, but that's
one heck of a battle.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.470
'Cause our, our new next iron chef is in,
is in that battle, so that, that won't be

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.200
out until next year sometime I imagine.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.410
But there's nothing like seeing a whole yak
on the altar, let me tell ya.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.410
[laughter]

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.060
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: [shouting] Yak.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.480
Another, you got another question?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.480
&gt;&gt;male #1: No, no just

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Ok.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480
&gt;&gt;male #1: thank you.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah, you're very, very welcome.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480
How about you?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.520
&gt;&gt;male #2: I wanted to say thank you to for

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.200
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You don't have your feet on
the yellow marks.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200
[laughter]

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200
&gt;&gt;male #2: Ok.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.590
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I mean if you're gonna put
a mat down with footprints, you, you need

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.590
to, you need to do it.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.590
&gt;&gt;male #2: Alright, we're on the same page
now.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.160
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Alright, we are, we're good,
I can talk to you now.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
&gt;&gt;male #2: Alright.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.930
Well again, thank you for coming here and

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:20.930
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You're welcome.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.490
&gt;&gt;male #2: I wanted to thank you for your
take on baking.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.310
Just your, your explanation of baking, the
way you break things down makes things very,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.310
very easy to understand.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.310
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Thank you.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.500
&gt;&gt;male #2: And it's a very unique take.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.730
I really like, I really appreciate it.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.700
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well you know baking is all
about balance.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.720
It's a see saw act, you know.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.340
The thing that people have to realize with,
with baking is it, is it doesn't forgive.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.110
It is engineering and, and if, if it's like
you know working on an engine.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.100
If you monkey with this over here, you gotta
do this over here.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.400
And once an equation gets out of kilter, you're,
you're done.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400
Game over.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.680
So I, I, I think that it's just there aren't
too many people that that like to talk about

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.500
it from that kind of standpoint.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.060
It's, it's really, really easy to talk about
baking from kind of historical standpoint

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.460
or traditional standpoints because we think
of baking as this kind of very kind of homey

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.000
craft, but it's rocket science.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.150
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #2: Yes it is.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.150
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: It is.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.460
It's absolute rocket science.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.880
You can draw a direct line from muffins to
Saturn V Rockets.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.880
[laughter]

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880
Well thank you very much.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880
&gt;&gt;male #2: Well my question was.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yes.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.400
&gt;&gt;male #2: So now that the greatest show in
the history of TV is coming to a close, what

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400
is coming next?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.300
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: What's coming next, there are
a few different things.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.780
One, I'm gonna be putting a lot of energy
into video enhanced e-books.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:36.280
I'm going to merge the, the, the film experience
with the print experience into an e form.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.690
And I think that there's a lot of room for
pioneering in that that'll allow for some

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:47.250
very interesting filmmaking opportunities,
as well as kind of a whole new way of communicating

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.100
what food is and how to work with a cookbook
in the kitchen.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.160
So I'm gonna be doing that.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.720
As far as Food Network goes, I'm going to
be doing a miniseries, it's kind of a historical

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.250
thing called Foods That Changed the World.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.120
We're gonna be looking at a series of ingredients
and how man's relationship with that ingredient

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.120
has helped to craft the planet that we live
in.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.340
And then also looking forward at the foods
that I think are gonna change the world as

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.340
we go into a planet with a population, you
know, of nine billion plus, which is that

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.670
we're basically all gonna eat Soylient Green
in very small cubes, you know.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.430
Some of you don't remember Soylient Green
probably.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.110
And, and at the very beginning of the year
there's another show on Food Network called

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.630
Next Food Network Star, I don't know if anybody's
seen Food Network Star before.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.130
Apparently I was in the very first episode
of that last year and the general impression

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.420
was is that I make people cry and that I'm
a meanie.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.420
[laughter]

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.280
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And so as a result I've been
asked to be on all 11 episodes next year.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.280
[laughter]

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.450
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: So I'm gonna be on all of the
Food Network Star shows next year and my only

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.880
mission is to make people cry and give up
or try, you know, drop out basically I think

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.880
is what I'm gonna do.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.620
Kind of like Louis Gossett Jr. in An Officer
and A Gentleman, you know, that's what I'm

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.770
gonna, that's what I'm gonna be there for.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.270
So I got a lot of, a lot of stuff going on.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.270
&gt;&gt;male #2: Cool.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.690
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And I, and I may, I may do
something that's not food related.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.760
Male modeling maybe.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.760
[laughter]

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.760
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Kidding.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.760
Yes sir.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.180
&gt;&gt;male #3: You're referred to differently
in Good Eats and Iron Chef America.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.210
Is it Alton or Elton?

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.210
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: It's Alton.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.210
&gt;&gt;male #3: Alright.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.640
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I just give up correcting people
after awhile, you know, and just yeah, ok,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.070
I know who you're talking about, you know.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.150
&gt;&gt;male #3: Ever since the we saw Iron Chef
America I've been wondering that, so.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.690
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah, yeah, that's the way
that my mom says it and the way my wife says

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:20.690
it.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.010
Do you want to take a minute and take a, take
a question from

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.190
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah, no, here's a great question
about fluffy rice.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.520
I can't get my rice fluffy.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.810
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Arrgghh.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.030
I, I can't get my rice to be fluffy.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.030
Arrgghh.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.030
[laughter]

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.120
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: What will it take for me to
accomplish this?

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.169
And that's from Mongomad, Mongo Mad.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.730
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah and number two like kind
of

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.700
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Wait a second, wait a second,
let's, let's, oh it's a two-part question.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.700
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Kind of.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.130
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well let's answer the first
one first.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.410
You're, you're a chef.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.830
Answer the fluffy rice question.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.830
[laughter]

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.110
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: You know I use a rice cooker.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.880
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You do use a rice cooker?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.650
Mult, that's a unitasker.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.910
Don't feel bad.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.170
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.170
Awww.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.270
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: It's cool.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:03.690
I, the, we have I would direct this person
actually to our the Good Eats Red Beans and

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:10.401
Rice episode, because we, we did a, a speed
version of cooking rice that, that is long

00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:15.180
grain rice that you sauté first in butter
until it's very, very hot and then you add

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.670
boiling water to it.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.960
Kind of stand back, dump in the water, slap
on the lid and count 15 minutes and it's done.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.440
So, I, I would say go Mongomad can go check,
check out that recipe, because I, I think

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.440
that makes a big difference.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.050
You've gotta get the heat right and you've
gotta do it fast.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.550
What can I make with sushi rice besides sushi?

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.150
I have eight pounds of the stuff

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.250
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: They have eight pounds of
it.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.250
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: hanging around,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.250
[laughter]

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.250
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: hanging around my neck like
an albatross.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.250
I like that.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.250
[laughter]

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.920
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You know an albatross is a
big bird and, and eight pounds of, of sushi

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.920
rice, you know what?

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.260
You can make, I don't know about you, have
you ever made rice pudding?

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.730
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I have and I actually used
sushi rice.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.750
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I like, I like that.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.750
Yeah.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:57.420
I think that you can make, you can actually
make rice pudding and then do it into cakes,

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.780
like rice cakes, only ones that you'd want
to eat.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.780
[laughter]

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.050
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Who actually likes rice cakes?

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.050
Be honest.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.050
No you don't.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.050
[laughter]

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.050
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: We make really good rice cakes
here.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.630
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You've been convinced to think
that you do by advertising.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.060
You don't actually like rice cakes.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.060
[laughter]

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.060
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Nobody does.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.060
So that's what I would do.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.240
I would make rice pudding out of it or a,
or a beverage.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.610
You can make a yummy beverage out of it

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.610
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.610
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: like horchata.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.610
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.610
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You can make with sushi rice.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.630
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I have a wardrobe question
that's not on the screen.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.990
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Oh this is, this is just from
you?

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.990
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Oh, who is this from?

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, I don't know who it's
from.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.990
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: This isn't Mongomad again is
it?

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: It's not.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.990
It's not.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.640
So in the past you've mentioned that your
wife chooses your wardrobe, did she choose

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.820
the bowtie or is that your choice alone?

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.060
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Actually when I said that about
my wife choosing my wardrobe, I was lying.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.060
She doesn't choose my wardrobe.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.060
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Really?

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.580
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I was just, I didn't, I just
didn't want to get into it.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.480
That was a long time ago I think I told that
lie.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Two years.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Was it two years?

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.480
That's a long

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.480
[laughter]

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: time ago.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480
No.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480
She will keep me from wearing things because
I'll put on something and she'll look at me

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480
and say, "Really?"

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480
[laughter]

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.350
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And then I go change clothes,
but that's, that's, that's all of it.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.840
So, the, I like bowties because you don't
get tangled up in them.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.310
I'm a man of action.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.310
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.310
Alright.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.310
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I'm action man.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.310
So.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.310
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: They get in your soup.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.310
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I don't want to get tangled
up in this big and I like ties, but I don't

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.180
want to get tangled up and I also find that
whenever I get a really, really nice regular

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.620
tie, like a silk tie, the first thing I do
is drop food on it and ruin it.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.983
So the worst thing I can do now is screw up
the shirt, you know, and this is, so this

00:11:20.983 --> 00:11:21.983
is up and out of the way.

00:11:21.983 --> 00:11:22.983
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Hey so

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:26.050
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And it's and I'm kind of a,
a Doctor Who fan, so, it's kind of

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.050
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Alright.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.050
[applause]

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.050
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You have, you have some Dr.
Who fans.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.550
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So you were here two years
ago and you really focused on health and you're

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.071
still looking really healthy, so

00:11:33.071 --> 00:11:34.071
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I'm still trying.

00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:35.071
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: How's that going?

00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:36.610
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: It's hard.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.140
You know losing weight's easy.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.230
Keeping weight off, hard.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.180
It's, it's like fighting zombies.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.560
You think you've killed all the zombies.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.560
[laughter]

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.560
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Um hmmm.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.560
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And then there are more zombies.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.560
I mean there are just more of them.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.560
They never freaking really go away.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.540
And so you have to constantly keep your 9mm
on you, you have to constantly keep a machete

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.610
nearby.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.460
And that's the way, that's the way it is with,
with diet because your body does not want

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.029
to maintain the weight that you've, you've
set.

00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:03.850
I mean it'll get used to it after awhile,
but any chance that your body gets to betray

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.850
you, it will.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.850
[laughter]

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.850
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: And how's your sugar?

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.800
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Does anybody else notice this
and, and anybody here, I mean you're all,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.300
this is in Northern California, people don't
have weight problems, I know, but 'cause you

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.910
all eat granola and alfalfas and crap.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.910
[laughter]

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:22.290
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I live in the South, ok, you
know we have biscuits and ham and mint juleps

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.820
for breakfast, so it's

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.820
[laughter]

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.810
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I mean until I was like 12
years old I thought bourbon was just for Captain

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.580
Crunch cereal for gosh sakes, I.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.580
[laughter]

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.580
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: It's hard.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.200
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: How's your sweet tooth going,
'cause I know that was?

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.220
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: My sweet tooth is not as nearly
as bad as

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.220
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.220
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: it used to be.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.490
The biggest thing to getting over my sweet
tooth was giving up diet soda.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.360
Diet soda I think is evil because what it
does is it tells your brain, "I need this

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.360
level of sweetness."

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.360
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Can you repeat that?

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.360
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Sorry?

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Can you repeat that about
the diet soda?

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.890
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I think diet soda is evil.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.890
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:52.890
Thank you.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:53.890
[applause]

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:54.890
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And I live in Atlanta.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.470
So I mean I've already got a hit out on me,
ok?

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.220
Because, I mean, you know in Atlanta all the
new houses have a diet Coke spigot in the

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.220
kitchen.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.220
[laughter]

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.160
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But no, I think that what it
does is it conditions your brain to believe

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.710
that you need a certain level of sweetness
all the time and when you can't get it from

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.420
you know your eighth soda of the day, you
eat more sweets.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:16.090
The truth is now if you were to put a bowl
of something that I used to be extremely susceptible

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:22.440
to, peanut M&amp;Ms, I considered any vessel of
peanut M&amp;Ms to be one serving.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440
[laughter]

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.680
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Kind of like Girl Scout cookies.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.500
Everybody knows that a box of Thin Mints only
has two servings in it because once the tube

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.500
is breeched

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.500
[laughter]

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.250
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You know, you take a hold of
the plastic and you take your fingers like

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.670
this, you just aawwww.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.670
[laughter]

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.460
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Until the plastic comes off.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.800
But now it's like I could eat you know like
a handful of peanut M&amp;Ms and be just overwhelmed

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.670
with sweetness that I couldn't, couldn't have
anymore.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.670
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Alright.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.920
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Or I could go ahead and have
another handful and just throw up.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920
[laughter]

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.750
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But that's unhealthy too, 'cause
it turns your teeth funny colors.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.550
Now this isn't really going where you thought
it was going.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:56.550
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: No that's ok.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.550
[laughter]

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.550
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Let's, let's go back down now
here to the floor for a second.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.550
How are you sir?

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.550
&gt;&gt;male #3: I'm, I'm great.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.550
Thank you for coming and

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.550
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You're very welcome.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.550
&gt;&gt;male #3: and for the record the bowtie is
pretty cool.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.550
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Thanks man.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.550
I mean it's, it's action.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.550
&gt;&gt;male #3: Yes.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.550
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I can move.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.440
&gt;&gt;male #3: As a, as a man who went to school
in the South, I have many bowties myself.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.460
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well you should rock them here
on campus.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.970
Be proud of your, of your southern heritage.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:14.970
&gt;&gt;male #3: I will have to.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.390
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Play your Lynyrd Skynyrd cd's.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.390
[laughter]

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.630
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Or your Lynyrd Skynyrd eight-tracks,
which are even cooler.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.600
&gt;&gt;male #3: Thankfully I'm not that old.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600
[laughter]

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.810
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I like him.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.070
He's ok.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.070
[laughter]

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:32.600
&gt;&gt;male #3: But it, it, it's good to hear that
you're getting more into the digital realm

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.089
and my question kind of relates to that, is
you kind of you know you started to wade into

00:14:37.089 --> 00:14:38.089
the social media sphere.

00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:39.089
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: [laughing] Yeah.

00:14:39.089 --> 00:14:41.839
&gt;&gt;male #3: I would be loath to not mention
you know that you are a Google+.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.020
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah, I am, I just don't know
how to use it.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.020
[laughter]

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.350
&gt;&gt;male #3: And, and you are in a, you've been
on Twitter as well.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.040
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah, I was on Twitter, I was
off Twitter, and I'm back on Twitter.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.210
&gt;&gt;male #3: So, so I'm curious, I kind of,
what's your perception been of, of, of your

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.870
experience engaging with the social sphere
and what can we do here at Google to make

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:00.870
it better?

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.040
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Pay off my mortgage.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040
[laughter]

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.990
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: No, kidding.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.470
What could you do to make it better?

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.010
You know I am, I am new at it.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.520
I decided to jump in because I wanted to shut
my agent up.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:18.210
My agent was nagging me and, and, and I finally
was like ok, fine, I'm gonna try this and,

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:22.230
and so I jumped in and then I jumped out because
it creeped me out because I live in a very

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:27.230
kind of insular, I don't, I'm antisocial is
what it comes down to.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:34.970
I on a day to day basis I don't really want
to interact with Susie572 from Boise, ok?

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.210
I just don't.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:43.140
I don't know how and on top of that I have
an addictive personality as I have my seventh

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.920
cup of coff, hey, could somebody get me some
more coffee?

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.220
Is there coffee over there?

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.220
[laughter]

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.820
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Can you get me some more coffee?

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.380
I'm starting to get the shakes.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.380
[laughter]

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.080
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: So you know it's like to me
Twitter is, is, is, is Tetris for the 21st

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.529
century, you know.

00:15:58.529 --> 00:16:00.790
It's very habit forming.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:06.390
But I, and I don't ever want to be influenced,
my, my own work, it's funny, when I started

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.790
making Good Eats and even before that one
of the things that I hated about directing

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:15.160
TV commercials is that I didn't like clients
very much and I wanted to be left alone.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.610
So I kind of have a, an.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.610
Thank you very much.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.610
I kind of have.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.100
No, what no cream, no Splenda, no, ok.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.100
[laughter]

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.150
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I, like Good Eats, I never
paid attention to fans.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.550
I want fans to like the shows.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.550
I really do.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.500
But I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna make it for
them.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.020
I always made it for me.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.290
I thought the best thing that I could do is
be true to what my vision is of what I want

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.270
to do with my craft and that I would do my
best to make the best shows I could, but I

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.120
wasn't gonna be influence by the outside world.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.899
I'm not gonna worry about, well oh the fans
want me to do this or the fans want me to

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:45.899
do that.

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:48.779
'Cause when you do that you don't actually
develop a fan base at all.

00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:51.700
Fans like to follow someone with a clear vision
of what it is they're doing.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.250
I, I truly believe that.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.850
And when you look at great media works through
the ages, they were always accomplished by

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.240
visionaries, not people with focus groups
and not people that were looking at search

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.000
engine optimizers, ok?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.579
It was somebody who decided I'm gonna do this
and they did it.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:09.400
And if people follow them, fanstinkintastic,
you get to do more of that.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.579
That's your reward is you get to keep working.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.630
And if you get some cash and prizes along
the way, ok.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:20.100
So the danger with social media is that once
you start engaging in that, you're from the

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.750
South, you must remember the, the story of
the Tar Baby.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.750
Remember your Brer Rabbit?

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.959
&gt;&gt;male #3: Actually I'm from California.

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:26.949
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Do you remember your Uncle
Remus stories?

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:31.559
Yeah, they're not really politically correct
anymore but the truth is, is, is social media

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:34.850
is the Tar Baby, once you stick your finger
in it, once you poke it you're pretty much

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.180
caught up in it.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:41.470
And it's very easy to then start letting that
influx of information, that influx of opinion,

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.760
that influx of emotion from all around kind
of infect what it is you're doing.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.380
And so that's why a lot of celebrities have
other people do it for them and they never

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.330
touch it at all.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:56.929
Or you've got people that do it a lot, but
don't do it in a way where they really let

00:17:56.929 --> 00:17:58.770
people, they put a lot out, but don't let
a lot in.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.830
I mean you have people that go insane, [laughing]
you know.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.940
And I've spent some time looking at what other
celebrities do, real cele, like big-time celebrities,

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.880
not just cablelebrities like me, but what
big celebrities do on, on places like Facebook

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.520
is they basically just put, they share out.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.801
And, and I think that's, I mean that's fine,
but I tend to want to also see what's, what's

00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:21.801
coming in.

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:23.020
But only to some degree.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.929
One of the nice things about Twitter is it's
limited, you know.

00:18:25.929 --> 00:18:29.220
You can only give me this little burst in
a link and if I want to go to the link, I

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.970
can, you know, so it's very, it's like skipping
a rock across a pond.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.220
I, I'm, and that's where I am right now.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:42.210
Whether how that's gonna change my work is
actually I, I, I realize that social media

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:46.270
is actually going to allow me to work better
because what it's going to allow me is to

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:51.920
focus my future work, more and more on the
stuff that I wanna do that I feel confident

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.280
my real fan base will also enjoy and will
allow me connectivity to them to allow them

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.970
to know what it is I'm doing.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:02.490
So in other words I'm gonna be able to preach
louder to a smaller choir if that makes any

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.490
sense.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.870
And that's one of the things that when you,
when you do TV projects, if you're just on

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:10.120
a network then you're, you're, it's a shotgun
and it's, and it's always going out there

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.450
and you always have to assume that somebody's
watching it.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.990
But a lot of the work that I want to do as
I move into another phase in my life is I

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.331
wanna start to focus more and more on what
I really want to do.

00:19:19.331 --> 00:19:23.470
And to do that I need to have better contact
directly with my fan base.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.080
And that's what I can get from social media.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.740
By the way, for free.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:35.650
You gotta realize that somebody like me will
very often pay a PR firm $10,000 a month to

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.600
manage, you know, media relationships, to
make sure that, you know, when you're in New

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.120
York you're gonna be on Jimmy Fallon and make
sure you get that article in Rolling Stone

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.120
magazine.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.120
Well guess what?

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.830
I don't like paying that money out to be really
honest with you.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.670
Why should I do that if I can have a good
life on social media and do the same thing

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.790
for free?

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.820
Did I come even close to answering your question?

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.820
&gt;&gt;male #3: Yeah, no that's

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.370
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Now to say what you can do
to make my life easier is, is, is don't always

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:05.630
assume as you design social media projects,
don't always assume that all of us want to

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.230
jump into deep water.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.660
You gotta think like, like a beach.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.380
I may just wanna walk here where the water
just laps up here a little bit.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.250
Or I might wanna get out in the waves, go
like this a little bit, but I may not want

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.310
to go out where the sharks are.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.770
I may not want to go out where the deep water
is, so make, make it easier for me to not,

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:27.000
you know, I don't, I'm not always gonna be
drawn into the deeper water of, of circles.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.190
Circles scare the crap out of, I'm not gonna
go into a circle.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.190
[laughter]

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: To me that sounds like a social
STD.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.480
I mean I'm like

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480
[laughter]

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: a circle?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.100
What the, what the hell do I need a circle
for?

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.170
I mean that just scares me.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.880
I don't wanna be in a circle.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.830
You know streams, that sounds safe, 'cause
streams wash things away, you know?

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.950
A stream, I like stream, you know?

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.660
Does that make any sense?

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.340
You know the last thing that I want to do
is, is live my life on a computer.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.220
I think that computers and the internet can
enhance life, they can enhance a lot of experience,

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.420
but they do not actually replace life.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.450
And unfortunately I've seen some people [whop-woo]
go bonkers.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:03.450
Literally.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.300
I've, I've known some people that have lost
their lives because they quit living their

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.280
life and they just lived on like Facebook,
which is old school anyway.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.480
&gt;&gt;male #3: Yeah, I think we can agree on that.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.480
Thank you.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.480
[laughter]

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Sure.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.530
Shall we take another one from, from, that
was sort of a dissertation.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.530
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Please.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.530
That's ok.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.530
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Although badly put.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.700
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Any chance you might be taking
to the asphalt again?

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.520
There's a lot of pavement you haven't ridden
yet.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.810
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Boy, tell me about it.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.050
I would like nothing more than to do more
Feasting on Asphalt shows and, and I might

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.580
be able to convince Food Network of that,
but they think they've pretty much got that

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.020
category all wrapped up with Guy Fieri and
Divers, Diners, Drive-ins, Dives, whatever

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.340
the heck it is.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.340
Yeah.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.340
What can I say?

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.150
Your, your e-mails could, could certainly
help.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.940
If you don't like that idea just e-mail Food
Network and I'll, I'll take to the road again.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.050
I'd always wanted to do more Feasting on Asphalt.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.730
I wanted to do a west coast all the way from
Baja to Alaska.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.540
I'd always wanted to do that and then I also
wanted to do Feasting on Rails because I'm

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.910
a huge train fan, but you have to go to Europe
and Asia if you really want to do that right,

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:06.990
so it gets expensive and then I want to do
Feasting on Air because I'm a pilot and I

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.990
want to be paid to fly.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I love the west coast thing.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.990
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Sorry?

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Another.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.990
I love the west coast thing.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.330
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah, the west coast, I would
love to do that because that's such a diverse

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.680
not only geography, but people groups.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:22.179
Food to me is mostly interesting when you
examine it within a micro-culture.

00:22:22.179 --> 00:22:25.770
You know it's like the best time that I had
on the original Feasting on Asphalt series,

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:31.720
season 1, you know before I broke my collarbone
and spent my time all drugged up, was cooking

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:37.820
and eating out on the reservations, native
American reservations in Arizona because you're

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.020
moving in a whole new people group that's
in your country that has whole different food

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.010
traditions and, and learning how to appreciate
those and see them through their eyes, that's

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.060
what that series is really about.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.060
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Great.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.880
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Not just getting really big
hamburgers.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.600
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.600
Let's see, here's another one.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Not that that's a bad thing
I guess.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480
Go ahead.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:02.320
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: When will you delve into science
of food in Good Eats, do you do your own research

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.720
or do you have a whole team of

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.320
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Physicists, nutritionists

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.320
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I know.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.320
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: etc.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.429
No we do, we do all of our research in house.

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:10.429
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:23:10.429 --> 00:23:11.429
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And I do a lot of research.

00:23:11.429 --> 00:23:17.420
Matter of fact I would say that 90% of the
story lines on Good Eats came out of research.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:22.380
What we would do is once we decided on a season
list of shows we would generate research books

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.710
that usually average probably like 500 pages
of research and this would be research from

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.600
periodicals, from books.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.020
We're very careful about internet sources,
we, we, we will use an internet source to

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.790
develop a lead and then we'll follow it to
a primary source typically speaking.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:40.270
And then out of sifting through all of the
research, that's where story lines kind of

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:45.060
percolate up and out of, so I would say that
research is the, the number one skill that

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.490
you have to be able to have to, to kind of
develop those, those story lines.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.530
So we do our own research.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:54.530
When we can't get an answer to something,
we have people that we can get to answer things.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.530
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: You don't Google it?

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.520
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Uhh, yeah, yeah, we, we.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.520
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.520
Alright.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.520
Good answer.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.520
[laughter]

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.510
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Although what I'd really love
to see from Google is like a really high-power,

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:09.030
professional level academic search engine,
something that's like a pay service that would

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:12.350
allow me the really good stuff.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.123
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: There's people that develop
that right here.

00:24:14.123 --> 00:24:15.123
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Faster.

00:24:15.123 --> 00:24:16.123
I, I would do that.

00:24:16.123 --> 00:24:23.450
I would pay, I would pay $10,000 a year to
have a high speed no junk search engine to

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.700
high-end academic concierge level research,
quality research.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.410
'Cause it's just too easy, you spend too much
time stumbling through crap and let's face

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:39.650
it nothing multiplies and profligates on,
on the internet faster than bad information

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:44.320
and you know and, and, and it would just be
really great to kind of weed through that

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.320
kind of stuff.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.320
Somebody ought to get on that.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.380
To be a fantastic, to be a fan.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.470
Now that you own the internet, you might think
about selling it at better levels, you know,

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.559
kind of like the, you know, the crème de
la crème of, of internet searching.

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:59.000
I, I would definitely, it would be invaluable.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Work on that would you?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Here's our team.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: 'Cause I could use that.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Alright.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.270
How about, which other fud, food, sorry, Food
Network host would you choose as your second

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:13.590
if Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain challenge
you to a two on two cage match?

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.590
[laughter]

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:20.490
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Let, let's be sure that we
can define the nature of the cage match.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.490
I haven't ever

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.490
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I'm assuming that's cooking
related.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.500
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I haven't seen, I haven't seen
Anthony Bourdain do anything but actually

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.630
just talk.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.440
[groaning &amp; laughter]

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.010
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Actually I like Anthony Bourdain
a great deal.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.500
I think he's a fantastic writer, I just haven't
actually ever seen him cook anything.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.120
Who would I, who would I want to take with
me?

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.870
If I was like going in the kitchen stadium

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.720
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.350
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Wow. [pause] I'd take Bobby
Flay.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.350
&gt;&gt;someone in audience: Yes.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.350
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.211
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I would take Bobby Flay because
I know, I don't think he likes Anthony Bourdain

00:25:57.211 --> 00:25:58.211
very much.

00:25:58.211 --> 00:25:59.211
[laughter]

00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:00.211
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:26:00.211 --> 00:26:03.211
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And I, and I'm not really sure
Anthony Bourdain likes him very much, so that

00:26:03.211 --> 00:26:05.200
could be like super cool.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200
That would be a lot of fun.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.660
I've never met Gordon Ramsay so I don't, I
don't know how that would be.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.910
But I like Anthony a lot.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.020
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I think that would be pretty
fun.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.570
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: He's a great writer, so I think
that that's, that's what I would do.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.290
It would either be him or I would, or I would
take Morimoto.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.290
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.650
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Just for the knife skills alone.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:20.650
[laughter]

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:21.650
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.000
There's a question about a knife on here.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.360
How long should a good knife last, assuming
of course that you're not using it to cut

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.250
shoes in half or open tin cans?

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.250
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You know what?

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.940
A really, really good knife should last lifetimes.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:33.940
Lifetimes.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:40.919
I, I have a, a carbon steel Sabatier, it's
a French knife made with, with a dark carbon

00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:48.900
steel that I know is 100 years old and it's
still, it's still kicking just fine.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.670
It's, it's, it should be something that you
should pass down to grandchildren.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.810
There's absolutely no reason not to do that.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.440
And all you have to do is take care of them
right.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.190
The number one thing that destroys good knives
by the way is bad washing.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:04.510
It's not bad sharpening or anything like that,
it's, it's harsh chemicals on handles that

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.809
make the rivets, the handle material rot out
around the rivets.

00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:11.840
It's people, I still see people buy $200 chef's
knives and put them in the washing machine.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.840
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.840
I was gonna say, don't put 'em in the wash.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.080
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: In the washing machine not
only do the chemicals, the enzymes that are

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.200
in the dishwashing powder that breaks down
stuff on dishes, but it's also the drying

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.200
cycles.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.200
It's a harsh environment.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.200
And yet I see that.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.190
Or is see people buy really good knives and
just throw them in drawers with a lot of other

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:30.230
junk which absolutely is one of the most dangerous
things in the world.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.340
Horrible thing to see.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.630
But a good knife, if you spend money on a
good knife, it will last generations without

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:35.630
question.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.970
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Speaking of danger, I think
there's an explosion question.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.429
Did you ever want more explosions on your
show?

00:27:40.429 --> 00:27:41.429
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well, who doesn't?

00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:42.429
[laughter]

00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:44.289
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I mean understand something.

00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:46.350
I have, I'm, I have, I'm a dad.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.250
I have an 11-year old daughter named Zoey,
she's been on the show a lot.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:51.679
I'm crazy about my kid.

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:53.590
But she does not think I'm cool.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:57.740
And the reason she doesn't think I'm cool
is because I have never been on Mythbusters.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.740
[laughter]

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:05.470
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Now I can't go on Mythbusters
because of exclusivity contracts and things

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.429
like that, but basically every time we're
watching Mythbusters and something blows up,

00:28:09.429 --> 00:28:12.070
she'll turn to me and say, "What'd you do
at work today?"

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.070
[laughter]

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:17.309
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: So one day I finally like alright,
I've had enough of this.

00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:19.539
We're gonna go blow up some stuff.

00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:21.070
And so I taught her some things.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.830
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.830
[laughter]

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.559
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I taught her how to make napalm

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:27.559
[laughter]

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:29.190
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: out of orange juice concentrate.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.980
And I taught her how to make nitroglycerin.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.610
And I taught her some other things.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:34.610
[laughter]

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:35.610
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: You know 'cause

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.070
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And we, we blew, we blew up
some stuff so loud that neighbors came to

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.370
ask if a transformer had blown somewhere in
the neighborhood.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.200
I mean it was we were making some really obscene.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.360
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Oh, that's fun.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.679
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And then we muffled the really
big explosions we muffled by dropping them

00:28:46.679 --> 00:28:47.679
in the pool.

00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:48.679
[laughter]

00:28:48.679 --> 00:28:49.679
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: First.

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:53.540
But that also had some backlash, unfortunate
backlash.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.540
[laughter]

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.530
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But I can't do that on TV.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.470
I can't show people how to do that or there
would be like kids coming to my signings with

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.960
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Would you have to put a disclaimer,
don't do this at home.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.510
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Hold me, you know, I, I, I
can't.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.789
I'm not gonna do that.

00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:04.789
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Alright.

00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:05.940
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But I know how to make food
blow up.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.940
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:07.940
I, I believe you.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.020
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Ok.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.299
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Anybody else, na, you can make
napalm.

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:12.299
Never mind.

00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:14.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: What's your one favorite kitchen
gadget?

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.610
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: My favorite kitchen ga, define
gadget.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.789
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Well, that's what's on the
screen.

00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:21.789
What's your favorite kitchen tool?

00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:23.860
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well a tool and a gadget are
very different.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.820
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Alright, what's your favorite
tool and what's your favorite gadget?

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:32.460
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Gadgets are, are, are flirting
with, are usually unitaskers.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.570
Which I don't suffer by and large except for

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.820
&gt;&gt;audience: Fire extinguisher.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.910
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Fire extinguisher, exactly.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:43.090
Which I have now turned into a freezer if
you saw our live show so there are no more

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.090
unitaskers.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:45.090
But my favorite.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.340
I do have tools that I like a lot, things
that I wouldn't be able to live without or

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.780
would not like to live without.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.600
An electric kettle.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.210
I do a lot of stuff in electric kettle.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.210
I'm a big egg fan.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:59.039
I love hard cooked eggs and so I load up my
electric kettle with them and then fill it

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.080
with water and turn it on.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.080
It cuts itself off.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.240
I leave 'em in for eight minutes and I get
perfect hard cooked eggs.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.410
So I like that a lot and I use a panini press
a lot.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.410
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.540
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I'm a big fan of panini presses.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.830
I use them to cook entire meals.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.419
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Do you have your favorite
hand tool?

00:30:11.419 --> 00:30:15.320
Everyone always asks me what my favorite kitchen
tool is.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.320
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: A favorite hand tool?

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.320
Nine inch spring loaded tongs.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.320
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.320
Great answer.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.830
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: They, I have some that are
longer, but holding something longer than

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.850
nine inches is just, I don't know, I can't
seem to get used to it, so.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:26.850
[laughter]

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.460
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok, I'll, let's take another
question here.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.919
What is your favorite cookbook to use other
than ones you've written yourself.

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:38.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: What, what are, what are cookbooks
that I like to cook out of other than mine?

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Exactly.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.220
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: My very, very first cookbook,
which I purchased, well that I bought for

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:49.350
myself, I'd inherited a bunch, but the first
cookbook I bought was in 1986 and it was the

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:55.690
original Frugal Gourmet cookbook, Jeff Smith's
Google for, Frugal Gourmet.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.820
I almost said google gourmet, which would
be a different thing altogether.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.390
And I still cook out of that book all the
time.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.100
And I still cook out of the 1962 edition of
the Joy of Cooking.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.590
Because that was the last edition where they
actually had sketches of how to skin a squirrel.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.590
[laughter]

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:14.660
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And once you lose that skill,
it's really hard to get it back.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:19.650
And the believe it or not the most important
thing to have for skinning a squirrel is good,

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.580
good boots.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.280
Because you have to hold, once you get the
skin going, you've gotta hold it and I've

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.299
actually skinned a squirrel with these very
boots.

00:31:28.299 --> 00:31:31.490
Is it's a, it's a pulling thing and once you
get the, the tail meat down you get a hold

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.570
of the skin and you pull it off, so you're
left with skin.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:38.750
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I was gonna ask what your
favorite go to meal is after this.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.150
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: My, my favorite go to meal?

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:41.150
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.430
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I've got a lot of favorite
go to meals.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.430
You know what?

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:52.240
When in, when in doubt [pause] I, I, I have
this one, one dish that I, I really adore

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.850
that I cook a lot when like my family is not
there and it's, I do this on a panini press

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.170
and it's really cool.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.790
I get my panini press hot, I take three, and
by the way I don't have an endorsement from

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:02.790
a panini press.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.250
I put three big rashers of bacon in it and
I close the lid and I wait about two minutes

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.000
and let the bacon cook till it's crisp.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Take it out.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.250
During the time that that's out, I cut up
an onion and I cut up some mushrooms.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:17.530
So what I do is I take the bacon out and while
the bacon fat is in there, I throw the sliced

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.130
mushrooms in, close the lid, cook another
two minutes till they're crispy, take those

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:26.179
out, throw in some sliced onion, still enough
fat to cook, a couple of minutes, take that

00:32:26.179 --> 00:32:29.130
out, in the meantime I cut up the bacon and
then the last thing I do is I throw in two

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.890
big handfuls of spinach.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:31.970
Baby spinach.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:36.650
Close the lid, count to 12, take it out, put
that all in a bowl, put some hot sauce on

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.650
it and eat it.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:38.790
I love that.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.480
So it's a hot spinach, mushroom, bacon salad.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.260
That's kind of my, I love that meal.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.260
And canned sardines.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.370
I got a thing for sardines.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:47.610
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.760
So what was the last meal that you cooked
at home?

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.169
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: The last meal that I cooked
at home before I went on, on this book tour

00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:56.390
was I made breakfast for my daughter.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.570
If I am in town, I cook my daughter breakfast
everyday.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:04.860
For two reasons: One, no one will feed you
as well as somebody who loves you.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.860
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: That's true.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:06.860
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I believe that.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:12.200
I believe there's a tangible transferable
value of, of, love in cooking for people,

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.470
so I want to cook for her everyday, number
one I know I can put good nutrition on the

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.919
plate and I want her to see that her dad is
there cooking for her and doing that for her,

00:33:20.919 --> 00:33:23.030
so that was my, my last meal, 'cause after
that I

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:24.030
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Do you cook with your daughter
often?

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.260
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Do I cook for her often?

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.260
Everyday.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.260
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: With her.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.260
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: With her.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.260
Yeah, but she's lazy.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.260
[laughter]

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.429
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: She's only interested, my daughter
is only interested in something that results

00:33:32.429 --> 00:33:34.890
in a lickable batter or dough.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:35.890
[laughter]

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:39.059
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: So she'll, she's you know like
my, my, my dogs.

00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:42.680
I have a couple of Corgis and they love ice,
so anytime I open the freezer door, they come

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.490
running because they think they're gonna get
ice.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.890
Anytime my daughter sees the mixer come out,
she comes.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:47.890
[laughter]

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:48.890
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Oh, that's funny.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.160
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Because she assumes there's
going to be some kind of, somebody's gonna

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.580
get to lick something off of something.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.580
[laughter]

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.740
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Which I don't know what that
says about her, but, that's, but when, when

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:00.360
it comes to actually doing work, she'll always,
ahh, Dad, you know, I got, I got this thing

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.429
I gotta do over here, you know.

00:34:03.429 --> 00:34:05.720
Unless it's blowing something up, then I got
her.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.299
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: You see, I think that's fun.

00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:08.909
Shall we take an audience question?

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:09.909
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:10.909
How about that?

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:11.909
You sir, speak.

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:12.909
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hey there.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:16.309
So I work in search and I was gonna ask you
for some feedback on searches specifically

00:34:16.309 --> 00:34:21.059
for maybe recipes or for restaurants and now
that you said what you said about, about filtering

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:25.909
out you know the high-quality content, I wonder
if maybe you could expand on that perhaps

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:27.999
and, and give any pet peeves or

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:31.809
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well, first off, I, I would
never, I don't search for restaurants on online.

00:34:31.809 --> 00:34:32.809
&gt;&gt;male #4: Ok.

00:34:32.809 --> 00:34:36.849
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I have never looked for a restaurant
on using a computer, so unless it's a map

00:34:36.849 --> 00:34:37.849
function.

00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:41.049
I'm standing here in Missoula, Montana, where's
the closest food?

00:34:41.049 --> 00:34:42.049
I will do that.

00:34:42.049 --> 00:34:47.089
I will use the map function on my iPhone for
that but like evaluating and looking them

00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:48.609
up, I typically don't do that.

00:34:48.609 --> 00:34:54.569
And I would never, there is no way to find
good recipes on the internet, I don't think.

00:34:54.569 --> 00:34:59.869
Not, not through a general recipe search,
because 99.97% of them are crap.

00:34:59.869 --> 00:35:02.910
And you can't, you can't find good ones unless
you go to a pay service.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:08.849
Like if you have a subscription to you know,
Cook's Illustrated, or some other you know

00:35:08.849 --> 00:35:13.289
site like that that you can access their recipes,
that can be quality, but just searching?

00:35:13.289 --> 00:35:14.289
Nah.

00:35:14.289 --> 00:35:17.079
&gt;&gt;male #4: So, so the ways in which that paid
service can provide you with those quality

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:22.259
recipes that you can't find on the open internet,
which ways could we perhaps improve Google

00:35:22.259 --> 00:35:26.650
search to provide better access to higher
quality content?

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:31.059
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well, you could, you could
have curators, for instance.

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:37.880
You could have like here are Alton Brown,
here are Anthony Bourdain's 125 favorite internet

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.880
recipes.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.920
Or you know you could find a way to curate
collections, you know, allowing you to package

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.630
what you don't actually own, which of course
is the way of the future.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:48.630
[laughter]

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:51.140
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But the problem with, with
a recipe is you gotta have a quantifier.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:57.019
And a quantifier usually comes in, in the
form of the dreaded forum, which I think is

00:35:57.019 --> 00:36:01.220
the whole idea of user feedback in forum style
is pretty much, if there is anything that

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.369
will ultimately destroy the usefulness of
the internet, it's that.

00:36:04.369 --> 00:36:08.430
Because the only people that typically go
on forums are, are people that are the last

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.660
people that you want to listen to.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:16.569
You know unfortunately we've given everybody
a voice and most of them are bad.

00:36:16.569 --> 00:36:20.509
So I don't really know how you do that because
I, I don't know how you provide.

00:36:20.509 --> 00:36:24.630
There, there might be a way that you could
set up search strings in such a way that you

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:32.569
could weed out a lot of things or you could
simply start getting people to go through

00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:36.119
a huge amount of print matter and, and, and
use that.

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:39.789
You know like anything that's in public domain,
you guys have snarfed up all that stuff anyway,

00:36:39.789 --> 00:36:40.789
right?

00:36:40.789 --> 00:36:44.599
But like Mrs. Beeton's cookbooks from the
1900s, you know, maybe being able to search

00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:47.170
through that, that kind of print matter.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.190
Stuff that's actually been tested.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:52.269
But I, that's, that's a good, that's a conversation
probably for well it's a longer conversation

00:36:52.269 --> 00:36:54.109
figuring out how to actually do that.

00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:58.000
I, I have a lot of people come to me and say
how the heck do I search for recipes on the

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
internet?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.530
And my, my answer is basically you, you, you
don't unless you're looking for something

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.430
very, very specific with a name attached to
it.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:11.029
Like for instance, I find that it is much
easier to find one of my own recipes by just

00:37:11.029 --> 00:37:14.779
Googling it rather than going to FoodNetwork.com
and looking for it.

00:37:14.779 --> 00:37:18.359
Because I can't find it on FoodNetwork.com
unless I go through Google.

00:37:18.359 --> 00:37:24.660
So if I, if I go to Google and I type in Good
Eats meatloaf, ok, that'll actually take me

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.960
someplace that I wanna go and it'll, and it,
but the nice thing would be is like if, if

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.009
you went to, ok say that it is my meatloaf
recipe and you had to search this ok, Alton

00:37:34.009 --> 00:37:37.290
Brown meatloaf or Good Eats meatloaf, goes
to there, being able to have some kind of

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.849
service that would then offer, hey if you
like this one, try these, in which case you

00:37:41.849 --> 00:37:44.230
would have to have some kind of reference
that would, some kind of system that would

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:51.759
cross reference ingredient lists or time that
it takes or reviews and then offer up another

00:37:51.759 --> 00:37:55.089
ten elsewhere on the internet based on if
you like this one.

00:37:55.089 --> 00:37:59.880
I think that could work, but then you, you've
that's some pretty sophisticated integration.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.030
Not that that's over you, your head at all,
I mean

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.030
[laughter]

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.030
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You can manage that.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:07.260
&gt;&gt;male #4: So if you don't use the internet
for restaurant searches, what is your process

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.260
for finding new restaurants?

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:13.940
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: My, my process for restaurant
searches is on the internet is strictly geographical.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.279
Is if I'm traveling and I'm like, "Dear God,
if I don't eat soon I am going to die."

00:38:18.279 --> 00:38:19.990
Where am I?

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.990
What's near me?

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:22.059
And, and that's what it is.

00:38:22.059 --> 00:38:26.630
And then what I'll do is I'll, I'll look,
I'll, I'll pull up you know on my iPhone I'll,

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:31.030
I'll pull up that restaurant, I'll look at
it's website and see what the menu is and

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.349
if they're open or not and go.

00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:38.739
But I'm not evaluating them or searching them
out in any other form rather other than geographical.

00:38:38.739 --> 00:38:42.920
Now if I could look them up by ingredient,
you know if I could say, "I'm, I'm standing

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:49.750
in the middle of Manhattan and I wanna know
who's serving rabbit in five blocks in every

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.450
direction, that would be interesting.

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:55.390
Because that would mean somebody's gotta look
through the online menus and, and somehow

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:56.660
work that sourcing out.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:01.079
That would be very interesting because there's
a lot of, there are ways to miss a lot of

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:04.979
good food because you don't know that, ok,
well this French rest, ok this Vietnamese

00:39:04.979 --> 00:39:09.170
restaurant over here is serving rabbit in
this form and this French restaurant's over

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.859
here are serving in this form because what
I really got a taste for today is rabbit for

00:39:11.859 --> 00:39:12.859
some reason.

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:13.859
That would be cool.

00:39:13.859 --> 00:39:15.769
I don't think we have that now.

00:39:15.769 --> 00:39:16.769
Do we?

00:39:16.769 --> 00:39:17.769
&gt;&gt;male #4: Well that's just great feedback,
thank you.

00:39:17.769 --> 00:39:18.769
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Sure.

00:39:18.769 --> 00:39:19.769
You sir?

00:39:19.769 --> 00:39:22.009
&gt;&gt;male #5: First I just wanted to thank you
for your deep fried turkey recipe.

00:39:22.009 --> 00:39:23.960
I follow it every single year and

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.960
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You build, you build the derrick.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.290
&gt;&gt;male #5: I build the derrick with the flashing
lights.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.369
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You use the flashing lights?

00:39:27.369 --> 00:39:28.369
&gt;&gt;male #5: The most important thing.

00:39:28.369 --> 00:39:32.969
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well not only does it say danger,
it says fried turkey will soon be served here,

00:39:32.969 --> 00:39:33.969
which I,

00:39:33.969 --> 00:39:34.969
[laughter]

00:39:34.969 --> 00:39:38.069
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I think is a nice kind of community
gesture 'cause people you know want that.

00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:39.099
&gt;&gt;male #5: Oh yeah, definitely.

00:39:39.099 --> 00:39:41.349
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And who doesn't want to build
a derrick?

00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:42.349
[laughter]

00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:44.519
&gt;&gt;male #5: The pulleys kind of threw me off,
but anyway.

00:39:44.519 --> 00:39:45.519
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Really?

00:39:45.519 --> 00:39:46.519
&gt;&gt;male #5: My question's about

00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:47.700
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: That's a pretty simple device.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.700
[laughter]

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.380
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Pulley, been around for a few
years.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.480
Hardware store, good, good place.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.969
&gt;&gt;male #5: So my question's about actually
brewing beer?

00:39:54.969 --> 00:39:55.969
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Ok.

00:39:55.969 --> 00:39:56.969
&gt;&gt;male #5: I'm gonna start brewing

00:39:56.969 --> 00:39:58.029
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Are you old enough to have
this conversation with me?

00:39:58.029 --> 00:39:59.029
&gt;&gt;male #5: Yes I am.

00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:00.029
[laughter]

00:40:00.029 --> 00:40:01.029
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Ok.

00:40:01.029 --> 00:40:02.029
Just checking.

00:40:02.029 --> 00:40:04.759
I don't know what the ages is for oh wow in
California, so what is it drinking age is

00:40:04.759 --> 00:40:05.759
21 here?

00:40:05.759 --> 00:40:06.759
Is that right?

00:40:06.759 --> 00:40:07.759
Ok.

00:40:07.759 --> 00:40:10.839
&gt;&gt;male #5: And then namely what in, in preparation
like are there any home recipes like using

00:40:10.839 --> 00:40:15.619
apple cider vinegar to rinse out like all
the stuff to make it in first or would you

00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:16.619
go with a solution?

00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:21.470
And if you used the solution, would you rinse
it after, 'cause a lot of them say, no rinse?

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:25.991
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: There are a lot of ways you
can go with your, your sanitation.

00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:30.959
Sanitation is paramount with any form of brewing,
especially beer.

00:40:30.959 --> 00:40:36.359
And there are a lot of commercial solutions
that work at very, very low concentrations.

00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:38.809
I gotta confess, I use a bleach solution.

00:40:38.809 --> 00:40:44.289
It's what I know, it dissipates very, very
quickly and I've never gotten sick from it,

00:40:44.289 --> 00:40:46.440
other than from drinking too much beer and
throwing up.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.440
[laughter]

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.440
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But I've never had a sanitation
problem, so I use a bleach solution, but there

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:56.140
are other people that swear by, excuse me,
non non-chloride kind of, kind of solutions

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.140
as well.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:02.269
But I would not use a vinegar, I would not
use anything that wasn't designed as a disinfectant.

00:41:02.269 --> 00:41:03.660
&gt;&gt;male #5: And you'd always rinse?

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.130
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And I don't, actually I don't.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.069
I'm using it at such low concentrations that
I typically don't rinse.

00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:09.069
&gt;&gt;male #5: Ok.

00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:10.069
Great.

00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:11.069
Thanks.

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:12.069
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: This is a strange conversation.

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:13.069
[laughter]

00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:14.069
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yes, ma'am.

00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:16.359
&gt;&gt;female #1: I know you touched upon this
earlier, but is there a new TV show or an

00:41:16.359 --> 00:41:21.239
episode of an existing show that you would
love to see that would probably never be created?

00:41:21.239 --> 00:41:24.959
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well there are a lot of Good
Eats episodes that I would have liked to have

00:41:24.959 --> 00:41:29.770
created that, that Food Network wouldn't let
me do because of subject matter and sensitivity

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.299
to their, to their clientele so to speak.

00:41:32.299 --> 00:41:36.319
The, the aforementioned rabbits, I would like
to have done a rabbit episode because I really

00:41:36.319 --> 00:41:37.319
like rabbit.

00:41:37.319 --> 00:41:39.829
But they were like, no, no.

00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:40.829
[laughter]

00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:43.970
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: No, no, no, no because Thumper.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:48.440
You know I mean it's like people will accept
you know here we are with the pigs [oinking]

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.910
you know because we all hate pigs now because
of Angry Birds, everybody hates pigs.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:53.910
[laughter]

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.789
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You know it's like I was having
a conversation with her, you know, "Daddy,

00:41:57.789 --> 00:41:59.420
you really gonna kill that pig?"

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.420
You know to make barbeque?

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.420
I'm like, yeah I'm gonna kill the pig.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.420
She's like, "I don't want you to kill the
pig."

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.779
Go over and put a helmet on it and all of
a sudden she wants it dead, you know?

00:42:04.779 --> 00:42:05.779
[laughter]

00:42:05.779 --> 00:42:07.829
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I said, "Not only are we gonna
kill it, we're gonna throw birds at it until

00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:08.829
it dies.

00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:10.540
We're gonna make the whole house fall down."

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.549
Anyway that's another story.

00:42:11.549 --> 00:42:14.930
But I really wanted to do a rabbit show, but
you know the hippity hoppity bunny nobody

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.559
wanted to see that and, and I probably didn't,
they said, "Well nobody wants to see you,

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:21.520
you know, cut up and skin a rabbit on TV."

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.660
And I said, "Well, you know, c'mon, once you
get the fur off it looks just like a cat."

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.660
[laughter]

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:28.470
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And this was not the best argument
that I put forth because then they were just

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.519
kind of like

00:42:29.519 --> 00:42:30.519
[laughter]

00:42:30.519 --> 00:42:33.569
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: So that, that didn't go very
well.

00:42:33.569 --> 00:42:38.940
And I also would have liked to, I'm, I like
offal, variety meats, sweet breads and, and,

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.079
and tripe and stuff like that and would love
to have done a show digging into that kind

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:47.280
of stuff, because I think if you're gonna
eat an animal you need to eat the animal.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.859
And they're like, no, no, no you're not gonna
do that, you're not, no, nobody, nobody wants

00:42:51.859 --> 00:42:53.799
to see you cook tripe.

00:42:53.799 --> 00:42:57.039
So I'll, I'll get my revenge by doing that
somewhere else and, and.

00:42:57.039 --> 00:43:01.589
But those were really the only things that
I really wanted to do that, that I, I was,

00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:04.890
I just, I just couldn't get traction, couldn't
get traction for it.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:05.890
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:06.890
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Sure.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:07.890
Hi.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:08.890
&gt;&gt;female #2: Oh, oh, thank you for coming.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:09.890
I wanted to

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:10.890
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: How are things over here?

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:11.890
&gt;&gt;female #2: You're

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:12.890
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: No I like it better over here.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:13.890
[laughter]

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:14.890
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Go ahead.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:15.890
&gt;&gt;female #2: You're my food hero.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:16.890
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Thank you.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.069
&gt;&gt;female #2: But I have three children who
have terrible food allergies and one of my

00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:22.359
favorite episodes that you ever did was the
replacements.

00:43:22.359 --> 00:43:23.359
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yes.

00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:27.410
&gt;&gt;female #2: But I was wondering and I've
struggled with this for years is I'm a, I

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.410
love to bake,

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:29.410
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yes.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:30.479
&gt;&gt;female #2: But they're allergic to wheat,
eggs and dairy.

00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:31.479
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You're doomed.

00:43:31.479 --> 00:43:36.410
&gt;&gt;female #2: And you did an episode where
you replaced the egg with lentils, but you

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:41.619
also replaced egg with applesauce, but you
didn't replace the milk and the wheat.

00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:46.400
So I was wondering if you've ever had to do
this challenge, because it's been very difficult

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.499
to make things, there's no emulsifier once
you remove the egg.

00:43:49.499 --> 00:43:50.499
So is there a better?

00:43:50.499 --> 00:43:54.559
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well, I mean you can use xanthan
gum as a replacement for, for the, for the

00:43:54.559 --> 00:43:57.289
natural lecithin in egg yolks and that works.

00:43:57.289 --> 00:43:58.339
Just understand something.

00:43:58.339 --> 00:44:00.980
You're never gonna get where you wanna go.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:05.700
There, there is, you're taking away the trinity
of real baking.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.779
So everything that you do once you remove
those is only gonna be an approximation.

00:44:09.779 --> 00:44:13.499
It may remind somebody of a baked good, but
you're, you're, you're probably not gonna

00:44:13.499 --> 00:44:15.259
get there, we just don't have the chemistry
for it yet.

00:44:15.259 --> 00:44:16.259
&gt;&gt;female #2: Ok.

00:44:16.259 --> 00:44:19.229
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You know you can replace, the
thing about working replacements is that you,

00:44:19.229 --> 00:44:20.769
you're, you can generally get away with one
or two

00:44:20.769 --> 00:44:21.769
&gt;&gt;female #2: Right.

00:44:21.769 --> 00:44:24.369
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But when you cross the line
and are trying to replace three, the structure

00:44:24.369 --> 00:44:25.369
of everything falls apart.

00:44:25.369 --> 00:44:26.369
&gt;&gt;female #2: Right.

00:44:26.369 --> 00:44:27.369
Well the oat flour

00:44:27.369 --> 00:44:28.369
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: 'Cause you're, you're messing
with that equation, sorry?

00:44:28.369 --> 00:44:32.150
&gt;&gt;female #2: The oat flour with the soy and
the baking powder with a little bit of extra

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.599
acid, so either rice wine vinegar or applesau,
apple vinegar

00:44:34.599 --> 00:44:35.599
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Sure.

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.440
&gt;&gt;female #2: Works really well for the leavening,
but my

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.009
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: As long as it's not a recipe
that was actually formulated for a double

00:44:41.009 --> 00:44:45.270
acting baking powder, because the problem
there is that you're getting all of your CO2

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.279
released upon mixture

00:44:46.279 --> 00:44:47.279
&gt;&gt;female #2: Right.

00:44:47.279 --> 00:44:49.589
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: So you may be able to mitigate
that by re-refrigerating

00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:53.849
&gt;&gt;female #2: I add a little bit of baking
soda so that at baking time I get the second

00:44:53.849 --> 00:44:55.130
lift for the addition of heat

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:58.920
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Uhhh, that's gonna be more
a factor of the acid than the base.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.099
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hmmm.

00:45:00.099 --> 00:45:02.069
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Don't I sound smart?

00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:03.069
[laughter]

00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:06.680
&gt;&gt;female #2: I like your lecithin idea, would
you presoak the lecithin so that it, it?

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.849
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well you said that they're
allergic to eggs.

00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:09.849
&gt;&gt;female #2: They are, but

00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:11.709
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well you probably can't use
the straight forward lecithin, so I would

00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:12.709
replace that with xanthan gum.

00:45:12.709 --> 00:45:13.709
&gt;&gt;female #2: With xanthan gum.

00:45:13.709 --> 00:45:14.709
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Probably.

00:45:14.709 --> 00:45:15.920
&gt;&gt;female #2: Or gelatin?

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:16.920
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.920
&gt;&gt;female #2: No

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.920
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: no.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.920
[laughter]

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.479
&gt;&gt;female #2: I've done really cool things.

00:45:21.479 --> 00:45:23.059
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well cool is the key word.

00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:24.059
&gt;&gt;female #2: [laughing]

00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:25.239
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: No, cool is the key word though

00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:26.239
&gt;&gt;female #2: Right.

00:45:26.239 --> 00:45:29.549
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: because if you're gonna, if
you're gonna use gelatin as, as a textural

00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:32.390
base, temp, it all becomes reliant on temperature.

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:33.390
So.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.650
&gt;&gt;female #2: Oh, 'cause you think it'll break
down once it hits 350.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.269
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well it does it depends.

00:45:37.269 --> 00:45:41.160
Now if you're using carrageenan or you're
using some other gel base that's a hot gel,

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.390
then, then that's different.

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:43.390
&gt;&gt;female #2: Ok.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:44.390
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: We're now boring everyone else.

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:45.390
[laughter]

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:46.390
&gt;&gt;female #2: Alright, I'm sorry.

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:47.390
So

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:48.390
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: They're like geez almighty,
just have some more kids.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.380
&gt;&gt;female #2: but if you were ever to do something
online, a second replacement would be awesome.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.479
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I will, I will attempt to do
so.

00:45:52.479 --> 00:45:59.440
This, this growing trend we have of intolerances
and allergies is certainly confounding and

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.440
&gt;&gt;female #2: Right.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.670
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And it opens up whole new marketing
opportunities.

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:07.660
And, and, and a lot of it I think I actually
do think that there is a part of the population

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.479
that is faking it.

00:46:09.479 --> 00:46:12.930
I don't think that there are nearly as many
intolerances as there are people that want

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.059
to be treated specially by having an intolerance.

00:46:15.059 --> 00:46:19.750
I'm not saying that's your families' case
at all because there's a real difference between

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.559
an intolerance and an actual allergy,

00:46:21.559 --> 00:46:22.559
&gt;&gt;female #2: Right.

00:46:22.559 --> 00:46:26.990
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: but you know people that are,
are gluten intolerant, that's going up.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:31.819
We're all lactose intolerant to some degree,
most of us of northern European extraction,

00:46:31.819 --> 00:46:33.499
no that aren't of, of

00:46:33.499 --> 00:46:34.500
&gt;&gt;female #2: Right.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.500
Asians.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.499
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: northern European extraction,
have some of that.

00:46:38.499 --> 00:46:39.530
So it's a concern.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.839
My daughter, I mean my daughter is allergic
to peanuts.

00:46:42.839 --> 00:46:45.109
We have no freaking idea where this came from.

00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:49.529
My, there is no peanut allergy going back
in my family as far as we can go or in my

00:46:49.529 --> 00:46:51.930
wife's and yet here she is.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.009
Why did this happen and how did it happen?

00:46:54.009 --> 00:46:55.009
Don't know.

00:46:55.009 --> 00:46:56.059
But I think it's something that we're gonna
have to deal with.

00:46:56.059 --> 00:46:57.239
Maybe part of evolution, just natural evolution,
I don't know.

00:46:57.239 --> 00:46:58.459
&gt;&gt;female #2: Well, I'll let you know.

00:46:58.459 --> 00:47:00.029
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But thanks, thanks for your
question though.

00:47:00.029 --> 00:47:01.220
I'll work on that.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.220
Yes?

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.109
&gt;&gt;male #6: So you mentioned zombies earlier.

00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:05.959
I just have to ask a question.

00:47:05.959 --> 00:47:09.869
In the event of a zombie apocalypse what's
your go to food for survival?

00:47:09.869 --> 00:47:11.619
I guess your go to food just for pleasure.

00:47:11.619 --> 00:47:15.579
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well I have to let you know
that I'm actually working on, on a couple

00:47:15.579 --> 00:47:19.470
of games that are related to this issue.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:20.470
Um, one

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:21.470
[laughter]

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:22.470
&gt;&gt;male #6: That's awesome.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.209
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: One is called Zombie Chefs,
where you're actually in a grocery store fighting

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:30.500
zombies that are chefs of different nationalities
and you can only kill them with ingredients

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.500
from their cuisine.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.500
[laughter]

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.019
&gt;&gt;male #6: That's actually a pretty good game.

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:36.019
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Is that bad?

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:37.029
Is Zombie Chefs bad?

00:47:37.029 --> 00:47:38.029
&gt;&gt;male #6: No, it's great.

00:47:38.029 --> 00:47:41.499
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And then, and then the big,
the big one I'm working on with my daughter

00:47:41.499 --> 00:47:45.990
is called Cupcake Apocalypse and it's, it's
set in the time where all the weapons that

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:50.049
we have left are cupcakes because we had all
these cupcakes we made to make cupcake TV

00:47:50.049 --> 00:47:54.170
shows and that's all we've got left and so
we've converted, we've converted NERF guns

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:56.349
to shoot cupcakes.

00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:59.599
So I have to say that in the end it's gonna
be the cupcakes that'll be the most important

00:47:59.599 --> 00:48:00.599
food.

00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:01.599
&gt;&gt;male #6: I'll look forward to playing

00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:04.539
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Because a head shot with a
10-year old cupcake, as long as it's not a

00:48:04.539 --> 00:48:07.119
Hostess product, which would still be soft
and tender,

00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:08.119
[laughter]

00:48:08.119 --> 00:48:12.089
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: is, is gonna, is gonna do,
do what needs to be done.

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:13.680
And zombies hate buttercream.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.680
[laughter]

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.680
&gt;&gt;male #6: Thank you so much.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.680
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: They hate it.

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.680
You're very welcome.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.680
This is a serious issue, people.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.680
I, I'm not kidding around.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.680
Yes sir.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.380
&gt;&gt;male #7: Yeah, well, speaking of families,
what was it like shooting a show with your

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.380
grandmother?

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.950
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: What was it like shooting a
show with my grandma?

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:32.180
That was in the very first season of good
eats and that was my maternal grandmother

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.959
and it was, it was great fun and I was really
glad we did it because she died about two

00:48:35.959 --> 00:48:40.559
years after that and so now my daughter doesn't
really remember her and so she can watch that

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:44.619
show and kind of see what my relationship
was like with my grandmother and it's nice.

00:48:44.619 --> 00:48:47.609
I still kind of have a hard time watching
it 'cause she and I were very close.

00:48:47.609 --> 00:48:51.839
So I'm glad we got to do it, but, you know,
I'm, it's tough, it's emotional thing for

00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:52.839
me.

00:48:52.839 --> 00:48:53.839
&gt;&gt;male #7: Ok.

00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:54.839
Thank you.

00:48:54.839 --> 00:48:55.839
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: And she owed me money when
she died so that's

00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:56.839
[laughter]

00:48:56.839 --> 00:48:57.839
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: that's kind of extra painful.

00:48:57.839 --> 00:48:58.839
So.

00:48:58.839 --> 00:48:59.839
Go ahead.

00:48:59.839 --> 00:49:00.839
&gt;&gt;male #8: Alright.

00:49:00.839 --> 00:49:02.720
I work on the books project which is actually
a couple buildings

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.749
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You work on the books project?

00:49:03.749 --> 00:49:08.069
&gt;&gt;male #8: So I was very interested to hear
that you're, you're looking into video enabled

00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:09.069
e-books.

00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:10.069
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yes, I am.

00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:12.880
But only if I can keep you guys from just
nabbin' 'em.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.079
[laughter]

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:20.489
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Do you actually wait by the
door of the authors that are dying to just

00:49:20.489 --> 00:49:22.369
wait for that moment when they take their
last breath?

00:49:22.369 --> 00:49:23.369
Or do you

00:49:23.369 --> 00:49:24.369
&gt;&gt;male #8: Yeah

00:49:24.369 --> 00:49:26.069
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I'm screwing with you, ignore
that.

00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:27.390
&gt;&gt;male #8: 120 years later.

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:28.569
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Somebody has to do it.

00:49:28.569 --> 00:49:29.790
&gt;&gt;male #8: Copyright law's a bitch.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:30.790
Anyway

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:31.790
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Copyright, schmappyright.

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:33.999
&gt;&gt;male #8: if you have some time this afternoon,
we'd love to have you come over and pick your

00:49:33.999 --> 00:49:35.099
brains on what you'd love to

00:49:35.099 --> 00:49:39.059
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well, and I'd love to pick
your brains too because the thing about digital

00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:41.420
publishing is that we're, everybody's still
going, huh?

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:42.420
What?

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.670
And, and the thing that you guys might not
think about very much is where people like

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:50.809
me that generate content are all stymied is
by legal.

00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:55.479
Because none of the lawyers can figure out
what even the definitions are of things right

00:49:55.479 --> 00:50:02.380
now and so all of us are paying hun, thousands
of dollars trying to develop deals that, that

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.109
like protect everybody and define things because
nobody knows what the words mean.

00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:07.799
There's not precedent for it.

00:50:07.799 --> 00:50:13.640
So law firms are just are really making hay
off of this whole thing while no work's actually

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.640
being done.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.170
I think that I know a lot of people with great
ideas that have just said, I can't, I can't

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:20.229
afford to do this.

00:50:20.229 --> 00:50:24.069
When you think about the fact that the average
entertainment copyright lawyer's going between

00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:28.719
$650 and $700 an hour on a, and that's for
something that either happens or doesn't happen,

00:50:28.719 --> 00:50:31.460
you just go, oh my gosh, I can't, I can't
afford to do this.

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.569
So everybody's waiting.

00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:36.719
Waiting for court precedence to be set so
that words can be defined enough that contracts

00:50:36.719 --> 00:50:37.719
are gonna be drawn up.

00:50:37.719 --> 00:50:39.529
It's really interesting.

00:50:39.529 --> 00:50:44.479
You know I've been trying to develop e product
now for a year and are just now getting to

00:50:44.479 --> 00:50:49.529
the point of actually being able to talk about
what they will be because of trying to wade

00:50:49.529 --> 00:50:50.529
through the legal.

00:50:50.529 --> 00:50:51.529
It's real interesting.

00:50:51.529 --> 00:50:54.959
&gt;&gt;male #8: So you're, you're hoping to use
a lot of content you've made before with

00:50:54.959 --> 00:50:55.959
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: No.

00:50:55.959 --> 00:50:56.959
All original.

00:50:56.959 --> 00:50:57.959
I have no desire to repurpose content.

00:50:57.959 --> 00:51:02.630
&gt;&gt;male #8: And, and you still have all these
copyright worries with all new material?

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:06.819
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well, yeah, because the issue
is defining what it even is.

00:51:06.819 --> 00:51:12.940
It's, come, come to New York young man and
spend some time with me in some tall buildings

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.140
in midtown and I'll just show you how complicated
it can be.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:20.489
It's not just about who originated at all,
it's about even defining what the word is.

00:51:20.489 --> 00:51:23.930
It's defining what's an e-book and what's
an app.

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:26.249
Where does one cross the line into the other?

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:31.880
Because author x may have a deal over here
that precludes the use of, of or may say you

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.239
can't make apps, but you can make e-books.

00:51:33.239 --> 00:51:35.519
Or you can do this, but you can't do that.

00:51:35.519 --> 00:51:39.499
And the time limits on this and how long this
is in here and how long the video piece is.

00:51:39.499 --> 00:51:40.499
Very, very complicated.

00:51:40.499 --> 00:51:42.155
I'm in a bit of a unique situation because
I don't own restaurants.

00:51:42.155 --> 00:51:44.529
I own a video production company.

00:51:44.529 --> 00:51:46.219
I own sound stage.

00:51:46.219 --> 00:51:47.259
I own editing.

00:51:47.259 --> 00:51:53.209
I own, that's what I do and so my desire is
to get as much visual motion content into

00:51:53.209 --> 00:51:54.809
my product as possible.

00:51:54.809 --> 00:51:55.809
That's what I do.

00:51:55.809 --> 00:51:57.789
That's what I'm best at.

00:51:57.789 --> 00:52:01.949
And so that, that puts me in even more of
a kind of a complicated territory because

00:52:01.949 --> 00:52:08.979
if I use, if the software if the people that
I work with to develop the actual e product

00:52:08.979 --> 00:52:14.990
if we work together, here's the problem with
pioneering, it's like ok I wanna do this and

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:18.170
because I make this and you guys make this
we all of a sudden make something new.

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:20.180
Oh dear God, who owns that?

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.559
Who owns that process?

00:52:21.559 --> 00:52:23.650
Is it patentable?

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:25.539
You can't just buy all your patents you know.

00:52:25.539 --> 00:52:26.539
[laughter]

00:52:26.539 --> 00:52:27.539
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: We tried.

00:52:27.539 --> 00:52:28.539
[laughter]

00:52:28.539 --> 00:52:30.480
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Sometimes you have to make
that stuff up.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.660
And so everybody's going, oohhh, ok so now
we need another agreement between us to cover

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:36.400
whatever we might innovate.

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.400
So it's really tough.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.130
It's easy to be back and so you start to see
the marketplace is already getting kind of

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:45.349
stale for e products because everybody's doing
the same stuff because it's established.

00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:50.020
Nobody wants to pioneer because nobody understands
who's gonna own it.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.369
You can just wait for dead guys.

00:52:51.369 --> 00:52:52.630
&gt;&gt;male #8: So, well, yeah, forever.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:53.680
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Yeah, I understand.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.680
&gt;&gt;male #8: Yeah.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.279
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: So it's, it's really complicated.

00:52:56.279 --> 00:52:57.279
It's exciting.

00:52:57.279 --> 00:53:02.549
I'm excited enough in it to be turning my
company solidly into the direction of figuring

00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:05.029
this out of finding out how to do this.

00:53:05.029 --> 00:53:10.279
For me it's life or death in a way because
it's, it's evolving into a state of really

00:53:10.279 --> 00:53:13.309
being able to do what I do best, which is
probably something that hasn't been invented

00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:15.799
yet and if I'm wrong I'm completely screwed.

00:53:15.799 --> 00:53:16.961
But we, we can talk.

00:53:16.961 --> 00:53:17.961
We should talk.

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:21.709
I would love, I would love to hear what you
guy, 'cause you guys know, you guys know what's

00:53:21.709 --> 00:53:22.709
going on.

00:53:22.709 --> 00:53:23.709
&gt;&gt;male #8: Yeah.

00:53:23.709 --> 00:53:24.709
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Hey.

00:53:24.709 --> 00:53:25.709
Oh wait.

00:53:25.709 --> 00:53:27.160
Yeah, let's do you so you can sit down.

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.190
You've been standing there awhile.

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:29.190
Go ahead.

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:30.190
&gt;&gt;male #9: Thank you.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:31.579
First of all thank you for coming and thank
you for the team here to inviting you.

00:53:31.579 --> 00:53:32.579
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Oh.

00:53:32.579 --> 00:53:33.579
I.

00:53:33.579 --> 00:53:34.579
Thanks.

00:53:34.579 --> 00:53:35.579
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Thanks for showing up.

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:36.579
&gt;&gt;male #9: Love your recipes.

00:53:36.579 --> 00:53:39.369
We make the schmaltz-based gravy every year
for Thanksgiving.

00:53:39.369 --> 00:53:40.990
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Schmaltz is good.

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.130
&gt;&gt;male #9: What's the one recipe

00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:43.300
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Not exactly a heart healthy
thing.

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.079
&gt;&gt;male #9: No, we make it once a year.

00:53:45.079 --> 00:53:46.079
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: In moderation.

00:53:46.079 --> 00:53:47.079
Exactly.

00:53:47.079 --> 00:53:48.199
&gt;&gt;male #9: What's the one recipe that scares
you to make?

00:53:48.199 --> 00:53:53.589
Is there a dish that's like, this doesn't
always work, it's a challenge, is there something

00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:54.589
like that?

00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:55.589
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You know what?

00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:56.589
&gt;&gt;male #9: Like to that you're working

00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:58.329
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: It's never the big complicated
dishes that do me in.

00:53:58.329 --> 00:53:59.479
&gt;&gt;male #9: It's the hollandaise sauce.

00:53:59.479 --> 00:54:05.479
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well no it's, it's, no you
know it's like if I've really worked it out

00:54:05.479 --> 00:54:08.529
it's the dishes that I accidentally turn my
back on.

00:54:08.529 --> 00:54:12.079
It's simple stuff that I get cavalier with.

00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:13.079
Rice.

00:54:13.079 --> 00:54:17.279
Every tenth pot of rice I make is a unmitigated
disaster and I don't know why.

00:54:17.279 --> 00:54:21.070
I, I, I will do it exactly the same as I've
done all the others, but for some reason I'm

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:22.700
not paying attention right and I screw it
up.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.280
So now I just throw out every tenth one.

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.640
I don't even make it, I just throw it out.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.640
[laughter]

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.920
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: To this day I will still, I
get up every morning and make a pot of coffee.

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.019
And without failure one out of every five
pots is horrible.

00:54:35.019 --> 00:54:36.130
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.289
You know it's when I'm not paying attention.

00:54:38.289 --> 00:54:43.859
But if you tell me ok today we're gonna roast
a whole hog over hickory wood with blah, blah,

00:54:43.859 --> 00:54:44.859
blah, blah.

00:54:44.859 --> 00:54:45.859
Alright.

00:54:45.859 --> 00:54:46.859
I'm there.

00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:47.859
I'm solid.

00:54:47.859 --> 00:54:48.859
It's on my scope.

00:54:48.859 --> 00:54:49.859
&gt;&gt;male #9: You're focused.

00:54:49.859 --> 00:54:50.859
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: I've got it.

00:54:50.859 --> 00:54:51.939
I usually don't screw that stuff up because
I plan and I'm paying real close attention.

00:54:51.939 --> 00:54:56.430
I'm not gonna tell you that occasionally my
hollandaise isn't 100%, but you know something

00:54:56.430 --> 00:55:00.539
like a sauce I look at a success range of
you know, it's within this 10%.

00:55:00.539 --> 00:55:01.569
Is it my best hollandaise?

00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:02.569
No.

00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:03.769
Is it still better than most people's hollandaise?

00:55:03.769 --> 00:55:04.769
Yeah.

00:55:04.769 --> 00:55:05.769
Is it edible?

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:06.769
[laughter]

00:55:06.769 --> 00:55:07.890
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You know the nice thing about
food experimenting is that most of the time

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:10.309
even the really bad screw ups are edible.

00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:12.809
You know you don't throw away that much food,
you know.

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:15.839
Which is why I tell people when they learn,
first learn how to cook.

00:55:15.839 --> 00:55:16.839
Cook eggs.

00:55:16.839 --> 00:55:20.709
They're cheap and, and if you mess them up
it's not that big of a deal.

00:55:20.709 --> 00:55:24.199
The chickens will make more, you know, it,
it, they're inexpensive.

00:55:24.199 --> 00:55:28.759
So I don't really mess up you know the big
stuff, but I'm a very simple cook.

00:55:28.759 --> 00:55:30.319
I don't do complicated stuff.

00:55:30.319 --> 00:55:31.319
I really don't.

00:55:31.319 --> 00:55:32.319
&gt;&gt;male #9: So what's your take on molecular
gastronomy?

00:55:32.319 --> 00:55:36.119
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well I've talked about molecular
gastronomy before and been pounced on for

00:55:36.119 --> 00:55:37.119
it.

00:55:37.119 --> 00:55:40.319
I think of all gastronomy is molecular.

00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:47.369
It's all molecules and, and the danger of
any movement in food is that people fixate

00:55:47.369 --> 00:55:49.689
on it, excluding other things.

00:55:49.689 --> 00:55:53.989
So I know a lot of young cooks right now,
I've met several young cooks who want to jump

00:55:53.989 --> 00:55:58.239
straight to the powder and not cook the carrots
properly.

00:55:58.239 --> 00:56:02.680
The real great practitioners, the real artists
in food that are embracing those ingredients

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.710
and techniques are already great cooks.

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:06.819
Ok?

00:56:06.819 --> 00:56:08.859
And they're just using, they're just innovating.

00:56:08.859 --> 00:56:14.200
It's like adding paintbrushes to your to you
know or colors to your palette, which is fine.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:18.109
I think that when we start moving into, for
my own personal taste, when food starts becoming

00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:22.500
unidentifiable as what it is, I kind of lose
my interest.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.970
And, and I've been on record as saying, "Man,
I just hate foam."

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:30.759
The only food I want foam on is cappuccino
and if you want to call a meringue a foam,

00:56:30.759 --> 00:56:34.039
but I don't want big bubbles that look like
something that came out of a dying fish's

00:56:34.039 --> 00:56:35.039
gills.

00:56:35.039 --> 00:56:36.039
[laughter]

00:56:36.039 --> 00:56:37.859
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: You know I just don't and you
can tell me that you filled them with smoke

00:56:37.859 --> 00:56:40.809
and that it's made with blah, blah and I'm
just still, I still just don't freaking want

00:56:40.809 --> 00:56:42.769
it man, you know it's just not what I eat
ok?

00:56:42.769 --> 00:56:45.369
It, I don't have a very sophisticated palette.

00:56:45.369 --> 00:56:48.479
I like simple foods that taste like what they
are.

00:56:48.479 --> 00:56:52.939
So those are all fantastic tools and you know
in the summertime I keep liquid nitrogen around

00:56:52.939 --> 00:56:56.660
because my daughter and I love to make instant
ice cream or we'll buy fruit on the way home

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.519
and say, "Hey, let's make sorbet out of that."

00:56:58.519 --> 00:56:59.849
And you know liquid nitrogen's cheap.

00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:02.420
There's a place up the street, I live near
a hospital, I can get the stuff cheap and

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:04.420
we pour it on all kinds of stuff.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.130
Some times we soak crackers in liquid nitrogen
and give them to the dogs, which is really

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:11.989
cool because as the dog chews the cracker,
the steam shoots out of their mouth.

00:57:11.989 --> 00:57:12.989
[laughter]

00:57:12.989 --> 00:57:17.039
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: But I'm not sure that's legal,
so I, I don't know how to do that.

00:57:17.039 --> 00:57:22.250
And, and I use xanthan gum to keep my, my
dressings stable.

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:23.479
So I use these things.

00:57:23.479 --> 00:57:29.930
I use you know occasionally we'll use a tapioca
maltodextrin to turn olive oil into a powder

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:31.819
because that's fun and I can put it on stuff.

00:57:31.819 --> 00:57:33.970
But by and large they're all just tools.

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:38.829
And when an artist becomes defined by the
tools, that's a problem, in general.

00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:40.339
&gt;&gt;male #9: Thank you.

00:57:40.339 --> 00:57:41.469
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Sure.

00:57:41.469 --> 00:57:42.902
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Um, I have a

00:57:42.902 --> 00:57:45.099
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: We're gonna wait for more people
to come to the microphones.

00:57:45.099 --> 00:57:48.569
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah, now, so would you do
a miniseries?

00:57:48.569 --> 00:57:49.569
That's a question on here I just thought

00:57:49.569 --> 00:57:50.569
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: A miniseries?

00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:51.569
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: that was interesting.

00:57:51.569 --> 00:57:52.569
Not food related.

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:53.809
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Uh, would I do a non-food related
miniseries?

00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:54.809
Sure.

00:57:54.809 --> 00:57:56.769
I would do a non-food related series series.

00:57:56.769 --> 00:57:58.640
I mean I have a lot of interests besides food.

00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.650
I like science.

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:00.650
I like all sorts of stuff.

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:01.650
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Ok.

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:03.170
I like the Mythbusters thing, I think you'd
be perfect for that.

00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:05.569
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: If I could get on Myth, well
if one of the Mythbusters guys would like

00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:07.619
get blown up, I could slip right in

00:58:07.619 --> 00:58:08.619
[laughter]

00:58:08.619 --> 00:58:09.619
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: and take over.

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.201
Either of them, you know I'd be alright with
that, I think.

00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:12.239
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I think that's a good fit.

00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:14.119
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Well, we'll have to see what
happens.

00:58:14.119 --> 00:58:15.900
They're getting pretty sloppy with their,
their pyroworks.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:16.949
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: I'm getting this.

00:58:16.949 --> 00:58:17.949
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Are you?

00:58:17.949 --> 00:58:18.949
Are we done, oh really?

00:58:18.949 --> 00:58:20.499
Did I suck all the air out of the room?

00:58:20.499 --> 00:58:21.729
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: We're a few minutes over.

00:58:21.729 --> 00:58:22.729
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Thanks for coming.

00:58:22.729 --> 00:58:24.089
Oh, wait, can I take this one more question?

00:58:24.089 --> 00:58:25.089
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yes, please.

00:58:25.089 --> 00:58:26.089
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Alright, go ahead.

00:58:26.089 --> 00:58:27.089
Go ahead sir.

00:58:27.089 --> 00:58:28.670
&gt;&gt;male #10: I really salute you for bringing
your really quirky sense of humor to TV and

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:32.420
yet you don't do it on all of your shows,
so what's it like balancing the quirky Alton

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.809
with the making people cry on Food Network
Star Alton?

00:58:34.809 --> 00:58:38.539
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: [laughing] I see that all as
quirky.

00:58:38.539 --> 00:58:43.410
You know, oh that's actually a really interesting
question because the kind of quirkiness that's

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:46.720
on, on Good Eats, that's actually me.

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:52.559
The, the other side of, of the way I am like
on Iron Chef America or certainly on Food

00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:54.979
Network Star is job specific.

00:58:54.979 --> 00:58:58.739
You know they're asking me to play a specific
role, so that's more like acting.

00:58:58.739 --> 00:59:06.299
That, that's, that's not me, that's a sliver
of me that's being used to make people cry.

00:59:06.299 --> 00:59:08.470
Which I can do, but it's, it's not me.

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:13.099
They, you know any job allows you only a certain
range of your skill set and so there are a

00:59:13.099 --> 00:59:16.140
lot of projects that I do that only call for
one or two things.

00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:18.430
Good Eats though is kind of the whole, the
whole kit and caboodle.

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:20.380
So, thanks for coming everybody.

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:21.770
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Thank you.

00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:22.770
&gt;&gt;Alton Brown: Thank you very much.

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:23.770
[applause]

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:24.770
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Hey, thanks a lot.

00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.771
