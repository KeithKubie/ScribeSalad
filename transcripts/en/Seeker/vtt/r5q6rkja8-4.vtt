This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Full Sail University.

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.749
This week the Japanese Aerospace Exploration
Agency announced it wants to get solar power

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:08.830
from space.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.540
I'm having flashbacks to disasters from SimCity2000.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.750
Hello!

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.180
I'm Trace.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.990
Thank you for watching DNews.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.410
Back in the 1960s, American aerospace engineer
Peter Glaser proposed launching solar panels

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.680
into space, and beaming the power they collect
back to the surface for our use.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.440
Since the late 60s the idea has been in a
holding pattern mainly because of the expense

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.039
and worries about maintenance and equipment,
but thanks to recent developments in solar

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.300
panel tech -- the Japanese space firm JAXA
says they can finally try it.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.300
The plan is ambitious at minimum and cost
hasn't yet been calculated, BUT JAXA is determined,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.460
and they're not the only ones.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.780
The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory is also
interested in space-based solar.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.319
The reason everyone's looking up, is because
that's where the sun sits!

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.969
If we can put a satellite in orbit to collect
the sun's rays BEFORE the atmosphere filters

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.789
them out, and without the worry of a cloudy
day, that would be rad.

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.680
The JAXA Space Based Power System or SBPS
will orbit 22,400 miles up, and if done to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.469
their specs, would completely replace a nuclear
power plant by producing 1 gigawatt of electricity

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.560
-- enough to power half-a-million homes.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.659
Their plan uses a 10,000 metric ton system,
which is... well pretty ridiculous.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.560
The largest rocket ever launched was the Saturn
V -- it took our boys to the moon and could

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.450
only lift about 130 metric tons.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.820
Once the power is gathered, a converter in
space will convert the electricity into a

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.030
microwave beam -- not like in your house,
literally waves of energy that are on the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.040
micro scale.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.820
Microwaves can be converted from energy at
80 percent efficiency, which means there would

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.659
be some loss, but it would be pretty damn
efficient -- about 48% of the power collected

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.170
would reach consumers.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.149
Which doesn't sound great, but it really is.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.020
To make sure the array is getting sunlight
24-hours a day, JAXA plans to put mirrors

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.970
on either side of the planet to reflect sunlight
at the collector all the time.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.970
The Japanese are announcing their plan so
far in advance in the hope other countries

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.470
will gather and help realize the dream of
solar from space.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.910
Once created, it could provide clean, unlimited
energy anywhere on the planet, regardless

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.030
of remote location.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.030
Here's the kicker.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.510
It would cost about a trillion dollars.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.110
Which sounds like a lot, but it's like 125
bucks per person on the planet in 2030.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.140
And that's WAY more than you're paying doe
your power bill.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.560
Not to mention oil wars and all the pollution,
ecological damage, mining and drilling that

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560
goes with fossil fuels.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
We've got commenting areaaassss, check them
out and type your feelings on space-based

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.560
solar so we can all talk about it!

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.120
None of this would be possible without computers
to run the system, and we need people to write

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120
the computer programs.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.350
Full Sail University in Florida offers courses
to help train tech professionals by blending

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.530
code and real-world experience.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.130
Students of Full Sail have hands-on access
to technology on their first day, get a discounted

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.340
laptop and all the software they'll need to
earn degrees in software, mobile and web development.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.690
