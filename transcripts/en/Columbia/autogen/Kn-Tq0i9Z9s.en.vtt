00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.160
representative of European Union it was
his own understanding and it was

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.170
his own understanding and it was
 

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.550
his own understanding and it was
accepted of other European countries

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:44.560
accepted of other European countries
 

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:49.700
accepted of other European countries
especially Germany and so I think that

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:49.710
especially Germany and so I think that
 

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:55.460
especially Germany and so I think that
is a growing understanding that we have

has good proclamations in that field but
 

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:51.580
has good proclamations in that field but
very little really support and so we had

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:51.590
very little really support and so we had
 

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.370
very little really support and so we had
the idea and we are working for that for

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:54.380
the idea and we are working for that for
 

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.750
the idea and we are working for that for

instance tough to establish the European
 

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.520
instance tough to establish the European
democracy foundation which in my view

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:00.530
democracy foundation which in my view
 

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.130
democracy foundation which in my view

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:03.140
really would a good answer for that
 

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.660
really would a good answer for that
until now we didn't succeed with that

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:07.670
until now we didn't succeed with that
 

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.880
until now we didn't succeed with that
and we have the question of Constitution

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:11.890
and we have the question of Constitution
 

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:16.180
and we have the question of Constitution
we know that difficulties and the

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:16.190
we know that difficulties and the
 

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.060
we know that difficulties and the
difficulties comes from the journal

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.070
difficulties comes from the journal
 

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:23.560
difficulties comes from the journal
support and itself we sometimes have

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:23.570
support and itself we sometimes have
 

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:26.320
support and itself we sometimes have
some doubted well if it was right to

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:26.330
some doubted well if it was right to
 

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.750
some doubted well if it was right to
support suit to support Poland in that

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760
support suit to support Poland in that
 

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.960
support suit to support Poland in that
situation because in that situation it

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:31.970
situation because in that situation it
 

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.970
situation because in that situation it
seemed to us very important to have the

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:33.980
seemed to us very important to have the
 

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:39.730
seemed to us very important to have the
similar better voting situation for

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:39.740
similar better voting situation for
 

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.240
similar better voting situation for
Poland but if you see the general

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:43.250
Poland but if you see the general
 

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:46.810
Poland but if you see the general
situation in Europe it's a difficulty

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:46.820
situation in Europe it's a difficulty
 

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.480
situation in Europe it's a difficulty
and so we germs sink and not only be

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:51.490
and so we germs sink and not only be
 

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:55.690
and so we germs sink and not only be
that with a double voting it's a more

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:55.700
that with a double voting it's a more
 

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.180
that with a double voting it's a more
justice situation on the one hand to

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:58.190
justice situation on the one hand to
 

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.750
justice situation on the one hand to
have the population on the other hand to

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760
have the population on the other hand to
 

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.620
have the population on the other hand to
have states and so little states have

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:05.630
have states and so little states have
 

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.490
have states and so little states have
the right to take part but it is on the

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:09.500
the right to take part but it is on the
 

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.550
the right to take part but it is on the
other hand clear that that states with

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:12.560
other hand clear that that states with
 

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.480
other hand clear that that states with
large at the big population can't be

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:16.490
large at the big population can't be
 

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:19.090
large at the big population can't be
over voted because it's not possible to

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:19.100
over voted because it's not possible to
 

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.720
over voted because it's not possible to
have a vote with all the little states

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:21.730
have a vote with all the little states
 

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:28.050
have a vote with all the little states
and the larger one in the more financial

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:28.060
and the larger one in the more financial
 

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.560
and the larger one in the more financial
stronger one have to pay and so I think

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:32.570
stronger one have to pay and so I think
 

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.940
stronger one have to pay and so I think
that total double voting for Europe is

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:35.950
that total double voting for Europe is
 

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.460
that total double voting for Europe is
really the best way and we have to

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:39.470
really the best way and we have to
 

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.930
really the best way and we have to
discuss it

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:40.940
discuss it
 

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.990

difficulties in that European issue peak
not only because of some really

not only because of some really
difficult questions but also because of

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:36.700
difficult questions but also because of
 

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.380
difficult questions but also because of
not so clear polish position about their

there is known not much awareness about
the Polish experience with Russia and

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:09.129
the Polish experience with Russia and
 

00:34:09.129 --> 00:34:12.990
the Polish experience with Russia and
not only with Russia but also with the

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000
not only with Russia but also with the
 

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.859
not only with Russia but also with the
situation in between exactly that's a

00:34:16.859 --> 00:34:16.869
situation in between exactly that's a
 

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:21.659
situation in between exactly that's a
deep experience in Poland and nobody who

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:21.669
deep experience in Poland and nobody who
 

00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:24.629
deep experience in Poland and nobody who
will try to understand Poland has to

will try to understand Poland has to
 

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:28.379
will try to understand Poland has to
forget it and that's why it has to be

00:34:28.379 --> 00:34:28.389
forget it and that's why it has to be
 

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:31.440
forget it and that's why it has to be
remembered and it's not only Poland if

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:31.450
remembered and it's not only Poland if
 

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:33.210

States if you see also pillows in other
states in that former European eastern

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:45.820
states in that former European eastern
 

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.480
states in that former European eastern
border and Russia there's a field of

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:50.490
border and Russia there's a field of
 

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:54.599
border and Russia there's a field of
history which Western Europe is not

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:54.609
history which Western Europe is not
 

00:34:54.609 --> 00:34:59.210
history which Western Europe is not
really aware and so it could happen that

00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220
really aware and so it could happen that
 

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.780
really aware and so it could happen that

end of the Second World War was shaped
in that way as we experience and I think

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480
in that way as we experience and I think
 

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.470
in that way as we experience and I think
there will be a majority in that room

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480
there will be a majority in that room
 

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:19.440
there will be a majority in that room

not only to say that must not happen
again we have to deal with that history

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:24.840
again we have to deal with that history
 

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:30.770
again we have to deal with that history

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640
question of European Union and I think
 

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.570
question of European Union and I think
you've been unions identity is very much

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:45.580
you've been unions identity is very much
 

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.900
you've been unions identity is very much
linked with that and we have to shape

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:48.910
linked with that and we have to shape
 

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.150
linked with that and we have to shape
data to prepare that I will come back to

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160
data to prepare that I will come back to
 

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:56.520
data to prepare that I will come back to
that again I think that from that

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:56.530
that again I think that from that
 

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.840
that again I think that from that
background

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:57.850
background
 

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.110
background
it is understandable the discussion in

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:01.120
it is understandable the discussion in
 

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.770
it is understandable the discussion in
Poland the question with the Baltic Sea

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:04.780
Poland the question with the Baltic Sea
 

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:09.480
Poland the question with the Baltic Sea
pipeline between Russia and Germany and

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:09.490
pipeline between Russia and Germany and
 

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.000
pipeline between Russia and Germany and
the European Union it's one of the

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.010
the European Union it's one of the
 

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:18.450
the European Union it's one of the
European energy lines and in the end it

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:18.460
European energy lines and in the end it
 

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:22.230
European energy lines and in the end it
is clear it will be built but the

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240
is clear it will be built but the
 

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.810
is clear it will be built but the
communication of Chancellor Shona in

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:24.820

communication of Chancellor Shona in
that way was a catastrophe because it

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:28.870
that way was a catastrophe because it
 

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.080
that way was a catastrophe because it
was not really consulted it discussed

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.090
was not really consulted it discussed
 

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:36.420
was not really consulted it discussed
before and so I think that's one of the

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:36.430
before and so I think that's one of the
 

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:43.280
before and so I think that's one of the
difficulties the other thing is involved

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:43.290
difficulties the other thing is involved
 

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:48.840
difficulties the other thing is involved
not to reject the participation during

not to reject the participation during
 

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:54.800
not to reject the participation during
orakpo in my view that was right but the

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:54.810
orakpo in my view that was right but the
 

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:59.870
orakpo in my view that was right but the
question was in which way that was

00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880
question was in which way that was
 

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.650
question was in which way that was
celebrated between Germany France and

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:04.660
celebrated between Germany France and
 

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:08.760
celebrated between Germany France and
Russia and that so-called I would call a

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:08.770
Russia and that so-called I would call a
 

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:14.040
Russia and that so-called I would call a
little bit worse so called ex situation

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:14.050
little bit worse so called ex situation
 

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:17.530
little bit worse so called ex situation
so that middle powers of the European

so that middle powers of the European
Union together with Russia that brought

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:21.910
Union together with Russia that brought
 

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:27.130
Union together with Russia that brought
some difficult feeling and polling but

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:27.140
some difficult feeling and polling but
 

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.140
some difficult feeling and polling but
the problem was on is in my view that

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.150
the problem was on is in my view that
 

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.050
the problem was on is in my view that
today when pull this member of European

European position towards Russia now we

you pin union is led by France and
 

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:00.120
you pin union is led by France and
Germany and that's why we don't like it

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:00.130
Germany and that's why we don't like it
 

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:04.150
Germany and that's why we don't like it
but in my view it's a very important

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160
but in my view it's a very important
 

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.860
but in my view it's a very important
issue for the future that you've been

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:05.870
issue for the future that you've been
 

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:09.660
issue for the future that you've been
union with such important issues has to

union with such important issues has to
 

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.840
union with such important issues has to
shape a camel position towards Russia

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:12.850
shape a camel position towards Russia
 

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:15.970
shape a camel position towards Russia
and I think the roundabout way if you

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:15.980
and I think the roundabout way if you
 

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:21.370
and I think the roundabout way if you

be that the background for supporting

Iran my feeling is that important

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:10.570
Iran my feeling is that important
 

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.050
Iran my feeling is that important
there's no clear feeling to be

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:13.060
there's no clear feeling to be
 

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.320
there's no clear feeling to be
threatened by Iran there's more feeling

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:16.330
threatened by Iran there's more feeling
 

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:20.580
threatened by Iran there's more feeling
to be threatened by Russia and so it

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:20.590
to be threatened by Russia and so it
 

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.790
to be threatened by Russia and so it
could be interesting difficulty the

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800
could be interesting difficulty the
 

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.540

peak countries including Russia that is
 

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:34.470
peak countries including Russia that is
only against that threatening Iran and

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480
only against that threatening Iran and
 

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.410
only against that threatening Iran and
in the same time especially important

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:37.420
in the same time especially important
 

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.010
in the same time especially important
there's a feeling we have to do it in

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:41.020
there's a feeling we have to do it in
 

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.599
there's a feeling we have to do it in
order to be more secure from Russia from

00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:45.609
order to be more secure from Russia from
 

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:49.170
order to be more secure from Russia from
possible threats from Russia and on the

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:49.180
possible threats from Russia and on the
 

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.890
possible threats from Russia and on the
other hand I think the background could

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:52.900
other hand I think the background could
 

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:59.040
other hand I think the background could
be that says a feeling in Poland that

00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.050
be that says a feeling in Poland that
 

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:02.040
be that says a feeling in Poland that
it's needed a special relationship to

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:02.050
it's needed a special relationship to
 

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.820
it's needed a special relationship to
the United States to get a more secured

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:05.830
the United States to get a more secured
 

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:10.620
the United States to get a more secured
situation and if that's right and that

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:10.630
situation and if that's right and that
 

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.440
situation and if that's right and that
would be interesting to talk about if

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:13.450
would be interesting to talk about if
 

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.460
would be interesting to talk about if
that's right then it would be a problem

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:16.470
that's right then it would be a problem
 

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:22.020
that's right then it would be a problem
because if that would be right then it

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:22.030
because if that would be right then it
 

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:25.109
because if that would be right then it
would mean that membership in NATO is

00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119
would mean that membership in NATO is
 

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:28.290
would mean that membership in NATO is
not enough and that could create

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:28.300
not enough and that could create
 

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.799
not enough and that could create
difficulties in

00:41:29.799 --> 00:41:29.809
difficulties in
 

00:41:29.809 --> 00:41:35.140
difficulties in
with regions of a different security and

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:35.150
with regions of a different security and
