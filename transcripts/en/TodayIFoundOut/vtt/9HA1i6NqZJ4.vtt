00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.759
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.050
In the video today, we're looking at why the
U.S. uses the electoral system, rather than

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.780
allowing general citizens to vote on the Presidency.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.140
On December 13, 2000, Vice President Al Gore
conceded the presidential election to Governor

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.140
Bush.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.430
A day earlier, a lengthy and expensive manual
vote recount process in Florida was stopped

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.980
by the United States Supreme Court despite
Bush leading by only 537 votes.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.580
With Bush winning the state’s 25 electoral
votes, it gave him 275 electoral votes and

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.480
put him over the needed threshold.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.260
This election result was highly unusual, not
just because of Supreme Court decisions and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.260
hanging chads.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.230
It was also only the fourth time in United
States history that a candidate had garnered

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.700
a majority of the popular votes but lost the
election- Gore received 50,996,582 votes and

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.800
Bush 50,456,062.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.920
Bush won because of the Electoral College
system - a much maligned and complex way of

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.270
determining the future leader of America.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.270
How does it work?

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.319
Why does America use the Electoral College?

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.189
Why isn’t a simple vote count good enough
to determine the president of the United States

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.189
of America?

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.780
To begin with, contrary to popular belief,
when Americans go to the polls to seemingly

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.049
vote for the next president of the United
States, they are, in fact, not actually voting

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.049
for the president.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.680
Rather, they are casting a vote for a group
of electors who will then vote for the president

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.049
as they see fit.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.880
To reduce any chance of confusion, rather
than having people explicitly vote for electors

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.859
on the ballot, the presidential candidate
a given group of electors is pledged to vote

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.789
for is put on the ballot instead.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.380
Another common misconception about presidential
voting in the United States is that the president

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.219
is elected once the general public's votes
are tallied up.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.689
Again, because the general public does not
technically vote for a president, but rather

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.359
on which Electoral College representatives
will get to vote for president, the president

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.139
isn't officially elected until the following
January.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:53.439
Specifically, on January 6th the current vice
president opens voting during a Joint Session

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.450
of Congress.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.789
It's during this session that electoral votes
are tallied, with the deadline for those to

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.929
be submitted being in late December.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.950
This may seem to be something of a technicality,
but there are many completely legal scenarios

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.709
in which a different president may be chosen
than the one who appears to have won after

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.350
the general public has cast their ballots
for electors.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.409
(More on a couple of these scenarios in a
bit.)

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.480
So who are these voters that actually elect
the president and how are they chosen?

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.280
There are only two federal laws that pertain
to who can be an elector.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.460
The first one comes from Article II of the
Constitution, which states that “no Senator

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.930
or Representative, or Person holding an Office
of Trust... shall be appointed an Elector.”

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.540
The second is a provision buried in the 14th
amendment that says any state official that

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.709
was involved in an insurrection or rebellion
against America is also barred from being

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.709
an elector.

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.610
(You can thank the Civil War for that one.)

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.230
Beyond those two restrictions, anyone can
be an elector.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.359
As for who ends up being an elector, that
depends on the political parties and how a

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.409
given state legislature sets the method of
selection.

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.879
But in a nutshell, each state’s political
parties nominate a group of electors who are

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.430
extremely loyal to their respective parties.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.150
Their number is equal to the number of electoral
votes the state has, which in turn is equal

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.870
to the number of senators (two per state)
and number of representatives (determined

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.170
by population) said state has, or in the case
of the District of Columbia, a set three electors

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.209
(thanks to the 23rd Amendment).

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.170
There is also potentially one additional minor
caveat to consider when the party selects

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.670
its groups of electors- an elector cannot
vote for a vice president and president who

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.870
both are from the elector's home state.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.689
This rule was meant to ensure an elector could
not vote for two of their state's "favorite

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:22.689
sons".

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.480
(More on why this was considered so important
in a bit.)

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.709
Today, this is obviously not an issue for
anyone so long as the presidential candidate

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.030
picks a vice presidential candidate from another
state than their own.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.719
On election day, whichever political party’s
candidate, be it Republican, Democratic or

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.749
a third party, wins the majority of the state’s
votes, that slate of electors becomes the

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.819
ones who get to vote for the president in
their respective state.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.930
For example, in 2012, Californians voted for
the 55 party-selected Democrats who in turn

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.730
all cast their 55 votes for the Obama/Biden
ticket.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.030
(Note: there are currently two exceptions
to this all-or-nothing approach- Maine and

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.749
Nebraska; they both use a district system.

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:01.560
In this system, the state's popular majority
is accounted for in some electors' votes,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.720
but others vote based on congressional district's
popular majority within the state.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.030
This can potentially result in a splitting
of the votes.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.980
For instance, in 2008, Nebraska ended up with
four Republican electors and one Democrat.)

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.881
However, as previously alluded to, to make
this even more confusing and convoluted, there

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:21.480
are no federal laws or Constitutional provisions
that require electors to cast their vote in

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.840
accordance with the state’s popular vote
result.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.620
There are some state laws, however, pertaining
to this; 29 states (and the District of Columbia)

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.980
have laws that require the electors vote the
way the popular vote has instructed them too.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.849
That said, penalties are not too severe in
most cases- failure to adhere to these state

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.260
laws by so-called “faithless electors”
could result in a fine or replacement as an

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.260
elector.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.990
That also leaves 21 states that do not have
such laws, allowing electors to vote as they

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.300
see fit instead of how the general public
directed them too.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.730
It turns out, this seems to have been what
the founders intended.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.710
It should be noted here that, according to
the National Archives, more than 99% of the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.199
time electors have voted as instructed and
no elector has ever been prosecuted or punished

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.070
for failing to vote in accordance with the
popular vote of their respective states.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.900
However, there have been 22 times involving
179 electoral votes that faithless electors

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.430
have bucked the system.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.150
The most recent was in 2008 when an elector
apparently accidentally voted for John Edwards,

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.889
rather than the Democratic nominee Barack
Obama.

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.250
Another notable recent instance was in 2000
when a DC elector abstained from voting in

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.780
protest over the District’s lack of representation
in Congress.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.180
Despite the occasional faithless elector,
to date, none of these faithless votes has

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.729
ever been the deciding vote in an election.

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.170
However, there have been elections where a
single faithless elector could have decided

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.810
the president, such as in 1876 when Rutherford
B. Hayes, despite losing the popular vote,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.910
won 185 electoral votes vs. 184 to Samuel
Tilden.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.660
So, why does the United States use the somewhat
convoluted Electoral College when a popular

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.610
vote would be drastically simpler and more
democratic?

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.870
In short, it was a necessary compromise from
a time when the "united states" were not bound

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.539
nearly as cohesively as today, nor the general
public very well educated on the whole or

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.880
well informed about the various candidates.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.310
For the more detailed answer, the Electoral
College dates back to 1787’s Constitutional

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.300
Convention in Philadelphia, where they were
given the gargantuan task of figuring out

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.720
a solution to the mostly ineffective Articles
of Confederation.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.460
Among the many issues that needed resolving
was how the president of United States was

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.510
to be elected.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.169
In order to understand the delegates’ thought
process, context is needed.

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.169
The young country was only 13 states and residents
were generally extremely provincial, meaning

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.330
they still trusted their own state more than
the federal government.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.700
Further, in many cases people identified more
as a citizen of their state, rather than a

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.690
citizen of the United States first.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.840
From this, the founders were concerned that
citizens of each state would put their own

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.860
best interest before the nation's.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.570
On top of this, because each state's citizens
would likely know their own candidates much

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.331
better than candidates from other states (most
of whom they probably wouldn't even have ever

00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:55.750
heard of), they were doubly likely to vote
for their own candidates.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.120
The ultimate result of this was feared to
be that the winner of each state would likely

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.340
be a citizen of that state, who would in turn
have little chance of winning, or even garnering

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.510
any support at all, in other states.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.750
This brings us to the first option put on
the table- election via popular vote.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.400
While more democratic, as mentioned, delegates
were very concerned that each state would

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.240
potentially elect their own candidate, making
it difficult to ever get a candidate with

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.100
wide support throughout the nation.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.789
Instead, they feared they'd be left with a
field of many "favorite sons."

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:26.240
Among these favorite sons, the bigger states
- like Virginia - would dominate, resulting

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.850
in little chance of someone from a smaller
state ever becoming president, and making

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.439
it so Virginia's interests would be disproportionately
represented in the nation's highest office.

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:39.509
For reference, at the time, Virginia had 424,000
men eligible to vote, which was more than

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:43.470
Georgia, Delaware, South Carolina, Rhode Island
and New Hampshire combined.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.970
The other major option proposed was a simple
Congressional appointment.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.259
Despite being inherently non-democratic, there
was a thought that the president should be

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:54.110
less powerful than Congress and, therefore,
needed to be dependent on them.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.050
Also, the thinking went, the general public
was largely extremely poorly educated and

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.250
poorly politically informed.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.240
Congressional members, on the other hand,
were not only already elected to represent

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.750
their respective citizens in such matters,
but were also intimately familiar with prospective

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.479
presidential candidates, their character,
work ethic, political leanings, etc. and were

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:15.379
generally quite well educated relative to
most people.

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:19.350
Thus, in a nutshell, members of Congress were
simply the most qualified to pick the most

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.050
qualified president.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.000
Ultimately this proposal lost because it threatened
the checks and balances of the federal government.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.569
As then delegate and future President James
Madison noted,

00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:30.930
“[T]he election of the Chief Magistrate
would agitate &amp; divide the legislature so

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.400
much that the public interest would materially
suffer by it.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.230
Public bodies are always apt to be thrown
into contentions, but into more violent ones

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.610
by such occasions than by any others.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.030
[T]he candidate would intrigue with the Legislature,
would derive his appointment from the predominant

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.280
faction, and be apt to render his administration
subservient to its views.”

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.070
Essentially- if the president was elected
by Congress, while in theory Congress at the

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.530
time may well have been in a much better position
to pick the best president, those who sought

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:02.130
the office would be constantly campaigning
and trying to impress those members, perhaps

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.250
even giving favors upon election in exchange
for votes.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.190
Beyond this, no president interested in getting
re-elected could ever oppose Congress for

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.760
fear they wouldn't re-elect him or her later.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.760
Needless to say, this system was ripe for
extreme corruption.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.080
So while in theory Congress was best suited
to pick the potential best president, in practice

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.100
they'd likely not have done so, or if they
did, lorded too much power over that individual.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.851
Thus, the Committee of Eleven on Postponed
Matters devised and proposed the Electoral

00:09:27.851 --> 00:09:31.080
College, a system the delegates ultimately
approved.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.560
Alexander Hamilton noted of the Electoral
College, "...if the manner of it be not perfect,

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.920
it is at least excellent."

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.810
As to what "the manner of it" actually was
intended to be- the idea here was essentially

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.140
something of a cross between a popular vote
and congressional selection- it was democratic

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.320
in the sense that the popular vote could potentially
determine the state’s allegiance (in the

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.450
beginning state legislatures didn't all do
it this way), but it also limited the larger

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.940
states' influence slightly by awarding extra
votes to smaller states via an elector for

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.450
each of their senatorial representatives.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.620
As for why it was also partially a compromise
for those who advocated for a congressional

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.351
selection, in a time before political parties
in the United States, there is evidence that

00:10:08.351 --> 00:10:12.780
the founders very much assumed the electors,
who explicitly could not "hold an Office of

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.580
Trust or Profit under the United States" (to
avoid at least some of the aforementioned

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.590
corruption potential), would not be bound
by the popular vote in their state or party

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.390
affiliation or any such similar device.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.890
In fact, in the earliest elections, over half
the states' legislatures selected their presidential

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:33.260
electors with no regard for public vote, a
right state legislatures still technically

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.410
retain, but is a practice that died swiftly
around the turn of the 19th century.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.900
Beyond potentially disregarding popular vote
in selecting which group of electors gets

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.700
to vote for president, if a given state legislature
really wanted to, they could even decide to

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.960
pick a group of electors via something completely
arbitrary like putting a bunch of mice in

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.540
a maze, one representing each person who ran
for president, with the winning mouse determining

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.460
which group of electors is chosen.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.930
Of course, no state legislature would dream
of doing something so outlandish.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:04.280
However, several state legislatures have very
recently begun banding together to use their

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.340
elector picking power to potentially disregard
their own citizen's popular choice (more on

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.340
this in a bit).

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.030
In any event, by 1790, along with the rest
of the Constitution, the Electoral College

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.810
was ratified by all 13 states and has in the
vast majority of cases resulted in little

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.710
controversy or public outcry for a change
to the original system.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.610
In fact, the Electoral College has undergone
only a few small changes since 1790.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.760
The most significant change occurred following
the election of 1800.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.820
At the time, each elector would cast two votes,
one for one presidential candidate and one

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.870
for another.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.440
The person with the most votes became president,
and the person with the second most became

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.730
vice president.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.060
This ensured that, at least in theory, the
second most qualified individual was vice

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.380
president- ready to step in should something
happen to the most qualified person- the president.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.490
Today the person who potentially would step
in should something happen to the president

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.920
is not selected by members of the Electoral
College, nor even by the citizens of the United

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.060
States, but rather by the president- the most
undemocratic selection of all.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.340
As Senator Samuel White of Delaware noted
when this switch was made, the vice president

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:09.700
is now chosen, not based on the individual's
qualifications for that office, but rather

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.500
by if "he by his name, by his connections,
by his wealth, by his local situation, by

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.380
his influence, or his intrigues, best promote
the election of a president..."

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.980
So what spurred the change in the Electoral
College, no easy thing to do given that it

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.600
requires an amendment to the Constitution?

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.440
Mainly the rise of political parties.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.120
In 1800, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were
both vying for the presidency, with each having

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.670
their preferred vice president within their
own party- something of a new concept.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:40.450
This was a problem if all electors for a given
party ended up voting for both individuals,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.520
for instance, Thomas Jefferson and his proposed
vice president, Aaron Burr.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.110
If this happened, they'd both be tied for
president.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.160
It happened.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.260
What followed was 36 rounds of voting within
the House to try to break the tie (the opposing

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.980
party members muddied things up by voting
for Burr just to attempt to see their most

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.440
hated rival, Jefferson, defeated).

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.580
There were even threats of militia's forming
to march on the capital to push for Jefferson,

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.270
before Jefferson, who was always understood
to be his party's choice for president over

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.290
Burr, was chosen.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.940
In the aftermath, the 12th amendment was passed.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.190
This said that each elector got two votes,
as before, but instead of both votes being

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.320
for a potential president, one would be for
president and the other for vice-president,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.660
thus creating little chance that a vice-presidential
candidate could be elected president.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.650
(Little chance, because, as VEEP illustrated,
it can still happen).

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.480
Other than that, over two hundred years later,
the Electoral College is still essentially

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.020
the same process as it was on day one.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.530
While today it's a bit outdated given most
American’s attitudes concerning federal

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.700
and state allegiances, it is a process that
has survived in no small part because it's

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.110
both relatively difficult to amend the U.S.
Constitution and, on the whole, the system

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.880
has worked pretty well, not garnering nearly
as much controversy as it would need to spur

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.570
a Constitutional change.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.740
All that said, following the highly controversial
2000 election between Bush and Gore, there

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.430
have been attempts to tweak the Electoral
College system without the need for amending

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.660
the Constitution.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.930
How would this be possible?

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.620
It all comes down to the fact that states
are allowed to select their electors however

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.940
they see fit, not just based on a winner-take-all
popular vote selection.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.070
Towards this end, several bills have been
proposed in various states to tweak the elector

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.070
selection.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.550
In most cases, these bills looked to switch
to a district system, rather than a winner-take-all.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:20.680
To date, little has come of these, as most
who oppose the Electoral College want a nation-wide

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.410
popular vote system, which on the surface
would seem to require a Constitutional Amendment...

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.410
or would it?

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.960
It turns out there is a way around this, too,
via the National Popular Vote system.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.781
This is a clever proposal in which each state
that joins agrees to give all its Electoral

00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:39.080
College votes to whatever candidate wins the
national popular vote, rather than their particular

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.800
state-level popular vote.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.550
In some cases, this may well mean a state's
legislature would go against its own citizen's

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.830
popular vote in selecting electors.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.030
Currently 11 states have pledged to this system,
for a total of 165 electoral votes.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:57.610
If 105 more electoral votes are pledged (making
for a total of 270), the system will take

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:02.140
effect and the United States, while still
using the Electoral College system, will begin

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.960
electing its president via electors based
on the national popular vote- no Constitutional

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:22.779
amendment required.
