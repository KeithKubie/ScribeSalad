00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.530
I'm going to draw a molecule
of benzene.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.340
And then we're going to think
about if anything interesting

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.550
might happen with
that molecule.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.140
So let me draw it.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.680
So we have 6 carbons
in a ring.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:22.290
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
carbons in a ring.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.030
What's interesting about
benzene, why it's different

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.320
than cyclohexane, is that
it has these 3 double

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.520
bonds in the ring.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.400
So let's say we have these two
carbons are double bonded to

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.150
each other, these two carbons
are double bonded, and then

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.630
these two carbons over here
are double bonded.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.550
Actually, I'll draw the
hydrogens here just so that we

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.050
remember that they're there.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930
But I'll it in a subtle color.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.960
So this carbon right
here is going to be

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.320
bonded to how many hydrogens?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.880
It has 1, 2, 3 valence electrons
already used up.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.390
So it's going to have one
bonded to one hydrogen.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.080
This one right here,
same thing.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.050
Bonded to one hydrogen.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.400
So it has 4 valence electrons.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.380
This one, same thing.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.350
I think you see the pattern.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.180
That each of these are-- they
have three bonds to carbons,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.770
one single bond to two carbons,
and then one extra

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.390
double bond.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.890
And then the fourth bond
is to hydrogen.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.040
So let me just draw all
of the hydrogens here.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.420
I'm doing it in this dark color
so we don't have to pay

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.950
too much attention to it.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.770
Now this right here,
this is benzine.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.310
And you're going to see a lot
about benzine in the future.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.910
But in this video, we're going
to study or try to understand

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.110
a particularly interesting
property of benzene, and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.360
that's resonance.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.520
And it's not a property of just
benzene, it's a property

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.150
of many organic molecules.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.350
But benzene is kind of
the most fun version.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.940
So let's think about what
might happen with this

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.370
molecule right here.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.980
So I have this electron.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.870
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.240
I have this-- let me
do it in this blue.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.570
I have this electron
over here.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.140
What if this electron moved over
to this carbon over here?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.110
So this carbon is still going
to have the other

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.110
electron in the bond.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.270
It's just going to kind of pivot
around a little bit.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.259
So that electron moves
over there.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.280
Now this carbon doesn't need 5
electrons, so this electron

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.170
goes to that carbon
right over there.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.160
Now this carbon doesn't need 5
electrons, so that electron

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.850
goes back to the original
carbon that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.210
lost that first electron.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.160
So at the end of the
day, everyone has

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.800
kind of broken even.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.390
If this happened, we might
end up with a structure

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.140
that looks like this.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.360
And I'll draw a two-way arrow
because we can actually go in

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.880
both directions.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.940
So let me draw just
the carbon chain.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.790
So 1 carbon, 2 carbons, 3
carbons, 4 carbons, 5 carbons

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.620
and 6 carbons.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.710
And then, over here, we had the
double bond over here, but

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.910
now it's moved over here.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.380
So now the double bond-- and
actually, let me do it in a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.070
blue color so we see
the difference.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.100
So now the double bond
is over here.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.750
This blue electron has
moved over there.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.260
This blue electron has
moved up here.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.040
Actually, let me color code it,
so it makes it very clear.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.190
So let's say this is
a green electron.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.100
Now the green electron has moved
from this carbon over to

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.630
that carbon.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.960
We can imagine that
it's done that.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.670
Then you would have this magenta
carbon or this magenta

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.290
electron that was with this
carbon, but now it's moved

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.390
over to this carbon over here.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.540
And now the double bond
has shifted as well.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.030
That's what this arrow showed.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.850
We'll stick with the blue
carbon over there.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.750
That blue carbon has moved down
to the original carbon.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.015
And now the double bond
has shifted over here.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.600
So we essentially have a very
similar, really, a very

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.100
similar molecule.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.160
This is actually just a rotated
version of that.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.320
But we have these double bonds
that could keep flipping back

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.140
and forth between this position
and that position

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.410
over there.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.930
They can just keep
on doing it.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.440
They can just keep flipping
either backwards or forwards.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.560
And the reality of benzene is
that it's actually never in

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.090
either this structure
or this structure.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.019
It's always, actually, in
something right in between.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.110
The reality of benzene
actually looks

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.050
something more like this.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.160
And I'll just draw it without
drawing all the carbons and

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.800
the hydrogens.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.100
And obviously, in this case, let
me draw the hydrogens here

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.410
since I drew the hydrogens
up here.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.700
This had the hydrogens
over here.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.700
Don't want to forget those.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.585
If you ever forget them
they're implicit.

00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:37.670
I want to draw the hydrogens.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.970
But if we just look at the
overall ring, we know that the

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.790
carbons and the hydrogens
are implicit.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.650
The actual structure of benzene
is actually in between

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.920
that and that.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.490
In reality, you kind of have a
half double bond between all

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.720
of the carbons.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.240
So the reality is, is that it
looks something like this.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.830
So you have half a double bond
there, half a double bond

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.670
there, half a double bond over
here, half a double bond over

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.400
here, and then half a double
bond over here.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.900
And then we're almost done.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.250
And then, half a double
bond over here.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.900
The reality of benzene is that
these electrons are actually

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.360
spinning around the
whole ring.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.920
It's not flip-flopping
between this

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.260
structure and this structure.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.220
The actual structure, the lower
energy state structure,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.510
is this right here.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.040
Now these Lewis diagrams or
actually, I haven't drawn all

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.850
of the Lewis electrons.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.510
But these are considered
contributing structures.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.650
And you often draw these when
you're doing reaction

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.600
mechanisms. But the reality
is, is that resonance, the

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.450
resonance of these positions
creates-- the reality of

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.120
benzene is that it's actually
sitting in this

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.230
intermediate position.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.600
Now, this doesn't happen
only with benzene.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.590
Another example, there's going
to be many examples.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.840
But just so that we're familiar
with maybe two of the

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.130
best examples, another example
that you'll see a lot in the

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.270
context of resonance is
the carbonate ion.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.460
So carbonate ion.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.670
You have a double bond to one
oxygen and then you have

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.980
single bonds to two
other oxygens.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.240
And those two other oxygens
have extra electrons.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.070
So if I were to draw this oxygen
over here it has 1, 2,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.980
3, 4, 5, 6 valence-- or
actually, I should

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.930
say, it has 7 valence.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.150
Let me make it very clear.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.800
So it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7 valence electrons.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.140
It has one extra electron, so
it has a negative charge.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.480
And the same is true
for this one.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.220
It has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7 valence electrons.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.800
One extra.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.030
So it has a negative charge.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.330
If you were to just look at
this, I guess you could call

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.420
it this resonance structure or
this contributing structure,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.330
you'd say hey, maybe this
oxygen-- and this oxygen here

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.120
is neutral, so it has
6 valence electrons.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.980
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.230
Maybe, just maybe, one of these
electrons can be given

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.180
to the carbon and then the
carbon would lose an electron

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.740
to this guy on top.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.290
So maybe you could imagine a
situation where this electron

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.720
right here gets given
to the carbon.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.430
And when that gets given to
the carbon, the carbon

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.950
releases-- it all happen
simultaneously.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.460
The carbon releases this
electron and it goes back up

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.910
to that oxygen over there.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.340
And so what's that going
to look like if

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.630
that were to happen?

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.550
So if that were to happen,
now our structure

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.920
will look like this.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.200
We have a carbon.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.820
Now this carbon only has
a single bond up here.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.520
And then we have our oxygen.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.090
The oxygen, it had its
6 valence electrons.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:52.420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 valence
electrons.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.320
But now it got this
extra blue one.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.590
And now it got this extra blue
one, so now it has 7 valence

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.280
electrons, and it has
a negative charge.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.230
Now this oxygen over here
gave one of its

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.150
electrons to the carbon.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.050
Now it is bonded with it.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.030
So now the carbon has
a double bond.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.750
I'll actually do it
in that color.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.320
Has a double bond with this
oxygen down here.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.230
It gave an electron, so now it
only has 6 valence electrons.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.040
And it is now neutral.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.220
And this oxygen over here,
nothing really

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.280
new happened to it.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.540
I could just copy
and paste it.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.020
So let me copy and then
let me paste it.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.799
So this one is just sitting
right like that.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:41.650
But you could imagine a
situation where this oxygen

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.799
right here, then all of a
sudden-- and it could have

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.350
come from this oxygen up here
or it could come from this

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.520
oxygen right here.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.450
This oxygen says hey, I have
an extra electron.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.670
Let me give it to the carbon.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.280
And then the carbon releases a
double bond with one of the

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.210
other oxygens.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.080
In this case, it would
be this one.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.940
Let me draw it.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.810
So maybe this electron right
here gets given to the carbon.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.150
Forms a double bond.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.630
Then the carbon can let
go of an electron.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.260
And so this electron right here
goes back to this oxygen.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.780
And so what happens?

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.190
So if that were to happen, our
structure looks like this.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:20.120
We have a carbon single bonded
to an oxygen up here that has

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.770
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
valence electrons.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.730
That hasn't changed in-- we
could call it this resonance

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.110
reaction, or however you
want to call it.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.420
So it still has a
negative charge.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.100
We have this guy down here.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.640
He took his electron back.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.270
So now he has 7 valence
electrons again.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:43.970
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 valence
electrons again.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.760
And I can even show the
one that he got back.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.220
That one's in purple.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.870
So he now has a negative
charge.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.540
And this guy now gave an
electron to the carbon.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.790
So he forms a double bond,
a new double bond.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.640
So this guy forms a double
bond with the carbon.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.200
He gave an electron, so he
only has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.420
valence electrons, and
is now neutral.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.030
Now these can all keep swapping
between each other.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.160
You can even go from this
structure to that structure.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.100
You can actually go from any one
of these structures to any

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.990
of the others.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.990
And the reality of the
carbonate ion, let

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.420
me write this down.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.670
This is the carbonate ion.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.710
The reality of it is that its
true structure is some place

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.625
in between all of these.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.630
So the true structure
of a carbonate ion

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.510
would look like this.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.330
You would have a carbon and
you'd have three oxygens.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.750
They have at least one
single bond with each

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.230
of those three oxygens.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.790
And then you have 1/3 and then
you have-- actually, I should

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:54.630
say, you have 1/3 of a double
bond with each of them.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.135
This is a 1/3 of a bond.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.250
This is not standard notation,
but this is essentially going.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.100
1/3 of the time, the electron
is on that bond.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.700
And then the other 2/3 of the
time, each of these oxygens

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.920
have an extra electron.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.835
You could imagine almost having
a negative 2/3 charge.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.430
Now, people normally draw one
of these structures because

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.550
this is a nice-- kind of you're

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.530
dealing with whole numbers.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.900
But the reality of carbonate
ions is that it's experiencing

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.690
this resonance.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.280
That the electrons are actually
always floating in

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.170
between these forms. Actually
floating across

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.300
all of these bonds.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.760
And that actually, makes this
molecule more stable.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.170
This is at a lower energy state
than any of these forms.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.150
And the same thing is
true with benzene.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.800
This right here, where we're
in between these two

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.250
structures, is actually at a
lower energy state, a more

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.830
stable state than either
of these forms.
