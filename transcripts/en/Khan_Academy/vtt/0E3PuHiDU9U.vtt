00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.311
You buy a truck for $60,000

00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:04.939
to start a shipping business.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.581
The truck has a useful life of 3 years.

00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:10.337
You then have to buy another truck.

00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:11.471
What I've done here is,

00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:13.413
I've drawn our actual ...

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.414
a series of income statements
for our shipping business.

00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:19.247
This is year 1, year 2, year 3, year 4.

00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:22.536
This is the revenue that we
make in each of those years.

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:24.004
It's kind of a business

00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:24.868
that right from the get go

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:26.997
we start making $100,000 a year.

00:00:26.997 --> 00:00:28.670
This is all in thousands.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.869
Let me it write that.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.414
This is all in thousands.

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:33.471
This is 100,000.

00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:35.003
It kind of just stays steady there.

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.870
We just keep making
$100,000 a year in revenue,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.336
for the first 10 years.

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:40.831
Then, we have to pay a driver.

00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:43.937
Let's say the cost of the
labor is $50,000 a year.

00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:48.178
Once again, this is in thousands.

00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:50.071
What I want to address in this video …

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:51.095
This would be a cost.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.138
When you just subtract out the labor cost,

00:00:53.138 --> 00:00:54.678
you have $50,000 left.

00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:58.762
Then, your other cost is
going to be the truck itself.

00:00:58.762 --> 00:01:00.011
What I want to think
about in this video is

00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:04.094
how should we account for
the cost of the truck.

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:07.068
You might just say,
"Hey look, to start off"

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:09.834
"I spent $60,000."

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:13.082
In year 1 we'll actually
go out to the truck store

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:14.469
and buy the truck.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.870
Why don't I just call it
an expense of $60,000?

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.403
One reality is, you can just say,

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:23.603
"Hey look, in year 1
my truck cost $60,000."

00:01:23.603 --> 00:01:26.344
Then, in year 2 I don't have
to spend any money on a truck,

00:01:26.344 --> 00:01:27.470
because I have one.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.178
In year 3 I don't have to do it,

00:01:29.178 --> 00:01:33.427
but then in year 4 my first
truck now has to be scrapped,

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:34.937
because I used it so much.

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:38.678
In year 4 I have to buy
another truck for $60,000.

00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:40.204
Then, again in year 5, year 6

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:41.513
I don't have to do anything.

00:01:41.513 --> 00:01:46.203
Then, in year 7 I have to buy
another truck for $60,000.

00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:47.428
8, 9, I don't have to do anything.

00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:51.603
Then, in year 10 I have to
buy another truck for $60,000.

00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:53.937
If you've counted for the
purchase of your truck

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:56.012
every 3 years this way,

00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:58.761
your profit would look like this.

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.803
In year 1, 100 - …

00:02:00.803 --> 00:02:03.871
This is revenue and these
2 lines are expenses.

00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:11.137
100 - 50 - 60, this is -10,000
in profit in that first year.

00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:13.470
The second year you make 50,000.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.071
The third year you make $50,000.

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:16.538
Just 100 - 50.

00:02:16.538 --> 00:02:20.270
Then, fourth year, again, -10,000.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.762
Then, you make 50,000 and 50,000.

00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:24.138
Then, again -10,000.

00:02:24.138 --> 00:02:25.071
Then 50,000.

00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:26.205
Then 50,000.

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:27.429
To someone who looked at

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.543
this series of income statements,

00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:34.204
they'd say, "This is some
type of bizarre business."

00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:35.271
"In the first year …"

00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:37.871
"Every 3 years you lose a tone of money."

00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:38.604
"I don't know why."

00:02:38.604 --> 00:02:39.737
"Maybe it's being mismanaged,"

00:02:39.737 --> 00:02:41.203
"maybe something strange is happening,"

00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:43.003
maybe it's because of bad weather."

00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:43.872
"Who knows?"

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:44.802
"Then, you make a ton of money."

00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:45.938
"Then, you lose some money."

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:47.095
"Then, you make a ton of money."

00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:48.937
It seems like some type
of very bizarre business

00:02:48.937 --> 00:02:51.737
when you look at it from the operating ...

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:53.405
when you look at it from the profit line.

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:57.344
Just when you just expense
the truck every 3 years.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:00.202
An operating profit is the
profit from the operation.

00:03:00.202 --> 00:03:02.136
Before you think about how you're paying

00:03:02.136 --> 00:03:04.270
for the operations, how
you're financing them

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.937
or taxes, or any of that type of thing.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.678
This is strange, because this
is a very stable business.

00:03:10.678 --> 00:03:13.345
It's very strange for
it's operating profit

00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:15.804
to kind of jump around like this.

00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:20.871
The way that we kind of reconcile this

00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:22.405
is by doing something called

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:25.512
capitalizing the expense of the truck

00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:29.205
and then depreciating it
over the course of it's life.

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:33.000
I'll cover that in the next video.
