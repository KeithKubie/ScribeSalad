00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The correct answer is that we're sending the wrong content type header.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If you look at the program we're using, we still have

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
this line in here which says content type to text plain.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we get rid of this line, I'll comment it out, save this file--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so we got rid of that line, and when I reload my browser--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
aha--now our form is as we expected.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That's because in Google App engine the default content type is text HTML,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which tells the browser that it's receiving HTML and it should interpret it as such,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
our text is then interpreted as HTML.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When it was sent as text plain, it was interpreted as plain text,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and the browser showed everything we sent back,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you know--angled brackets and all.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now--let's see if this form behaves the same way as our old one did.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's working just as it did before, except the difference this time

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is the HTML is served by our live web application running on our machine

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
instead of just a plain text file.
