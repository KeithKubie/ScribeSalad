in the last two videos you learn to

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219
in the last two videos you learn to
 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.379
in the last two videos you learn to
think about the structure of language

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389
think about the structure of language
 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.440
think about the structure of language
using logic I introduced using symbols

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
using logic I introduced using symbols
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.180
using logic I introduced using symbols
for constants and variables and how to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190
for constants and variables and how to
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.920
for constants and variables and how to
break statements into subject and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
break statements into subject and
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.870
break statements into subject and
predicate it's time to look at some

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
predicate it's time to look at some
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.220
predicate it's time to look at some
logical symbols that will give our

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
logical symbols that will give our
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.519
logical symbols that will give our
sentences a bit more structure starting

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
sentences a bit more structure starting
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769
sentences a bit more structure starting
with quantifiers when we talk about a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
with quantifiers when we talk about a
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.259
with quantifiers when we talk about a
quantity we mean how many of something

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
quantity we mean how many of something
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.749
quantity we mean how many of something
there are but ordinary language is

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
there are but ordinary language is
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.729
there are but ordinary language is
fairly general even vague in its

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
fairly general even vague in its
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.490
fairly general even vague in its
treatment of quantity one house two or

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
treatment of quantity one house two or
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.190
treatment of quantity one house two or
more houses this is actually true of

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
more houses this is actually true of
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.920
more houses this is actually true of
logic too we'll look at three basic

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
logic too we'll look at three basic
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.760
logic too we'll look at three basic
quantities none sum which is one or more

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
quantities none sum which is one or more
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.450
quantities none sum which is one or more
and all each of these quantities is the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
and all each of these quantities is the
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639
and all each of these quantities is the
symbol so we will have three symbols

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
symbol so we will have three symbols
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.910
symbol so we will have three symbols
that we can call quantifiers first

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
that we can call quantifiers first
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.910
that we can call quantifiers first
here's the quantifier all remember when

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
here's the quantifier all remember when
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.619
here's the quantifier all remember when
we use predicates with variables we

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
we use predicates with variables we
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.930
we use predicates with variables we
ended up with sentences like X is a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
ended up with sentences like X is a
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.660
ended up with sentences like X is a
person but this doesn't tell us anything

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
person but this doesn't tell us anything
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.480
person but this doesn't tell us anything
about that X let's use X as a quantifier

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
about that X let's use X as a quantifier
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.620
about that X let's use X as a quantifier
for any X X is a person let's try that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
for any X X is a person let's try that
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.920
for any X X is a person let's try that
with the sentence X all Y we get for any

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
with the sentence X all Y we get for any
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.940
with the sentence X all Y we get for any
X X all Y one step further with for any

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
X X all Y one step further with for any
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.649
X X all Y one step further with for any
X for any Y X all Y when I use any with

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
X for any Y X all Y when I use any with
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.450
X for any Y X all Y when I use any with
these variables I'm really referring to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
these variables I'm really referring to
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.050
these variables I'm really referring to
all the things x and y can stand for so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
all the things x and y can stand for so
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.850
all the things x and y can stand for so
let's throw the universal quantifier all

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
let's throw the universal quantifier all
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.730
let's throw the universal quantifier all
into the mix we get the sentence for all

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
into the mix we get the sentence for all
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.780
into the mix we get the sentence for all
X X is a person in ordinary language you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
X X is a person in ordinary language you
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.609
X X is a person in ordinary language you
can read that as all of them are people

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
can read that as all of them are people
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.600
can read that as all of them are people
or just all people or all humans let's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
or just all people or all humans let's
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.069
or just all people or all humans let's
look at another one for all X Jill saw X

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079
look at another one for all X Jill saw X
 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.020
look at another one for all X Jill saw X
here we're basically saying Jill saw

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
here we're basically saying Jill saw
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.359
here we're basically saying Jill saw
everything but if we abandon these

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
everything but if we abandon these
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.069
everything but if we abandon these
quantifiers and just let the predicate

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
quantifiers and just let the predicate
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.170
quantifiers and just let the predicate
we'd end up with blank is a person and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
we'd end up with blank is a person and
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.800
we'd end up with blank is a person and
Jill saw Blake okay let's move to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
Jill saw Blake okay let's move to
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.450
Jill saw Blake okay let's move to
another symbol this one is the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460
another symbol this one is the
 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.120
another symbol this one is the
existential quantifier it acts like the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
existential quantifier it acts like the
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.800
existential quantifier it acts like the
universal quantifier all you just

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
universal quantifier all you just
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.960
universal quantifier all you just
learned about but instead it means sum

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
learned about but instead it means sum
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.180
learned about but instead it means sum
or more specifically there exists at

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
or more specifically there exists at
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.500
or more specifically there exists at
least one

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
least one
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.960
least one
let's go back to our variable X in the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970
let's go back to our variable X in the
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.899
let's go back to our variable X in the
phrase X is a person let's say we wanted

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909
phrase X is a person let's say we wanted
 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.910
phrase X is a person let's say we wanted
to talk about some person in other words

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
to talk about some person in other words
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.119
to talk about some person in other words
for some X where X is a person we'll

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129
for some X where X is a person we'll
 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.880
for some X where X is a person we'll
need to use an existential quantifier

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890
need to use an existential quantifier
 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.289
need to use an existential quantifier
we'll also you need to use it for the

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299
we'll also you need to use it for the
 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.350
we'll also you need to use it for the
sentence that Jill saw something

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360
sentence that Jill saw something
 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.940
sentence that Jill saw something
remember that Jill saw everything used

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950
remember that Jill saw everything used
 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.729
remember that Jill saw everything used
the universal quantifier all but for

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739
the universal quantifier all but for
 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.740
the universal quantifier all but for
Jill saw something we'll use the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
Jill saw something we'll use the
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.220
Jill saw something we'll use the
quantifier some our final quantifier is

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
quantifier some our final quantifier is
 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.569
quantifier some our final quantifier is
the symbol no take a statement P this P

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579
the symbol no take a statement P this P
 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.119
the symbol no take a statement P this P
might represent John saw the movie or my

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129
might represent John saw the movie or my
 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.490
might represent John saw the movie or my
house is red then the negation of that

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
house is red then the negation of that
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.890
house is red then the negation of that
statement not P would have the same form

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900
statement not P would have the same form
 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.050
statement not P would have the same form
as John didn't see the movie or my house

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060
as John didn't see the movie or my house
 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.900
as John didn't see the movie or my house
isn't red I'm listing two ways of

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910
isn't red I'm listing two ways of
 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.849
isn't red I'm listing two ways of
writing the not symbol but both have the

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859
writing the not symbol but both have the
 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.250
writing the not symbol but both have the
same meaning take another statement this

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
same meaning take another statement this
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.559
same meaning take another statement this
time with an individual constant and a

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569
time with an individual constant and a
 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.869
time with an individual constant and a
predicate as you saw in the last lesson

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879
predicate as you saw in the last lesson
 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.000
predicate as you saw in the last lesson
you can write john saw the movie this

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
you can write john saw the movie this
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.699
you can write john saw the movie this
way now let's turn the state same

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709
way now let's turn the state same
 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.830
way now let's turn the state same
statement into a negative John didn't

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
statement into a negative John didn't
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.729
statement into a negative John didn't
see the movie

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739
see the movie
 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.610
see the movie
see how that works same goes for my

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
see how that works same goes for my
 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.129
see how that works same goes for my
house isn't red that's how a predicate

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139
house isn't red that's how a predicate
 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.979
house isn't red that's how a predicate
is negated same applies to the two

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989
is negated same applies to the two
 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.990
is negated same applies to the two
predicates with variables X isn't a

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000
predicates with variables X isn't a
 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.699
predicates with variables X isn't a
