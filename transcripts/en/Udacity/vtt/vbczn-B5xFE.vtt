00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.600
The answer is the first two.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.490
Does U contain a number
greater than 100?

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.680
Well just scan through.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.340
If you find one, it does.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.250
If not, there wasn't one.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.320
This can be solved with
a linear time algorithm.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.129
Do any three elements sum to zero?

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.050
Well, we can just try all and
choose three possibilities.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.470
This is only cubic in
the number of input numbers, so

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.360
this brute force
algorithm is polynomial.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.960
I should say that there happen
to be faster algorithms as well.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.260
And lastly,
does any subset of U sum to zero?

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.500
Here, the brute force strategy
is to try all subsets of U,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.190
and this is exponential in the size and
input.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.016
Indeed, this problem is NP complete.
