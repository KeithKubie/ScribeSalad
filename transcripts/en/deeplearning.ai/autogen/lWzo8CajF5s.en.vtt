00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.360
you've learned how to implement

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.370
you've learned how to implement
 

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.679
you've learned how to implement
exponentially weighted averages there's

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689
exponentially weighted averages there's
 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.570
exponentially weighted averages there's
one technical detail called bias

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580
one technical detail called bias
 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.160
one technical detail called bias
correction that can make your

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170
correction that can make your
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.140
correction that can make your
computation of these averages more

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
computation of these averages more
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.390
computation of these averages more
accurately let's see how that works

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
accurately let's see how that works
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.580
accurately let's see how that works
in the previous video you saw this

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
in the previous video you saw this
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.550
in the previous video you saw this
figure for beta equals 0.9 this figure

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
figure for beta equals 0.9 this figure
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.210
figure for beta equals 0.9 this figure
for beta equals 0.98 but it turns out

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
for beta equals 0.98 but it turns out
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.700
for beta equals 0.98 but it turns out
that if you implement the formula as

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
that if you implement the formula as
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.429
that if you implement the formula as
written here you won't actually get the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
written here you won't actually get the
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.910
written here you won't actually get the
green curve when say beta equals 0.98

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
green curve when say beta equals 0.98
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.669
green curve when say beta equals 0.98
you actually get the purple curve here

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
you actually get the purple curve here
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920
you actually get the purple curve here
and you notice that the purple curve

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
and you notice that the purple curve
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.069
and you notice that the purple curve
starts off really low so let's see how

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
starts off really low so let's see how
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.110
starts off really low so let's see how
to fix that when you're implementing a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
to fix that when you're implementing a
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330
to fix that when you're implementing a
moving average you initialize it with B

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340
moving average you initialize it with B
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.119
moving average you initialize it with B
zero equals zero and then V 1 is equal

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129
zero equals zero and then V 1 is equal
 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.720
zero equals zero and then V 1 is equal
to 0.98 V zero plus 0.02 theta one but

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
to 0.98 V zero plus 0.02 theta one but
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.180
to 0.98 V zero plus 0.02 theta one but
the zero is equal to 0 so that term just

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
the zero is equal to 0 so that term just
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.479
the zero is equal to 0 so that term just
goes away so B 1 is just 0.02 times

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
goes away so B 1 is just 0.02 times
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.450
goes away so B 1 is just 0.02 times
theta 1 so that's why if the first day's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
theta 1 so that's why if the first day's
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.590
theta 1 so that's why if the first day's
temperature is say 40 degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600
temperature is say 40 degrees Fahrenheit
 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.399
temperature is say 40 degrees Fahrenheit
then V 1 will be 0.02 times 40 which is

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
then V 1 will be 0.02 times 40 which is
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.160
then V 1 will be 0.02 times 40 which is
8 so you get a much lower value down

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
8 so you get a much lower value down
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080
8 so you get a much lower value down
here so it's not a very good estimate of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
here so it's not a very good estimate of
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.429
here so it's not a very good estimate of
the first day's temperature V 2 will be

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439
the first day's temperature V 2 will be
 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.450
the first day's temperature V 2 will be
0.98 times B 1 plus 0.02 times theta 2

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460
0.98 times B 1 plus 0.02 times theta 2
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.630
0.98 times B 1 plus 0.02 times theta 2
and if you plug in you know V 1 which is

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640
and if you plug in you know V 1 which is
 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.050
and if you plug in you know V 1 which is
this down here and multiply it out then

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
this down here and multiply it out then
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.260
this down here and multiply it out then
you find that B 2 is actually equal to

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270
you find that B 2 is actually equal to
 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.289
you find that B 2 is actually equal to
0.98 times zero point zero 2 times theta

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
0.98 times zero point zero 2 times theta
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.460
0.98 times zero point zero 2 times theta
1 plus 0.02 times theta 2 and that is

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
1 plus 0.02 times theta 2 and that is
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.210
1 plus 0.02 times theta 2 and that is
zero point zero one nine six theta one

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
zero point zero one nine six theta one
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.840
zero point zero one nine six theta one
plus zero point zero two theta 2 so

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
plus zero point zero two theta 2 so
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.210
plus zero point zero two theta 2 so
again you know assuming if they the 1

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
again you know assuming if they the 1
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.389
again you know assuming if they the 1
and theta 2 a positive numbers when you

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399
and theta 2 a positive numbers when you
 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.190
and theta 2 a positive numbers when you
compute this B 2 will be much less than

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
compute this B 2 will be much less than
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.950
compute this B 2 will be much less than
say they want all theta 2 so B 2 is in a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
say they want all theta 2 so B 2 is in a
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.440
say they want all theta 2 so B 2 is in a
very good estimate of the first two days

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450
very good estimate of the first two days
 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.660
very good estimate of the first two days
temperature of the year so it turns out

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
temperature of the year so it turns out
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160
temperature of the year so it turns out
that there's a way to modify the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
that there's a way to modify the
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.050
that there's a way to modify the
Zestimate that makes it much better and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
Zestimate that makes it much better and
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.429
Zestimate that makes it much better and
it makes it more accurate especially

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
it makes it more accurate especially
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.130
it makes it more accurate especially
during this initial phase of your

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140
during this initial phase of your
 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.380
during this initial phase of your
estimate which is that instead of taking

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
estimate which is that instead of taking
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.620
estimate which is that instead of taking
VT take VT divided by

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630
VT take VT divided by
 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.010
VT take VT divided by
one minus beta to the power of T where T

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020
one minus beta to the power of T where T
 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.070
one minus beta to the power of T where T
is the current data you're on so let's

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
is the current data you're on so let's
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.230
is the current data you're on so let's
take a concrete example when T is equal

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240
take a concrete example when T is equal
 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.030
take a concrete example when T is equal
to 2 1 minus Bay to the power of T is 1

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040
to 2 1 minus Bay to the power of T is 1
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.730
to 2 1 minus Bay to the power of T is 1
minus 0.98 squared and it turns out that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740
minus 0.98 squared and it turns out that
 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.930
minus 0.98 squared and it turns out that
this is 0.0 0.6 and so your estimate of

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
this is 0.0 0.6 and so your estimate of
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.310
this is 0.0 0.6 and so your estimate of
the Thames on day 2 becomes be 2 divided

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320
the Thames on day 2 becomes be 2 divided
 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.530
the Thames on day 2 becomes be 2 divided
by 0.03 9 6 and this is going to be 0.01

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
by 0.03 9 6 and this is going to be 0.01
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.510
by 0.03 9 6 and this is going to be 0.01
9 6 times theta 1 plus 0.02 Zeta 2 you

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520
9 6 times theta 1 plus 0.02 Zeta 2 you
 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.760
9 6 times theta 1 plus 0.02 Zeta 2 you
notice that these two things adds up to

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770
notice that these two things adds up to
 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.660
notice that these two things adds up to
the nominator Oh Penelope 9 6 and so

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670
the nominator Oh Penelope 9 6 and so
 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.250
the nominator Oh Penelope 9 6 and so
this becomes a weighted average of theta

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
this becomes a weighted average of theta
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.210
this becomes a weighted average of theta
1 and theta 2 and this removes this bias

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220
1 and theta 2 and this removes this bias
 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.220
1 and theta 2 and this removes this bias
so you notice that dump as T becomes

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230
so you notice that dump as T becomes
 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.960
so you notice that dump as T becomes
large beta to the T will become will

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970
large beta to the T will become will
 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.850
large beta to the T will become will
approach 0 which is why when T is large

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860
approach 0 which is why when T is large
 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.620
approach 0 which is why when T is large
enough the bias correction makes almost

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
enough the bias correction makes almost
 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.750
enough the bias correction makes almost
no difference this is why when T is

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
no difference this is why when T is
 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.850
no difference this is why when T is
large the Purple Line and the green line

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860
large the Purple Line and the green line
 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.040
large the Purple Line and the green line
you are pretty much overlap but during

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050
you are pretty much overlap but during
 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.220
you are pretty much overlap but during
this initial phase of learning when

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230
this initial phase of learning when
 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.540
this initial phase of learning when
you're still warming up with your

you're still warming up with your
 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.910
you're still warming up with your
estimate when bias correction can help

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920
estimate when bias correction can help
 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.500
estimate when bias correction can help
you to obtain a better estimate of

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
you to obtain a better estimate of
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.180
you to obtain a better estimate of
temperature and as this bias correction

temperature and as this bias correction
 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.880
temperature and as this bias correction
that helps you go from the purple line

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890
that helps you go from the purple line
 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.490
that helps you go from the purple line
to the green line so in machine learning

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500
to the green line so in machine learning
 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.920
to the green line so in machine learning
for most informations of the exponential

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930
for most informations of the exponential
 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.560
for most informations of the exponential
weighted average people don't often

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570
weighted average people don't often
 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.660
weighted average people don't often
bother to implement bias Corrections

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670
bother to implement bias Corrections
 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.790
bother to implement bias Corrections
because most people would rather just

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800
because most people would rather just
 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.800
because most people would rather just
wait that initial period and a slightly

wait that initial period and a slightly
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.930
wait that initial period and a slightly
more bias estimate and go from there but

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940
more bias estimate and go from there but
 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.760
more bias estimate and go from there but
we are concerned about the buyers during

we are concerned about the buyers during
 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.440
we are concerned about the buyers during
this initial phase while you're

the warming up or then bias Corrections
 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.430
the warming up or then bias Corrections
can help you get a better estimate early

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440
can help you get a better estimate early
 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.160
can help you get a better estimate early
on so that you now know how to implement
