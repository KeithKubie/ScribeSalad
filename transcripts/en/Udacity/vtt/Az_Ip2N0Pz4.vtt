00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.019
Okay, so I want to do, VIP tickets sold first.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.820
&gt;&gt; Okay, so. Let's see what's going on

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.480
here. We've got our master object festival, and it's

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.830
summarizing something. okay. Not much there, summarizing attendees. Oh,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.250
because it's the only thing that it's related to.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.830
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.530
&gt;&gt; Okay. And roll-up type. Count. I'm guessing that would tell me that

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.590
there were two.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.760
&gt;&gt; That would count the number of records.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.960
&gt;&gt; Okay, which is not what we want to do.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.412
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:33.330
&gt;&gt; We want to add up the number of tickets sold.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.390
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.990
&gt;&gt; Okay. This is actually making

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.290
sense. Field to Aggregate. Tickets Purchased? Yes.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.550
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.870
&gt;&gt; But only if they're VIP tickets.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.620
&gt;&gt; So what's great is at the very bottom

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.770
you can see there you can create a filter criteria.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.630
&gt;&gt; Okay. all records should, no, only records meeting certain criteria.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.090
Oh, this is easy. Field is Ticket Type.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.960
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.060
&gt;&gt; What's operator? Oh, okay, equals.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.150
And equals VIP, yeah?

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.620
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.570
&gt;&gt; Sweet.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.430
&gt;&gt; And you can do a lot of different kind of calculations, as you can

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.570
see. So, the minimum value, the maximum value,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.050
some sort of aggregate, and you can get

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.480
it to be pretty complicated with your

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.240
filters. Well that's great. So now you have

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.610
a count of your VIP tickets, but you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.560
probably want one for general admission to right?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.010
&gt;&gt; Wait, first I want to see, I want to see if this actually worked.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.440
I'm want to go to Cloudstock an see if I can, actually see this thing.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.810
Hey, it's pretty cool. Okay. Alright now, I will

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.630
do the same thing for the general admission tickets.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.160
&gt;&gt; Right
