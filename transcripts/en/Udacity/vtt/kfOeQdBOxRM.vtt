00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:03.730
(Dan) So, Rato, what have
we learned in this lesson?

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.109
(Rato) Well, I learned that I do not want 
to write databases and content providers.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.060
What did you learn in this lesson?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.980
(Dan) Well, JUnit tests are awesome,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.550
and building the back end framework 
of our apps is the most glorious of work.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.620
It's an absolutely vital part
of creating a robust app

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.480
with a great user experience.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.405
(Rato) I also learned that Dan 
cannot do an English accent.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:30.329
Fortunately, you can get ready 
to welcome back Katherine for lesson five

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.512
where we'll shatter 
our activity into fragments,

00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:35.487
use our content providers
to populate more complex UIs,

00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:39.320
and build layouts that work as well 
on tablet's as they do on phones.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.660
(Dan) Which seems like
a convenient segueway

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.840
into the history and evolution 
of Android hardware.
