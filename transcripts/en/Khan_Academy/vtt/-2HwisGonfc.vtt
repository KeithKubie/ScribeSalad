00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.033
Voiceover:Vectors A and B are drawn

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:05.800
in the interactive graph below.

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:08.966
Click to graph the terminal point of the

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.966
vector obtained by adding A and B,

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.366
who's initial point is the origin.

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.300
So we want to add A and B.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.433
So let's see.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:22.533
So vector A, we're going to
start at the tail of vector A.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.333
And so vector A takes us right over here.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
And then if we were to put
vector B, if we put it's tail

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.833
at the head of vector A,
and so essentially shift

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:35.300
vector B over like this,
we see that vector B,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.866
we're going to go in the X
direction negative three,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.933
and in the Y direction positive three.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.300
So over here you would
go in the X direction

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.633
negative three, and in the Y direction you

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:48.133
would go positive three, just like that.

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:52.766
So this right over here would
be the head of A plus B,

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:56.566
Notice vector A and then if we
were to shift vector B over,

00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:00.133
right over here, vector B
would be right over here,

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:04.033
and so A plus B would start
at the tail of vector A

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:08.400
and go to the head of
our shifted vector B.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.566
You could have done it
the other way around.

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.900
You could have said, "Oh, B plus A.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.500
"Let me just take this vector
and shift it over here,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.100
"so this vector goes
four in the positive X.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.233
"direction and one in the positive Y."

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:21.233
Four in the positive
X, one in the positive

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:23.233
Y would have gotten you to the same point.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.100
It doesn't matter whether you're

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.014
adding A plus B or B plus A.
