I don't know, I guess, I might try to add another column or

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.870
I guess another field that would be the attendee I wanted to add.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.982
&gt;&gt; So, that might make sense, but, not

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:12.610
really because we could have 10,000 attendees, right?

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.425
&gt;&gt; You're so kind.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:13.680
[LAUGH]

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.720
Okay, right, okay. So, we don't want 10,000 new columns that makes

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.970
sense. So I guess just make an entirely new object called attendee?

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.660
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.670
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.
