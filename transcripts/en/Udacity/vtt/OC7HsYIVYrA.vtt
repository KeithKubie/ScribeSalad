Whether it's the ABO enzyme that determines

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.780
blood type, the lactase protein which allows you

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.840
to digest lactose found in many dairy products,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.680
or the tyrosinase enzyme which pigments your skin,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.630
and hair, and eyes. Or any other protein.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.400
The central dogma describes how DNA, the genetic

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.920
code, is copied through an RNA intermediate. And

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.300
translated by ribosomes into proteins made of amino-acids.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, even one small change in the DNA, one

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.600
change in the genetic code, can have profound consequences

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.510
on the resulting protein. Let's take a closer look,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.590
using our example of the ABO enzyme and blood type.
