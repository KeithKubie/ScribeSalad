[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:08.540
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA: Please help
me welcome my guests for today.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.780
Deputy Legal Director of
the International Refugee

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.260
Assistance Project and
Visiting Clinical Lecturer

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.843
at Yale Law, Lara Finkbeiner.

00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:23.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.470
Hi, Lara.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.060
Good to see you.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.465
And fellow Googler and founder
of Rainbow Street, Kevin Steen.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.320
So before we start talking
about the refugee crisis,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.550
why don't you spend a
couple of minutes describing

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.060
what your organizations do
and what the goal of each

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.032
of your organizations is?

00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:46.990
LARA FINKBEINER: Great.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.486
So I guess I'll start.

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:49.610
My name is Lara Finkbeiner.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.330
I'm the deputy legal director
at the International Refugee

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.710
Assistance Project, or IRAP.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.390
IRAP is an organization that
provides free legal assistance

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.870
to refugees who are seeking
safety in third countries

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.040
like the United States,
Europe, Canada, Australia,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.967
to name a few countries.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:08.300
You guys have all seen the news.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.650
We're facing the largest
refugee crisis of modern time,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.740
and a lot of people
are stuck in countries

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.082
and still facing
ongoing persecution.

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:20.540
And because of that, they're
getting increasingly desperate

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.310
and having to risk
their lives by trying

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.040
to get on boats to reach
Europe or other places.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.770
What we're trying to do
is to provide each refugee

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.060
a lawyer in order to represent
them in legal adjudications

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.820
so they can have safe legal
passage to countries where

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.349
they have a permanent
path to safety.

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.140
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA:
What about you, Kevin?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.430
KEVIN STEEN: Well,
as Andre said,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.850
I'm the founder
of Rainbow Street.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.110
And we at Rainbow Street
are focused specifically

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.050
on housing needs and
other essential resources

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.690
for LGBT refugees in crisis
situations in the Middle East.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.530
And so you can see us as the
kind of front-line defenders

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.580
against a lot of the very
real risks of bodily harm

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.810
that refugees face, that LGBT
specifically refugees face,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.850
in countries like
Jordan and Lebanon

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.039
and other places where
it's particularly

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.069
risky to be yourself as a queer
person or a transgender person.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.860
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA:
And now let's actually

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.310
talk about the refugee crisis.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.860
And just so that everybody
is clear here, Lara,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.580
why don't you start by telling
us what exactly constitutes

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.690
a refugee?

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.160
LARA FINKBEINER: Sure.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.320
So a refugee is a person who
is being individually targeted

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.250
for reasons of race, religion,
nationality, political opinion,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.350
or membership in a
particular social group--

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.520
and that's where LGBT
refugees are included--

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.770
and are forced to flee
their country because

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.440
of that persecution and seek
safety in another country.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.010
And so right now in
the world today, there

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.200
are over 65 million
people who have

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.950
been displaced from their homes
because of war or persecution.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.910
And those people have sometimes
crossed an international border

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.680
and gone to a neighboring
country in order

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.704
to seek safety, or
sometimes they're

00:03:05.704 --> 00:03:07.370
just displaced within
their own country.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.210
And we call those people IDPs,
or Internally Displaced People.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.940
The vast majority
of those individuals

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.860
have no legal
mechanism to then get

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.810
to safety in a third
country because we only

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.760
have laws governing
people who have actually

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.460
left their country and sought
safety in a neighboring

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.720
country.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.180
So that's sort of what the legal
definition of a refugee is.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.150
I think the thing
to remember here

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.650
is that the vast majority
of these people--

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.780
this is particularly
true with LGBT people--

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.450
when they're fleeing their
country because of persecution

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.940
and going to a neighboring
country, a lot of times

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.790
are facing the same persecution
if not worse persecution

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.120
in that second country.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.495
ANDRES MUNOZ
MEDINA: So let's try

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:48.090
to put some numbers into this.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.780
So you said 65 million refugees.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.050
And I'm assuming
that most of them

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.840
tried to come to some
Western countries, especially

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.460
LGBT people.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.064
How many of them do they
actually get resettled?

00:04:03.064 --> 00:04:05.480
LARA FINKBEINER: One of the
common misconceptions I think,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.600
that people think that
refugees eventually

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.350
make it to safety in a country
like the United States.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.250
In actuality, less
than 1% of all refugees

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.519
will ever get the chance to
get resettled to a safe third

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.649
country, less than 1%.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.690
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA: The
chance to get resettled?

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.648
LARA FINKBEINER: Right.

00:04:24.648 --> 00:04:27.290
So even after they're
referred for resettlement,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.630
there's a legal adjudication
that takes place,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.210
and not all of those
refugees are accepted.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.280
So the actual number is
even smaller than that.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.940
And so, of all the people
watching this broadcast

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.920
right now, if this room
was filled with people,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.630
maybe one person in
this entire group

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.300
would actually get chosen and
referred for resettlement.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.820
So it's an incredibly
small number.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.000
What IRAP is concerned
about is that those slots

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.820
go to the most vulnerable people
given that the number of slots

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.420
are so low, and that
they have fairness

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.140
and the adjudicative process.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.264
And so that's what we focus on.

00:05:00.264 --> 00:05:02.180
And just to follow up
on that, a lot of people

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.370
ask me why is it
such a small number,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.240
why aren't more refugees
getting resettled.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.260
Refugees slots are basically
allocated by country.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.540
So every year, Western
countries come together

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.970
and say we'll give 50,000
slots for resettlement,

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.400
we'll give 10,000
slots for resettlement.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.740
Those numbers are really a
drop in the bucket compared

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.900
to the overall numbers of people
who are displaced in the world.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.460
So what we're
seeing increasingly,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.960
in particular with
the United States

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.050
now, is those
numbers are actually

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.883
getting smaller and
smaller at the same time

00:05:31.883 --> 00:05:34.280
that the crisis
is growing, which

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.960
is putting individual
lives at risk.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.510
And so that's sort
of the situation

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.950
that we're facing right now.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.366
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA: Let me
try to focus a little bit more

00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:45.090
on the subject of
LGBTQ+ refugees.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.000
So 65 million, it's the
number of total refugees.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.830
What about LGBTQ+?

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.190
How are they different from
the general population?

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.930
You said some countries sort
of try to make things fair.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.220
Is being LGBTQ+ better for you
because you are at more risk?

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.367
Is it worse for you just
because you were gay?

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:13.450
LARA FINKBEINER: I'm answer
the legal side of that

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.210
and then turn it over to
you for country conditions.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.820
One thing that I think is
really important to say first

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.030
and foremost when we're talking
about LGBT persecuted people

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.910
is that there's a
distinction between people

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.490
who make it to Western countries
and are able to seek asylum.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.070
We call those people
asylum seekers.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.390
So if you actually make
it to the United States,

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.250
you have the right
to apply for asylum

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.130
and prove that you
faced persecution.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.020
But to make it to
the United States,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.840
you have to have a visa
they go on an airplane.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.600
And for most LGBT people in
the world, that's impossible

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.750
because, to get a visa, you
have to show significant ties

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.414
to your home country.

00:06:48.414 --> 00:06:50.080
So you have to show
that you're married.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.360
You have to show you have
kids, a high-paying job,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.160
you own a house, you own a car.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.710
These are all things that
are unattainable to most

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.030
LGBT people in the world.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.090
And so that's really
an impossible task.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.580
And so because of that, we
have this refugee resettlement

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.520
scheme which is supposed to
complement our domestic asylum

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.150
scheme in allowing us to do
adjudications of refugees

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.740
who are still stuck overseas.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.460
So that's just sort
of the first hurdle.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.106
LGBT people, when
they're being persecuted,

00:07:18.106 --> 00:07:20.480
they're not really able to
get a visa and get on a plane.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.063
So what they're able
to do potentially

00:07:22.063 --> 00:07:25.310
is cross a border into
a neighboring country.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.010
And I say potentially
because there

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.310
are a lot of folks who can't
travel safely internationally

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.260
even if they're just crossing
a land border from, let's say,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.700
Lebanon to another country.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.440
They can't go through
any kind of checkpoint

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.260
because, perhaps they're
trans and their gender

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.120
marker on their
passport doesn't match

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.620
their physical presentation.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.080
And that's something that
could get them killed.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.060
And so some people are
actually literally stuck

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.337
in their country.

00:07:53.337 --> 00:07:55.420
And even if they make it
to a neighboring country,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.760
if they make it to Jordan,
if they make it to Lebanon

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.010
and from, let's
say Iraq or Syria,

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.960
they still face a
host of issues there.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.710
KEVIN STEEN: Yeah.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.584
And that's kind of where
Rainbow Street comes

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:07.660
in is, similar to
IRAP, we are trying

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.480
to focus on the most like
vulnerable of the vulnerable

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.330
cases for queer people and
trans people in these countries

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.030
where it's really, really tough
for them to live, let alone

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.560
possibly travel or seek refuge.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.430
And so we work
primarily with groups

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.440
of local activists
in Jordan and Lebanon

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.210
and surrounding
countries that are

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.330
focused on getting folks out
of life-threatening situations.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.200
Really often, we see individuals
who are facing persecution

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.429
from their own family.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.322
That's actually probably
the most prevalent concern

00:08:36.322 --> 00:08:37.780
that we have for
a lot of the folks

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.960
that we're monitoring is
they may instantaneously

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.020
enter a really life-threatening
situation if they are outed

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.640
to someone in their family.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.030
And in these places like
Jordan, for example,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.770
where there is a really
prevalent social structure

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.200
based on family ties, that
really complicates that.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.380
And so if you're going
to flee your family,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.180
it's not really a
matter of finding

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.190
a different
neighborhood to live in

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.105
or even a different city on
the other side of the country.

00:09:06.105 --> 00:09:08.230
If you're fleeing your
family because you're trans,

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.620
it means there is
a network of people

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.540
throughout the
country, many of whom

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.230
you may have never met before,
who are looking out for you.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.710
And not in a good way, but I
mean they're hunting you down.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.180
And that's the
situation that we've

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.370
helped a lot of our
refugees get out

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.700
of when they have opted to
leave the country in emergency

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.270
situations.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.860
That actually happened
just last week

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.900
with a really young
transgender woman

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.210
in Jordan who chose
to flee to Lebanon,

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.300
and IRAP and Rainbow Street
worked together to get her out

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.900
as quickly as possible.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.680
I think, though,
that so often there

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.980
is the misconception, not just
by supporters of this work

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.330
but also the beneficiaries of
Rainbow Street who are really

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.370
in these crisis situations,
that as soon as they

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.330
get to that second country that
their situation is going to be

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.105
a lot more secure or safe.

00:10:01.092 --> 00:10:02.800
It's definitely better
to be in a country

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.258
where you're not being actively
hunted down by your family,

00:10:05.258 --> 00:10:07.690
but folks who end up
in a second country

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.120
are exceptionally
vulnerable because they have

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.690
no support network whatsoever.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.360
And so that's where we activate
our resources as volunteers

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.350
at Rainbow Street,
as we're connected

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.990
to a network of activists in all
these different countries who

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.780
are trained with our
case intake protocol

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.720
to learn exactly what the
needs of these people are

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.250
and mobilize to
get them housing.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.430
And so all of our
assistance comes

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.400
in the form of cash stipends
on a monthly basis that

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.490
is designed to help people
get the housing that they need

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.397
and other services such
as medical checkups.

00:10:39.397 --> 00:10:41.980
Trans people in particular have
a whole lot of ongoing medical

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:47.800
needs that cannot be ignored,
and our activists also connect

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.870
them not just to the funding,
but also to support networks

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.950
to help them find the safe
places in these countries

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:54.550
to live.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.130
You can't just live in
any old neighborhood.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.862
And so that kind of
holistic approach

00:11:00.862 --> 00:11:02.320
I think is really,
really necessary

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.420
and really lacking
right now in a lot

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.600
of these under-resourced
countries for LGBT folks,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.130
where there just is a community
but it's pretty disjointed.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.140
And so we at Rainbow
Street are focused on

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.690
of organizing that a
little bit and channeling

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.550
some of the funds
from US donors,

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.770
grassroots donors, who
really want to help

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.630
and getting folks
off the street out

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.900
of that vulnerable situation
so that they can access groups

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.670
like IRAP.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.470
If you're on the
street, it's really hard

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.540
to be able to make
appointments and be

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.440
able to keep those
appointments if you

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.440
don't have any money for
transportation, getting

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.390
in a taxi.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.257
With the kind of assistance
that our network provides,

00:11:41.257 --> 00:11:43.340
folks can access those
resources that connect them

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.830
to their long-term support.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.700
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA:
That's great, Kevin.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.790
You mentioned something
about local organizations

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.500
that you work with,
especially in the Middle East.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.930
Do you feel that--

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.880
let me rephrase.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.120
How do you think the
local organizations are

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.680
supporting the LGBT refugees?

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.850
Are they trying
to do a good job?

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.350
Are there enough?

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.210
Obviously, probably not enough.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.310
KEVIN STEEN: Never enough.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.870
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA:
Never enough.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.286
KEVIN STEEN: There's
never enough.

00:12:14.286 --> 00:12:15.320
Good question, though.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.780
The truth is I definitely don't
know every single group that's

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.280
out there.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.154
I'm constantly learning
about new groups that

00:12:21.154 --> 00:12:23.270
have some kind of
informal support strategy

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.980
and figuring out
what I can learn

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.620
from them, what
information I can possibly

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.320
share with them from Rainbow
Street, kind of them connected

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.440
with our support
network in a way that

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.672
is secure for our volunteers.

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.130
Because you never
know who might be

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.050
trying to get more
information about them

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.400
for malicious purposes.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.107
But in general,
there's a lot more

00:12:42.107 --> 00:12:44.690
going on in the Middle East in
terms of queer rights and trans

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.740
rights.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.470
Unfortunately, not a lot of it
can be focused on policy work.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.220
In Lebanon, though,
there is a great group

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.750
called Helem that is focused
specifically on policy.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.180
There is a law in Lebanon--

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.000
I don't know if people
are familiar-- that

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.890
criminalizes same sex relations
in really ambiguous terms.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.570
And so there's like
a lot of legal space

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.980
to be able to kind of
reset that precedent.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.800
And so that's what Helem
is working on right now.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.700
They're the main legal advocacy
group that I'm aware of.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.927
Maybe you know more
on that regard, Lara?

00:13:18.927 --> 00:13:19.760
LARA FINKBEINER: No.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.430
I mean, there are
actors in this space,

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.022
but I mean Helem's been in
Lebanon for a number of years

00:13:26.022 --> 00:13:28.230
now, and they're definitely
at the forefront of this.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.980
But in general,
there is not a lot

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.486
of space for
advocacy work on this

00:13:32.486 --> 00:13:34.110
because it's just
simply too dangerous.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.280
KEVIN STEEN: Yeah.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.840
It's simply too
dangerous, exactly.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.080
And there's also the
barrier of simply not

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.160
being able to literally
register legally as an entity.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.660
And so, like in
Jordan for example,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.000
there is Rainbow Street.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.170
We have like a group of a dozen
caseworkers who meet weekly.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.255
We have office space.

00:13:52.255 --> 00:13:54.380
But we're not legally
registered as an organization

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.340
because that would be far too
dangerous to flag ourselves

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.056
to the local government.

00:14:00.056 --> 00:14:01.430
And there are
other organizations

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.980
we work with, a media
organization called

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.290
"MyKali Magazine,"
who does awesome work.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.782
They have this online magazine.

00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:08.990
Everyone should check it out.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.510
I think it's just like
My.Kali.com Maybe.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.010
Search it.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:13.910
It's amazing.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.771
They do a lot of features of
queer artists in the Middle

00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:17.270
East.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.010
They publish in
Arabic and English.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.040
They're really at the
forefront of this.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.790
And Rainbow Street
gets a lot of referrals

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.960
from folks who contact
MyKali looking for support

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.810
for themselves as a queer person
who may be facing persecution,

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.940
or maybe just needs community.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.340
There are also a lot of just
informal housing networks.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.890
Especially within
the trans community

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.440
we see a lot of trans women
banding together and being

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.760
able to identify friends of
friends who are able to offer

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.920
a room on a short-term basis.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.170
And part of our work
at Rainbow Street

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.910
is really trying to
organize that network

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.760
in a way that does not
increase the amount of risk

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.230
that people are in.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.300
Because as you can
imagine, the more you

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.860
share with others about
these networks, the more risk

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.400
you're in of being discovered
by local authorities.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.610
And so we are constantly
meeting new groups

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.410
of just informal
activist networks

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.740
who are working together to
secure housing and provide food

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.680
for people and trying to really
bring them into the folds

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.210
and organize it as
much as it needs

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.480
to be organized in order to have
more resources to refer people

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.650
to.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.030
So most of Rainbow Street's
work is in Jordan and Lebanon,

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.730
and so that's kind of like
where my knowledge lies.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.040
But I'm constantly
learning about new groups.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.050
One for example
in Tunis, Tunisia,

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.960
called Dumge that is
currently assisting us

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.060
with a case, a trans
man who just moved

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.390
from Algeria to Tunis,
who is just kind

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.480
of like starting over and
registering as a refugee

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.770
and getting on the track
to eventual resettlement.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.679
And that's a great
example of a group

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:55.470
that I had not heard
of until very recently

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.830
but is extremely well
equipped to mobilize and get

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.710
this person help resources,
psychological support,

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.374
community support,
housing, stipend for food,

00:16:03.374 --> 00:16:05.540
mobile phone-- that's one
thing you need immediately

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.248
when you get in country,
and often people

00:16:07.248 --> 00:16:09.770
have to trash their
old phones because who

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.050
knows who has that number.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.570
And so I've been
really encouraged.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.175
As I've done this work
since like 2014 or so,

00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:18.800
there are always more
groups popping up

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.250
that kind of identify
themselves as soon as we

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.130
are in a crisis situation and
need support in a new location.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.650
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA: We all
know that our dear President

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:33.170
Trump is trying to
pass this ban, travel

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.610
ban, executive order.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.540
How bad is it?

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.460
How much does it affect
the refugee program in US

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:46.760
in legal terms for a refugee
that is trying to come here?

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.930
LARA FINKBEINER: Yeah.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.690
The executive order has
had a devastating effect.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.970
I think one thing that
hasn't been told in the media

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.790
is much as we hear a lot
about these six countries

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.460
where there's a visa ban.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.390
But actually, the
executive order

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.180
also completely shuts down
all refugee processing.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.109
So that applies to refugees
from every country in the world,

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.060
not just a set of countries.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.524
And I won't go into the whole
history, the legal history.

00:17:13.524 --> 00:17:15.190
You guys have probably
seen in the news.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.869
There's all kinds of court
decisions coming out.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.720
So I'll just skip to what
the current status is,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.569
is that the ban is
actually in effect.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:24.950
After the Supreme
Court decision,

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.700
the ban went into effect
with some limitations.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.730
Right now, refugees are
not coming to this country

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.290
unless they can show they
have a bonafide tie to a US

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.350
person or a US entity.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.640
What does that mean?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.950
We're still fighting
about that in court.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.190
The one thing resolved is that
if you have US family here,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.380
then you're allowed to come in.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.080
That's not a great solution
for most LGBT refugees

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.991
because they may have fled
persecution from their family.

00:17:53.991 --> 00:17:55.490
They may have
strained relationships

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.240
with their family.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.130
Or they may just not
have family here.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.660
And so for example, a couple of
weeks ago, one of our clients

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.810
told his story in
"The New York Times."

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.770
He's an LGBT refugee
from Iraq who

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.490
was tortured by his
father for years.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.610
And then ISIS basically
started to take over his town,

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.470
and he had to flee for his life.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.760
And so he went to Turkey
where, actually, things

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.490
are getting increasingly
worse for LGBT folks there.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.637
They've banned Pride for
the last three years.

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:25.970
KEVIN STEEN: With water cannons.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.470
LARA FINKBEINER:
With water cannons.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.910
Relatively recently, a
Syrian refugee, LGBT refugee,

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.920
was decapitated by a militia.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.524
So obviously his life
is in danger there.

00:18:39.524 --> 00:18:41.690
He was lucky enough to get
referred for a settlement

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.090
through the entire
US adjudication,

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.090
was accepted right before
the executive order came out.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.240
And since then, it's just been
a series of getting his hopes up

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.130
once we get a victory
in court and then

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.730
having his hopes let down.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.030
And in this article, what
he talks about is that,

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.610
after everything that he's
been through in his life,

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.830
the most devastating
thing that happened to him

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.740
has been this executive order
and having literally his travel

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.830
date, which is just like his
glimpse at a safe future,

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.240
snatched away from him.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.520
And so it really is truly
affecting individual lives.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.380
And even though this
is supposed to be

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.560
only a 120-day
suspension, 120 days

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.680
is literally life or
death for some people.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.970
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA: This
fear, it's unfortunately not

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:26.660
only in US.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.110
We've seen a lot of
countries in Europe

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.810
are also turning
into this nationalist

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.880
and trying to close
their borders.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:41.260
So how are we doing as a country
compared to everybody else,

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.930
I guess?

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.240
LARA FINKBEINER: That's
a really tough question.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.610
So traditionally, the
US has actually always

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.510
been the largest
resettlement country.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.660
So we accept more
resettled refugees

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.660
than all the other
countries combined.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.470
But that program is--

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.970
we set the number
every single year,

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.910
and that number is
set by the president.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.930
And that happens around this
time every year, October.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.740
And so we're hoping to continue
to be a leader in refugee

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.180
resettlement, particularly for
persecuted LGBT individuals.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.910
But you know, everything is
sort of in jeopardy right now.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.860
And now is the time
that people really

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.860
need to stand up and show
their support for this program.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.650
This program has
been run for years.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.510
The refugees that come
through this program

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:32.390
are vetted by 11 different
government agencies,

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.050
including the CIA, FBI,
Department of Defense,

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.940
before they even come to the US.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.284
Refugees are the most
heavily-vetted group

00:20:39.284 --> 00:20:41.200
of individuals that come
to the United States.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.600
And so we've put
so many resources

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.960
into ensuring that the
program is safe in order

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.600
to keep this really,
really valuable

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.110
and vital lifeline
available to individuals.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:58.120
And so I would say, to
answer your question,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.980
refugees all over
the world are facing

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.550
sort of unprecedented attacks.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.530
And a lot of it is based
on misunderstanding,

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.520
misinformation.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.960
The US is one of
those countries.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.490
The executive order has had
a really terrible effect,

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.710
but I'm still
hopeful, especially

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.850
given all of the response
to the executive order

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:22.510
by the American public, that
we can ensure that we remain

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.550
a country that welcomes
others, particularly

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.940
people who have been
persecuted for who they are.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.500
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA: So now, I
think the question that we all

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.450
want to know, what can we do?

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.160
I mean, it sounds really grim.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.860
We're just people, right?

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.485
What can we do?

00:21:41.485 --> 00:21:42.401
LARA FINKBEINER: Yeah.

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:43.012
I know.

00:21:43.012 --> 00:21:44.470
Sometimes I hate
giving these talks

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.570
because the situation does sound
really dire, but we at IRAP

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.270
are still hopeful.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:56.365
Every week we get the news that
one client or a few clients

00:21:56.365 --> 00:21:58.740
make it to safety and are able
to start their lives over.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.350
Some of our cases that
we've worked on together

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.480
have made it to countries
and are flourishing there.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.450
And so we still have
the ability to make

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.950
a difference in an
individual life,

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.950
and I think that's really
important to remember.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.630
Because sometimes you see
this number, 65 million,

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.690
and it seems really overwhelming
and hard to sort of feel

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.340
tangible.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.190
But it's still 65 million
individual stories

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.410
and 65 million individual lives.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.880
So there's a lot of room
to affect individual lives.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.330
If there are any lawyers
who are watching this,

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.220
IRAP actually works with
a really vast network

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.120
of volunteer lawyers
and law students.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.002
We have something like over
600 active cases right now even

00:22:39.002 --> 00:22:40.710
though we're a small
organization because

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.505
of our vast volunteer network.

00:22:42.505 --> 00:22:44.880
And so if anyone is interested
in volunteering their time

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.770
to work on an
individual case, please

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.720
feel free to reach out to us.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.930
Secondly, donations.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.700
Even a small amount
of money can make

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.890
a huge difference for people.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.510
Sometimes we have clients who
are kicked out on the street,

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.510
but they have a resettlement
date in three weeks

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.290
and they just need a hotel
room for three weeks.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.780
So they need a place to
stay just for a few weeks.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.230
A few hundred dollars can
save that person's life.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.840
And so donate to groups,
especially-- groups

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.600
like Rainbow Street can make a
huge difference for a person.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.530
And then I'll say,
thirdly, I guess

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.840
one of my missions in life,
this year in particular,

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:30.710
is for people to understand
that refugees are an LGBT issue,

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.429
and to make that part of the
conversation in our community.

00:23:33.429 --> 00:23:34.970
And particularly,
when you're talking

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.400
to people who maybe don't know
that much about the process

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.630
or don't know that much about
what LGBT refugees go through,

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.660
it's really important
to sort of dispel rumors

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.702
and to talk about individual
stories that you've heard of.

00:23:47.702 --> 00:23:49.160
And if you have
any other questions

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.701
or you want to talk
to me afterwards,

00:23:50.701 --> 00:23:52.110
I'm happy to chat as well.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.982
But we really rely
on people like you

00:23:53.982 --> 00:23:55.940
to sort of spread the
word within our community

00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.290
because we are stronger
when we stand together.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.620
IRAP was the group that
basically started the airport

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.050
response after the
executive order.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.400
We foresaw that there
was going to be an issue.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.290
We had two clients who were
on planes that landed at JFK

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.720
two hours after the
executive order was signed.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.340
And we put out a
call to attorneys

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.910
to come to the airports.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.530
And I think we are
expecting maybe we'll get

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.840
10 people to show up at JFK.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.960
Certainly didn't expect hundreds
of attorneys and protesters

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.620
to converge on airports
all around the country.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.290
That made a difference from it
being a small issue where maybe

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.260
we got a couple of clients
out, to leading to momentum

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.530
to then address the
executive order in courts,

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.020
and win, and get
clients to safety.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.262
So we really are
stronger together,

00:24:44.262 --> 00:24:46.220
and I think it's a really
important time for us

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.260
to come together as a
community and to advocate

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.080
on these folks' behalf.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.640
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA: Kevin,
want to add anything to that?

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.990
KEVIN STEEN: I mean, I love
everything that you just said,

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.830
Lara.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.280
And I just love IRAP for
starting that response that

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.650
was able to really help
people in crisis situations

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.340
that they had no idea that
they were about to land in.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:10.356
I think, in addition to
everything that Lara said,

00:25:10.356 --> 00:25:12.230
there are a couple of
narratives that I think

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.272
are worth kind of engaging
with in our popular culture,

00:25:15.272 --> 00:25:16.730
and some of them
are really, really

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:20.720
well intentioned, which provides
an awesome opportunity to kind

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.200
of work in a little bit of
education for our community.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.440
And by our community I mean
the LGBT and allied community.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.950
Because like you said,
Lara, systems of oppression

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.690
all benefit from one another.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.120
And by dismantling
oppression in one form,

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.010
we are definitely
providing more space

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.546
for liberation for queer
people and trans people.

00:25:39.546 --> 00:25:41.420
So I think the first
thing that comes to mind

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:48.410
is changing the narrative around
the situation for LGBT people

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.385
in the Middle East
in particular,

00:25:50.385 --> 00:25:52.010
since that's where
Rainbow Street works

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.990
and where my expertise is.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.680
It's really, really easy to
fall into the trap of discussing

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.260
LGBT issues in the Middle East
and in doing so inadvertently

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.630
painting Islam as an inherently
homophobic system of belief,

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.890
which is a myth,
depending on who you ask.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.641
But kind of a lot of
different religions

00:26:13.641 --> 00:26:15.140
or a lot of different
social groups,

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.139
there are so many ways
to understand that issue.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.750
I've definitely seen some
super well-intentioned folks

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.480
look to Islam or look
to organized religion

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.987
as a source of these problems.

00:26:27.987 --> 00:26:30.320
And I think that that can be
really unhelpful, actually,

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.250
because we're at a period where
xenophobia and Islamophobia is

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.310
really, really fueling
this anti-refugee sentiment

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.460
that we're seeing.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.190
And so I really think
it's very important

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.170
to sort of engage
with those questions

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.540
and look to the groups
who identify as Muslim

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.450
and are in these countries
helping each other out

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.280
as evidence that this is
not a cut-and-dry issue.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.770
This is not an Islamic issue or
a Middle East can't figure it

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.000
out kind of issue.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.240
There are activist communities
who are working independently

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.670
out there, and I know a lot
of them and work with them

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.120
on a daily basis.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.420
So I think being
able to really speak

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.520
to that is an
important conversation

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.960
for us to have as a community.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.710
And I think, in terms
of discussing ways

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.310
that we can help, so often
like lots of people--

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.020
I live in the San
Francisco Bay Area,

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.582
and I imagine it's similar here
in New York, I'm not sure--

00:27:20.582 --> 00:27:22.040
there are a lot of
great groups who

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.660
are focused on
refugee resettlement,

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.440
and a lot of LGBT
groups who are providing

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.325
funds and other kinds of
resources, volunteer time,

00:27:30.325 --> 00:27:32.450
to connecting with refugees
who have been resettled

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.380
in the United States.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.810
And you need a support
network, and that

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.141
is so necessary and
like totally do not

00:27:38.141 --> 00:27:39.890
mean to undermine that
at all because that

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:41.205
needed to keep happening.

00:27:41.205 --> 00:27:43.580
But often, I've found that
the conversation kind of stops

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.270
there.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.540
And that by providing these
resources for queer people

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.140
or trans people who have
been resettled in country,

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.857
people may not be able
to see beyond and look

00:27:54.857 --> 00:27:56.690
at these numbers that
Lara was talking about

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.210
and see the assistance
that's really

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.940
needed in first or
second countries

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.040
before people are resettled,
or maybe folks who

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.170
are eligible to be resettled.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:10.980
So as a queer community,
as an LGBT community,

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.962
I think that we really
enjoy a lot of benefits

00:28:14.962 --> 00:28:16.670
from living in the
society that we're in.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.253
You were just telling
me this earlier,

00:28:18.253 --> 00:28:20.840
Andres, and I really want
to echo the sentiment.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.379
I feel so grateful to be where
I am in the United States

00:28:23.379 --> 00:28:24.920
at this point in
history, where there

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.110
are a lot of fights
ahead of us, but we

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.120
can have these conversations.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.140
And I personally feel like
it's time for us as a community

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.160
to pay it forward.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.290
And I am really, really
encouraged to see

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:40.160
people who are donating to
groups like Rainbow Street,

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.230
but also other
groups like IRAP who

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.425
have specific LGBT
kind of programming

00:28:44.425 --> 00:28:46.550
and are helping people get
out of these situations.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.860
Because this is an
international issue,

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.870
and it requires an
international response.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:54.750
And so while we focus on
our local communities,

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.560
we need to not let that stop
us from looking beyond that.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.250
And so, of course
donations are great.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.660
Rainbow Street is
all grassroots.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.850
We've got a little
donation booth over there

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:06.100
if you're here in person.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.190
And for IRAP, as well.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.010
I know that we're accepting
donations for IRAP over there.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:13.144
As a Googler, I give every
month to both organizations

00:29:13.144 --> 00:29:14.060
and that gets matched.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.410
So something to think about.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.410
The other thing is, at
least for Rainbow Street,

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.860
I can speak to the need for
volunteers to give your time.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.830
We definitely rely on
a network of volunteers

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.130
who are in country and can
provide the services that

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.350
are really crucial for
these LGBT refugees

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.120
and internally-displaced people.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.490
But we also just need
to get the word out here

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.110
in the United States
about why this

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.790
is an international
issue, why it

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.040
should be important
to the LGBT community.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.170
And sometimes that looks
like volunteer time

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.400
at a tabling event.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.910
Sometimes that looks like
dedicating your social media

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.580
page to this for a while, which,
like, actually gets people

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.210
to look at it.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:54.930
And as much as you can scoff
at social media, it does help.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.440
And we need people
to help us research,

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.560
too, different situations
with different countries.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.260
And so that, as we respond
to the needs of refugees

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.520
or other folks who
get in touch with us,

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.210
we can make informed
decisions about like, OK,

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.720
who is providing XYZ
resources in this locale?

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.690
Who can we begin to work
with in this new locale?

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.810
And so if any Google
employees in the audience

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:21.650
are interested in being a
part of any of those efforts,

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.670
it's not all tabling.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.070
A lot of it is kind
of like research

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.180
and coordinating for the
more introverted among us.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.530
Get in touch with me.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.350
You know who I am.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.640
And there is a
volunteer listserv,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.810
Rainbow Street volunteers,
I think it is, at Google.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.510
If you're tuning in externally,
visit our website site

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.620
Rainbow-Street.org.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.450
That's Rainbow dash Street.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.360
And we have a volunteer
portal for you

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.444
to sign in and say
that you're interested,

00:30:49.444 --> 00:30:51.110
and we'll be in touch
as soon as there's

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.790
an opportunity in your area.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.580
If you're feeling really
proactive, email me.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.350
There's an info@rainbowstreet.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.210
That will go to someone
at Rainbow Street.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:00.980
And we can talk about
an event that you

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.440
may have in mind or any
other kind of project.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.830
We're very grassroots.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.372
We really depend on
the awesome ideas

00:31:06.372 --> 00:31:07.788
of people who get
in touch with us

00:31:07.788 --> 00:31:09.540
and really want to
share in this movement.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.750
So I'm definitely willing
to listen and work

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.649
with you on that, too.

00:31:13.649 --> 00:31:15.440
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA:
Well, thank you, guys.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.231
Now is the time, if
you have any questions,

00:31:18.231 --> 00:31:20.480
please use the microphones
if you want to ask anything

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.920
to Lara or Kevin.

00:31:29.292 --> 00:31:30.500
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Pat.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.140
I work here on Google Maps.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.990
So I guess my question is,
a lot of the conversation

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.850
is focused around
the Middle East.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:41.480
Are there any scenarios
happening outside of the Middle

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.872
East that you work with--

00:31:42.872 --> 00:31:44.330
I think you said
for Rainbow Street

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.820
you're specifically focused
on Lebanon and Jordan--

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:51.200
but anything that we should
know about issues outside

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.990
of that part of the
world, especially

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.054
I guess with the recent
news coming out of Chechnya?

00:31:57.054 --> 00:31:57.970
LARA FINKBEINER: Yeah.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.851
So IRAP, I say we're Middle
East focused because that's

00:32:00.851 --> 00:32:02.850
primarily where the
majority of our clients are,

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:06.530
but we provide almost all
of our assistance remotely.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:10.130
And so we work with folks
all around the world.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.500
And I'll speak about
Chechnya in just a moment,

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.510
but I guess the thing
I would emphasize here

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.070
is a lot of what we're talking
about in the Middle East

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.960
plays out in all these different
regions around the world.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.390
Whether you're
fleeing from Uganda

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.980
to a neighboring
country, or if you're

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.590
trying to leave Chechnya and
go to a neighboring country,

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.600
again, even crossing
an international border

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.627
doesn't necessarily make
you safe as an LGBT person.

00:32:30.627 --> 00:32:32.210
And actually, I talk
about this a lot,

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.230
but I actually think
there needs to be

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.870
a lot more sort of direct
pipelines from your country

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:40.220
of origin to a safe country if
you're LGBT because sometimes

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.840
you're even safer
in your own country

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.298
because you might have some
networks or some people you can

00:32:44.298 --> 00:32:46.100
rely on if things
go really south,

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.590
or maybe you continue
working and making an income.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.381
All of those things
are taken away from you

00:32:50.381 --> 00:32:51.970
when you flee your country.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.950
But it's basically playing
out all over the world.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.622
Most of the hotspots where
you see LGBT persecution,

00:32:58.622 --> 00:33:00.830
things are not a lot better
in neighboring countries,

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:04.500
which are the only places
that can really access.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.610
In regards to
Chechnya, the situation

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.920
has gotten a lot
of attention, which

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.650
has been really important.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:16.250
We actually have seen a
number of countries step up,

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.040
and we've gotten
some folks to safety

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.330
in other European countries.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.913
And we're in talks of trying to
help people come to the United

00:33:22.913 --> 00:33:23.820
States as well.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.390
So there actually has
been an encouraging sort

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.550
of international
response to that,

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:33.290
which is really great
because what's going on there

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.030
right now is just deplorable.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:37.280
So yeah, to answer your
question, we are definitely

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.321
are involved in other
areas of the world as well.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.750
KEVIN STEEN: I think for Rainbow
Street, as you mentioned,

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.190
we are particularly focused
on Arabic-speaking countries

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.590
because the genesis
of Rainbow Street

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.620
started with some connections
I made when I visited Jordan

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.290
at one point, and a close
friend of mine who ended up

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.940
in this life-threatening
situation,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.980
and a complete absence
of any services

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.386
like this in the region.

00:34:02.386 --> 00:34:04.760
So I can't really speak to a
lot of the services that are

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.020
available in
non-Arabic-speaking countries,

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.050
but again I've been really,
really encouraged to see groups

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.040
like--

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.110
I think the Russian
LGBT Network has really

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.060
stepped up and taken
a lot of the kind

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:24.590
of front-line load of
these folks out of Chechnya

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:25.580
who need support.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.260
And of course, IRAP and
a lot of other countries

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.701
who've been resettling
folks on an emergency basis.

00:34:32.701 --> 00:34:34.409
ANDRES MUNOZ MEDINA:
Any other questions?

00:34:37.354 --> 00:34:38.770
Well, like Kevin
said, we're going

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:42.070
to have a couple of
donation stations over there

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.469
if you wish to donate.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:47.739
It will be deducted
from your payroll

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.540
and will be matched by Google.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.090
So yay.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.660
Otherwise, please help me
thank our guests today.

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:59.310
