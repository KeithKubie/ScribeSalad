00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.180
If our game players are looking for
a freemium game,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.370
we still want to include them
in our monetization strategy.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.650
How do we do that?

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.630
&gt;&gt; To monetize all our players,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.990
we can use ads which make small amounts
of money each time they are displayed.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.960
&gt;&gt; Ads have become more and more common
in game apps in the past few years, and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.890
the revenue they generate
has increased every year.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.080
&gt;&gt; That's great, but

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.140
what kind of profit can an individual
developer expect to get from these ads?

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.580
&gt;&gt; Well, a typical profit for every
thousand ads shown is about two dollars,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.325
so to really make a profit from ads
you need to display a lot of them.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:39.415
&gt;&gt; But remember, not by overwhelming
your players with constant ads, but

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:43.755
by showing a few of them to lots and
lots of players.

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:46.375
&gt;&gt; Let's look at the different types
of ads that game developers use.
