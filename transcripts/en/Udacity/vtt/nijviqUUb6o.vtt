00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Norvig] And the answer is 20 billion. How do you do that back of the envelope?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
5 factorial is 120. Let's just round that off to 100.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
100 to the 5th--that's 5 times 2--is 10 digits, so that works out to 10 billion.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And we rounded down to get from 120 to 100, so we should round back up,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and maybe it's somewhere around 20 billion.

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It turns out that the actual number is 24.9 billion, approximately, so that's not a bad estimate.
