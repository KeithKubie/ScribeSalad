10 Things You Didn't Know About Superhero
Villains

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.600
Comic book superheroes are some of the most
popular characters in fiction.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.420
Batman, Superman, the Avengers, the X-Men
and the Fantastic Four are just some of the

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.420
kind of examples we're referring to when we
say that.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.250
But, of course, superheroes wouldn't be what
they are without an antithesis - and they

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.540
come in the form of supervillains.Supervillains
are actually some of the most interesting

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.210
and complex characters going.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.362
Their motives for being evil, their aesthetic
qualities, and their powers and abilities

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:30.269
vary to the extent that no two are truly the
same - and some are every bit as popular as

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.470
their heroic counterparts as a result.They've
transcended the comic book genre, along with

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.470
the heroes they antagonise, to appear in movies,
television shows, video games and various

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.470
other media platforms.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.470
But exactly how much do you know about them?

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.000
We think there are some facts about the best
supervillains out there that might just surprise

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
you.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.510
Here are ten things you didn't know about
some of your favourite superhero's villains.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.510
Harley Quinn
Given that she's become one of the most recognisable

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.900
and popular characters in comic books over
the past few years, it might come as something

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.550
of a surprise to you to learn that Harley
Quinn's origins weren't in paper form.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.652
The Joker's girlfriend - who will be played
by the gorgeous Margot Robbie in the upcoming

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:55.809
Suicide Squad movie - actually started life
as the Clown Prince of Crime's animated accomplice

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.089
in the "Joker's Favor" episode of Batman:
The Animated Series back in 1992.

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.989
She has since gone on to appear in nearly
1000 comics and we really can't wait to see

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.530
Robbie's take on the character in the coming
weeks.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.080
Deadshot
Deadshot is the Suicide Squad member with

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.080
the perfect aim.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080
He's an extraordinary marksman who will be
portrayed by Will Smith in the upcoming movie

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080
about the aforementioned team.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.720
Something you might not know about the character
in the comic books, however, is that he actually

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.211
has a death wish - and that makes the Suicide
Squad the perfect team for him.

00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:19.890
He accidentally killed his own brother and
was plagued by feelings of self-loathing and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.000
guilt as a result.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.830
Consequently, he sought out a spectacular
death of his own - although he never did so

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.560
without putting up a fight, but the fact is
he wants to die and puts no value on his own

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.360
life whatsoever.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.036
Enchantress
Enchantress is a villainess who will be portrayed

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:35.090
by Cara Delevingne in the upcoming Suicide
Squad movie but, in the comic books, she has

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.450
actually been a member of several superhero
teams.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.829
These teams have included the Justice League
Dark, the Shadowpact and the Sentinels of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.149
Magic - and they are all essentially mystical
versions of teams like the Justice League

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.079
and Justice Society, brought together to deal
specifically with supernatural threats.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.760
Her allies on these teams have included characters
as versatile as the likes of Blue Devil, Deadman,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.360
Detective Chimp, John Constantine, Madame
Xanadu, Nightmaster, Nightshade, Ragman, Warlock's

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.170
Daughter and Zauriel, and they have collectively
fought against powerful supernatural beings

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.860
like the Spectre.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.549
Steppenwolf
It was recently announced that Steppenwolf

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.480
will be the main villain in the upcoming Justice
League movie, after deleted footage from Batman

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.560
v Superman: Dawn of Justice emerged showing
the character in cahoots with Lex Luthor.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.560
But who is he?

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.730
Very few people have ever even heard of the
character, so let's just give you the basics

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.441
about this guy; For starters, he's Darkseid's
uncle - yes, that Darkseid's uncle - and he

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.790
possesses almost as much power as his nephew.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.930
He's also the leader of the military on the
New Gods' planet of Apokolips, leading armies

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.620
of Apokoliptian soldiers, Parademons and dog-like
beasts into battle.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.970
He is not to be trifled with and he will make
an excellent villain in the DC Extended movie

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.970
universe.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.629
Apocalypse
The X-Men villain known as Apocalypse was

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.790
once a man called En Sabah Nur - that's something
most people know, thanks to 2016's X-Men:

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.349
Apocalypse - but what most people don't know
is that En Sabah Nur was actually a member

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.090
of the organisation that was a precursor to
S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.909
That's right, the ancient organisation that
would become the Strategic Hazard Intervention

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.620
Espionage Logistics Directorate (or the Strategic
Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.989
Division if you're a Marvel Cinematic Universe
fan) was called the Brotherhood of Shield

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.550
and actually had En Sabah Nur amongst its
ranks.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.379
Other members of the group included important
historical figures like Leonardo da Vinci,

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.280
Isaac Newton, Archimedes, Galileo Galilei
and Zhang Heng - and they were the first group

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.500
to ever send Galactus packing when he first
attempted to devour Marvel's Earth.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.350
Doctor Doom
Marvel Comics are often criticised for copying

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.569
characters.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.080
Thanos was based on DC's Metron and Darkseid,
Deadpool was based on DC's Deadshot and Moon

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.810
Knight was based on DC's Batman, for example,
but Marvel's most iconic villain actually

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.180
had one of the most iconic villains in all
of fiction based on him.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.310
We're referring to Doctor Doom AKA Victor
Von Doom, and none other than Star Wars villain

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.959
Darth Vader was based on the character.

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.580
From his scars to his armour, and from the
initials of his name to his treatment of those

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.380
he considers inferior to himself, Vader's
creators blatantly used Doom as one the influences

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.380
of his creation.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.010
It's just a shame that Doom hasn't been treated
as well on the big screen as Vader, as every

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.730
Fantastic Four movie he's been in has been
terrible!

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.610
Loki
Tom Hiddleston has made Loki a household name

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.349
with his brilliant performances as the God
of Mischief in the Thor movies and The Avengers

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.810
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but even
those who know the character from the comics

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.800
associate him solely with being an adult male
- but that hasn't always been the case.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.750
Loki has spent time as both a female and a
small child in the modern comic book era,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.790
due to the nature of Asgardian reincarnation.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.909
And while there has been an actual female
Loki because of how that all works, the villain's

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.040
essence has also spent time inhabiting the
bodies of both Lady Sif and the Scarlet Witch

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.620
- so Loki really is no stranger to living
life as a woman.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.640
Lex Luthor
Lex Luthor is the arch-enemy of the most iconic

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.090
superhero in comic books - Superman himself.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.990
With that in mind, you probably think he's
all villain - something that Gene Hackman,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.760
Kevin Spacey and Jesse Eisenberg will have
implanted in your minds, no doubt - but that's

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.150
not actually the case at all.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.670
In fact, in 2014, in The New 52 rebooted continuity,
Lex Luthor joined DC's most celebrated superhero

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.570
team - the Justice League.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.910
It happened after he saved Superman's life
by removing a piece of Kryptonite from his

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.470
brain - and Luthor went on to build a new
watchtower for the team and recruited the

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.070
powerful Shazam to their ranks.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.540
Thanos
Thanos is an incredibly powerful cosmic villain

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.470
from the pages of Marvel comic books.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.410
Able to take on entire teams of Avengers on
his own, the villain also known as the Mad

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.150
Titan has been picked to be the big-bad in
the ever-popular Marvel Cinematic Universe,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.150
having first appeared in the mid-credits scene
of 2012's The Avengers.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.320
But, in spite of his enormous power, did you
know that he's responsible for some of the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.200
lamest moments in comic book history?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.800
Let's run through a handful; First of all,
he owned the worst vehicle ever seen in a

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.070
comic book - a helicopter known as the Thanos-copter.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.030
Second of all, he was arrested by a group
of cops.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.010
A group of normal Earth cops.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.110
And finally, he was defeated by Squirrel Girl.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.570
A mutant with Squirrel-like powers.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.350
Thanos doesn't seem so scary now, huh?

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.200
The Joker
The Joker is now the most iconic comic book

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.311
villain of all time and is, arguably, right
up there with any other villain in fiction

00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:29.860
in terms of his cultural status - but that
wasn't always the plan for the character.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.890
In fact, Batman's arch-enemy was actually
supposed to be killed off in his first appearance.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.931
That was in Batman #1 in 1940, but the comic's
editor saw something in the Clown Prince of

00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:39.931
Gotham that made him keep him alive.

00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:43.880
The rest, as they say, is history, and the
character has gone on to appear on countless

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.390
media platforms, with Jared Leto set to follow
in the footsteps of Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.970
and Heath Ledger by bringing the character
to life on the big screen in this year's Suicide

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.130
Squad movie.
