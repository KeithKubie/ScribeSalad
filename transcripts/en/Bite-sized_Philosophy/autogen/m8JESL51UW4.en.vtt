it seems to me that the way that you

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740
it seems to me that the way that you

the issue it seems to me is how you act
and I was thinking about this intensely

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
and I was thinking about this intensely
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.560
and I was thinking about this intensely
when I was thinking about Nietzsche and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
when I was thinking about Nietzsche and
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.850
when I was thinking about Nietzsche and
Dostoyevsky because of course you know

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
Dostoyevsky because of course you know
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.370
Dostoyevsky because of course you know

that Nietzsche was the philosopher who
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080
that Nietzsche was the philosopher who
announced the death of God right and who

triumphant proclamation even though it's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
triumphant proclamation even though it's
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.190
triumphant proclamation even though it's
often read that way and don't niches

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200
often read that way and don't niches
 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.780

inclusion from that from the death of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790

inclusion from that from the death of
God the fact that our ethical systems

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
God the fact that our ethical systems
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.539
God the fact that our ethical systems
were going to collapse when the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549
were going to collapse when the
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.039
were going to collapse when the
foundation was pulled out from

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
foundation was pulled out from
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:43.760
foundation was pulled out from
underneath them

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770

he believed that human beings would have

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
he believed that human beings would have
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270
he believed that human beings would have
to find their own values to create their

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
to find their own values to create their
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.370
to find their own values to create their
own values and there's a problem with

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
own values and there's a problem with
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.780
own values and there's a problem with
that because it doesn't seem that this

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
that because it doesn't seem that this
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.539
that because it doesn't seem that this
is something Carl Jung was very thorough

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
is something Carl Jung was very thorough
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.010
is something Carl Jung was very thorough
and investigating it doesn't really look

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
and investigating it doesn't really look
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990
and investigating it doesn't really look
like people are capable of creating

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
like people are capable of creating
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730
like people are capable of creating
their own values because you're not

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
their own values because you're not
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130
their own values because you're not
really capable of molding yourself just

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
really capable of molding yourself just
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.050
really capable of molding yourself just
any old way you want to be like you have

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
any old way you want to be like you have
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700
any old way you want to be like you have
a nature that you have to contend with

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
a nature that you have to contend with
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.389
a nature that you have to contend with
and so it isn't a matter of creating our

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
and so it isn't a matter of creating our
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.680
and so it isn't a matter of creating our
own values because we don't have that

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
own values because we don't have that
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.229
own values because we don't have that
capacity it might be a matter of

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239
capacity it might be a matter of
 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.910
capacity it might be a matter of
rediscovering those values which is what

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
rediscovering those values which is what
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.270
rediscovering those values which is what
human was attempting to do now and and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
human was attempting to do now and and
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.860
human was attempting to do now and and
and so I think Nietzsche was actually

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
and so I think Nietzsche was actually
 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.839
and so I think Nietzsche was actually
profoundly wrong in that in that

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849
profoundly wrong in that in that
 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.309
profoundly wrong in that in that
recommendation I think he was

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
recommendation I think he was
 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.729
recommendation I think he was
psychologically wrong now you know

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739
psychologically wrong now you know
 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.280
psychologically wrong now you know

somewhat miraculous in some sense it's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860
somewhat miraculous in some sense it's
 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.400
somewhat miraculous in some sense it's
it's quite uncanny Dostoyevsky was

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
it's quite uncanny Dostoyevsky was
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.350
it's quite uncanny Dostoyevsky was
obviously a literary figure well whereas
