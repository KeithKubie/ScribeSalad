00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.409
Today, I brought you out to the mountains because a lot of you have been asking how to make charcoal and so today

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.410
I'm going to show you a really [easy] way to do it

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.950
Let's get started. now charcoal may not seem that sexy of a thing to make but it's actually very

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.610
Valuable we buy it in bags usually for grilling for summertime cooking

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.799
But it's also used for melting metals with the mini metal foundry some medical applications use it for extracting

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.229
Poisons out of your stomach, and you swallow something wrong

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.199
It's used in Air filters water filters and pyrotechnics for making black powder, so it's very versatile substance

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.659
and it's very easy to make now all you need to get started is some kind of a steel can like coffee can or a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.239
Tuna can even a can of beans will work

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.558
I just went to the paint section of home Depot got one of these [1] quart paint cans. You can see it's empty

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.180
It's about two and a half dollars

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.930
But while you're there you may as well pick up some of these paint stir sticks as well

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.520
they're completely free you can usually get about as many as you want and these are what we're going to be using to make the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.089
Charcoal itself now these paint sticks are obviously too long to fit in there by themselves

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.870
So we need to break them into smaller pieces

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.300
But the idea is to shove as many of them as we can get in there at once so let's get busy

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.119
Go ahead and cram as many pieces of wood inside the container as you can and if you're using something like a paint can be

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.170
Aware there's a liner here

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.189
That's gonna burn off you really don't want to breathe that stuff in just put your lid on securely

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.159
bang it into place like we would a can of paint and

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.319
Then we're going to need a vent hole right here on the top and you can use a screwdriver or something like a sharp pointy

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320
Rock just to

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.159
make a nice little hole in the center that's going to act as a vent hole for letting out some of the pressure when it's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.109
In the fire [now] [you] don't have to use paint stirrer sticks to make your charcoal in fact you can use any sticks lying around

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.959
The ground or [even] some leftover sawdust that works just as well

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.540
I've got three cans of wood here one is our paint stir sticks another one is filled with sawdust another one is random

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.589
twigs, and sticks down at the ground let's light up a fire and get these things roasting

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.509
now as the can starts to heat up you can see it [start] smoking and that's because all the

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.599
Gases inside the wood are being [released] that's hydrogen. Methane and all kinds of other things like acetone pitch

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.489
Just a ton of stuff and we're getting that all out of the wood and because there's no [oxygen] in there

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.499
The wood is going to Char, but it's not going to burn that fire's getting pretty healthy

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
So let's throw all three of them on at the same time (oh no, this is a bad idea)

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.979
Now when this smoke starts pouring out enough and this gets hot enough you're going to notice that this

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.959
smoke actually catches on fire

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:26.480
 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.069
Create a very flammable gas that some people called wood gas and in some countries [like] in Germany to use that on their vehicles

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.340
looks like that one, may be done

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.709
Those other ones, they're so tightly I can't even get to without it burning my fingers

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.880
Ha oh, no my charcoal caught on fire

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.199
So apparently if there's too much pressure building up in there the whole lid might pop off

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.589
Now you can see this one still has a flame coming out of it

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.990
But the other two have gone out that means these ones are done

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.169
We can take them out of the fire and let them cool down for about 10 minutes

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.360
All right all of our containers are pretty much stopped smoking

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.509
it's important to you something like [a] stick or a piece of aluminum foil to

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.110
Cover that hole so no air or sparks fall down into that charcoal and be carefully don't touch these they are

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.540
Extremely hot they're going to need about [5-10] minutes [to] cool down before you can really touch them now

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.260
It's been about 10 minutes

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.869
And this can is very cool to the touch [so] [let's] go ahead and remove our stopper and hope that no sparks cut down inside

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.890
There, but even if they did I don't suppose the bullet on too much damage at this point now

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.910
We need to do is take something like a sharp rock a screwdriver or even a sharp stick to pry this lid off

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.059
So [we] can pick out inside and see what we just made , there we are

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.580
and look at that our paint sticks to virtually been reduced to half their size and look how they've turned completely black and

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.060
C R I S P Y

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.410
Mmm. Look how everything's shrunk down in size it's quite a bit smaller and even bigger sticks like this that used to be tough to

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.799
Break you can break em' easily, and they're black all the way through now. I'm excited to see how this one turned out

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.400
This is the sawdust

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.260
Which I'm hoping will save us a little bit of work trying to grind the charcoal down into Powder

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.890
[it's] just I had this one filled up to the top so let's see how it came out

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.419
[that] is weird look at that

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.910
almost looks Like Chunky biscuits

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.699
So if you compress these together you can make your own charcoal briquettes out of sawdust look at that.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.089
Well there you go. I'd say that it was a complete success. We turned stir sticks

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.819
Sawdust and sticks. We found off the ground into charcoal and there's a hundred applications. You could use this stuff for which

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.510
I'll probably show you in future video, but in the meantime if there's anything specific

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.689
You'd like to see me do put your comments down below and maybe I'll make it happen

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.020
and we'll see you in the next video talk to you then
