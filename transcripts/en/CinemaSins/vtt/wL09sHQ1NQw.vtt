00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.490
Why can't we do a conversation about how hot
Hermoine is?

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.690
Because she's a fictional character.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.630
So
There's also the more pressing matter of how

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.160
criminally underage she is.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.579
But she's played by Emma Watson, who is not
underage and totally hot.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.900
She was underage when she played Hermoine!

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.300
Table read.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.700
Table read.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.710
Gonna do a table read.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.110
Table read.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:50.720
Are you waiting for me to say something?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.270
Well, you do have the first line in the script.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.790
Oh, yeah.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.309
My bad.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.309
Okay.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:08.880
Hey, you know what I was thinking the other
day when I was watching Harry Potter?

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450
You name one actress who's hotter than Emma
Stone.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.450
Cut.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.450
Cut.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.450
What?

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.570
It's Emma Watson not Emma Stone.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.570
You dumbass.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.530
As usual, you messed up your line.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.530
No.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.800
I didn't.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.110
He might have, but I didn't.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.210
Well, I guess it's probably hard to remember
your lines when you don't bother to learn

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.210
them in the first place.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.210
I learn them.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.210
I do.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.420
I just forget them.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.939
Alright.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.620
Do we need to take five so you can go learn
your lines?

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.351
No, we do not need to take five!

00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:44.100
I got this.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.700
A hundred bucks says you don't got this.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.610
You are not helping, alright.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.409
And you forgot to put your hood on so they'll
think you've got headphones on.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.520
And you, I could replace you with any number
of guys around here that look like you, alright?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.930
Are you threatening me?

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.860
Like, do you want me to call my agent?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.090
Dude, Dad is not your agent, no matter how
many times you say it.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.670
He's just a senile old man who doesn't know
who the hell you are.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.629
It's not my fault he can't remember who I
am.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.870
No, it's actually entirely your fault.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.790
You were the one holding the ladder.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.599
Buddy, what are you doing?

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.549
I don't know how you can even complain about
me on a set that has him on it.

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.569
He's just as much a part of this family as
you are, alright?

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.569
He deserves to be a part of this.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.459
Can you at least give him a job where he doesn't
screw up every take.

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.349
I mean, did he even graduate from microphone
school?

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.069
There's no such thing as microphone school.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.870
In this case, there's not even any such thing
as microphone.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.989
That is not a microphone, it's a golf club.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.889
By the looks of it, it's a 3-wood.

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.629
Buddy, come on!

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:58.629
What are you doing?!

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.730
I told you he was incompetent.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.650
He's not incompetent, alright, you just have
to learn how to work with somebody slower

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.650
than you.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.989
I sure did.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.799
Wait, guys.

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.419
How are we even recording audio right now?

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.419
That's it.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.239
I'll be in my trailer.

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.279
You mean the Corolla?

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.279
Yes.

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:19.309
I guess we're taking five.

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.839
Nah, don't worry about it.

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:25.140
I'll just do both parts.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.529
How will that work?

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.881
I'll change shirts in between and just split
screen it down the middle.

00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:30.340
Who's gonna know?
