00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.036
- [Voiceover] The submarine
captain starts ascending

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:06.638
at a constant angle of
inclination of 20 degrees

00:00:06.638 --> 00:00:10.386
so that he can surface in 5,000 feet,

00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:10.985
so it looks like this,

00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:12.695
the submarine is right here,

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:15.838
and he starts surfacing,

00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:19.091
he starts ascending at
an angle of 20 degrees

00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:20.749
so he's just going on that direction,

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.329
so this is our angle of 20 degrees,

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.764
and he wants to surface.

00:00:23.764 --> 00:00:26.254
So I guess this is the
surface right over here

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:27.760
of the water.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.936
He wants to surface

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:32.872
after traveling 5,000 feet
in the horizontal direction.

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:35.622
Changes in pressure are very important

00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:37.427
in submarine travel, and the pressure

00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:40.826
in kilopascals is given by the equation

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:45.225
the pressure in kilopascals
is approximately 2.990

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:49.357
times your depth in your depth,

00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:50.916
and I guess it's going to be feet,

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:53.273
plus 101.3.

00:00:54.043 --> 00:00:55.754
What is the current pressure, P,

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.633
on the submarine at depth D?

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:01.142
Round your answer to
the nearest kilopascal.

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:02.308
All right.

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:03.300
So if we can figure out,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.445
and they've kind of drawn a
nice right triangle for us,

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:09.056
where this angle right
over here is 20 degrees,

00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:11.649
and so if we can use a
little bit of mathematics

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.289
to figure out what D is,

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.538
then we can substitute D into this formula

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:18.268
right over here and
figure out the pressure

00:01:18.268 --> 00:01:21.561
in terms of kilopascals
at this starting depth

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:22.736
right over here.

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:24.505
Well, how do you do that?

00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:27.110
Well, if you're dealing
with a right triangle

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.182
and you know an angle

00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:29.383
and you know one of the sides,

00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:30.806
you might remember

00:01:30.806 --> 00:01:32.949
that you're trig,

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:36.112
your definitions of your trig functions

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:37.892
might come in handy.

00:01:37.892 --> 00:01:39.645
And for just basic right triangles,

00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:43.055
you always want to refer to soh cah...

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:45.330
Soh cah toa,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.174
where soa says that side is equal to

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.781
side of an angle is equal

00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.124
to the ratio of the opposite
side to the hypotenuse.

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:54.567
Cosine of an angle is equal to the ratio

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:56.240
of the adjacent to the hypotenuse.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.460
And tangent of an angle is equal to

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.260
the ratio of the opposite
side to the adjacent side.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.955
So we have our angle here.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.329
Now what sides are we trying to deal with?

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:06.472
We're trying to deal with

00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:09.426
this side right over
here is the opposite side

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:12.549
and if any of this looks foreign to you,

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.281
I encourage you to

00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:16.304
review the basic
trigonometry on Khan Academy.

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:18.131
And then this side right over here,

00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:19.546
it's not the hypotenuse.

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:21.180
It's the adjacent side.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.236
You could argue that the

00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:25.212
hypotenuse is also right next to it,

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:26.460
so some people would call it adjacent

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.907
but we would call this the hypotenuse,

00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:28.845
that is

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:31.260
the longest side of the right triangle.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.220
And then the adjacent side

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.342
that is not the hypotenuse,

00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:36.235
that's the one that we
call the adjacent side,

00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:38.277
so this is the adjacent side.

00:02:38.277 --> 00:02:40.074
So, we're going to be
dealing with the opposite

00:02:40.074 --> 00:02:40.980
and the adjacent.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.007
So which trig function

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:43.680
comes into play here?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.169
Well, tangent deals with the opposite

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:47.429
and the adjacent.

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.199
So we know that the tangent,

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:52.477
the tangent of 20 degrees

00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:55.660
is going to be equal to the ratio

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.610
of the opposite side to...

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.145
or the length of the opposite side

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.840
to the length of the adjacent side.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.928
So it's going to be

00:03:01.928 --> 00:03:06.746
D feet over 5,000 feet

00:03:06.746 --> 00:03:08.469
or if we want to solve for D

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.146
we could just multiple both
sides of this by 5,000.

00:03:12.186 --> 00:03:15.108
Multiple both sides by 5,000

00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:17.209
and we're gonna get D is equal to,

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.588
I'm just swapping sides here,

00:03:19.118 --> 00:03:22.466
is going to be equal to
5,000 times the tangent

00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:24.569
of 20 degrees

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.124
and then we could take
whatever this value is

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:28.646
and substitute it down

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:31.667
down here and round to
the nearest kilopascal.

00:03:32.287 --> 00:03:33.516
Well tangent of 20 degrees,

00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:35.203
we're gonna need a calculator for that,

00:03:35.203 --> 00:03:36.821
and luckily we have one.

00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:38.353
Now when you do this,

00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:39.325
when you use your calculator,

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:40.742
you want to be very careful

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:43.390
that you are in the correct mode,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.819
so you want to be very careful

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.600
that you are in degree mode.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.620
Depending on your calculator,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.973
there's different ways of going between

00:03:48.973 --> 00:03:50.999
degree and radian mode

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.606
and I encourage you to
get familiar with that.

00:03:52.606 --> 00:03:53.872
That's just going to be useful for you,

00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:55.852
potentially on the SAT, but for sure

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:57.241
when you're in trigonometry class

00:03:57.241 --> 00:03:59.084
but I'm in degree mode here.

00:03:59.084 --> 00:04:00.403
So I could take,

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:02.863
I could take 20 degrees

00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:05.097
and take the tangent of it.

00:04:05.487 --> 00:04:06.827
So that's this right over here

00:04:06.827 --> 00:04:09.325
and then multiply it times 5,000.

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:12.354
So times five, one, two, three,

00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:14.413
is going to be equal to this.

00:04:14.413 --> 00:04:15.601
So that's my depth.

00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:20.301
1,819.8511...you know,
it keeps going, feet.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.738
And now I can substitute into...

00:04:22.738 --> 00:04:25.514
into this formula.

00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:27.264
So let's see, if I want to take our D,

00:04:27.264 --> 00:04:28.235
this is our D,

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:30.817
multiply it by 2.990.

00:04:30.817 --> 00:04:34.874
So let's multiply it
by two point nine nine,

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.273
well I could store a zero there

00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:37.444
but it's not gonna change the value,

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:38.900
is equal to that

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.076
and then add 101.3.

00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:44.953
So plus 101.3

00:04:45.373 --> 00:04:46.990
is equal to

00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:51.512
5,542.65500

00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:54.016
and let's see, I want to round
to the nearest kilopascal.

00:04:54.016 --> 00:04:58.172
This P here is given in kilopascals,

00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:01.101
so it's gonna be 5,540, I'm gonna round up

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:02.634
'cause I have a point six here.

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:05.964
5,543.

00:05:06.574 --> 00:05:07.478
So,

00:05:08.048 --> 00:05:12.716
P is approximately 5,543,

00:05:13.165 --> 00:05:16.654
5,543 kilo...

00:05:17.163 --> 00:05:19.389
kilopascals

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.706
kilopascals, based on the information,

00:05:24.446 --> 00:05:26.281
based on the information

00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:28.037
that they gave us.

00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:29.348
Put a comma there,

00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:30.547
not a decimal, a comma.

00:05:30.547 --> 00:05:31.835
There you go.
