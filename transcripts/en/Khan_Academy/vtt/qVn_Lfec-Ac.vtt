00:00:00.591 --> 00:00:02.203
- [Voiceover] We now
have a lot of experience

00:00:02.203 --> 00:00:04.482
finding the areas under
curves when we're dealing

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:06.558
with things in rectangular coordinates.

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:07.974
So we saw we took the Riemann sums,

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.577
a bunch of rectangles,
we took the limit as we

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:12.040
had an infinite number of
infinitely thin rectangles

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.469
and we were able to find the area.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.404
But now let's move on
to polar coordinates.

00:00:16.826 --> 00:00:18.406
And in polar coordinates
I won't say we're finding

00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:21.043
the area under a curve,
but really in this example

00:00:21.043 --> 00:00:23.864
right over here we have
a part of the graph of

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:26.009
r is equal to f of theta and we've graphed

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.417
it between theta is equal to

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:29.418
alpha and theta is equal to beta.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.087
And what I wanna do in
this video is come up with

00:00:33.087 --> 00:00:38.087
a general expression
for this area in blue.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.902
This area that is bounded,
I guess you could say

00:00:40.902 --> 00:00:45.902
by those angles and the graph
of r is equal to f of theta.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.880
And I want you to come
up, or at least attempt

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.198
to come up with an expression on your own,

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:56.949
but I'll give you a
little bit of a hint here.

00:00:57.448 --> 00:00:58.911
When we did it in rectangular coordinates

00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:00.525
we divided things into rectangles.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.410
Over here rectangles don't
seem as obvious because

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.190
they're all kind of coming to this point,

00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:08.365
but what if we could divide things into

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:15.116
sectors or I guess we could
say little pie pieces?

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.476
Someone is doing some
serious drilling downstairs.

00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:20.262
I don't if it's picking
up on the microphone.

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:21.541
But anyway, I will continue.

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:24.783
So what would happen if
we could divide this into

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:28.912
a whole series of kind of pie pieces

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:34.520
and then take the limit as if we had

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.276
an infinite number of pie pieces?

00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:40.225
So we want to find the
area of each of these pie

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:43.594
pieces and then take the
limit as the pie pieces

00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:46.189
I guess you could say
become infinitely thin

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.591
and we have an infinite number of them.

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:54.377
And I'll give you one more
hint, for thinking about

00:01:54.377 --> 00:01:56.484
the area of these pie, I guess you could

00:01:56.484 --> 00:01:59.500
say the area of these pie wedges.

00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:03.183
I'll give you another
hint, so if I have a circle

00:02:03.183 --> 00:02:04.978
I'll do my best attempt at a circle.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.848
Luckily the plumbing or
whatever is going on downstairs

00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:11.669
has stopped for now
allowing me to focus more on

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.346
the calculus, which is
obviously more important.

00:02:14.747 --> 00:02:17.288
All right so if I have
a circle, that's my best

00:02:17.288 --> 00:02:20.252
attempt at a circle, and it's of radius r

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.247
and let me draw a sector of this circle.

00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:29.268
It's a sector of a circle, so
that's obviously r as well.

00:02:29.673 --> 00:02:32.679
And if this angle right
here is theta, what is

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:37.679
going to be the area of
this sector right over here?

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:42.474
So that's my hint for you,
think about what this area

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:45.464
is going to be and we're
assuming theta is in radians.

00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:49.345
Think about what this area
is going to be and then

00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:52.003
see if you can extend
that to what we're trying

00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.745
to do here to figure out, somehow

00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:56.548
I'm giving you a hint again.

00:02:56.548 --> 00:03:00.501
Using integration, finding
an expression for this area.

00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:03.127
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:03:03.127 --> 00:03:05.203
So first let's think about
this, what's the area

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:09.151
of the entire circle,
well we already know that.

00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:10.881
That's going to be pi r squared,

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:13.741
formula for the area of a circle.

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:15.831
And then what's going
to be the area of this?

00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.333
Well it's going to be a
fraction of the circle.

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:23.755
If this is pi, sorry if this
is theta, if we went two pi

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:25.597
radians that would be the
whole circle so this is

00:03:25.597 --> 00:03:30.014
going to be theta over
two pi of the circle.

00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:35.591
So times theta over two pi would be the

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:41.678
area of this sector right over here.

00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:43.620
Area of the whole circle
times the proprotion

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.381
of the circle that we've kind of defined

00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:48.159
or that the sector is made up of.

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:52.125
And so this would give
us, the pis cancel out,

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:56.181
it would give us one half
r squared times theta.

00:03:57.179 --> 00:04:01.029
Now what happens if instead of theta,

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.568
so let's look at each of these over here.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.450
So each of these things that I've drawn,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.249
let's focus on just one of these wedges.

00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:13.771
I will highlight it in orange.

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:21.060
So instead of the angle
being theta let's just

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.582
assume it's a really,
really, really small angle.

00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:26.067
We'll use a differential
although this is a bit of

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:27.876
loosey-goosey mathematics
but the important here

00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:29.551
is to give you the
conceptual understanding.

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:32.847
I could call it a delta
theta and then eventually

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:35.132
take the limit as our delta
theta approaches zero.

00:04:35.148 --> 00:04:37.180
But just for conceptual
purposes when we have

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.064
a infinitely small or super
small change in theta,

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:46.064
so let's call that d theta,
and the radius here or I guess

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.068
we could say this length right over here.

00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:55.195
You could view it as the radius of

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.885
at least the arc right at that point.

00:04:58.128 --> 00:05:02.359
It's going to be r as a
function of the thetas that

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:04.250
we're around right over
here, but we're just going

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.947
to call that our r right over there.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.060
And so what is going to be the
area of this little sector?

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:15.098
Well the area of this
little sector is instead of

00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:16.624
my angle being theta I'm calling

00:05:16.624 --> 00:05:19.279
my angle d theta, this
little differential.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.932
So instead of one half
r squared it's going to

00:05:21.932 --> 00:05:24.300
be, let me do that in a color you can see.

00:05:24.393 --> 00:05:29.393
This area is going to be
one half r squared d theta.

00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:34.101
Notice here the angle
was theta, here the angle

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:36.493
was d theta, super, super small angle.

00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:40.725
Now if I wanted to take
the sum of all of these

00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:44.302
from theta is equal to alpha
to theta is equal to beta

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.133
and literally there is an
infinite number of these.

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:47.786
This is an infinitely small angle.

00:05:48.365 --> 00:05:53.365
Well then for the entire
area right over here

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:56.149
I could just integrate all of these.

00:05:56.646 --> 00:06:01.646
So that's going to be the
integral from alpha to

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:08.546
beta of one half r
squared d theta where r,

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:14.196
of course, is a function of theta.

00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:15.510
So you could even write it this way,

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.310
you could write it as
the integral from alpha

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.310
to beta of one half r of
theta squared d theta.

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:27.798
Just to remind ourselves or assuming r

00:06:27.798 --> 00:06:30.193
is a function of theta in this case.
