00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
 

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.960
In the last several
videos, we learned

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.550
how we can approximate
an arbitrary function,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.070
but a function that is
differentiable and twice and

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.940
thrice differentiable
and all of the rest.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.360
How we can approximate a
function around x is equal to 0

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.000
using a polynomial.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.320
If we just have a
zero-degree polynomial, which

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.410
is just a constant,
you can approximate it

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.240
with a horizontal line that
just goes through that point.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.860
Not a great approximation.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.840
If you have a
first-degree polynomial,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.250
you can at least get the
slope right at that point.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.350
If you get to a
second-degree polynomial,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.260
you can get something that
hugs the function a little bit

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.000
longer.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.790
If you go to a
third-degree polynomial,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.620
maybe something that hugs
the function even a little

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.150
bit longer than that.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.270
But all of that was
focused on approximating

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.880
the function around
x is equal to 0.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.150
And that's why we call it the
Maclaurin series or the Taylor

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.950
series at x is equal to 0.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.170
What I want to do now is
expand it a little bit,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.430
generalize it a little bit, and
focus on the Taylor expansion

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.680
at x equals anything.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.960
So let's say we
want to approximate

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.420
this function when x--
so this is our x-axis--

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.230
when x is equal to c.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.290
So we can do the
exact same thing.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.300
We could say, look,
our first approximation

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:25.707
is that our polynomial
at c should be equal to--

00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:28.290
or actually, even let me better
it-- our polynomial could just

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.990
be-- if it's just
going to be a constant,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.080
it should at least
equal to function

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.700
whatever the
function equals at c.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.660
So it should just equal f
of c. f of c is a constant.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.560
It's that value
right over there.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.540
We're assuming that c is given.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.240
And then you would
have-- this would just

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.560
be a horizontal line
that goes through f of c.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.610
That's p of x is
equal to f of c.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.480
Not a great
approximation, but then we

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.170
could try to go for having
this constraint matched,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.177
plus having the
derivative matched.

00:02:02.177 --> 00:02:03.760
So what this constraint
gave us-- just

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.059
as a reminder-- this gave
us the fact that at least p

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:11.340
of c, the approximation at c,
our polynomial at c, at least

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.410
is going to be equal
to f of c, right?

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.902
If you put c over
here, it doesn't

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:16.443
change what's on
the right-hand side,

00:02:16.443 --> 00:02:19.110
because this is just
going to be a constant.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.720
Now, let's get the
constraint one more step.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.050
What if we want a situation
where this is true,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.160
and we want the derivative
of our polynomial

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.570
to be the same thing as the
derivative of our function

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.410
when either of them are at c.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.030
So for this situation, what
if we set up our polynomial--

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.280
and you'll see a
complete parallel to what

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.540
we did in earlier videos.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.790
We're just going to shift
it a little bit for the fact

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.280
that we're not at 0.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.590
So now, let's define p of x
to be equal to f of c plus f

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.130
prime of c.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.100
So whatever the slope is at this
point of the function, whatever

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.362
the function slope
is, times-- and you're

00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:09.570
going to see something
slightly different over here--

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.150
x minus c.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.140
Now, let's think about
what this minus c is doing.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.320
So let's test, first of
all, that we didn't mess up

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.180
our previous constraint.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.150
So let's evaluate this at c.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.540
So now, we know that
p of c-- and I'm

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.790
using this exact
example-- so p of c--

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.390
let me do this in a new color.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.250
Let me try it out.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.020
So p-- that's not a new color.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:44.290
p of c is going to be equal
to f of c plus f prime

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.730
of c times c minus c.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.470
Wherever you see an x, you
put a c in there. c minus c.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.180
Well, this term right over
here is going to be 0.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.770
And so this whole term right
over here is going to be 0.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.030
And so you're just left with
p of c is equal to f of c.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.270
You're just left with that
constraint right over there.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.530
And the only reason why
we were able to blank out

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.350
this second term right over here
is because we had f prime of c

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.630
times x minus c.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.160
The x minus c makes all of the
terms after this irrelevant.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.430
We can go now verify
that this is now true.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:31.120
So let's try-- p
prime of x is going

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.510
to be the derivative of this,
which is just 0, because this

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.590
is going to be a constant,
plus the derivative

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.644
of this right over here.

00:04:39.644 --> 00:04:40.810
And what's that going to be?

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.150
Well, that's going to be--
you can expand this out

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.500
to be f prime of c
times x minus f prime

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.859
of c times c, which
would just be constant.

00:04:48.859 --> 00:04:51.150
So if you take the derivative
of this thing right here,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.920
you're just going to be
left with an f prime of c.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.390
So the derivative of our
polynomial is now constant.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.050
So obviously, if you
were to evaluate this

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.930
at c, p prime at c, you're
going to get f prime of c.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.900
So once again, it meets
the second constraint.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.690
And now when you have
both of these terms,

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.080
maybe our approximation will
look something like this.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.900
It will at least have the
right slope as f of x.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.380
Our approximation is
getting a little bit better.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.960
And if we keep doing
this-- and we're

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.110
using the exact same logic
that we used when we did it

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.420
around 0, when we did
the Maclaurin expansion--

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:39.090
you get the general Taylor
expansion for the approximation

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.010
of f of x around c
to be the polynomial.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.910
So the polynomial p of x
is going to be equal to--

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.670
and I'll just expand it out.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.970
And this is very similar
to what we saw before.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.519
f of c plus f prime
of c times x minus c.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:00.060
You might even guess what the
next few terms are going to be.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.311
It's the exact same logic.

00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:02.810
Watch the videos
on Maclaurin series

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.634
where I go for a few
more terms into it.

00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:06.300
It becomes a little
bit more complicated

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.240
taking the second and
third derivatives,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.030
and all of the rest
just because you

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.110
have to expand out
these binomials,

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.740
but it's the exact same logic.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.780
So then you have plus
your second-degree term,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.189
f prime prime of c,
divided by 2 factorial.

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.730
And this is just like what we
saw in the Maclaurin expansion.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.480
And just to be
clear, you could say

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.100
that there's a 1
factorial down here.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.110
I didn't take the
trouble to write it

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.690
because it doesn't
change the value.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.500
And then that times
x minus c squared

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.590
plus the third derivative
of the function

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:45.450
evaluated at c over
3 factorial times

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.079
x minus c to the third power.

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:50.620
And I think you get
the general idea.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.580
You can keep adding more and
more and more terms like this.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.110
Unfortunately, it makes
it a little bit harder,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.800
especially if you're
willing to do the work.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.356
It's not so bad, but instead of
having just x here and instead

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:05.730
of just having an
x squared here,

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.910
and having an (x-c) squared having

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.900
an (x-c) to the third,
this makes the analytical math

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.600
a little bit hairier, a
little bit more difficult.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.660
But this will
approximate your function

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.430
better as you add
more and more terms

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.010
or on an arbitrary value
as opposed to just around x

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.400
is equal to 0.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.830
And I'll show you that using
WolframAlpha in the next video.
