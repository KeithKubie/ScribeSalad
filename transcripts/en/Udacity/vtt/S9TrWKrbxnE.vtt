00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:01.929
In a final exercise,

00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:03.321
I'd like you to scatter plot

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:05.611
the data that is modified,

00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:07.592
by modifying two of those prices,

00:00:07.592 --> 00:00:10.311
and please again, plot the data,

00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:12.406
and answer for me the question,

00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:15.288
whether you can fit a line, or for differently,

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:16.929
"is this linear?"

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.929
I really want you to go with a piece of paper to draw those points.
