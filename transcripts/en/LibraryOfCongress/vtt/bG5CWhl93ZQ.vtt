&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Our guest
this afternoon is Jesmyn Ward.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.650
Thank you so much for
being here today.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.510
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Thank
you all for having me.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.250
[ Applause ]

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like many
of you I first became aware

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.070
of Jesmyn Ward's work when
I read her remarkable novel

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.770
"Salvage the Bones".

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.220
Beginning of the days before
Hurricane Katrina hit,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.280
Salvage the Bones tells
the unforgettable story

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.880
of a 14 year old girl named Ash,
the only daughter of four siblings

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.320
in a poor Mississippi
home and that book went

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.430
on to win the National
Book Award in 2011.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.230
Congratulations.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.670
And now Jesmyn Ward is back with
a new novel "Sing, Unburied,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.670
Sing" and once again, we're
traveling with a poor,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.550
Black family in Mississippi.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.710
But this is a more complex story
I think, with several narrators

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.190
and a plot that moves
back and forth in time

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.970
in between the living and the dead.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.740 position:56%
The story is built around a car trip
that a woman takes with her children

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.070
to pick up her husband who has
just been released from prison.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.060
To begin, even though I've read
dozens, maybe hundreds of stories

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.090 position:56%
in the news about the tragedy that -

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.330
Salvage the Bones is still
the way I think about Katrina.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.730
And it's a novel I keep
coming back to as I read

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.370
about what's happening
now in Houston.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.490
Is your family safe?

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.360
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes
my family is safe.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.860
I mean we got some fairly heavy
rains from like the outer bands

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.040
of the hurricane, but we're okay.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.340
Yeah, we're okay.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
goes through your mind

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.730
as you see this thing
repeated again?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.920
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I didn't think

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.060
that it would affect me
as strongly as it did.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.910
I-these days I tend to follow
- I didn't get most of my notes

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.380
from Twitter because I think
it - I've said this before,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.230
I think it makes it - it's easier
to bear the news when you feel

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.700
like you're processing
with the community.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.810
That's what I feel like when
I'm on Twitter reading the news.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.610
So anyhow as I'm like reading
the news, I mean reading Twitter

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.220
and seeing tweets from
people who are -

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Trapped.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.450
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yeah trapped, who
are sending out - who are tweeting

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.190
for help and asking for people
to send rescues to them.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.420
I thought, I just - I kept
retweeting those tweets

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.530
and liking them and trying
to like amplify their voices.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.820
But I didn't realize that
it would be that affecting

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.410
that it would feel that heavy.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.060
I mean it was you know,
it almost felt

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.370
like it was happening again, right?

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.570
That I was back and here Katrina
was bearing down on all of us.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.630
And you know and wreaking such
destruction and so it was difficult

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.700
and I'm surprised that it was that
difficult, but it was difficult.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.520
And I thought "Well
maybe I should you know,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.820
maybe I should talk about this?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.370
Maybe I should actually write some
original tweets" and I couldn't.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.700
Like I was speechless
with horror I think.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.680 position:56%
And also sorrow, you know because
here people are suffering yet again.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You might have heard
the people that I heard on the radio

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.460
who had moved after Katrina and now
are going through the same thing

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.380
with this new storm, unbelievable.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.680
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes
and it has to feel

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.810
like no time has passed
at all for them.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.300
I know you know, I'm living
back on the Gulf Coast.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.500
I work in New Orleans and for
us it's been what, 12-13 years

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.090
and it feels like it
was just yesterday.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.650
So for them as they're living
through this new natural disaster,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.710
I mean I can't imagine
how that feels.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
incredible, incredible.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.760
Your new novel is about
a car trip on some level,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.560
it's to and from a state prison.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.080
But it's a journey in a
much larger sense too.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.200 position:56%
I want you to talk about how you
conceived of that story, the journey

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.380
and the car trip as a
vehicle so to speak.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.610
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: So I originally I
thought this will just be you know,

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.240
the car - the trip was like
my excuse to get this family

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.630
on the road, to make
them go somewhere.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: To
keep them contained.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.420
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yeah to keep
them contained and I thought,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.190 position:56%
okay just be a road trip and
they'll go and they'll pick the dad,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.230
you know Michael, pick him up
and then they'll come back home.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.560
And then I began reading about
the history of Parchman Prison

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.770
and reading about the history of
- more about Mississippi history.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.580
Because I knew absolutely
nothing about Parchman Prison.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.260
And as I was reading
more about the history

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.880
of Parchman Prison I realized that
this book wasn't just going to be

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.230
about a road trip, and it couldn't.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.030
And that in some respects even
as they are driving north,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.750
sort of into what has I think what
people understand as the heart

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.030
of Mississippi, I felt like
at the same time they're doing

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.940
that they also in some
ways journeying backwards

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.030
into the past, right?

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:20.770 position:56%
And to really confront the history
of - the history of - and the legacy

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.000
of slavery, of Jim Crow,
of mass incarceration.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.560
Like they're confronting
all these things

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.270
as they're moving - as
they're on that road.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because the
novel is dispersed with memories

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.950
of the grandfather's
time in that same prison.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.250
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: When it
was considerably worse.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.960 position:56%
But just the 1940's, as you describe
it, it sounds more like the 1840's.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.260
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You don't say
it explicitly but it does sound

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.610
like a system of slavery.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.910
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That
was intentional.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.510
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes
that was intentional.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
historically accurate.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.110
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes, I mean
everything that I learned

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.230
about Parchman seemed to indicate
- I mean the most important book

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.400
to me during the process
of writing this book,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.430 position:56%
is a book called "Worse in Slavery".

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.590
And it is about Parchman
Prison and I think

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.680
that the author is making
the argument that you know,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.170
that system was worse than slavery.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.630
I mean it's basically once
people were sent there,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.790
I mean they were tortured,
they were worked to death.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They
were worked to death.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.390
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.690
So -

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
people profited off this.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.290
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
state or someone.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.350
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: They would rent
the - they would rent the inmates

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.320
at one time, in the very
beginning I think of the history

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.940
of Parchman Prison they'd
actually rent out the inmates

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.480 position:56%
to you know these titans of industry
in Mississippi and they would do -

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like
they were farm animals.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.880
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: They would do
jobs you know for these titans.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:53.040
But then as I guess the - later on
I guess in the 40's, I guess that's

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.500
when they decided to make Parchman
Prison itself like a working farm,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.040
or plantation and that's
what it was.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's just horrific.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.770
I had no idea about this either.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.550
I knew conditions were bad but
that they were worked like this

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.970
in a way that's so obviously
reproduced the conditions

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.270
of 100 years earlier.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.320
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes, with Trusty
shoes, watching them with guns,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.640
making sure they don't run.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The dogs -

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.650
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes the dogs,
hunting them if they did run.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And killing them.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.250
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes
and killing them.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.670
If you killed someone
who ran and you know

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.790
because these were inmates guarding
other inmates with guns, right?

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.600
So if one of the inmates with a
gun killed someone who was trying

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.100
to escape they were able to go
free, like that was their reward.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There was
no investigation, no trial.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.150
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: No.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Now
the father is in -

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.230 position:56%
this takes place in the current day.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.280
The father is in the prison,
is better but you suggest

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.440
that it's still the legacy of that.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.310
We still have a few
million people in prison.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.610
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.490
Has anyone seen Thirteenth,
the documentary?

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:58.390
I mean - it's a wonderful
documentary also you know,

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:04.170
it's amazing and also sad and
presents some very harsh truths.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.510
But in part like that
documentary is about the -

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.950
is about mass incarceration.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.320
About the fact that we're like I
think a couple of different people

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.680
in that documentary said we're the
jailingest nation on earth, right?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
jailingest nation.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.060
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yeah I mean we
- and I wish I had a better head

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.570
for numbers because some of the
statistics that they put forth

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:32.590
in Thirteenth were just
amazing to me and blew my mind.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:38.070
But I guess the population of
Americans who are in prison today.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.180
Like we have more people in
prison in the United States

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.680
than the entire world has,
like all the other countries

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.780
in the world have in prison, right?

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.080
We have more than that.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It affects
everything of course.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.680
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It effects voting.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.280
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes you can't vote.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They
can never vote again.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.880
Not just when they're in
prison, but never again.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.260 position:56%
They're permanently disenfranchised.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.560
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yep.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Let's
talk about these ghosts

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.460
because your novel play with time.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.400
It does move back and
forth as the family travels

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.690
in the car the story is
dispersed with older stories

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.450
that the grandfather has
been telling the boy.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.610
And there are ghosts, not
as metaphors in the novel,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.150
but as ghosts which people are
interacting with and seeing.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.510 position:56%
That must have been a very conscious
decision that you thought about,

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.810
can I get away with ghosts?

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.110
Is this too gothic?

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.800
But when we think about
ghosts, we think about slavery,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.330
you come up against Tony
Morrison's classic Beloved.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:37.170
How did you negotiate that
sort of anxiety of influence?

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.690
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: It might
be foolish but the only way

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:45.530
that I can write new work,
the only way that I can sort

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:52.010
of complete a successful
rough draft is if I forget

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.370
about everything else, right?

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:59.420
And of course I was aware of
Beloved and of Tony Morrison

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.470
and feeling a certain
amount of stress

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.930
because you know Beloved
is a masterpiece.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.230
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.080
&gt;&gt; Right? Write about ghosts,
you know that you know,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:16.360
Black ghosts from these horrible
moments in history without thinking

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.280
about Tony Morrison's Beloved.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.620
But yeah, I did it by
not thinking about it

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.430
because that's the only way I can
- it's the only way I can write.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.070
I just had to forget - I just had
to put all of that out of my head

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.600
and just say "Okay you need
to write the best story

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.910
that you possibly can", right?

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.570
Write about JoJo, about Leoni
and about Ritchie and Pop, right?

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.150
Ritchie is one of the
ghosts in the book.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What do
the ghosts represent?

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.480
Not to reduce these
characters to representations,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.820
but why use ghosts
instead of memories?

00:10:50.820 --> 00:11:00.590
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I am - one of the -
one of the deciding factors for me

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:09.100 position:56%
when I was thinking about whether or
not Given was a ghost, and whether

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.120
or not you know Ritchie would
come into the present moment,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:20.300
was the fact that young boys like
Ritchie actually existed, right?

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.600
And -

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In prison?

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.200
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: In prison -

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: He's 12.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.800
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: In Parchman Prison.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.770 position:56%
I mean you know as I said I did lots
of research about Parchman Prison

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.200
and one of the things that I read
is that you know, young Black boys.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.500
I mean these are children, right?

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.300
As young as 12 and 13 were charged
with petty crimes and you know,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.190
something as silly
as loitering, right?

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.430
And then sent to Parchman Prison.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:50.290 position:56%
And once I read that and I thought
about these little boys sent to live

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.770
and work and die in a
place like Parchman Prison,

00:11:53.770 --> 00:12:00.420
I felt like it would be doing an
injustice to young men like that

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:08.840
if this character, this Ritchie,
this boy if he wasn't able to exist

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.780
in the present moment and wasn't
given the opportunity to speak.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.870
So at that moment I was like
"Okay the only way he is going

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.140
to have the opportunity to speak in
the present moment and to interact,

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.140
really interact with JoJo"
this 13 year old Black boy

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.610
who is living now and
the modern self.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.840
The only way that's going to
happen is if Ritchie is a ghost.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.100
You know and so I felt
like I didn't have a -

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.450
I really didn't have
a choice, you know.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.620
As soon as I knew that a kid

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.610
like him existed I had
to write about him.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's tremendously
effective and powerful,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.840
and means so much when you think

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.920
about how we are haunted
by this past.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.220
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes, I mean it's -

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.600
I mean they're completely
different characters, right?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:03.360
But here you have Ritchie is
a 13 year old boy who lived in

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:11.150
and was a victim of Parchman
Prison and of I think the legacy

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.980
of slavery right, in
Mississippi from the 1940's.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.930
And yet he - and then here
in this present moment

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.750
in the book you have JoJo another
13 year old, young Black boy

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.990
who is wrestling with
that same legacy, right?

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
opportunities will he have?

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.590
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Exactly.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
book, it's not hopeful.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.810
But there are moments of hope.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:43.050
There's a suggestion of some sort
of resolution, there's a suggestion

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.870
that these ghosts can
be not exorcised,

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.050
but at least put to
peace in some way.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.430
As you look across America
can I invite you to speak

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.310
about what might bring
some more element of peace

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.260
to our incredibly fraught
culture at the moment?

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.860
I mean when Obama was elected a lot
of people in this room were full

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.380
of hope and optimism, which
now seems painfully naïve.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.680
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:19.480
I think that - I think that
part of what Ritchie needs,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:25.430
part of what these ghosts
may need is they need -

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.780
they need their stories
to be told, right?

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.320
They need the terror and the
pain of what they lived through,

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.240
they need that told and they
need that acknowledged, right?

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:43.620 position:56%
And I think that's a beginning to
finding our way towards hope, right?

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.300
I think that we - that we're in
this very odd moment in history

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:54.120
where there's a very sort of
active you know, group of people,

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.520
element in our society
who is totally

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.310
against acknowledging this history.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.030
They're against acknowledging

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.020
that this Civil War was
fought because of slavery.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, it
was about states' rights.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.680
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yeah exactly.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.740
You know there again, it's like
acknowledging that you know

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.220 position:56%
that Black people have been devalued
and dehumanized in this country

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.170
for hundreds of years and that

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:25.360
that history you know has
real effects today, right?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.960
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: We live with that

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.260
and there again it's
acknowledging all of that.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.210
So I think that part of the way
that we might hopefully find

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:39.960
out way towards a more
hopeful or better moment is

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.770
by at least beginning
by just acknowledging -

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Telling
these stories.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.370
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yeah
telling these stories.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Are
you, this sounds naïve

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.820
but aren't you amazed how many
stories have not been told?

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.120
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes I am.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I remember reading
Beloved, it was a long time ago

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.040
but I learned about
slavery in school.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.680
I just thought you
know Black people had

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.820
to work really hard
and they were enslaved.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.640
I had no idea it was a whole
system of torture and rape.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:08.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes, I just recently
read a fantastic life changing book

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:15.380 position:56%
called "The Half has Never Been
Told" by Edward E. Baptist, I think.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.980
And it is amazing.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.880
And it's all about slavery and
the making of American capitalism.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, we
don't acknowledge it.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.020
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: We don't.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.470
And I had no - I'm 40 years old and
I just read it for the first time.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.490
I had no idea.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I didn't
know about this prison.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.550
I remember Toni Morrison
talking about when she began

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.390
to write Beloved, she
discovered all these ghastly tools

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.570
that have just been
written out of our history.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.870
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Switching
subjects a bit.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.700
You are relatively new mother.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.000
I understand you have two children?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.300
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: One pretty young?

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.900
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes, two months.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Congratulations.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.500
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Thank you.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The central
character of your book is a mother.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.420
And she's a terrible mother.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.680
I mean I know we hate to say that
about anybody because it's hard

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.900
to be a mother, but she's
selfish and she's mean

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.450
and she doesn't like her kids.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.030
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: No.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We all don't

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.780
like our kids sometimes
but this is different.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.120
She kind of enjoys you know,
making them uncomfortable.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.640
What was that like?

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.940
To create a character like that?

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.880
A young mother who
was really bad at it?

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.180
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: It was hard.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.140
She was the hardest character
for me to write because you know,

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.780
normally in all of my fiction I
feel like I love all my characters.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The previous book,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.380
those characters tore
everyone's heart out.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.680
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.980
I love them.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.680
But she was difficult
because at least

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.760
when I was writing the very
first chapter which is told

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.510
from JoJo's perspective
and JoJo he -

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.720
there's much that he doesn't
understand about his mother.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:57.020
He sees the way that she abuses
him and that she neglects them and

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.070
but he - and he doesn't
understand why.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How could he?

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.670
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Exactly,
I mean he's 13, right?

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.920
And so - and so when I was
writing that first chapter I was

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.490
like man, I really don't like her.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:14.900 position:56%
And then I began writing her chapter
and I still did not like her much.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:21.180
And I realized that one of the
reasons that I did not like her is

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.970
because she was such an awful
mother and she was so horrible

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:28.290
to her children and as a new mom

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.260
and as a mother I just couldn't
understand why she would treat her

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.960
kids like that.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.260
And so I - it was then that
I realized I have to figure

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.770
out what's driving
this woman to do this.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:44.930
And then you know as I sort of
wrote more of that second chapter

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.560
and then I went to
the third chapter.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.880
I still didn't know, right?

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.150
And so when I came back around to
her again in the fourth chapter,

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.770
I made a decision, right?

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.640
The phantom that she
was seeing would be one,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.480
her brother that she lost.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.500
And two, that he would be an
actual ghost .That he wouldn't be a

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:11.370
hallucination, right an
effect of her substance abuse.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.410
And that changed everything for me

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.750
because suddenly I
understand her motivation.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:25.750
I understand the wound that
she was living with, you know?

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:30.510
And that made her sympathetic
to me, that made me love her

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.590
because I felt so badly
for her, right?

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.140
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Because
the great pain of her life

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.470
and she can't figure out how
to - she can't figure out how

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.770
to come to terms with her grief.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.650
She can't figure out
how to move beyond it.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.160
And you know and she's so like
- she's so selfish and she's

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.020
so wrapped up in herself
and her pain that you know,

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.620
I think that affects every
relationship in her life.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.400
I think confronting a question like
that and being willing to stick

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.040
with it and answer it is what
makes the book so powerful.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.910
And so emotionally complex,

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.860
if she were just a villain
the book wouldn't really work.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.160
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: No, no, no, no.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: A story about
a boy who was a villain.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.120 position:56%
The book switches back and forth
chapter by chapter for the most part

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.060
between the son and the mother.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.380
The boy is extremely
sympathetic taking care

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.050
of his three year old sister
pretty much on his own,

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.610 position:56%
knowing that he can't let his mother
do it because she might leave them

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.630 position:56%
or she might hurt them or who knows.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.140 position:56%
Yeah I had the same reaction reading
the book that I hated this woman

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.950
and then by the end she just seemed

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.880
like a really tragic character
in the most complex way.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.710
She's an addict, she
knows she's an addict

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.600
and when she acknowledges
how awful she is,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.190
you just feel horrible for her.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.490
What is that like to live with?

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:48.790
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Because she knows.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.790
I think that part of her knows
that she's an awful person

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.590
and she's an awful mother and
that she's doing lasting damage

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.990 position:56%
to her children by treating them the
way that she does, but she can't -

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.410
she just can't help herself.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:07.310
She can't you know see beyond
her own issues, you know,

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.880
see beyond her own pain to
be there for her children,

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.340
to care for her children
and nurture them.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.050
She just can't do it.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:21.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
tough and very real.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:27.720
As they're traveling they meet
this gentleman, this character

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.080
who is part of a drug
deal of some kind.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.740
He's extremely kind and
just really evil, right?

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:40.300 position:56%
Don't you think he's just unnerving
how polite he is and how nice he is.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.410
He's like the devil you know?

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.710
Where'd that guy come from?

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:50.160
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I had a lot
of fun writing this guy.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.930
I don't know where he came from.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.510
He just - I - as I was writing
this story I think that he -

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.680
it's funny because I'm continuously
surprised when I write -

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: By these people?

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.280
These characters?

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yeah as I'm writing.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.120
I mean I'm not the kind of
writer that maps everything

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.510
out from the very beginning.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.860
I don't plot, I don't
do any of that.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.160
I start with characters.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.590
I have a vague idea of
where they might be going.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Were you surprised
they stopped at this house?

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.560
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes, I was.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.490
I was like "Oh look at this.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.790
Who's this"?

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And he's so
solicitous and getting the water,

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.420
"Anything else you need"?

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.630
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yep, yeah but I had
- he was just - it was interesting

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.690
to spend some time with him
at his house as he's trying

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.740
to feed them spaghetti and
put them in mortal danger.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's a
drug run essentially.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.510
Everybody who writes
about your work notes

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.990
that you have this
strikingly poetic style.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.180
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: They haven't always
noted that it's a good thing.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:57.850
In the past they've been like
"What do you have going on;

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.360
I don't understand any of this.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.020
It's too much".

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I think it's
beautiful and very poetic.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.750
And I'm curious, have
you written poetry?

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:09.200
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I wrote lots
of bad poetry when I was

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.200
in high school and also in college.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.970
And then for a few years after - so
into my early 20's I was writing -

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:21.860
I wrote a lot of poetry,
but I feel like I'm afraid

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.740
that I'm not very good at it.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.530 position:56%
I'm afraid I'm not a very good poet.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:32.450
I love poetry, with everything
in me I love reading it.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.750
I love reading poetry.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.050
I feel like when I read poetry

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:40.640
that I remember how amazing
language can be and like all

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.680
of the things that language can do.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:48.130
And how the right word or the
right image, or the right sound

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.700
of these words strung together
how that can make you feel,

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.660
you know this well
of emotion, right?

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.630
And so I love poetry.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.910
I just - I'm afraid that
I'm not a very good poet,

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:05.700
if I could I don't know, maybe when
I'm - if I live to be 60 then -

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like
twice your age now.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.600
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I'm actually
40, so 20 more years.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I hope you
write poetry before then.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.490
So you haven't published any?

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.790
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I haven't
published any.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.960
I would love to publish poetry,
but I'd be very nervous about -

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.360
very anxious about how
it would be received.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:29.330
But I always admire writers who
write you know in multiple forms,

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.390
and write across several
different genres'.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.690
And I would love to -

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:33.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You write
non-fiction too though.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.290
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I do.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.590
I write non-fiction.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.030 position:56%
But I would love to write children's
literature and I would love

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.770
to publish maybe just
one book of poetry.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:46.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Well who do you go
to to know if your work is any good?

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.400
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Oh so I have a
group of friends, all writers,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.120 position:56%
some of them I met when I was at -
in the MFA program at the University

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.800
of Michigan at I met when
I was a fellow at Stanford.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:06.290
And once I sort of
write a rough draft

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:12.870
and then revise it multiple times,
and I get the manuscript to a point

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.950
where I don't think I'll embarrass
myself if I send it to my friends,

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.250
then I send it to my friends

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.570
and I say "Can you look
at this please, read it.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:20.870
Tell me what you think.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.220
What's working and
what's not working".

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do they?

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.820
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: They do.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.170
It takes them a couple
months but they read it

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:31.000
and they write a response
and they send it back to me

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.010
and then I revise again, multiple
times based on their feedback.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:40.920
And only after I've done that do
I then send it along to my editor

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.230
who is amazing and who I think
really makes me a better writer.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's great.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.270
You don't have trouble
receiving harsh criticism.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.570
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Nope.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.650
I think I took so many writing
workshops when I was younger

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.300
that I became accustomed to it.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're over that.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.040
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: And because
I understand nothing is -

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.730
at least for me I mean there might
be some magical writer out there

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:08.160
who puts something down on
the page and it's perfect.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.530
I am not that writer.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.640
I know that when I put something
on the page that there's plenty

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.160
that is you know, that
needs work, right?

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.480
And so I feel like my friends who
are writers and also my editor,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:24.180
they're doing me a favor
because they're helping me

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.420
to realize this vision that I had.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.910
They're making the book the best

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.100
that it can be by giving
me feedback.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
a good attitude;

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.700
it's pretty tough to have though.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.140
So what do you read
that you like this year?

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.150
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Okay let's see.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:44.610
I have a lot on my bedside table.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:49.940
So I actually the Half has
Never Been told, this year.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.240
It was amazing.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.470
It took me a long time because
it's so dense, but I did.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:55.770
I read that book.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did you
read George Sanders book?

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.370
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I haven't
had the opportunity -

00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There are
ghosts in that book too.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.970
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I heard that.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Some Black ghosts
in this with unnamed graves.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.050
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I want - I was
very excited about the fact

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.130
that he was coming out
with something new,

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.590
but I just haven't had the
opportunity to read it yet.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would you take
questions from this audience?

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.210
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Sure.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We've got two mics
here, one there and one there.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.640
Just come up.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.940
It's very hard for us to
see you with the lights

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.570
on so wave your hands around.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:26.130
You wrote a memoire
of the men we reap -

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.430
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Reaped.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:28.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Reaped.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:33.370
Incredibly powerful book about
five men in your life who died.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.240
That's a strange way to - it's a
strange conceit and it says so much

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.050
about the tragedy of
what's going on in America.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.400
Talk about how that
book was conceived?

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:50.710
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I think that in one
way or another I have been writing

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:58.460
about my brother ever since I
began seriously trying to write.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: He was killed?

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.060
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes he was killed.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.950
He was hit by a drunk driver.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.600
And I was writing about
him even when he was alive;

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.970
I feel like I was writing about
him in one way or another.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:17.610
And so once I you know lived
through those four or five years

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.380
when my brother died and my cousin
died and my three friends died.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.440
I knew that one day I'd
write about that experience

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.400
but I didn't exactly know
what form it would take.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.280
Because I could have
fictionalized it, right?

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.950
But then I thought about it and I
realized no one would believe it.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.490
They wouldn't be able to suspend
their disbelief because they'd be

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:45.000 position:56%
like this doesn't happen, there's no
way you know that - there's no way

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.750
that it would be like this rash of
deaths in this really small town.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's an irony

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.350
that we won't accept
certain things as fiction.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.560
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Yes, and
so I knew if it's creative

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.850
and non-fiction then
they have to accept it

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:03.190
because they know it's the truth,
right, that I'm telling the truth.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.720
And so - and so I began
working on that project.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.970
I mean I just felt that was
a story that I had to tell.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.490
I had to write about my
brother's life, I had to write

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:16.050
about my friend's life, I had
to write about all their deaths

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.810
because I felt like
people didn't know.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.530
And I felt like they should know.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
implicit in that book is

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.900
that this is not so uncommon.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.700
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Exactly; yes.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Which is -

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.330
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I mean it is
heartbreaking when I travel

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.940
and I meet so many different people

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.100
and so many people have read
the book and they come up to me

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.970
and they say, "I felt like
you were writing my life".

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.130
"I lost this person and
I lost that person".

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:45.320
I mean and it's - yeah it is.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.050
It's heartbreaking to
know that you know,

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.940 position:56%
that so many other people have lived

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.140
and are living through
the same thing.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It is, it's
an incredibly powerful book.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.840
Yes ma'am?

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.140
&gt;&gt; She was first, I'll let her go.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes ma'am.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.540
&gt;&gt; Well I was going to mention
that boo, the Men we Reaped and I -

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:09.230
first I wanted to say I'm so sorry
for your loss and for your family.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:13.720
The book touched me in ways
that I can't really relate to,

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.140
but it just was very powerful.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:22.130
And I also what you said earlier
today was that these stories need

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.220
to be told when you're
talking about your other book.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.570
But I think that that's so true
with the stories that you told

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.570
in Men We Reaped; and so
I just wanted to thank you

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.360
for telling those stories.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.930
And bringing that out so that
we could hear about that;

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:41.370
I think that is one way that we
can come together as a nation.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.850
And that was a really important
- I'm sure it was incredibly hard

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.490
for you to do that; so thank you.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.510
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Thank you.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:53.330
[ Applause ]

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:57.860
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm from Hancock County,
Mississippi, from Bay St. Louis.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.130
So I really wanted to
come see you today.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.390
And I've been living here
for a really long time.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:06.550
So, I often feel like I'm
an ambassador for our state.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:11.970
I wanted to chat with you a little
bit about this because I have kind

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:16.520
of like a materialistic, like
defensiveness of Mississippi,

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.590
where I can criticize
Mississippi but ya'll can't.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:26.370
And so I was just wondering you
tell a lot of very raw stories

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.690
about you know where
Mississippi is the setting.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:32.500
But you've also had the opportunity
to go to places like Stanford

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.060
and interact with people who
have probably never been there.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.380
And how do you balance
you know telling stories

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:43.900
that are representative of this
place without I don't know,

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.490
letting people read
too much into it.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.790
Yeah.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.170
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: That's
a good question.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:55.210
I mean I think the way
that I balance that is

00:31:55.210 --> 00:32:01.480
by creating characters
who are complicated,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.420
who have dimension, who are alive.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.170
Who are not just like one
thing, you know what I'm saying?

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:11.190
They're not there you know, no
one is - at least my hope is

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.490
that no one is a villain.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.060
No one character is
a villain in my work.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.250
All these people that
I write about you know,

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:23.260 position:56%
they lead very complicated lives and
they're just human beings and trying

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.900 position:56%
to do the best that they can, right?

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.830
With the circumstances
that they've been given.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:35.410
And so I hope that by making
them as human as I possibly can

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.880
that it will be harder, you know
for people when they read my work

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.370
to just sort of dismiss the kind
of people that I write about,

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.800
or dismiss the place that I -

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.620
dismiss the place that
I write about.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:54.500
Because I mean sometimes I too feel
like an ambassador for Mississippi,

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.450
especially when Hurricane
Katrina comes up in conversation.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.240 position:56%
Because I know that sometimes people
can have like very dismissive ideas

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.040
about people that stayed,
the people that remain

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.830
when they know a hurricane
is going to hit.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.960
You know the people that
are struggling to survive

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.280
after a natural disaster like that.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:18.220
You know comes to Mississippi,
comes to the South and so yeah,

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.200
I try to humanize my
characters the best that I can

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:29.470
so that people aren't able to sort
of you know, aren't able to say

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:33.910
"Oh you know they're just
backwards", "They're just dumb,

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.660
they don't make good decisions".

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.780
I want to you know, complicate them

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.640
so that you can't dismiss
them like that.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:47.280
And so that you know you're able to
see JoJo, this is just a kid trying

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.090
to figure out what it is
to grow up and what it is

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.100
to be an adult in this
country, right?

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.590 position:56%
So you can look at Leoni's character
and say oh no this is a woman

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:02.060
who is struggling with
the loss of a loved one.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:08.050
And who you know, is not
healing, right from that loss.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:13.060
So yeah, so that's
the way I think I try

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.470
to balance I guess
the representation

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:19.420 position:56%
of the place that I'm writing about.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes sir?

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:26.700
&gt;&gt; My name is James, hello.

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.080
I have a question about
your book that just came

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.480
out that you're talking about
and I would like to know will -

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.640
have you intentionally wrote any
characters that are connected

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.980
with the characters from
Salvage the Bones in regards

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.660
of stream of consciousness.

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:50.610
The last time I read that book
was my last year at Morehouse.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:51.990
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: That's
a good question.

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:58.010
I don't know if - I will try
to answer it as well as I can.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:02.170
I think in some respects that
- Salve the Bone was written

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.030
from Esch's perspective, right?

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.370
So from the perspective
of this teenage girl;

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.220
and so she's speaking
the entire time, right?

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.560
She has agency, she is
determining the narrative,

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.000
she's determining -
she's telling the story.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.520
And so I think some of
that carried over in Sing,

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:27.650
because here I am you know
allowing a 13 year old Black boy

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.140
to tell the story as
he understands it.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.340
And then allowing his - and
then his mother is able to do

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.850
so at the same time, and then
there's another narrator, right?

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:41.750
One of the ghosts speaks here.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:45.640
And I - you know I -
it's funny because I feel

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.390
like the first person - writing

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:54.590
from the first person
perspective is - I like it.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:58.290
It's easier for me then writing say
from a third person perspective.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.150
It's definitely easier
for me than writing

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.070
from like a second
person perspective.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:11.420
And so there is something that
seems natural about inhabiting -

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:16.470
about these people and about them
sort of inhabiting my head space

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:21.390
and speaking to me and then - and
then I'm just sort of translating

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:25.590
and letting their words,
you know come to the page.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How do you
get inside people that are

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.090
so different than yourself?

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.390
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: From myself?

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.690
I -

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You didn't have a
childhood like any of these people?

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.390
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: No I didn't.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.270
I don't know.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.150
I don't know if I can answer that.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
need to find out.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.220
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: I don't know.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.980
Honestly often it feels like this
person is sitting right here,

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.050
sort of right outside of
my line of vision right?

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:58.660
And they are telling me
- they're speaking to me,

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.550
they're saying these
things and I'm just sort

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.400
of sitting there typing away.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I don't
believe that at all.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:08.930
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Imagining -

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The things you write
are too artistic, are too formed,

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.250 position:56%
are too beautiful, are works of art.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.370
No one is dictating that to you.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.820
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: It feels that way.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.160
I think in the moment of creation
and I'm specifically talking

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.520
about writing - when I
write the rough draft,

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.690
it feels very intuitive, you know?

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:33.210
Like I'm not thinking about you
know how well I'm developing my

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:37.270
characters or whether there's too
much narration and too little scene

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:40.580
in this section or how my dialogue
is working; I don't think about any

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:45.670
of that when I'm working on the
first rough draft of a work.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.520
I just let it come.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.710
Now I do - I do revise a lot.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:55.870
But I only revise once I've
completed an entire rough draft.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.610
Then I go back and I revise again
and again and again and again

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.410
and then I think about
all those things.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.130 position:56%
I think about character development.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.830
I think about plot, I think about
you know balancing narration

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.130
and scene, I think about dialogue.

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:11.900
I think about all those things
when I'm going - when I revise

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.740
and then I do edit after
edit after edit after edit.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.950
And I actually enjoy revision even
though it probably doesn't seem

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:19.980
like I do, as I'm saying that.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.280
But I do, I enjoy revision.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:26.370
I enjoy the fact that I have
something to work with and so yes,

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.790
I think about those things
when I'm going back in,

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:32.020
but in that first moment I don't.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Just feel possessed.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.670
Did you want to follow up sir?

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.970
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.990
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Thank you.

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:45.250
&gt;&gt; I saw in View with Alice
Walker once and she said that all

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.730
of her characters come to
her and tell her who they are

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.700
and then she types them
out, so you're not alone.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:59.340
I wanted to say this to you, I
absolutely love Salvage the Bones;

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.190
I cannot tell you how much.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:05.120
My book club loved it
and we would do anything

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.780
to get you to do a sequel.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:16.700
But in addition to that I wanted
to say on behalf of every women

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.500
in the world who has ever been
wronged by a man she loves,

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.840
thank you for letting
Cash kick this guy's butt.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.740
I mean thank you.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.500
And we need that sequel.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.700
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Thank you.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you ma'am.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.070
[ Applause ]

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:40.450
&gt;&gt; So my family too is from
Hancock County, though I am not.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.040
And while Katrina devastated
my family,

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.000
I think in your novel it opened me
up to a perspective that I would,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.770 position:56%
as a White woman, not naturally see.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:56.030
And I'm reminded of that as my
family is currently in Houston.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:01.790
And going through the destruction
in their lives and property there.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:06.160
But I think you've helped me
reflect on my battles are different

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.380
than other people's battles,
so I want to appreciate

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.820
that in your fiction
and non-fiction.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.540
But my question is do you feel

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:19.520 position:56%
like when you're reading fiction you
learn more about kind of humanity

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.270
and the past and things
like that, or do you feel

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:28.080
like you do more so
through non-fiction?

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.410
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: That's
a good question.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:36.330
I don't know if I can quantify.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.340
I feel like - I really
think that everything

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.970
that I read teaches me
something, you know?

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:50.960
And that you know say when I need
to immerse myself in a story,

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:56.650
you know in a fictional
story and you know go along

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.820
with this experience that doesn't
mirror mine then I go to fiction.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:09.860
If I want more - and/or sometimes I
can do that in memoire too, right?

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:17.500
Or if I want to learn more
than I know now then I'll go

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.020
to creative non-fiction for that.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:22.830
I don't know, I feel
like I don't know -

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:27.020
I feel like everything teaches me
something, every book gives me -

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.080
if I read it all the way
through it gives me -

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.650
the reason that I'm reading it is

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:35.600
because it's giving me
something that I need.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.950
And so I don't - it's really hard
for me to compare the two genres

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.790
because they give me so much.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:49.980
I don't know if I - I probably
didn't answer that so well.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I agree.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.720
It's such a pleasure to have
you today, thank you so much.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.520
&gt;&gt; Jesmyn Ward: Thank you all.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.300
