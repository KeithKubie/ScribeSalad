00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.220
We looked at the auditor scissoring is an attempt to

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:10.200
Simulate those extra gray scales. Let's keep it to a gray scales for the purpose of this video just using black and white pixels

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.979
There's another approach we can take which is called error diffusion

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.869
So what we do and we'll still use black and white to do this we take a picture

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.409
Let's start with this one, which has got the value 128 so it's mid gray

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.099
We can either say it to be white 255 or black zero so we choose the one which is closer

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.669
So in this case 255 is slightly closer than zero. So we've set that to me two, five five now we can calculate

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.350
The error in the value we've given it to what it should be. So this should be

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.059
128 we said it to be 255. So we've got an error of plus

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.820
127 that's how much brighter it is than what we do especially because we've got that piece. It'll be that

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.719
Now what we can do is we can say let's make the pixels around it slightly darker than they should be

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.739
To compensate for the fact that that one's brighter. So we've got this one pixel, which is brighter

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.390
Let's make the ones around it darker

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.449
And again when the eye looks a little average of axes and low-pass filter over the image and it will appear

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.199
Roughly to be the right brightness all the way over it in this case

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.130
We want to make it darker by quite a lot. Now. The question is where do we pass that?

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.719
Error on to do we just put it onto the next pixel do we put it onto the pixel before?

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.689
We put onto the pixel below it the pixels above it

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.869
One of the classic approach is used is what's called?

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.409
Floyd Steinberg do the ring and what you do here is you don't modify pixels that have already been set

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.139
So you're scanning the image from the top left across each row from left to right?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.529
So the pixels before it you've already set and so you say ooh

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.409
I'm going to take the arrow from this and I've got to put some of it into here

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.489
Some of it into here some of it into here and some of it into here

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.140
So let's start down here a bit. We've set this to be two five five. This is up

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.540
527 so we need to split that plus 127 and take all the ones around it down

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.419
By some amount. So what the Floyd sign Burke algorithm says is into this pixel here. We'll take

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.489
7/16 of the error into this pixel here. We'll take

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.630
1/16 of the error into this pixel here. We'll take

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.319
5/16 of the area and into this one here it will take

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.230
3/16 of the error what this basically means is that this was up by 127

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.220
So, what does that the runs around it a total of 127 lower. So our error that we need to pass out is minus 127

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.150
so we take

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.420
127 divided by 16

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.870
multiplied by 7

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.109
So this Pixar we're going to bring down by minus 56 this one. We're going to bring down by

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.109
1/16 which is roughly 8 and this one is 5/16 which is going to be roughly

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.160
40 and this one's going to be 3/16 which is gonna be roughly

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.969
24 so these are all - so what we're saying?

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.639
Is it for the pixels that surround this one because we were too bright by 127 levels

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.809
We're going to make all the ones below it less bright by certain amounts. So let's work out what those values would be

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.170
So we take 120 8 here we subtract with 56 from it which gives us the value of 72

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.130
So make this pixel to the right

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.509
Be 0 but that's going to generate its own error

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.829
And so we do exactly the same thing in which would generate an error, which would go here

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.768
This was too dark by 72 which means we need to raise this pixel by so much which would make it white

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.858
But we also need to raise this pixel this pixel

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:47.219
Which is also that pixel and so on so we could have passed the error out amongst and if we repeat this out

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.669
over the whole image we can convert a

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.339
Continuous tone image here into a set of pixels that are either black or white

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.720
But which are compensating for the error? And so again, we'll give the appearance of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.480
the original gray things

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.289
But if you were to zoom in on this you would see that rather than having a regular pattern

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.769
It would look a lot more random. You'd have sort of clusters of things actually

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:18.720
These numbers were chosen 3/16 5/16 1/16 7/16 so that for 50% gray you do get that checkerboard pattern

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.519
But for other things you get different patterns the advantage of this is that each of the dots

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.699
Are a single pixel wide rather than before on the other to the west some were single pixel some got bigger some got smaller here

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.699
Everything would end up as a single pixel

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.179
So what we've been talking about is spatial diddly

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.410
we've been taking the either the error and diffusing out over the image or

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.840
Using an order thing over the image to create the dithering you can also do there in time

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.790
So some of the plasma televisions and actually some LCDs as well to try and create the gray scales rather than dither

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.090
Just in space. They also do that in time

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.660
So what they do, is that rather than having the pixel be white all the time

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.029
And they're all black all the time to create the space with the other

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.329
They have it flashing very fast between the two things

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
So it looks great because it's flashing

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.690
Faster than the eye can see black then white the black then white and black the white black and white black the white

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.060
Is it kind of a bit more for the history books this then? It's still you

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.960
I mean printers are still black and white printers

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.970
Either can put a blob of ink or they can't put a blob of ink put a blob of tone or they can't

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:32.109
with the exception of dye sublimation ones where they can start to mix the colors together in different ratios as they're subliming the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.560
Inks and so on it's still used in television

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.700
For example, the camera Shaun's using to film this I think has a 10-bit sensor

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.519
But it's recording at 8 bits. And so it'll be due there in gown

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.460
That's the high end bits the 9th and 10th bit down to the 8 bits to create some that you can see on

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.489
YouTube and so I still use an open you'll go away

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.609
At least you haven't asked me about it on it in audio

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.539
We said that again and now we're going across here. He's 128 greater than hundred 28. No, so we leave that blank

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.649
So now we come down on to line 2 and we do the same thing with the second line here

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:13.750
He's 128 great at 192. No, right? Ok, believe it is 128 greater than 0 yes. Ok, so we get the program to
