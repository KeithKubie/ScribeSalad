00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Hey whats up guys today i'm hanging out with my friend Zack

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.600
From a channel called JerryRigEverthing. He has no idea what we are getting up to today do you?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.980
I have no idea I know that you have been recently been involved with a lot of like organs

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.760
like biological organs

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.200
so I think it's something along those lines

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.520
and i'm kind of nervous about it to be honest

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.260
yeah  he has every reason to be nervous

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.500
because today we are going to be tasting brains

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
That is a terrible plan.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
You guys remember in the previous video we took cow brains

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
cast them in silicone

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.740
and then we cleaned those molds out and we cast gummy

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.540
and poured the gummy inside the mold

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.180
so its been about 24 hours

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.100
they have been sitting in the fridge

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.240
it's time to take those out

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.980
reveal what we've created

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.420
and give them a taste test.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.180
Oh boy!

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.660
so lets do that now Zack go to the fridge

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.560
there is two little molds in there.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.080
These ones in the green.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.440
Yeah so we got these little yeah bluish green molds here.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.620
Oh there heavy!

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.340
You thought they were going to be real brains didn't you.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.840
Yeah.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.840
I was not excited about that.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840
Cool why don't you go ahead and just throw it down there on the counter.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.960
So I got my assistant Zack here all gloved up

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.820
we are going to peel off the tape and very very slowly open these thing up and see how they turned out

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.420
So, what we're going to do now is just slowly peel the gummy back

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.360
You can probably leave that intact for now

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.380
And what I want you to do is start pulling at the pulling at the edges very gently

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.140
this is gummy and its sticking it will release from the silicon

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.660
if he goes slow enough.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.820
Am i going to tear the silicone at all or is it going to come lose

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.509
silicon will be fine it's the gummy that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.890
were worried about it is very very

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.590
slowly very very we are going to see if we can get those

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.790
things out intact

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.070
that's in there that's right made

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.659
different decisions here so that when

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.950
the gummy set we can pull it open

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.420
and exposed the whole thing and we don't

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.670
want the brains anywhere LOL only good

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.320
no brainy leakage

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.150
I'll hold that down

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.460
anyway you can see some of the bubbles

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.659
actually came up to the base of the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.520
brain but it looks like the tops

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.740
probably going to be fully intact

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.420
looks like the green is more at the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.689
bottom right now the green color tool is

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.340
actually pulling away very nicely

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.470
silicon is actually a lot more sturdy

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.820
than you think it would be like it's

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.590
really strong holding together very

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.340
tightly

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.350
yeah like you're using my both arms very

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.299
strongly to hold we have it would hold

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:03.890
the most

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.530
go ahead and grab it put that thing over

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.289
and let's take a look

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.520
we have success

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.920
oh my goodness look at that is crazy

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.150
that is awesome

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.000
look at the detail that worked out

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.010
really well it's even got the gap

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.140
between the left and right side of the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.740
brain

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.270
you can even pull that apart look down

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.350
inside a little bit gently

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.780
we are severing connections to get right in there with

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.280
our surgical equipment

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.489
very cool very cool wow that's amazing

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.890
it actually worked the check this out

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.580
guys

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.680
this turned out almost an exact clone

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.870
exact replica of the brain that we had

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.640
and what's really cool is you do get the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.620
slimy green texture on the top two and

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.570
then it's like this gross purple

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.620
underneath

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.750
I think we have a successful zombie

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.580
brain casting what you think it looks

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.950
good this looks a lot tasty than the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.340
other brains out thinking about ya so

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.380
moment of truth guys how does a gummy

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.610
zombie brain taste

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.130
well we're about to find out or more

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.190
particularly actually Zack's about to find out all right

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.450
we got a guinea pig we got our

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.250
gummy brain let's go just I want

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.410
you to take a giant bite out of that let

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.010
and let me know what you think

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.190
ok so just clarified this is in the same

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.470
mold that the real brain sat in right

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.489
that is correct

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.320
okay just checking oh wow that was a

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.060
good bit it was a healthy size bit I'm

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.989
impressed

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.930
so what do you think it tastes like gummy

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.510
so that's good that is good it doesn't

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.519
taste like brains not that I've ever

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.720
had brains

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.750
it's pretty good good to hear so there

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.640
we have it no aftertaste no residual

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.959
taste of brains we just got the full

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.730
tummy effect we got the purple we got

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.079
the green we got everything cool going

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.090
on here so I'm calling out of success

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.620
i'm excited to see what's in this one

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.090
looks open that up next

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.130
alright let's take a look look at how

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.560
well these seams fit back together

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.910
this part is looking a little bit tricky

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.470
we're gonna have to approach this

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.629
gingerly just want to reiterate that this

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.640
rubber the silicone stuff is a lot

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.129
stronger than you think it like it is it

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.870
requires a lot of force to keep it open

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.060
it's a good workout yeah there you go I

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.880
just felt the release and here is our

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.380
brain reveal nice that captured a lot of

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.640
detail it's amazing the details of that

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.080
captures checked out brains

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.330
goomy goomy brain drain bump let's put

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.500
our minds together with your brains

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.760
Squishy Brains

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.580
I guess it only be right if i did a taste

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.920
test as well would it not where to start that

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.669
is the question where to start i think

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.080
im just gonna take a nice big bite right

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.800
out the back right here

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.740
it has got a fun texture

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.620
umm yep thats gummy one hundred percent genuine

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.940
homemade gummy

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.220
that's what i call brain candy food for

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.360
thought

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.650
cool look at the different patterns here

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.120
you can see where the green splits and

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.160
turns into purple i love the way that

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.220
green glows their their king of random

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.430
approved so what I want you to do is I

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.930
want to grab that thing and just slowly

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.940
pull it off I want you to dissect our gummy

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.220
brain here grab onto this thing down

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.350
here and just slowly pull it apart look

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.700
inside there

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.670
look at wow you know what's amazing

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.740
about this is that's about how soft the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.260
actual brain could literally do that to

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.940
a real brain that's crazy it just

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.500
tears right apart but it's still like

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.790
a little bit stronger than you think it

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.960
is I mean it's like literally pulling

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.610
apart of gummy worm just way thicker  so

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.200
we've got our epic gummy zombie brains

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.040
are working out great

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.390
we've taken a bite I think it's time to

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.800
have a little fun I don't have anymore

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.300
kitchen knives because I destroyed them

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.680
all but I do have a propane torch and a

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.300
butter knife that may be fun to just heat this thing up

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.980
thing up and glided through the center

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.440
of the brain like a gummy lobotomies

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.940
were performing right now I think so

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.680
that's getting hot there we go alright guys

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.270
check it out we got a glowing knife to

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.830
we have a brain here I want you to glide it

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.410
right through the middle there haha

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.320
sizzle what nice effortless look at that that is beautiful

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.850
and it smells terrible like burning

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.160
gummy let's get another one all that

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:43.560
still hot oh hear that its like dripping

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.880
you think if I held it together would

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.250
like actually fuse back together

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.150
look at that

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.760
oh yeah out of the clean-cut dude of the

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.050
clean-cut you got a nice cross-section

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.480
you can see the purple and the green on

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.110
both sides delicious so hot knife vs.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.750
gummy brain I'd call that a success we got this

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.160
this little weird piece down here i

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.270
think im just gonna torch that with a

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.140
blowtorch

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.520
let's just melted

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.520
woah thats awesome

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.100
like a marshmallow

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.820
yeah it is

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.560
oh wow oh my gosh it is like a

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.120
marshmallow exactly like a marshmallow

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.820
you like that layer of carbon look at

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.110
how smooth and shiny is on the inside

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.240
lick it i was joking but that's going to

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.060
do it do it do it

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.840
that tastes great tastes cool

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.540
smooth clean gummy say that again

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.540
i love that

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.620
that looks really neat. I am going to have to see that in slow mo

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.240
there it is

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.000
that whole thing turned into a

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.260
crust that flowed down solidified but then you

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.730
get this clean little gummy in the

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:11.510
middle there

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.490
there we go so we have reduced our

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.960
gummy to this beautiful little

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.280
nugget which i'm going to eat right now

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.670
I've got a little crush the carbon her

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.140
it's the same taste when you burn your

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.820
marshmallows over the campfire but what

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.110
I love about the brain here look how

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.550
shiny that is like cutting through with

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.650
a hot knife you get this drippy shiny

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.670
gooey sorry Zack i know that was your piece

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.820
no its alright i'm willing to share so I still

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.950
got this for pound gummy brain from that

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.419
19 that we cast I think it's time to

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.100
pull this out and just revealed the

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.169
original gummy and what I would normally

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.240
do is fill this up with plaster that we

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.920
have a full cast we've used this is

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.350
asked in the cast a new gummy in but just for

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.520
the sakes were revealing everything

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.810
today we're just going to get everything

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.670
out on the table so it's like Christmas

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.900
Zach go crazy

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.680
let's just dig right in look at that now

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.480
even though this is paper you'll see

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.490
that once you kind of get loosened up it

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.000
should be fairly freely once we rip that

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.300
off everything also pop loose footloose

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.030
and this is how easy it is you just kill

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.780
this thing away comes out perfectly

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.730
intact and then we got a cool little

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:22.820
skin for it look at that okay that we try that one

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.830
yeah which one tastes better which one tastes

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.950
better yes thats cherry

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:37.040
okay no offense man but this one tastes better

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.699
can't argue with that there's a lot more

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.410
sugar in this one there's a lot more

00:09:44.780 --> 00:10:04.460
my bite was bigger

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:10.980
this is your brain on drugs

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.840
smoking hot

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.880
oh thats really hot

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.780
alright we are going to push this little bit here

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.600
that guy's cool experiment today our

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.120
brains worked out perfectly of so

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.650
impressed that we got our tummies on the

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.050
brain looking feeling and tasting with

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.900
it i was very impressive detail of it i

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.370
didn't think that the mobile to capture

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.960
like all those little crevices inside

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.540
the brain that was intense and big

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.010
thanks to Zack for being the guinea pig

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.020
be willing to take the first bite I

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.430
would have taken by the real brains too

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.920
if you need to make you I'm here for you

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.800
i bet he would have

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.430
yep so Zack has a channel called jerry-rigged

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.600
everything if you remember back when I

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.100
did the stealth shelf project he

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.840
actually rebuilt that on his channel

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.850
using our kit so if you're trying to

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.320
build the stealth-shelf yourself you can

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.820
reference one of his videos he also does

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.950
a lot of cellphone repair tutorials and

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.540
all kinds of things completely unrelated

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.790
to eating brains more about using brain

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.440
so go check him out he's got an awesome

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.700
tech channel i'll put a link in the

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.260
description below thanks for joining us

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.550
today guys it's been awesome hanging out

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.750
with you we looking for in the next

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.380
video document the average cow brain

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.180
weighs about 1 pound and here's the

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.470
thing we did some fact-checking and

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.540
that's only about point one percent of

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.820
cows body weight in contrast of humans

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.380
our brains take up two percent of our

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.660
body weight but the largest brain in an

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.670
animal is sperm whale at a whopping

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.670
17 pounds that would be a whole lot of

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.990
gummy if we're to catch the sperm whale

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.500
brain here today
