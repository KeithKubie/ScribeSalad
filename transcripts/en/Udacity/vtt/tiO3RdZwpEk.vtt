00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.166
The equation we need to get a graph that's just shifted up from the graph of y

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.244
equals x squared by three units, is y equals x squared plus 3. Just as we saw

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:12.212
with y equals x squared minus 3, where every point on the lower parabola was

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:16.180
just three units below the corresponding points on the red one, this time,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.340
everything in the green parabola is three units higher than everything in the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.739
red parabola. So if you move the green parabola down three units, it would

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.322
exactly match the red one. So you see that adding constant terms to the side of

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:33.575
the parabola equation that has x on it, moves the entire equation up. And

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.614
subtracting constant terms over here moves it down.
