00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
A few months ago, when we first talked about
acid base reactions,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.400
we saw how acid rain could melt the face off
a statue.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.550
Which is better than melting your face off,
which some acids can do.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.940
So consider yourself lucky.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.280
Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide emitted
from burning fossil fuels

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.800
reacts with water in the air to form sulfuric
acid.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.320
And back when acid rain was at it's worse,
in the 80s and 90s,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.539
it was the scourge of pristine waterways all
over Europe and North America.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.040
Some rivers and streams were left completely
devoid of algae and fish.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.949
In Montana, where I live, we saw quite a bit
of acid rain too, as that statue can attest,

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.340
but oddly enough rivers and streams here did not suffer the same horrible effects as other places.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.420
This, that I'm standing in right now, is the
Clark Fork River.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.210
It remains relatively unharmed by acid rain.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.800
In fact, when the water that fed it had a
pH of 4.5, the river remained basic.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.530
This is a dropper full of dilute sulfuric
acid, think of it as a model for acid rain.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.739
And this is just distilled water with a pH indicator in it that makes it blue when it's neutral or basic

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.899
and it'll turn pink if it's at least a little
bit acidic.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.799
Let's see how much acid it takes to turn our
distilled water a little bit acidic.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.960
Let's do one drop. Oh wow! It's already pink
guys, it's already pink. One drop.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.100
Let's try the same thing with the river water.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.420
Let's see how many drops it takes before it turns - I'm just - it's just - I'm just dumping it in there.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.360
We gettin it? It's starting to happen now?
There, it's sort of half and half.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.040
We've got a half and half transition.
After, after like five, or six, or seven drops.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.730
That was a lot more.
And we're not even all the way there.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.130
Get, get a little bit more, a little bit more,
a little bit more, c'mon.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.260
There we go! There, there now it's acidic.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.580
Why does this happen? It's because this river
is protected by limestone.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.960
Which is calcium carbonate that is present
throughout the entire river system.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.780
Acid rain dissolves the calcium carbonate
in the limestone,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.630
that carbonate washes in to the river and
acts as a natural buffer.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.960
A buffer solution resists changes to it's pH when a strong acid or base is added to it.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.140
So the Clark Fork geochemistry explains why acid rain isn't as devastating here as it is in,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.460
say, the Adirondack Mountains of New York
where there is no limestone.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.060
Buffering is a big deal in chemistry.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.520
We buffer swimming pools to prevent the chemicals
from damaging our skin,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.140
and we buffered soda pop to prevent the acidic
flavorings from damaging our teeth and tissues.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.810
We even have buffers in our blood to keep
our internal pH constant and ourselves healthy.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.990
I think it's important to learn about something
that powerful. How about you?

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:26.370
[Theme Music]

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.110
A buffer solution is a mixture of a weak acid plus its conjugate base, or a weak base plus it's conjugate acid.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.090
These are called acid-base pairs.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.870
Weak in reference to acids and bases means
that they only partial dissociate.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.920
It's actual their weakness that makes them
great buffers.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.220
Since they don't fully dissociate in water, the undissociated buffer can act as either a source or a sink for protons.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.120
Which helps neutralize a strong acid, or base, that's added to the solution. It's really all about equilibrium.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.620
For example, when weak acid like acetic acid
is added to water,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.820
a tiny fraction of it dissociates in to its constituent ions: acetate and hydrogen ions, or protons.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.430
I was recently pouring a bunch of a solution
like this all over my fish and chips.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.360
Vinegar is just a 5% solution of acetic acid.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.590
But the reaction is reversible as well, and
that's where equilibrium comes in.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.360
Say we have a 1 molar solution of acetic acid.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.560
To make the solution a buffer we need to increase
the concentration of acetic acids conjugate base,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.700
acetate, by adding sodium acetate to it.
That would be a good way.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.460
Sodium acetate dissociates completely, thereby
providing a ton of acetate ion.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.220
To see how this works in practice, let's add
enough of that salt to make a 1 molar solution.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.190
We know how much acid and how acetate we put
in, but the important thing is the pH.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.040
And to determine that, we have to know how
many protons there are.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.709
A Rice table will help us keep track of everything!

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.650
The reaction, R, we're interested in here
of course, is the dissociation of acetic acid.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.140
We can ignore the sodium from the sodium acetate,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.300
although it will stick around, it's just a spectator ion that won't take part of any reactions.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.940
Our solution contains initial concentrations
I of 1 molar acid and 1 molar acetate.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.470
We haven't formed any hydrogen ions yet, so
that stays at zero for now.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.530
We don't know how much the concentrations
will change, C, so we call it 'x'.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.500
The acid loses 'x' and both ions gain 'x'.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.459
So our concentration's at equilibrium, E, then are 1 minus x, 1 plus x, and simply x - in that order.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.989
Now just put the numbers in to the equilibrium
formula, 1.76 x 10^-5.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.840
But when chemists work with dissociation equations,
for acids and bases,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.669
they give the Keq a special name:
the acid (or base) dissociation constant.

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.650
The symbol for this kind of equilibrium constant
is Ka, for an acid, or Kb for a base.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.210
So use the equilibrium expression for acetic
acid, and put in the Ka,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.379
and the equilibrium concentrations from the
RICE table.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.120
With a little simple algebra, it simplifies - simplifies?
That doesn't, that doesn't look simplified.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.900
I guess you could call that simplifying, but
ugh...that's like quadratic, I don't want to do that.

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.620
So here's a little trick to make this a lot
easier.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.029
See acetic acid is a really weak acid.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:01.629
So only a tiny fraction of it dissociates.
Which means that 'x' is super small.

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.400
If it's so small that after rounding for significant
digits it doesn't change our answers at all,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.620
then why not just drop it?

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.520
Then that first x for the hydrogen ion has more effect because it's multiplied, but the other two?

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.319
Let's just forget they're there and see what
happens.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.100
If we go back to where we plug in all the numbers and simply drop the two 'x's that are being added and subtracted,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.650
the rest of the problem cancels out leaving
x to equal 1.76 x 10^-5.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.629
The rest is a breeze with a couple taps of
the calculator we find that the pH is 4.754.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.879
But here's the big question, what if we tried
to push the pH out of whack?

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.909
The whole point of a buffer is to resist that,
right?

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:41.539
If I add a strong acid, like say hydrochloric acid, at a concentration of like 0.1 mole per liter to distilled water.

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:47.319
The pH will change, very quickly.
To like, very fast, dropping, yes.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.320
Now we're at like a 3. pH of 3.
Not a healthy environment for most organisms.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.169
So let's think about what would happen to
the pH with a buffer in place.

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.129
Even though HCl dissociates completely in
water, releasing tons of hydrogen ions,

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.529
when it's added to a solution that's buffered
with acetate,

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.419
the excess hydrogen ions join with the acetate
ions to form acetic acid.

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.129
Thus that strong acid can't effect the pH
much because the hydrogen ions are used up.

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:20.089
To neutralize .01 molar HCl, or more specifically .01 molar H+, the acetate concentration much decrease by 0.01 moles per liter.

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:25.420
Simultaneously increasing the acetic acid
concentration by 0.01 moles per liter.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.770
That leaves us with .99 molar acetate and
1.01 molar acetic acid.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.990
Well pH is determined from the concentration
of protons,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.289
which is in our equilibrium equation so let's
just solve for that.

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.240
When you plug in the new acetic acid and acetate
concentrations and the Ka,

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.409
you get 1.80 x 10^-5 moles per liter for the
proton concentration.

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:52.039
Which translates to a pH of 4.746.
This is obviously not a big change from 4.754.

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.069
In fact I had to go out to the fourth digit
to see the pH change.

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.649
Which isn't even justified if you watch Crash
Course Chemistry on significant figures.

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:03.219
But I have to confess vinegar and hydrochloric
acid they may make things easier to understand,

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:06.529
but they're not exactly super relevant in
terms of practical chemistry.

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:09.649
Instead I want you to see how this works in
the 'real' real world.

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:12.839
So, let's consider the buffering system of
the Clark Fork river.

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:16.969
There the reaction between dissolved limestone
and acid rain really happens in three steps.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:22.809
First, the solid calcium carbonate reacts with the protons from acidic rain to form calcium and bicarbonate ions.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.619
The bicarbonate ions each have one hydrogen.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.460
As long as protons are available, the bicarbonate ions can grab a second proton to become uncharged carbonic acid.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.960
As you can see this chain reaction uses up
two protons per molecule of calcium carbonate.

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:39.279
That makes this process doubly powerful.

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:43.599
And that explains why the Clark Fork river
is so resistant to acidification.

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:45.569
But of course buffers are not invincible.

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:49.129
Add enough acid or base and even the best
buffered solution will get overwhelmed.

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:52.349
We call that threshold the buffering capacity
of the solution.

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:56.429
And we determine it in the lab using pH indicators
through a process called titration.

00:07:56.429 --> 00:08:00.439
Earlier I used a pH indicator that showed
an acidic pH by turning pink.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:06.520
But there are lots of other indicators, each with different colors and a different pH where it changes.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.780
This is called the indicators end point.

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:14.710
Here we have 100 mL of water from the river
to which I've added some pH indicator.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:20.179
It's actually a mix of two different pH indicators:
bromocresol green and methyl red.

00:08:20.179 --> 00:08:22.149
That work together well for this reaction.

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:27.379
It'll stay blueish in color for as long as the bicarbonate ions are around to keep the pH buffered

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:30.249
above the indicators end point of pH 4.

00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:32.800
This long glass thing here is a burette.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.420
It's for dispensing liquids in a very controlled way, while also keeping track of how much you've dispensed.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:44.380
At the moment it contains exactly 25 mL of
a 0.10 molar sulfuric acid solution.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.560
The thing to do is to add the acid very slowly,
stirring as I go,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.100
which is being done for me by this automatic
stirry thing which is quite nice.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.630
And - and - you can do it a few ways.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.720
If you have a guess at how much you can put in, you can just sorta turn it on and let it go,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.920
but I don't know so I'm just gonna let it
drip.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:08.440
Very slowly.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.660
You can turn it very slightly and you can
actually get it to do sorta drippy drips.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.870
So then you're like, waiting to see if there's
some changing happening.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:22.980
And there's a little bit of changing happening,
but now it's going back. So, we're getting closer.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.940
And what I'm doing right now, is I'm actually
adding less than a drop at a time

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.040
by going quickly past the opening in this
little burette thing.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:37.100
I can actually see the reaction happening, right before my eyes. It's beautiful, and then it goes back.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.620
It's right now a paler blue than it was before
which is exciting.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.670
It means we're getting close! This is the
stuff I get excited about. I know I'm a nerd.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:55.560
Ohhh, it's almost white right now, it's like a pinkish, purpley. Ohhh, beautiful! That was perfect!

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.829
The solution is now staying pink which means
that I've exhausted it's buffering capacity,

00:09:59.829 --> 00:10:02.990
and the pH has dropped below the indicators
end point.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:12.680
The volume in the pipette is now 22.4 mL, meaning that I used 2.6 mL or 0.0026 liter of the acid solution.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.120
The acid solution is 0.1 molar.

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:21.989
So multiplying these numbers together tells
me that I used 0.00026 mole of H2SO4.

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:24.759
Sulfuric acid reacts at a one to one ratio
with calcium carbonate,

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:28.069
so assuming the calcium carbonate is the only
buffer in the water,

00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:35.560
the 100 mL of river water here must also contain
0.00026 moles of calcium carbonate.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.810
Making it a 0.0026 molar or 2.6 mM solution.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:46.569
I'm a big fan of protecting the environment, but sometimes it is amazing to see what nature can do to protect itself.

00:10:46.569 --> 00:10:50.860
We live in an amazing world and I wouldn't
trade it for anything. Not even Mars.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.069
Thanks for watching this course of Crash Course
Chemistry.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:57.069
If you were listening, you learned that some
bodies of water, like the Clark Ford river,

00:10:57.069 --> 00:11:01.089
have natural protection from acid rain in
the form of a buffering system.

00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:04.680
You learned that a buffer is a solution that
resists changes in pH.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.860
You learned how to make a buffer solution.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:12.079
And you learned how to calculate the pH of such a solution by various methods, including titration.

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:15.819
And lastly, you learned the importance of
the carbonate buffering solution in nature.

00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:20.310
