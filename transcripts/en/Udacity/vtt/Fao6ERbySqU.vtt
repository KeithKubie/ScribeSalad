00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.019
I'm going to introduce some simple concept of geometrical optics to

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.340
help us understand how light traverses through the lens and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.430
what happens on the other side of the lens after light has passed through it.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.050
Let's look at a simple example schematic of a lens.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.280
This is referred to as a principle axis and

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.650
we'll look at as light hits this lens and what happens on this side.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.480
So this is a set,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.695
is the principal axis is a point here which is also the focal length.

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:28.220
If you remember the whole concept of the pinhole, that's where we

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.770
want the image to be formed in the camera obscura pinhole camera.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.800
In this case now when light hits through the lens let's see what happens.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.170
So any light that's parallel to the principle axis, when it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.180
hits the lens will converge to the point where the focal length of that lens is.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.980
So parallel rays converge at the focal length point of a lens.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.760
Any ray of light that goes through the point of the principal axis will go

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.760
through straight unchanged.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.370
It will not have any deviations.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.340
So any rays of light that basically pass through the center principal point of

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.760
a lens will traverse through without any divergence.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.640
So, in essence, this is the point that behaves like a pinhole.
