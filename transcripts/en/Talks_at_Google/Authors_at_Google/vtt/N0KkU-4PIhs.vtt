JESSE NICHOLS:
Fellow Googlers, I

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.650
am the host moderator for today.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.960
My name is Jesse Nichols.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.092
And I will be spending about 30
or 45 minutes in conversation

00:05:11.092 --> 00:05:12.550
with John Cleese,
after which we'll

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.450
follow up with some questions.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.790
I just wanted to let
you know that questions

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.550
can be posted to
[? adorigo/askjohncleese. ?]

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.280
Or if you're in the
audience, obviously,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.640
just make sure you queue
up and I'll kind of signal

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.236
five minutes or
so in advance when

00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:27.610
we're going to
jump to questions.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.655
And it might be a
little earlier than that

00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:30.029
if that's the way
he wants to go.

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.890
But just to give you a heads up.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.149
For those of you who got a
book, hold onto it tightly.

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:36.940
No more books will be
available after that,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.135
at least not here for free.

00:05:38.135 --> 00:05:43.500
[AUDIO OUT]
--schedule will permit

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.140
him to be around for signatures
and photographs afterwards.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.260
And on that note, he
has politely asked

00:05:49.260 --> 00:06:18.524
[AUDIO OUT]

00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:20.500
All right, welcome YouTube.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.530
I will not waste any of your
time giving introduction

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.400
to a man who needs
no introduction.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.290
Please let's welcome to
the stage, John Cleese.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:46.146
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:46.146 --> 00:06:48.720
JOHN CLEESE: This is
my badge of honor.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.540
Daily Show.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.344
I had so much fun on that.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.024
Did you see it?

00:06:53.024 --> 00:06:53.690
Some people did.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.290
It was lovely.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.845
The first thing Jon
Stewart asked me, he said,

00:06:56.845 --> 00:06:58.770
why have they got
the photograph wrong?

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.540
Why don't they show the whole--
it was a wonderful start.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.490
You know, I was able to
shout into the wings,

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.180
are they all like this?

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.460
It was just good fun.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.410
What are we going to-- I
just want to do one thing.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.837
Can you all hear me OK?

00:07:13.837 --> 00:07:14.336
Yep?

00:07:14.336 --> 00:07:15.980
That's great.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.372
That's a good start.

00:07:17.372 --> 00:07:19.330
JESSE NICHOLS: Well
actually, to kick this off,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.990
I did read that you prefer
very friendly or very rude

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.720
questions.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.620
And I was wondering,
why the hell would

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.070
you believe something
as stupid as that?

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.810
JOHN CLEESE: Well, because
the worst questions you get

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.820
are the ones from California.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.760
And people get up and say,
oh, Mr. Cleese, well, you're

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.600
so wonderful.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.300
I've been watching you
since I was three months old

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.920
and you're just wonderful and
you've transformed my life

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.780
and you-- I just--
can you tell us

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.450
how we could become as
wonderful as you-- well,

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.700
not as wonderful as you
but could you give us

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.115
a few tips on how to--
that kind of crap.

00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:56.890
You know, whether
it-- if somebody

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.700
says why have you been
married so many times,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.787
it's immediately
interesting, you see?

00:08:03.787 --> 00:08:05.870
That's why I say just ask
slightly rude questions.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.520
It's much more fun.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.940
JESSE NICHOLS: OK, well on
that note-- So, anyway--

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.190
JOHN CLEESE: Do you trust him?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.504
I don't trust him.

00:08:16.504 --> 00:08:18.377
Do you know him well?

00:08:18.377 --> 00:08:20.210
JESSE NICHOLS: None of
these people know me.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.580
JOHN CLEESE: Nobody knows you.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.860
It's Jesse, right?

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.696
JESSE NICHOLS: It is Jesse.

00:08:25.696 --> 00:08:26.820
Do tell us about this book.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.660
So anyway what prompted
you to write this?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.610
JOHN CLEESE: Well, I'll
tell you what it was.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.210
It was conversation
with Michael Caine.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.669
I know Michael a little bit.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.740
And we used to always
holiday together.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.250
I don't mean together, but
we would be in Barbados

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.610
at the same time with
two of my other friends.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.100
[STATIC, CLUNKING NOISE]

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.270
And uh, shall we do
something about that?

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.142
Or, shall we just let it go on?

00:08:53.142 --> 00:08:54.350
Do we know what's causing it?

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.919
JESSE NICHOLS: Both of us
should remain absolutely still.

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:03.960
JOHN CLEESE: That's good.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.200
It's funny how
seldom-- it's just

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.060
like people who want
photographs, you know?

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.910
They always come up to you.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.200
They say, can we
have a photograph?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.580
I say to them, you mean
to commemorate the fact

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.870
that we met four seconds ago?

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.840
And then they take a
photograph, except they

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.530
don't take a photograph because
they get someone else to take

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.450
the photograph who doesn't
know how to work the camera.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.640
And then the first two or
three shots don't work.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.880
Then the guy I'm being
photographed with

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.408
goes back and takes
[STATIC NOISE] the camera.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.645
This is the home
of high technology.

00:09:44.645 --> 00:10:01.400
[LAUGHS] The lights
will go out in a moment.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.169
Where was I?

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.960
JESSE NICHOLS: Something
about photographs.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.550
JOHN CLEESE: Oh
yes, photographs.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.280
So it always goes
wrong, it always

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.850
goes wrong when people want
photographs or microphones

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.790
or something like that.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.970
I love the idea of technology,
but my phrase used to be,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.660
isn't it wonderful?

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.711
It's a shame none of it works.

00:10:23.711 --> 00:10:25.210
That's because
that's my experience.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.010
You know, someone who
likes science but was never

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.737
very interested in technology.

00:10:31.737 --> 00:10:32.820
How did we get on to that?

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.361
JESSE NICHOLS:
Michael Caine was in--

00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:35.730
JOHN CLEESE: Michael Caine.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.850
Michael Caine.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:41.090
[STATIC NOISE]

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.340
Michael Caine told
me that he just

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.820
finished his own
autobiography and he'd

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.630
had a wonderful time writing it.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.410
And I said, why?

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.610
And he said, because you
reclaim parts of your life

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.960
that you'd completely
forgotten about.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.570
Now for people of your
age, it's hard to believe.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.870
But by the time you get to 70,
there's great chunks of things

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.990
that you've completely
forgotten about.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.250
But because the
memory is associative,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.600
as you start to remember
things and try to figure out

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.360
what happened in
what order, it all

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.530
begins to start coming back.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.190
And that's really
very satisfying.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.310
You remember parts that you'd
lost and then what happens

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.180
is, you begin to see certain
patterns in your life

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.180
emerging which you had
not been aware of before.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.370
This is sort of a little bit
of a narrative here and there

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.584
and you'd never sense there
was a sort of cause and effect.

00:11:33.584 --> 00:11:35.750
JESSE NICHOLS: Interesting
that you put it that way,

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.090
this kind of discovering
or piecing together.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.580
You get the sense of that,
certainly in the first third

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.920
of the book where you go
into what I would be proud

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.280
if I could remember such
depth into your youth

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.440
and leading up to university.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:48.940
So-

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.880
JOHN CLEESE: Yes, but
you-- what happens

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.760
is, you remember the things
that are meaningful to you

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.000
and you forget all the rest.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.850
And when you meet friends
from 40 years ago,

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.300
you find they have
a very clear memory

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.050
indeed, of two
incidents involving you

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.880
that you have no
memory of at all.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.900
But you have two very
clear memories of them,

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.960
which they can't remember.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.130
And it's very strange.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.100
It's very selective.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.510
But it's all down to
what is meaningful,

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.230
that's what sticks in your mind.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.210
JESSE NICHOLS: Well,
what I found compelling,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.260
if you could really break the
book up into sections, right?

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.870
There is youth, leading
up through high school,

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.140
or what we call high
school, you call it college.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.830
There is university and then
there is post-university.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.080
University is brief, but
then there is post-university

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.480
leading up to Monty Python.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.590
So why did you choose
that chunk of your life

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.140
to be the exposition
of your biography.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.166
JOHN CLEESE: Well,
people have said to me

00:12:44.166 --> 00:12:45.540
that they were
disappointed there

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.570
wasn't more about Python in it.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.340
And I was a bit bothered
when people said that.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.790
And I said to my publishers,
we misled people.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.730
And they said, no, if you'd
been writing a book about Monty

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.200
Python, it would've been called
Monty Python by John Cleese.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.360
But an autobiography,
people should realize,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.170
is basically to do with the
early part of your life,

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.840
at least at the start of it.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.890
And this is quite a lot pages.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.085
I can't remember what, but
it's about 125,000 words,

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:16.630
which is long for
the average book.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.230
And that really only got me
up to the beginning of Python.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.490
Because there was a lot
of other stuff I'd done.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.210
I mean, a lot of people
naturally here don't know,

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.624
but I did a radio show that
did over 100 shows called,

00:13:28.624 --> 00:13:30.040
"I'm Sorry, I'll
Read That Again."

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.240
It wasn't very good,
but it was very popular.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.180
Then I did a series
with two guys

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.220
called Ronnie Corbett and Ronnie
Barker, who became very, very

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.080
famous in England,
had their own shows.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.130
They were knows as
The Two Ronnies.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.790
And when Ronnie
Barker died, it really

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.130
was a day of sort
of national lament.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.220
He was a wonderful
guy and very funny.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.902
Then I worked with
Marty Feldman and spend

00:13:50.902 --> 00:13:51.860
a lot of time with him.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.810
I worked with David Frost and
did a lot of time with him.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.226
So that I had a
lot of experiences

00:13:56.226 --> 00:13:58.290
in and around show business.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.880
I was actually in
a Broadway musical,

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.740
which is kind of funny, because
I am hopeless at singing.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.060
When I was young, Mr.
Hickley threw me out

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:13.180
of singing classes, because I
was just literally hopeless.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.790
And when I was in America,
in New York in '64,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.070
I got invited-- my agent
rang me up and said,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.720
you've been invited to
audition for a British show.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.770
And I said, what is it?

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.415
And he said, it's a musical.

00:14:27.415 --> 00:14:30.540
And I laughed out loud
because it was so absurd,

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.710
me auditioning for a musical.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.800
But I went along.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.050
It was "Half a Sixpence."

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.780
It was a fellow
called Tommy Steele,

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.720
who was a big star at the time.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.620
And I read the
dialogue and made them

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.670
laugh because I was playing
an upper class twit.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.460
And then they said to me,
will you sing something?

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.790
And I said, no.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.810
And they said, but it doesn't
matter what, just sing.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.800
And I said, I can't
remember a tune.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.720
And they said, well, could
you sing your national anthem?

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.880
I said, certainly,
how does it go?

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.130
And then I sang appallingly.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.180
And two days later, I
went off, I was at home

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.110
and the phone rang and
they'd offered me the part.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.992
And I said to my agent,
I can't, I can't sing.

00:15:13.992 --> 00:15:16.450
And he said, well, he won't
notice just because you're only

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.320
in the chorus numbers.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.180
And the moment I
went into rehearsal,

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.780
I went up to the
little guy who is

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.530
the musical director,
Stanley Lebowsky, and I said,

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.450
Stanley, I'm John Cleese.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.410
I have to tell you.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.200
I said at the auditions,
I cannot sing.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.220
And Stanley, I
remember, he said, John,

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.190
I've been on Broadway 40 years.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.690
Everybody can sing.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.670
So he took me over to the
piano and 10 minutes later, he

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.290
changed his mind.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:46.700
He just told me
to mime the words.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.260
And that's what I used to do.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.250
I used to go out there and mime.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:55.530
One day after about six weeks,
I joined in very quietly one day

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.310
in the chorus numbers.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:00.600
And Stanley was waiting
for me in my dressing room.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.190
When I came out, he said,
John, are you singing?

00:16:06.822 --> 00:16:08.280
That's the first
time anyone's ever

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.925
said that to someone
in a musical.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.390
So I have all sorts of
odd experiences like that.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.460
And I also taught for two years,
which I thoroughly enjoyed,

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.100
really enjoyed that.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.430
So all of that's in there.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.810
But a lot of it is about
tracing the development

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.330
of a sense of humor.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.000
Because even when
I was 14, I mean

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.410
there was never in my
mind, even the possibility

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.960
the I would become a
professional comedian.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.070
I mean, in the place
that I grew up,

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.970
a little sleepy,
seaside resort, I

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:45.650
was as likely to become
a matador or the Pope

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.992
as a comedian.

00:16:46.992 --> 00:16:49.075
I mean, it just simply
wasn't on our radar screen.

00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:50.960
And when I got to
Cambridge, I happened

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.690
to join a club called
The Footlights, which

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.550
is like the crazy, the Hasty
Pudding Club at Harvard.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.670
And I joined it just
for fun, because I

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.140
liked the people in it.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.720
And what happened after
that was that I started

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.920
to get into the end of
academic year shows.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.810
And when I did the last one
of those in my third year,

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.720
because at Cambridge,
you only do three years,

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.490
suddenly the show was very,
very good, not because of me.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.839
I was not the star of the show.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.829
There were two other guys called
Tim Brooke-Taylor and Bill

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:23.579
Oddie and they were
the stars of the show.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.180
And an impresario put us in
the West End for five months.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.750
This little student review
ran in the West End, you know,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.850
which is London's
Broadway, for five months.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.060
And the BBC came along,
BBC radio offered me

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.960
a job was as a writer-producer
and I was a performer.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.580
And so I thought, well, I
don't want to be a lawyer.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.300
I never wanted to be a lawyer.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.120
And so, I escaped and suddenly
found myself in show business.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.230
And the great thing was, because
the BBC had offered me a job,

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.360
my parents were OK about it.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.426
Because the BBC was
like the Civil Service.

00:17:58.426 --> 00:18:02.150
And I was able to say, yes,
I've joined the pension scheme.

00:18:05.162 --> 00:18:07.120
JESSE NICHOLS: It's
interesting that you put it

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.970
in the context of
a narrative though.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.647
I definitely got the sense
of that as I read the book.

00:18:11.647 --> 00:18:13.730
And I've got plenty of
friendly questions in here,

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.430
but a rather rude one.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.230
JOHN CLEESE: Do it.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.150
JESSE NICHOLS: The first third
of your book, I was wondering,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.260
will this all be an aside,
as you were growing up,

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.960
you didn't realise, you didn't
at least admit to showing

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.270
of a ton of comedic talents.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.450
It's not like you were the
class clown or constantly

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.210
playing pranks.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.610
And I'm saying, where did the
John Cleese that come from?

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.980
And you get to a point where
the next thing you know,

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.570
you're on your London's
Broadway, you're on the BBC,

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.920
and I actually didn't like that.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.730
Because you're giving too
much leeway to 23-year-olds

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.814
who took two years
before graduating college

00:18:44.814 --> 00:18:46.230
and don't know
where they're going

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.604
and say, don't
worry, Mom, by 30,

00:18:47.604 --> 00:18:50.249
I'll be the next Monty Python.

00:18:50.249 --> 00:18:52.790
JOHN CLEESE: Well, yes, I mean
there were a couple of things.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.090
When I first went to
my prep school, which

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.470
is sort of eight to
13, I didn't mix in

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.330
very well, because
my parents had

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.770
moved some insane
number times, like 11

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.980
times in 12 years or
something like that.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.990
So I was never in
one place and I never

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.570
had time to form any strong
friendships with other boys.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.900
So that was a difficulty.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.890
And also I was an only
child of older parents.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.100
Dad was 46 when I was born.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.240
Mother was 40, which is
really quite old in 1939.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.980
So I had not really
been socialized.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.810
I'd just sort of been
very happy on my own,

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.500
playing games on my own, and
according to Sammy Davis,

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.600
becoming creative.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.200
Because Sammy Davis always
said that being on your own

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.740
and being bored was
a wonderful source

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.820
of creativity, which
it may well be.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.850
So when I arrived
in school, I just

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.460
didn't fit in terribly well.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.260
People didn't like me much.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.880
But I think I soon discovered
that if I could make them

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.730
laugh, there was a
feeling of warmth.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.500
You'll all know what it's like
to tell a story successfully

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.915
at a dinner party or
at a cocktail party.

00:20:01.915 --> 00:20:03.110
You know, you feel good.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.220
You feel the warmth.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.800
And I think
unconsciously, that' what

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.160
took me towards
making jokes in class.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.469
But I wasn't the class clown.

00:20:11.469 --> 00:20:12.260
You're quite right.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.230
I was much-- I had a sort
of sneakier version of it.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.770
In fact, it was a master
called Mr. Whitmarsh

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:22.820
who taught me history.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.210
And Mr. Whitmarsh, I'll
tell you in a second,

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.430
absolutely summed me up.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.040
But I have to tell you,
he amused me a lot,

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.130
because he couldn't pronounce
his own name properly.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.800
And that's quite unusual.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.520
He couldn't say he
was Mr. Whitmarsh.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.800
He said his name was Mr.
W-w-whitmarsh And he'd

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.550
chosen to teach history
of the 17th century,

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.190
so you had to teach all
about the R-r-reformation

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.970
and the Counter R-r-reformation
and the R-r-roundheads

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:00.880
and the L-l-loyalists and Oliver
C-c-cromwell and [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.520
and Prince R-r-rupert of the
R-r-rhine the R-r-restoration.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.390
If he'd taught 18th
century history,

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.775
he would just have to get
through the R-r-regency

00:21:12.775 --> 00:21:14.590
and all would have
been plain sailing.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.870
And it fascinated me.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:22.730
We would ask him questions to
see how many Rs we could get.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.500
But the point of telling you
is that he wrote in my history

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.630
report once, he
said, Cleese indulges

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:33.540
in subversive activities
at the back of the room.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.320
That was the entire
history report.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.000
So there was a bit of
me that liked laughing.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.960
But it wasn't a very bold,
in your face kind of stuff.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.685
It was sly.

00:21:44.685 --> 00:21:46.060
JESSE NICHOLS:
Well, it certainly

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.640
seems to be a recurring
theme, exploring

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.970
where your sense of creativity
and humor, if not personal,

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.890
something maybe more general,
where that comes from.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.100
So what were some of your
big conclusions from this?

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.933
JOHN CLEESE: Well, the
first thing I noticed

00:21:58.933 --> 00:22:02.780
is that I did-- I got into
science-- into Cambridge

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.950
on science, on physics.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.040
And I realized when I arrived
at Cambridge, to my horror,

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.220
that there were people doing
physics who were actually

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.690
interested in it.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.750
So I thought, well,
what else can I do?

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.250
And there were very
few other things

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.640
that I was qualified to do.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.930
But one was the law.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.060
And so I said, all
right, I'll do that.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.920
Because I've always used
words fairly precisely.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.960
And legal thinking
is very simple.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.450
It's just a question
of does this case

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.210
fall into this category
or that category.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.530
And if you can
categorize accurately,

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.560
then law becomes easy,
at least intellectually.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.800
I think when you get in
the real practice of law,

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.140
it's all about rather
dishonest tactics and sort

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.580
of maneuvering the other
side and never accepting

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.560
the 1% of the blame or anything.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.410
I don't like that
side of law at all.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.290
But intellectually,
it was interesting.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.214
How did I get on to that?

00:22:59.214 --> 00:23:01.380
JESSE NICHOLS: How you
developed, certainly such a--

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.260
JOHN CLEESE: Oh that's right.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:02.760
Sorry.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.320
Well, when I got to Cambridge
and I joined The Footlights,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.290
partly by accident,
just because the guy

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.580
I was sharing digs
with knew someone

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.030
who was already
in The Footlights.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.010
So it was a sort of inside job.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.580
I got in there and I
started to discover

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.150
that I could write on a
piece of paper, words,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.800
that if performed properly,
would make people laugh.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.850
And no one had ever suggested,
in my first 21 years,

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.730
that I had a shred
of creative talent.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.140
I mean, I wrote one or
two quite good essays.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.540
We had to write
an essay on time.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.590
And I wrote the
whole essay about how

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.571
I didn't have enough
time to write the essay.

00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:42.070
And I thought that
was quite clever.

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.400
But you see, you're dealing
at Clifton College, my school

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.330
from 13 to 18, you're
dealing with teachers

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.360
who are intelligent, but who
have no creativity at all.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.670
So they can't recognize it.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.950
Do you see what I mean?

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.670
So when I discovered
I could write

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.950
stuff that made people laugh,
it was an astonishing discovery

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:00.800
to me.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.540
And the first thing
I found, which

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.840
is the key to everything--
because I actually

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.820
lecture on creativity.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.860
--the thing I
discovered immediately

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.900
was that if I was working on
something fairly late at night,

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.970
and I might work on it for an
hour, 45 minutes or something

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.000
like that, and then
I would go to sleep.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.720
Come on in.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.320
It's fine.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:21.860
Come on in.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.568
You're all right?

00:24:22.568 --> 00:24:23.700
You're welcome.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.570
I would work on it
quite hard and then

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:33.010
I would sit down, and have a
cup of chocolate, and go to bed.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.500
And when I woke up the morning,
I'd make myself a cup of coffee

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.180
and go over to the desk,
and within two or three

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.110
minutes I had the
solution to what I'd

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.460
been blocked on
the previous night.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.660
And I began to find
this very strange

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.400
because it happened
all the time.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.380
And I suddenly realized
it must-- could only

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:02.770
be that my mind, my unconscious,
was working on the problem

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.930
while I was asleep.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.500
And I began to learn the basic
principle of creativity, which

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.480
is that it comes
from the unconscious.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.220
And if you think that's
an odd thing to say,

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.157
did you know that when Edison
was trying to have an idea--

00:25:20.157 --> 00:25:20.740
you know this.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.700
Somebody's nodding.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.750
He used to keep a
metal bowl on the floor

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.430
and he used to have ball
bearings in his hand.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.780
Because he felt that his best
ideas came in that sort of

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.430
hinterland between being
asleep and still being awake.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.180
And he had the ball bearings
because when he fell asleep,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.060
he would drop the
ball bearings and they

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.300
would drop into the metal
pan and wake him up again.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.800
And that would
enable him to stay

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.240
in this sort of
semi-dream world, where

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.010
he thought he got
most of his ideas.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.370
And the guy who
understood, finally,

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.550
the structure of the carbon
atom, whose name was something

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:01.375
von Stradonitz, Kekule von
Stradonitz or something,

00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:03.970
he suddenly understood it
because he was very tired one

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.880
night and he was
looking into a fire.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.330
And as he saw the flames
flickering, you know,

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.510
he sort of fantasized
that they were

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.732
snakes trying to
bite their own tails.

00:26:13.732 --> 00:26:15.190
And the more he
thought about that,

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:20.100
the more he suddenly realized
it was a carbon ring.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.110
So that's a good
example that you

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.000
don't get the stuff of the
unconscious printed out

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.670
in a nice piece of paper.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.980
You get just odd intimations.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.300
Einstein himself said
that muscular feelings

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.020
were a part of his
creative process.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.602
So it's important to realize
that creativity doesn't

00:26:38.602 --> 00:26:40.060
come from the left
brain, you know,

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.690
the logical, linguistic,
mathematical part.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.750
It doesn't come from that.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:49.230
You can make very small advances
with that side of the brain.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.890
But anything that's a really
new and unusual breakthrough

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.180
kind of revelation,
that will always

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.470
come from the right brain.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.390
That will always come
from the unconscious.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:05.160
And I don't mean the Freudian
unconscious with this dustbin

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.550
that we put our most aggressive
and unpleasant feelings into.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.170
I'm talking about
the unconscious that

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.790
enables you to drive
to the office every day

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.340
without really thinking
what you're doing.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:21.070
If you try to think what you're
doing when you tie shoelaces

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.060
together, it gets in the way.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.880
There's certain things that
your unconscious mind does

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.150
extraordinarily
well for you and you

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.980
don't have to bother
with them, like you

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.970
guys on your computers or
people who play the piano.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.582
And so there's a lot of very
intelligent stuff going on

00:27:36.582 --> 00:27:38.040
in the unconscious
and the question

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.040
is how to get in touch with it.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.650
And I think that the only
ways you get in touch with it

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:48.590
is by creating what I call
an oasis, a quiet place.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.210
So you have to have boundaries
of space and boundaries

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.090
of time.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.120
Because the two
things that fuck up

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.775
creativity are
interruptions and anxiety.

00:27:59.775 --> 00:28:01.650
And the greatest research
that was ever done,

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.700
was done on some architects.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.860
A guy who used to
teach at Berkeley,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.170
I forgot his name,
a Scottish name.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.920
He interviewed
all the architects

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.950
who were picked
out by their peers

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.500
as the greatest architects,
the most creative ones.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.840
And he asked them
literally, what

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.190
they did from the moment
they got up in the morning

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.480
to the moment they
went to bed at night.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.770
And then he went all
the other architects

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.490
who weren't very creative,
though he didn't tell them

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.900
that was why.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.840
And asked them what they did
from the moment they got up

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.300
in the morning until the moment
they went to bed at night.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.510
And what he discovered was
there were two differences

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.150
between the creative ones
and the uncreative ones.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:49.190
Nothing to do with IQ,
completely unrelated.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:54.220
The first was that the creative
architects knew how to play,

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.570
how to play with an idea.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:00.120
And that means to get really
absorbed and interested in it.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.812
And he called it childlike.

00:29:02.812 --> 00:29:04.770
Because you know how
children, when they really

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.940
get interested in
something, how utterly

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.030
absorbed they become,
without any sense of time,

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.180
thinking, now if I pull
it's wing off, what happens?

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.020
You know, now if I
pull this leg off,

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.030
and they're in a
world of their own.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.517
The architects were like that.

00:29:19.517 --> 00:29:21.850
And the other thing that might
interest and surprise you

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:27.520
is that they deferred decisions
as long as they could.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.220
If a decision had to be
taken at a certain time,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.150
then they took it.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.390
But they didn't take it
before it had to be taken.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.880
And those were the
characteristics

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.560
of creative people, which is
very different from what you're

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.010
basically taught at school.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:41.510
I think.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.380
And I'm entirely
sure it's right.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.010
Because I keep reading
books on creativity.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.650
And that's all they
ever regurgitate.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.630
Nobody's really
discovered anything new

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.130
about creativity
since about 1980

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.450
because it's just
about knowing how

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.870
to get in touch with
the unconscious.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:01.300
And once you've
said that, there's

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.710
not much you can say about
it, because the rest of it

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.410
is unconscious, so how
can you write about it?

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.959
Does that makes some sense?

00:30:09.959 --> 00:30:12.250
JESSE NICHOLS: There were a
number of nuggets, actually

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:16.110
of wisdoms that you pulled
out throughout the book.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.500
And some of them were
about creativity.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.250
Some of them were just
about kind of human nature.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.597
At one point, you talk
about Cleese's two rules

00:30:24.597 --> 00:30:27.180
of comedy which kind of struck
a chord with what you were just

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:27.680
saying.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.510
Do you remember--

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.420
JOHN CLEESE: I don't
even remember--

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.200
I haven't read the bloody thing.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.546
I just wrote it.

00:30:33.546 --> 00:30:35.420
JESSE NICHOLS: Just one
draft, send to print.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.570
JOHN CLEESE: Well,
yes, that's right.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.909
If I was happy with a page,
I just handed it over.

00:30:38.909 --> 00:30:41.325
And I think there's a point,
provided you're happy with it

00:30:41.325 --> 00:30:43.587
at one stage, if you
keep looking at it,

00:30:43.587 --> 00:30:45.420
you'll always want to
change it a little bit

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.100
and you're not necessarily
making it any better.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.890
And I trusted my editor.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.090
If my editor thought
something wasn't right,

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.721
he'd point it out to me
and I would rewrite it.

00:30:54.721 --> 00:30:56.220
But I don't know
what those-- I used

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.366
to have three rules of comedy.

00:30:58.366 --> 00:30:59.490
And those were very simple.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.280
That was, no puns was rule one.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.610
Rule two was absolutely no puns.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.920
And rule three was
no puns whatsoever,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.530
under any circumstances.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.080
Those were my three main rules.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.390
Do you remember what--

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:15.160
JESSE NICHOLS: One of them
was to kill the anxiety.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.730
And to do that through practice.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.700
So a lot of what
you were teaching

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.980
through going back and reviewing
what made you the comedic

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.892
and writing talent that
you became was process.

00:31:25.892 --> 00:31:26.600
JOHN CLEESE: Yes.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.450
I was very, very
interested in process,

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:34.190
in a way that most of my
friends weren't I have to say.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:37.090
They seemed to think that if
you understood the process too

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.360
well, that might
reduce your creativity.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.790
And I think that's nonsense.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.770
I've had an immense
amount of therapy.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.340
I had an extraordinarily
difficult relationship

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.930
with my mother.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.760
We finished up
fond of each other

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.850
because we had time to repair
the relationship, to make

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.800
reparation as the
psychiatrists say,

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:02.130
because she lived
to 101, not bad, ay?

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.770
But it was something that put
me into therapy a great deal.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.550
Because I was finding it very
hard to get relationships

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.460
with women right.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.660
Most of the rest of my
life worked pretty OK.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.710
I mean, I made the
usual quota of mistakes

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:15.600
that everybody does.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.140
But you know what I mean, by
and large, the rest of the life

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.420
was all right.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.180
But the stuff with females
was very hard for me.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.140
Because I went through
this single sex school

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.310
from eight to 18.

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:33.350
I mean, all you ever saw was
the maids who served food up

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.980
at lunchtime and the
headmaster's wife.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.420
And that was pretty much it.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.120
So if you have a
very odd mother--

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.410
and she was pretty crazy.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.380
I mean, she was just sort of--

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:48.050
I used to say that she
suffered from omniphobia.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.430
You name it, she had
a morbid dread of it.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.500
And she was terrified
of almost everything.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.190
And she needed her
own way all the time.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.310
And if she didn't get her own
way, she would have tantrums.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.575
And Dad, who'd been
rather a brave soldier

00:33:01.575 --> 00:33:07.041
in the first World War, he was
quite frightened of Mother.

00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:09.540
I think there were times when
he would rather have been back

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.790
in the trenches of France.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.840
He would have found it a
more tranquil experience.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.270
But because she was
very touchy, and we

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.020
live treading on eggshells
and all that stuff,

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.477
I had to spend an awful
lot of time in therapy.

00:33:23.477 --> 00:33:25.560
And people said, but if
you understand the process

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.530
too much, you'll
become less creative.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.260
I don't think that's true.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.880
I think what happens is
you become less driven,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.390
which means that you may
not be so productive.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.450
But I think it
actually frees you up

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.160
to become more
creative because you

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.970
can go to parts of your
mind that otherwise you

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.540
would have backed
away from because they

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.200
made you uncomfortable.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.794
Does that make sense?

00:33:50.794 --> 00:33:52.210
I have an instinct
at this moment.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:54.970
Does anyone have a
question about any of this?

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:55.777
Yes, sir.

00:33:55.777 --> 00:33:56.693
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:58.854 --> 00:34:00.270
JOHN CLEESE: Oh
yes, that's right.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.580
If you can go up to the mic.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.977
Thank you.

00:34:02.977 --> 00:34:03.893
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:31.714 --> 00:34:32.880
JOHN CLEESE: Yes, yes, I do.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.230
Because you see, what
you're going to say

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:39.280
is that if you know how
to use the unconscious,

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.360
you will be creative.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.139
You'll have good ideas, but
you won't necessarily-- sorry.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:47.080
You'll have ideas, but they
won't necessarily be good ones.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.710
I mean, just because you have
an idea, doesn't mean it's good.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.570
So then you've got to bring
in what I would call the more

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.689
critical, left brain part, to
assess the idea after a time.

00:34:56.689 --> 00:34:58.730
Because after you've
assessed it, it doesn't mean

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.780
it's suddenly a wonderful idea.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.030
There may be a bit of it
that you think is very good

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.850
and other bits that
aren't so good.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.652
So then you can go back into
the creative phase again.

00:35:07.652 --> 00:35:08.610
Do you see what I mean?

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.330
And start becoming creative.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.030
And then often you
feel a bit overloaded

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.500
when you've had too many ideas.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.875
And that's the
moment when you've

00:35:15.875 --> 00:35:17.990
got to start nailing them
down and examining them

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.190
with the left brain.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.500
So that you can have a process
of iteration, by which you

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.850
constantly have new ideas
and then you reassess them.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.680
And when you've
think you figured out

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.000
what's good and works
and what doesn't work,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.810
then you can start working
again on the same stuff

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.700
and just keep going
round and round.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.310
And I think that's what happens.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:41.139
I think you reach a conclusion--
you know Karl Poppers work?

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:42.680
The philosopher of
science, you know,

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.250
who said that really, you
never know what the truth is.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.080
All you know is that
the latest theory

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.220
is the one that seems to
solve most of the problems.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.197
But you never really
know what it is.

00:35:53.197 --> 00:35:54.530
And I think that's what happens.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.650
You take it so far
and then you suddenly,

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.795
suddenly spot something else.

00:35:59.795 --> 00:36:03.260
And then you integrate
that, and then

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.750
you suddenly spot
something else.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.310
That's certainly been my
experience a lot of the time.

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:10.190
Because, particularly
with audiences,

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.590
I'm constantly
learning from audiences

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.300
because they tell
you what works.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.390
And that my big surprise--
you see, in the old days,

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:22.080
if I went out in the theater in
front of an audience, I would,

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.590
if I wasn't doing so well, I
would think it was my fault.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.380
I would think, oh, my
timing's off tonight.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.230
And then, of course, I'd worry
and I would tighten up inside

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.850
and when you tighten up, then
your timing isn't quite good.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.640
Anyone who plays sports
knows that that's the case.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:43.380
But in fact, when I went into
movies, you'd make the movie

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.660
and you'd cut the movie
and put it up on the stage

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.210
and you'd watch the
audience and they

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.230
would respond quite differently
on different nights.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.280
And it's exactly the same film.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.510
You see what I mean?

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.630
And when I do my one man show,
I show little clips from things,

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.320
like the Black Knight sketch.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.610
And I sit and I watch
the first three rows

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.000
because the light
from the screen

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.250
enables me to see the faces
in the first three rows.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.260
And they're all laughing
at different times.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.240
They're all laughing
at different things.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.860
And I think it's because
when we sit in an audience,

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.910
laughter is infectious.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:17.859
And we tend to infect
each other and sort of

00:37:17.859 --> 00:37:19.650
think we're all laughing
at the same thing.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.600
but when you get people
sitting in at home,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.190
particularly reading
a book, you get

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.750
a completely different reaction.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.020
I mean, "The Wall Street
Journal" gave this

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.240
a dreadful review.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.780
Did you know about that?

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:36.030
I mean, they liked Dick
Cheney's autobiography.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.509
But they gave it
a dreadful book.

00:37:37.509 --> 00:37:39.300
And the people who've
been interviewing me,

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.730
who've on the whole, I have
to say American journalists,

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:45.505
television, radio, print,
are so much more professional

00:37:45.505 --> 00:37:47.774
than the British ones
who don't read the book.

00:37:47.774 --> 00:37:48.690
They've read the book.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.610
And they basically think it's
amusing and fun and quite

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.720
interesting.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.390
And when they saw
this Wall Street,

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.200
they'll all
commented, they said,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.320
this isn't the book we read.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.040
But the answer is, it is.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.480
But people's judgment
and their sense humor

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.560
is very much more
subjective than we think.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.435
JESSE NICHOLS: It's
those kinds of lessons

00:38:08.435 --> 00:38:10.250
that you extracted
that I think make

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:14.280
this such a must read for
aspiring comedic writers,

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.890
aspiring comedians in general.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.425
There was a point
in my life where

00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:20.657
I dabbled in stand up comedy
just to build my own confidence

00:38:20.657 --> 00:38:22.740
and interest in the subject
and just to see what--

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.050
JOHN CLEESE: How long did-- You
mean, you performed stand up?

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.800
JESSE NICHOLS: I did
stand up for at least

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.697
once a week for an entire year.

00:38:28.697 --> 00:38:29.530
JOHN CLEESE: Really?

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.980
JESSE NICHOLS: So, 60 or
70, yeah, so about 60 or 70

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:32.870
performances.

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:36.770
JOHN CLEESE: So what did I say
in the book that surprised you?

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.090
JESSE NICHOLS: One of them
was-- it would have just

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:42.220
been nice to know this
before going into it,

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.720
was this notion that
comedy is so personal.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.180
You have a sense
of this, but you

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.420
know that when there's
a crowd of people,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.829
they tend to laugh together.

00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:50.620
But you don't have a
sense of how different

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.470
the responses to the
same material will be

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.461
and how you can't
let that destroy you.

00:38:55.461 --> 00:38:56.960
You can't let one
night destroy you.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.876
It really should be a
trend that destroys you.

00:38:58.876 --> 00:39:00.830
JOHN CLEESE: That's
exactly right.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:03.896
That' extremely well put.

00:39:03.896 --> 00:39:04.895
That's absolutely right.

00:39:04.895 --> 00:39:07.840
If nobody ever laughs at
you, yes, maybe you're

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.810
in the wrong business.

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.060
But there's no
question, you can go out

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.920
and you could have one audience
rolling around with stuff,

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.630
and then the next night,
you have an audience,

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:22.390
they're perfectly nice and
they don't laugh 1/3 as much.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:25.010
By and large, if you're
in big urban areas,

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.830
the audiences are quicker
and they laugh for longer.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:32.800
And if you go out into the
rural areas, then sometimes

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.730
it's awfully hard work.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:38.140
Because they kind of-- you
have to prise the laughs out

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:38.650
of them.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:39.540
You know what I mean?

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.480
You have to put extra energy in
and underline the jokes a bit

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.720
and just make it all
a little bit simpler.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.740
And they don't even
laugh very much then.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.590
And then at the end
of the show, you

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.520
get this extraordinary
reception.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:59.510
And you think, well they
enjoyed it in their own way.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.929
I tell you, the
funniest audience

00:40:00.929 --> 00:40:03.220
I've ever-- well, there were
two audiences I played to.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:07.550
When we first went to London,
this little student review,

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.700
they put this into a little
theater of 350 people.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.030
And they gave us two
trial performances

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.160
because you need to
try comedy and you also

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.560
need to get to know the
feeling of each theater

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.310
because if you do it
slightly differently.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:25.260
I mean the hardest presentation
I've done with the book

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.150
was in a room that was
very long and narrow.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.010
And the microphones
weren't very good.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.800
Well, that's-- you're
immediately screwed when that

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.760
happens, you know?

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.950
But anyway, we did
the first night,

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:40.820
we did a sort of dress rehearsal
performance to an audience.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.340
And we'd done it in
Cambridge for two weeks

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.630
and in Oxford for a week.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.350
So we had a pretty good idea
of what worked and what didn't.

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:50.080
And this audience
was the weirdest

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.220
I've ever met in my life,
because they laughed

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.230
at the lead up lines, and
then were completely silent

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:59.680
when we did the punchlines.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.040
And it was utterly disorienting.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.956
It was the worst
warm up audience

00:41:04.956 --> 00:41:06.080
we could possibly have had.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.630
And afterwards, I went to
the manager of the theater

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.490
and said, can you
explain this to me?

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.780
And he said, oh yes, there's
a convention in town.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.756
They bought every
seat in the theater.

00:41:17.756 --> 00:41:19.130
And I said, a
convention of what?

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.480
Oh, they're all psychiatrists.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.890
And that was the single
weirdest audience.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:31.040
The other one was in New
Zealand at a matinee,

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.580
when, before we went
onstage about two o'clock

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.190
in the afternoon,
there was a noise

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:38.920
that we've never hear before.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.280
And we thought what is it,
a sort of tinkling noise.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.830
And it was quite loud, well
not loud, but it was pervasive.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.500
And somebody peeped
through the curtain

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.740
and we realized that the
audience consisting entirely

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.370
of 70-year-old ladies,
each one of whom

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:58.730
had a coffee cup or a
teacup, sorry, teacup.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:02.030
And each one of whom
had Parkinson's disease.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.940
So the noise coming
from these things

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.800
was absolutely deafening.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.110
And when we went
out to do the show,

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:11.500
we started to do the
show as we always did,

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.440
and we got absolutely nothing.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.020
There was no laughter at all.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.310
We had a lot of jokes.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:19.720
They didn't get any of them.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.540
But they sat there
quite happily,

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.850
thinking what nice young men
and how well they've shaved,

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:28.440
and their hair is
the right length,

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.580
and they clearly all washed
before they came on stage.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.650
And I was fascinated.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.740
I had a very good piece called
the Old Testament weather

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:45.130
forecast, when I forecast
the plagues, as a weather

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:46.115
forecaster would.

00:42:46.115 --> 00:42:46.990
You see, what I mean?

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.090
I said, well, on
Tuesday, there'll

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:53.890
be boils, and then death of
the firstborn, rivers of blood,

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:56.240
and my reign on the beast
and all this kind of thing.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.310
And I always got
a huge laugh when

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.490
I said moving in from the
south, southeast, boils.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:03.690
I always got a huge laugh.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:06.110
So playing to complete
silence, there

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.280
was a thing going on
between all the performers.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.050
I said, I'm going to get the
first laugh of this afternoon.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:13.510
I'm going to get it on boils.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.400
And we started betting money.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.210
People were betting $10 that
I wouldn't get the laugh

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:21.150
and I was spending
$10 that I would.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.700
And when I finally got out
up in front of the audience,

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.700
and I said-- did this whole
thing about rivers of blood,

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.090
death of the
firstborn, and said,

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:34.370
and now, moving in from the
south, southeast, boils.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:36.340
And I said it very
loudly so that it

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:42.350
would penetrate their
hearing aids, nothing.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:45.855
Except screams of
laughter from the wings.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:54.740
I'm standing in front of
this audience, I lost it.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.950
I just stood there crying
with laughter on my own,

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.610
howling, howling with laughter.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.260
And they just sat
there watching me.

00:44:12.451 --> 00:44:14.950
JESSE NICHOLS: Even in an early
comedy experience like that,

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:16.700
I can just hear the skit.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.350
I can imagine it in the way that
you would probably deliver it.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:22.490
And that's where the Python
I think resides in this book,

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.340
is in the moments and the skits
that churned and evolved over

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.550
the years, and became some
of your most iconic work,

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.450
and were probably hilarious
back then, but by the time

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:34.520
they were polished,
were really incredible.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.670
A lesson for comedians?

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.753
JOHN CLEESE: But I'll tell
you something very odd.

00:44:37.753 --> 00:44:40.030
That sometimes the
things that became iconic

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.430
were not received on
the first occasion

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.930
with any particular enthusiasm.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:48.290
If you listen to the
very original tape

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:52.770
of the parrot sketch
or of the silly walks,

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.330
there's a bit of laughter.

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.790
It's not like Dunedin
and the coffee cups,

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:01.790
but it's extraordinary, it's
just very ordinary laughter.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:06.280
And then you start thinking,
but so how did it become iconic?

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.890
And I think it
became iconic when

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:12.420
we start to do the stage shows.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.650
But after all, if you do a
stage show in Southampton,

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:17.950
nobody knows about it,
other than the people

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:18.990
in South Hampton.

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.900
So I literally do not understand
how some of these sketches

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:26.420
just took off and became
part of the language.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.920
And if you look at an
English newspaper now,

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.420
I would say that in a
week, there will be,

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.390
in any newspaper, there'll
be a reference to what

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.910
have the Romans ever done for
us, or this parrot is dead,

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:40.940
or something like that.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.350
It's extraordinary how it
passes into the language,

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:47.371
because you just don't
see how it happens.

00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:48.870
JESSE NICHOLS:
Lupins, or God knows.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:49.703
JOHN CLEESE: Lupins.

00:45:49.703 --> 00:45:50.775
Yeah, I love lupins.

00:45:50.775 --> 00:45:52.400
JESSE NICHOLS: We'll
will be opening up

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.150
for questions in just
a couple of minutes.

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.329
I guess one of the things
that hadn't come up yet

00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:58.120
that I thought was
particularly interesting

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.290
was the show where
you could tell

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.360
you were on the verge of
Python really coming together.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.620
And that was the "1948
Show," timely because it also

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.557
ran into 1949.

00:46:08.557 --> 00:46:09.890
JOHN CLEESE: Yeah, that's right.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.160
Well, there was a show
that we started to do,

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:17.220
after David Frost picked me
out of obscurity in 1966,

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.990
to do a sort of
a satirical show,

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:24.670
but with not sort of
political sound, not

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.150
political satire,
more social satire.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:31.280
And I did that and I did quite
a lot of shows at that time.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.190
And David knew that
I wanted to try

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:40.270
a slightly wilder, crazier
zanier, more mad cap,

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:44.340
off the wall, out of
left field, type comedy.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.530
And he asked me if I wanted
to do a show, and I said yes.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:51.150
And I wanted to do it
with Marty Feldman, who

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.270
I knew very well because
he'd been the script

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.770
editor on the previous
show I'd done with David.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.000
And he wasn't a
performer at all.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.400
And David, you know Marty
Feldman a little bit?

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.060
Well, David was amazed,
and he said, well,

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:06.335
Marty's not to a performer.

00:47:06.335 --> 00:47:08.550
And I said, he's
going to be wonderful.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.410
I tell you, David.

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:10.610
And of course, he was.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.850
And then Chapman was
on that, Graham Chapman

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.180
and Tim Brooke-Taylor.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.140
And we did these 13 shows.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.450
And they were very fresh,
they were very different.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:22.900
And I always used to say it
was half a step towards Monty

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:24.040
Python.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.950
And then, you won't believe
this, they wiped the shows.

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:32.990
Because this was in the
day when videotapes--

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:38.390
I have to use both hands but
they were that big and that big

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:40.100
and about that wide.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.080
So if you had 13
of them, it started

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.350
to take up a lot of space,
and they began to wipe shows.

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:50.620
They wiped shows with
Chapman, me, and Feldman.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.540
And now we're beginning
to discover them,

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:55.920
because they found five
compilation shows in a vault

00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:01.760
in Swedish television and when
Marty's window, Loretta, died

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.100
last year, she left
me a couple of tapes

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.300
that were in her attic.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.680
Nobody knew about them.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:11.210
And then David Frost's second
son, Wilfred, who's my godson,

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:12.730
found two more.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.790
And the one you're
talking about,

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:18.550
which was the last one we ever
did, we did 13 altogether.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:23.570
It's so like a Monty Python
that if I showed it to you now,

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:26.470
apart from the different
faces doing the performance,

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.680
you'd think it
was a Python show.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:34.140
And I had no idea that it
was so similar to Python.

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.040
I had no idea.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.950
I'd forgotten just
how similar it was.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:41.000
So this is part of the
story in the book about how

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.920
we got to Monty Python.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.200
JESSE NICHOLS: No, it
was really well played

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.408
and you could, just again,
you could hear the voices.

00:48:47.408 --> 00:48:49.710
That was your first time
seriously collaborating

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:51.350
with Graham.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:52.880
Or it sounded like
it was at least

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.280
the first extensive period
you spent working with him

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.960
and it also teed up
the relationships

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.500
you made with Terry,
I guess, the Terrys.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.350
JOHN CLEESE: I tell you what,
have you got a book there?

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.790
Turn to 295 and we'll
do one of the sketches

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:10.520
because this is example of
the-- this is an example.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.630
Excuse me.

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:12.520
So I hate these.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.512
[STATIC SOUND]

00:49:13.512 --> 00:49:14.504
Blech, blech.

00:49:17.947 --> 00:49:18.446
295.

00:49:18.446 --> 00:49:20.140
Here we are.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.860
You come into my
office because you

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:23.890
want to take a memory
training course.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:24.780
OK?

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.530
JESSE NICHOLS: Go with
the British accent,

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.770
just to stay in character.

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:28.260
JOHN CLEESE: You want to?

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:28.740
All right.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:29.239
OK.

00:49:29.239 --> 00:49:32.480
So I'm the guy sitting at the
desk and I say to you, come in.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.067
Good morning.

00:49:33.067 --> 00:49:33.567
Come in.

00:49:33.567 --> 00:49:34.440
Thank you.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.120
Do sit down.

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.607
Now what can I do for you?

00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:38.690
JESSE NICHOLS: Well, I'm
interested in your memory

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:39.440
training program.

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.650
JOHN CLEESE: Good,
well a lot of people

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.530
feel they'd like to
improve their memories.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.730
The wonderful thing
is, improving them

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:52.195
is not as hard as um, as
hard as um, as hard as nails.

00:49:52.195 --> 00:49:53.570
JESSE NICHOLS: I
beg your pardon?

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:55.740
JOHN CLEESE: As hard as nails.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.820
It's word association.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.870
You see, it's the
basis of my system.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:02.340
You remember things by
associating with uh,

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:06.227
with uh, people like that.

00:50:06.227 --> 00:50:07.560
JESSE NICHOLS: People like what?

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.200
JOHN CLEESE: They like
to improve their memory.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:09.980
You see?

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.720
Now, what can I do for you?

00:50:13.769 --> 00:50:15.810
JOHN CLEESE: Well, I'm
interested in your course.

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:16.500
Good.

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:17.000
Good.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.833
You remembered that.

00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:21.000
You see, you have learned
to associate your interest

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.650
in my course with
my asking you why.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.750
Association of ideas,
the basis of everything

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.300
we do to acquire
a better memory.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.400
But it's not as hard as um--

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.594
JESSE NICHOLS: I think--

00:50:32.594 --> 00:50:34.010
JOHN CLEESE: No,
as hard as nails.

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.080
Remember?

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:35.610
Never mind.

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:36.110
Never mind.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:36.520
Never mind.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.480
You'll soon pick it up.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.440
Now take a common
object like this.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.440
JESSE NICHOLS: A saucer.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.030
JOHN CLEESE: A saucer.

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.530
Good.

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:43.210
Well done.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.219
Now, what does it
make you think of?

00:50:45.219 --> 00:50:46.260
JESSE NICHOLS: Well, uh--

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:46.970
JOHN CLEESE: What
would you, what

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:47.940
would you like to think of?

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:49.230
JESSE NICHOLS: Like to think of?

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:50.130
JOHN CLEESE: A nude woman.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:50.720
JESSE NICHOLS: A nude woman?

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.490
JOHN CLEESE: A nude woman.

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:52.060
Well done.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:52.830
You're getting it.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:56.064
Now, what is the
nude woman doing?

00:50:56.064 --> 00:50:57.230
JESSE NICHOLS: Drinking tea?

00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.980
JOHN CLEESE: Good.

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.165
And what's she
drinking tea out of?

00:51:00.165 --> 00:51:01.040
JESSE NICHOLS: A cup?

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.140
JOHN CLEESE: Quite right.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.462
A cup and-- saucer.

00:51:04.462 --> 00:51:06.925
You see?

00:51:06.925 --> 00:51:08.082
Are you getting it?

00:51:08.082 --> 00:51:09.290
JESSE NICHOLS: I'm not sure--

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.206
JOHN CLEESE: Well, one
of the association idea

00:51:11.206 --> 00:51:14.390
is that the basis of our
method, indeed the whole,

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:15.570
the whole in the wall.

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:19.440
And what do I see through
the hole in the wall?

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.370
A nude woman.

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:21.750
Do you see?

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:24.530
Every time, every time, every
time, yes, yes, it's good.

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.667
Of course, it's such a
strong image, you see?

00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:27.500
You can't forget it.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.960
You associate that with anything
that you want to remember.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.110
Anything at all, numbers,
dates, names, anything.

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:35.090
Try, try, try again.

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:37.170
JESSE NICHOLS:
Battle of Trafalgar.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:38.530
JOHN CLEESE: Ah, Trafalgar.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:43.172
Trafalgar, Trafalgar Square,
square, hole in the wall,

00:51:43.172 --> 00:51:44.880
look through the square
hole in the wall.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.744
What do I see?

00:51:45.744 --> 00:51:46.910
JESSE NICHOLS: A nude woman?

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:47.868
JOHN CLEESE: Excellent.

00:51:47.868 --> 00:51:48.780
Excellent.

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.034
And who is this nude woman?

00:51:50.034 --> 00:51:51.200
JESSE NICHOLS: I don't know.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.630
JOHN CLEESE: The
Empress Josephine.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:55.260
1815.

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:58.900
See it rhymes, Josephine, 15.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.860
JESSE NICHOLS:
1815 was Waterloo.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.652
Trafalgar was 1805.

00:52:01.652 --> 00:52:02.984
JOHN CLEESE: Now, wait a minute.

00:52:02.984 --> 00:52:03.850
I haven't finished.

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:07.360
Uh, Josephine's wearing
boots, Wellington boots.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.510
You can't see her toes.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:13.600
So deduct 10 from
the 1815, 1805.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.459
Simple.

00:52:14.459 --> 00:52:16.250
JESSE NICHOLS: Right.
the date of Waterloo.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:17.780
JOHN CLEESE: Uh, well, 1815.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.280
JESSE NICHOLS: But
how do you do it?

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.571
JOHN CLEESE: Ah, wait a moment.

00:52:20.571 --> 00:52:24.400
Ah, Waterloo, Waterloo Station,
Waterloo Station, trains,

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.760
train to Brighton,
Brighton Pier,

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.480
peer through the
hole in the wall,

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:34.770
and there's the Empress
Josephine in the nude, 1815.

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:36.770
JESSE NICHOLS: But she
has Wellington boots on.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:37.990
JOHN CLEESE: No,
Battle of Waterloo.

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.781
Duke of Wellington.

00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:39.410
In he comes.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:42.470
Wants his boots back,
so he sees her toes,

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.660
no need to deduct ten.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.020
Waterloo 1815.

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.150
See?

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:48.400
JESSE NICHOLS: Fire of London.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.260
JOHN CLEESE: What?

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.710
The date of the fire of London.

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:52.710
JOHN CLEESE: Oh, well,
let me see, let me think.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:53.980
Date of the Fire of London.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:58.730
Fire, fiery, diary, diary,
Samuel Pepys, Samuel Pepys

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:01.460
had a diary, yes, he wrote
about the Fire of London.

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.980
Ah, Samuel Pepys.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:06.685
Samuel Pepys, peeps through
the whole in the wall.

00:53:06.685 --> 00:53:08.224
And what does he see?

00:53:08.224 --> 00:53:09.390
JESSE NICHOLS: A nude woman?

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:11.860
JOHN CLEESE: No, three
nude women, you see?

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:14.730
By the light of the fire,
he sees three stunning,

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.645
gorgeous, nude
women, sex, sex, sex.

00:53:17.645 --> 00:53:18.980
Sexteen sexty sex.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.054
If you'd seen that
sketch in Monte Python,

00:53:29.054 --> 00:53:31.220
it wouldn't have been out
of place at all, would it?

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:32.340
It's fascinating.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:38.330
So I had no idea until I started
going back a long time to 1967,

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:42.260
I had no idea how much of
Monty Python was, as it were,

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.679
encapsulated it
in the 1948 show.

00:53:44.679 --> 00:53:46.220
JESSE NICHOLS:
Absolutely incredible.

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.940
We have time for a
few more questions.

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.106
I want to make sure the
audience gets a chance here.

00:53:50.106 --> 00:53:52.050
JOHN CLEESE: Good.

00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:53.844
Excellent.

00:53:53.844 --> 00:53:55.930
AUDIENCE: I just had
a quick question.

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:58.800
JOHN CLEESE: A little
closer to the mic, I think.

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.449
Yes.

00:54:00.449 --> 00:54:01.490
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:04.890
I heard someone say
somewhere that all humor is

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:06.550
subversive at the heart of it.

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:09.875
You mentioned that you as
a child were subversive.

00:54:09.875 --> 00:54:12.280
And I just wanted to
get your take on that.

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.180
JOHN CLEESE: Yes I
think, I'll tell you

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:18.090
why I think--
there's two reasons.

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:21.450
The first one is
that people who are

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:24.240
very pompous and
authoritarian, they

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.920
have organizations, which stamp
out any kind of criticism.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.260
You know, people
are terrified to say

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.006
what they think because
if they really disagree

00:54:34.006 --> 00:54:35.880
with the people in
charge, they're in trouble

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.500
and they may get fired.

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:42.610
Now in places like that, and it
was a bit like that in the USSR

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:45.110
not so long ago,
then the only way

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:49.540
that people could express
criticism or discontent

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.630
was through humor.

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:52.470
They could make jokes.

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.650
So the ones, the
people in charge,

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:58.580
saw jokes as subversive,
as subverting

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.260
the system, the
power system, which

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:02.570
gave them all their power.

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:06.470
So they kind of dismissed
humor as subversive.

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:09.785
And there's a certain kind
of very puritanical mind

00:55:09.785 --> 00:55:12.060
that mistrusts humor.

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.020
There was a famous case
of somebody working

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:20.670
for Henry Ford in a factory
called the Red River Factory.

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:23.460
I don't know where Red River is.

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:28.080
But there was a guy there
who was fired for laughing.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.100
And then there was
an inquiry about why.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:36.140
He had been warned the
previous month for smiling.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.110
So when you get people
who are absolutely

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:43.850
obsessional about doing
things, then any kind of humor

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:48.020
is a threat to that
obsessional pursuit of a goal.

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.030
You can imagine
that there were not

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:54.410
a lot of jokes going
around Himmler's SS.

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:56.420
Do you see what I mean?

00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.240
But if you look at humor,
it's really about two things.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.270
If you laugh at a
character in a comedy,

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:08.520
it's always because
he is not, he's

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.890
not behaving appropriately.

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:16.130
It's only inappropriate
behavior that could be funny.

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.940
Similarly, comedy is
about things going wrong.

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.790
If somebody goes
off on a journey,

00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:26.370
and everything goes right,
there's nothing funny.

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:29.760
It starts getting funny
when things go wrong.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.850
So that means that
people are funny when

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:35.430
they're inappropriate and things
are funny when they go wrong.

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:37.980
So there's
essentially something,

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.860
when we laugh that's critical.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:40.360
You know.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.790
We're laughing at someone
because they're not

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:45.840
behaving appropriately or
because they screwed up

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.190
and so things are going wrong.

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:48.100
You see what I mean?

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:53.330
So there's an element-- It is
true to say that all humor is,

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:56.080
in some very subtle
way, critical.

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.590
Because if you have somebody
whose life is going smoothly

00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:01.230
and who is behaving
appropriately,

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:04.080
there's no way you
could make them funny.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.360
But that's a little different
from the subversive attitude.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.690
OK?

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:11.190
AUDIENCE: Is there
any dream project

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:12.750
that you haven't
had the chance to do

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:16.010
and what is one of the
biggest mistakes of your life?

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:18.960
JOHN CLEESE: Well, I think
trying to rema-- when

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.760
I did the "Fish
Called Wanda" sequel,

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.040
I shouldn't have
cast the same people.

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.080
Because it was an attempt
to do a quite different kind

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.910
of movie, and by
casting the same people,

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:34.260
people thought I was trying
to do the same kind of movie.

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.310
You know, I thought "A Fish
Called Wanda" was very funny,

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:39.540
but it's very sort of
cynical, hard-edged thing.

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:42.550
And I was trying to make a
movie that actually families

00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:45.500
could go to and kids could
laugh at it with their parents.

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.480
So that was a mistake.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.480
What was the first
thing you said?

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.396
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.840
JOHN CLEESE: Yes, I would love
to do a series of documentaries

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:58.810
about what religion would be if
the churches hadn't fucked it

00:57:58.810 --> 00:57:59.310
up.

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:04.395
I think that would be
really interesting.

00:58:04.395 --> 00:58:06.640
JESSE NICHOLS: Wasn't that
called "The Meaning Life"?

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.640
JOHN CLEESE: No, no, no.

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.242
Because certainly
"Life of Brian."

00:58:11.242 --> 00:58:12.700
JESSE NICHOLS: Oh,
"Life of Brian."

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.120
Sorry.

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.460
JOHN CLEESE: Yeah,
certainly "Life of Brian"

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:17.060
But "Life of Brian" was a
joke, not about religion.

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.240
But about how people
follow religion,

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.250
so it was related to that.

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.720
But I think it's
very interesting

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.120
because when I read about
the mystical experience,

00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.070
I do have a sense that
something is going on,

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:31.860
which is not entirely
explicable in terms

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:37.130
of the usual materialist
reduction, as scientists view.

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:38.500
Yes, sir.

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.750
AUDIENCE: Most of your writing
that I'm familiar with,

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:43.780
the sketch comedy
and movie scripts

00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.550
and corporate videos
and things like that,

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:50.160
are a very different style of
writing than an autobiography.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:54.219
I wondered if being so practiced
at that sort of writing

00:58:54.219 --> 00:58:56.010
made it difficult to
write an autobiography

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:57.510
or if it kind of
made it easier just

00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:59.130
because you're used to writing.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:00.960
And from reading
the book, it doesn't

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.830
seem like it was-- it doesn't
read like it was hard for you

00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:04.330
to write.

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:06.090
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:09.100
JOHN CLEESE: It was not as hard
as I thought, whereas you see,

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.620
if I think-- I have
a feeling that if I'd

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:16.820
tried to write a novel, I
don't think I could do it.

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:17.910
I don't know why.

00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:21.640
I just don't feel that my
skills would extend to that.

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:25.250
But because I've written
for television and film

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:29.326
all my life, it's natural
for me to write dialogue.

00:59:29.326 --> 00:59:30.950
So I knew I'd be able
to write dialogue

00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:33.650
but I didn't know if I'd
be able to write narrative.

00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:36.690
And all I did was, whenever
I wrote a sentence,

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:39.430
I read it out as though
it was a line of dialogue,

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:41.060
even when it was narrative.

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:44.450
And I just found that if it
sounded right, I left it.

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:48.370
And if it didn't sound
right, and you guys in IT

00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:51.110
will be delighted to know
that I wrote with a propelling

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:54.860
pencil in an exercise book.

00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:56.620
And I loved the contact.

00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:59.700
And I would just keep
on rubbing out that line

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:05.480
and writing it until it sounded
right when I read it out.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.540
And my editor, who did
an extraordinary job,

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.900
he said, and I'd never
have guessed this,

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:14.910
he said the vast majority of
writers are fine on narrative

01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:19.110
and can't do dialogue
to save their lives.

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:20.620
So I started the
other way round,

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.410
and found that actually
writing in the narrative

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:23.270
was not difficult.

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:25.270
But that was because I
just was listening to it.

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:27.690
And the nicest thing people
have said about the book

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:30.190
is that it's like having a
dinner conversation with me.

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.730
They can hear my voice.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:35.301
So I was surprised to
find that, but pleased.

01:00:35.301 --> 01:00:36.092
AUDIENCE: Right on.

01:00:36.092 --> 01:00:36.510
Thank you.

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:37.160
JOHN CLEESE: OK.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:37.951
AUDIENCE: Yes, sir.

01:00:37.951 --> 01:00:40.080
So we have a question
from the internet.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.020
From Rick Elliott,
who notes that you

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.420
are rightfully famous
for your comedy.

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.670
Have you done serious
dramatic roles?

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:50.542
And if so, would you contrast
those with your humorous work?

01:00:50.542 --> 01:00:51.500
JOHN CLEESE: Well, yes.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:55.640
I did do one very dramatic role.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.050
I'm going to read it to you.

01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:58.740
Have I got-- oh, yeah.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:00:59.640
Thank you.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.030
I think this is quite funny.

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:02.660
This was the first
time I was ever

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:09.730
asked to do a straight role.

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:16.050
And it was a very strange
thing that happened.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:17.920
Let me just come
to the right place.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.110
Because it was my house,
my school, 13 to 18,

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:26.250
was divided into houses,
groups of about 70 or 80.

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:31.120
And there was the house play
competition every spring term.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.070
And we decided to do "Faust."

01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:38.640
Two of the boys were
interested in acting,

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.140
so they got the big parts,
Faustus and Mephistopheles.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:45.470
I was given the smaller,
but crucial role of Lucifer,

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:48.640
the Prince Of Darkness,
the embodiment of evil,

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.110
the Antichrist himself.

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:53.000
Now I realized right
from the start,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.370
that playing Satan
gave me a chance

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:57.550
to prove myself as a
serious, straight actor,

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:01.570
but I'm afraid it
was a devil too far.

01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:04.060
Part of the problem
was my tights.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.980
Somebody had decided
that in order

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.980
to make my first entrance
as terrifying as possible,

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:14.590
I should be dressed in
starkest black and tights.

01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:17.870
Now, you know, because I've
related in the book earlier,

01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:20.500
how unmuscular I was, right?

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:24.520
My legs were so thin, I
could have played a flamingo.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.600
And yet, the director's
vision involved

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.070
putting me, of all
people, in black tights.

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:34.820
Now on the day of the
dress rehearsal studio,

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:38.050
I stood in pitch darkness
behind some black drapes,

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:39.950
waiting for the cue
for my entrance,

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:43.590
accompanied by a junior boy,
whose job it was to show me

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:46.960
where the gap in the drapes
was to be found through which

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.790
I could walk on to stage.

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:50.990
Then I heard my cue, the
boy parted the curtains

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:53.930
and I strode forward to
announce my first line which

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:56.285
was, (DEEP GRAVELLY
VOICE) I am Lucifer.

01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:00.740
Before I had time
to open my mouth,

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.260
however, I was hit
by a wall of laughter

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:05.080
that shook the building.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.710
It wasn't just the
tights, of course.

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:10.270
It was the idea that
this spindly twerp

01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:12.526
could strike terror into
people's hearts, when

01:03:12.526 --> 01:03:14.400
instead of frightening
the shift out of them,

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.030
he was more likely to cause
them to wet their pants.

01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:20.900
Thinking quickly and realizing
the situation was lost,

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.450
I ad-libbed, (DEEP GRAVELLY
VOICE) I am ludicrous.

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:27.100
Another big laugh.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.680
Now, later that evening--
that was the dress rehearsal.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:35.410
During the actual performance,
things began to go downhill.

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:38.440
I took up my position
behind the black drapes.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.640
And this time a different
boy was standing there

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.370
in the darkness.

01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:43.080
I peered at him and
said, who are you?

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.070
He said, I'm Topman, Cleese.

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:47.690
Gould has a music lesson.

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:50.000
So I said, so you're
parting the drapes for me.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.320
He said, what?

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.950
I said, you're parting
the drapes for me,

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:56.850
so that I can get on stage?

01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:57.350
He said.

01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.329
I don't know about that.

01:03:59.329 --> 01:03:59.870
I said, What?

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:00.750
Well, what are you doing here?

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:02.000
He said, I don't know, Cleese.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.610
He just asked me to
stand in for him.

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:07.490
So I could hear my cue coming
up in about 10 seconds.

01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:11.990
I start groping the
drapes in the dark,

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:14.400
trying to find the gap
myself, desperately

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.970
grabbing at the
pitch black cloth,

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:19.810
in search of an opening
as the seconds tick away.

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:21.250
And there's my cue.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:25.940
So I just walk forward
into the drapes

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:31.110
and keep trudging onward against
the weight of all the velvet

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:33.640
cloth that is clinging to me.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.030
And the audience start
to giggle at the sight

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:42.560
of this strange, increasingly
large bulge in the back cloth,

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:47.980
that is ever more slowly making
its way towards-- The actors

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:50.080
step back in alarm.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.730
At least I'm
frightening someone.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:55.180
And I manage just
to keep moving,

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.130
so that when I have reached
a point about halfway

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:02.880
to the front of the stalls, the
drapes now at full extension,

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.220
start sliding back over my
head and finally fall away

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:10.630
from me, revealing a
strange creature, a lackard,

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:15.010
stick insect, apparently in
a fright wig, who announces,

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:18.920
(DEEP GRAVELLY
VOICE) I am Lucifer.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.750
By which time most
of the audience

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:24.490
had lost contact
with their chairs.

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:25.645
That was my first attempt.

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.470
And then the next time I did it
was 34 years later for Kenneth

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:36.326
Branagh, when I was in
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

01:05:36.326 --> 01:05:42.520
and I played Kenneth Branagh's
anatomy tutor, Dr. Waldman,

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.410
and managed to play the
whole thing without getting

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:50.030
a single laugh, not even when
Robert De Niro stabbed me

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.520
to death.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.380
So that was a considerable
accomplishment.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.619
AUDIENCE: So you talked a lot
about the creative process,

01:05:59.619 --> 01:06:01.160
which was really
interesting to hear,

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.650
because I haven't actually heard
you talk about that before.

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:06.520
What changes with that?

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.810
You talked a lot
about the unconscious

01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:12.020
and how important
that is to creativity.

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.960
What changes when you're doing
something collaboratively

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.752
with somebody else?

01:06:15.752 --> 01:06:17.376
JOHN CLEESE: Well,
first of all, you've

01:06:17.376 --> 01:06:18.850
got to be very
relaxed with them.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:20.350
When you start
writing with someone,

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:24.170
it's just a tiny little bit like
a sort of platonic first date.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.390
Because you've got
get to know each other

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:27.352
and trust each other.

01:06:27.352 --> 01:06:28.310
Do you see what I mean?

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:30.680
Because you have to,
to really be creative,

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.660
you have to say the first thing
that comes into your mind.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.190
You mustn't process it
with the critical mind

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:37.770
before you voice it.

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:40.510
You've just got to say
what comes into your mind.

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:43.080
And that means you have to
have a certain amount of trust

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.800
in the person you're
with so he won't

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.320
think you're a complete prat.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.030
Or she won't think you're
a complete prat if you

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:52.150
say something that is silly or
dumb or something like that.

01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:53.640
So there's a
process in which you

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:57.060
have to get very, very
comfortable with someone.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.770
Once you've done
that, what happens

01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:02.350
is that the ideas
build off each other.

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:05.170
You sort of bat things
backwards and forwards.

01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:07.950
And they move forward
so fast that you

01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:10.670
can't see the
process at the time.

01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:14.200
But all you do is, when you
do get to the good idea,

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.320
after batting it
backwards and forwards,

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.380
you can never really
remember how you got there.

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.530
Do you see what I mean?

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:21.530
Only it doesn't matter.

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:22.470
It doesn't matter.

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:24.830
You literally don't
know who said what,

01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:26.880
but you know that you've
got to this thing.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:30.860
And it's because you've got two
minds batting off each other.

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.830
So you get somewhere
that I think

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:34.465
you wouldn't get on your own.

01:07:34.465 --> 01:07:37.170
Now, obviously you can't do
that with an autobiography,

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:39.240
because it's so highly personal.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.550
Now, if you're writing
a play, in which there's

01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:44.060
some particular thing
you want to say,

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.850
well, you shouldn't write
that with somebody else

01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:49.540
unless they have exactly
the same views as you.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.970
Do you see what I mean?

01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:55.470
You should just-- I think
that thing that sums it up.

01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:58.044
You get to a place you'd
never get on our own.

01:07:58.044 --> 01:07:59.960
That's the advantage of
collaborative writing.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.245
But I have to say, you have
to keep the group very small.

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:06.520
If you try and get four people
writing creatively together,

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.320
you get nothing done at all.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.320
Because always one of
the four will disagree.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.770
When there's three, you could
get a certain amount done,

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:15.020
but it's a slower process.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.450
So I think really
two is the best.

01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:18.910
And what used to
happen in Python,

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:21.600
we worked in twos
and ones, and then we

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.870
would get together
every six or seven days

01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:27.100
and read out what we'd written.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.640
And then we would simply see
whether we laughed or not.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.020
I mean it was very simple.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.350
If we all thought it was
funny, we all laughed,

01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:34.770
it was in the show.

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:37.314
And if not, we would send
it off to some other show.

01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:41.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.700
JOHN CLEESE: OK.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.760
Yes.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.260
Hello.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.968
AUDIENCE: A few years
ago, I found myself

01:08:45.968 --> 01:08:47.350
at the Globe Theatre in London.

01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:49.100
And I was standing on
a paving stone that

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.069
said Michael Palin
spelled incorrectly.

01:08:52.069 --> 01:08:55.290
And next to it was one with
your name, spelled correctly.

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:57.552
JOHN CLEESE: Say that,
one was Michael Palin

01:08:57.552 --> 01:08:58.819
AUDIENCE: Pallen.

01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:01.210
JOHN CLEESE: Palin,
you must say Palin.

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:02.710
He doesn't like
being called Pallen.

01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:04.390
AUDIENCE: But it
was spelled Pallen.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:05.640
JOHN CLEESE: Oh, that's right.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.229
OK.

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.450
That's right.

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:06.949
Yes.

01:09:06.949 --> 01:09:08.819
You're absolutely right.

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:09.770
Oh, my god.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.359
You're way ahead of me.

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:12.200
That's right.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:15.859
Michael doesn't like
being called Pallen.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:27.529
So I paid-- I paid to have
one of those stones put

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:28.540
in with a double L.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:33.620
Oh, the worst thing I ever did
was, at the Hampstead Theater,

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:37.950
when they were asking people who
went regularly, to put up money

01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:41.210
to buy seats in
people's names, right?

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:44.899
And I bought one of the
name of Martin Bormann.

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:52.390
Now, he was part of Hitler's
very tight group of associates.

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:53.910
And nobody spotted it.

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.480
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if Michael Palin knows

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.390
about that stone at the Globe.

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:04.590
And if you know, what
his reaction was?

01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:08.580
JOHN CLEESE: You know,
I'm not absolutely sure.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.510
I will ask him.

01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:11.300
But I'll tell you
a story about Palin

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.590
because he and I played jokes
on each other all the time.

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:18.260
And on one occasion,
somebody came to me and said,

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:23.680
would you and Michael like
to do some program together?

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.390
And I thought that would be fun.

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:27.140
So I thought how do I
get hold of Michael?

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.990
So I called his home.

01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:30.130
And Helen answered.

01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:34.990
And of course, he was off making
one of those, [YAWN] sorry,

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:36.750
one of those travel
programs of his.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:44.820
And Helen said, he's at
this hotel in Helsinki.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.910
So I thought well, I'll give
him a call this evening when

01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:49.910
he's finished shooting.

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:52.380
And I called him
and asked for him.

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:55.880
I said, can I speak
to Mr. Palin, please.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.650
And there was the usual delay
while they put me through.

01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:01.220
And while I was waiting,
I thought to myself,

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:04.420
he doesn't know who this is.

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:07.230
Then I thought, he
doesn't know where I am.

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:09.020
So when he answered
the phone, and said,

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.228
hello, I said, (IN A NORWEGIAN
ACCENT) Ah, Mr. Palin,

01:11:11.228 --> 01:11:15.110
my name is Larsley Bristom,
I'm a television producer

01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:18.220
with NRK television in Oslo.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:23.270
And were wondering if you might
just do an interview with us.

01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:25.765
And he said, I'm awfully sorry
because I'm going to bed now

01:11:25.765 --> 01:11:27.300
and I'm off early
in the morning.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.250
And I said, no, Mr. Palin,
not an interview tomorrow,

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:33.200
but an interview now.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.200
He said, now?

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:38.290
I said, yes, I'm downstairs
in the lobby of your hotel

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:40.040
with a film crew.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.600
And we have the chairs set
up and the lighting is ready.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.252
Could you come down?

01:11:46.252 --> 01:11:50.150
And he said, I'm
already in my pajamas.

01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:52.800
And I said, Oh, the
Norwegians would

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.990
think that was
very witty, if you

01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:59.810
do the interview in
your pajamas, Mr. Palin.

01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:02.650
That would be really funny.

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:07.790
He started to get quite ratty,
which Michael very seldom does.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:08.910
So I kept going.

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:12.412
I said, but it's so important
that we interview you.

01:12:12.412 --> 01:12:14.120
And he said, well why
is it so important.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.910
I said, because we're doing
it to tribute to the greatest

01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:20.110
comedian in the world,
Mr. John Cleese.

01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:33.595
And it's very important that
we speak to one of his helpers.

01:12:48.778 --> 01:12:50.580
He began getting really cross.

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:54.790
And I said, Michael, it's me.

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.300
And I swear, he laughed
for two minutes.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.150
I mean, he just--

01:13:05.685 --> 01:13:06.310
We've finished.

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:07.393
JESSE NICHOLS: I think so.

01:13:07.393 --> 01:13:08.630
I think that wraps it up.

01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:10.927
JOHN CLEESE: Are you all happy?

01:13:10.927 --> 01:13:11.905
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:11.905 --> 01:13:12.883
JOHN CLEESE: Thank you.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.730
Oh, incidentally,
any of you who've

01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:21.840
been nice enough
to buy a book, I

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.130
will be very happy to
sign that, if you'd

01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:26.470
like to bring it up to me now.

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:29.750
OK, I'll put your
name and my signature,

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:32.082
unless you want someone
else's like Michael's.

01:13:32.082 --> 01:13:34.040
JESSE NICHOLS: Thank you
everyone, for joining.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:37.690
And John Cleese.
