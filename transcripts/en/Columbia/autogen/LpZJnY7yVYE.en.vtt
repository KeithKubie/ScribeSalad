compete with China economically so we're
 

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.010
compete with China economically so we're
going to have to look to something that

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.020
going to have to look to something that
 

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.480
going to have to look to something that
looks like better regional integration

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:39.490
looks like better regional integration

and I think Iraq could be a driver of

and I think Iraq could be a driver of
that and it's particularly given its

that and it's particularly given its

energy resources and its central

and what would it cost to get you over
 

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.509
and what would it cost to get you over
that anxiety right um I'll probably

that anxiety right um I'll probably

never be over that anxiety I will

kind of commitment one that it probably
 

00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:49.299
kind of commitment one that it probably
wasn't possible to turn Iraq around and

00:20:49.299 --> 00:20:49.309
wasn't possible to turn Iraq around and
 

00:20:49.309 --> 00:20:51.519
wasn't possible to turn Iraq around and

00:35:35.979 --> 00:35:35.989
risk of really bad things happening or
 

00:35:35.989 --> 00:35:39.720
risk of really bad things happening or
do you want this kind of continuing

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:39.730
do you want this kind of continuing
 

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:44.109
do you want this kind of continuing
stream of highly reactive very tactical

00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119
stream of highly reactive very tactical
 

00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:47.249
stream of highly reactive very tactical
and unambitious you know policy outcomes

00:35:47.249 --> 00:35:47.259
and unambitious you know policy outcomes
 

00:35:47.259 --> 00:35:51.339
and unambitious you know policy outcomes
the other thing you know that I would

00:35:51.339 --> 00:35:51.349
the other thing you know that I would
 

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:53.019
the other thing you know that I would
look to would be some intelligence

00:35:53.019 --> 00:35:53.029
look to would be some intelligence
 

00:35:53.029 --> 00:35:54.339
look to would be some intelligence
reform we were talking about this a

00:35:54.339 --> 00:35:54.349
reform we were talking about this a
 

00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:56.109
reform we were talking about this a
second ago you know we can talk about it

00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119
second ago you know we can talk about it
 

00:35:56.119 --> 00:35:59.220
second ago you know we can talk about it
more but I think that's any real issue

00:35:59.220 --> 00:35:59.230
more but I think that's any real issue
 

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:03.390
more but I think that's any real issue
just if I can jump in on the interagency

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:03.400
just if I can jump in on the interagency
 

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.579
just if I can jump in on the interagency
one of the things that I'm pretty

00:36:06.579 --> 00:36:06.589
one of the things that I'm pretty
 

00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:08.200
one of the things that I'm pretty
certain about is I will never hear

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:08.210
certain about is I will never hear
 

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.239
certain about is I will never hear
anyone in government say the interagency

00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:10.249
anyone in government say the interagency
 

00:36:10.249 --> 00:36:12.670
anyone in government say the interagency
is working well you know it's always

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680
is working well you know it's always
 

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.660
is working well you know it's always
interagency is broken I think that that

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:16.670
interagency is broken I think that that
 

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.430
interagency is broken I think that that
we can expect and the question is just

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440
we can expect and the question is just
 

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.700
we can expect and the question is just
you know how broken is the interagency

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:20.710
you know how broken is the interagency
 

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.620
you know how broken is the interagency
and I'm sympathetic to what Steven just

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:23.630
and I'm sympathetic to what Steven just
 

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.569
and I'm sympathetic to what Steven just
described which is maybe you either have

00:36:25.569 --> 00:36:25.579
described which is maybe you either have
 

00:36:25.579 --> 00:36:28.660
described which is maybe you either have
to settle for really mundane incremental

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:28.670
to settle for really mundane incremental
 

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.249
to settle for really mundane incremental
decisions that never have the

00:36:30.249 --> 00:36:30.259
decisions that never have the
 

00:36:30.259 --> 00:36:32.739
decisions that never have the
possibility of changing a strategic

00:36:32.739 --> 00:36:32.749
possibility of changing a strategic
 

00:36:32.749 --> 00:36:34.359
possibility of changing a strategic
picture in a fundamental way if you work

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:34.369
picture in a fundamental way if you work
 

00:36:34.369 --> 00:36:37.569
picture in a fundamental way if you work
through the bureaucracy or run the risk

00:36:37.569 --> 00:36:37.579
through the bureaucracy or run the risk
 

00:36:37.579 --> 00:36:40.029
through the bureaucracy or run the risk
of having decisions that turn out to be

00:36:40.029 --> 00:36:40.039
of having decisions that turn out to be
 

00:36:40.039 --> 00:36:42.430
of having decisions that turn out to be
really poor decisions if you circumvent

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440
really poor decisions if you circumvent
 

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.529
really poor decisions if you circumvent
that bureaucracy and I think you know

00:36:44.529 --> 00:36:44.539
that bureaucracy and I think you know
 

00:36:44.539 --> 00:36:46.029
that bureaucracy and I think you know
there's certainly plenty of examples to

00:36:46.029 --> 00:36:46.039
there's certainly plenty of examples to
 

00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:49.390
there's certainly plenty of examples to
support either of those propositions but

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400
support either of those propositions but
 

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.069
support either of those propositions but
I do think that we have learned a little

00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079
I do think that we have learned a little
 

00:36:51.079 --> 00:36:53.319
I do think that we have learned a little
bit about the conditions that are

00:36:53.319 --> 00:36:53.329
bit about the conditions that are
 

00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:55.539
bit about the conditions that are
required to make the interagency work in

00:36:55.539 --> 00:36:55.549
required to make the interagency work in
 

00:36:55.549 --> 00:36:57.819
required to make the interagency work in
a way that actually can produce a good

00:36:57.819 --> 00:36:57.829
a way that actually can produce a good
 

00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:59.470
a way that actually can produce a good
decision and when I mean a good decision

00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480
decision and when I mean a good decision
 

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.039
decision and when I mean a good decision
a set of prescriptions or a strategy

00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:03.049
a set of prescriptions or a strategy
 

00:37:03.049 --> 00:37:05.229
a set of prescriptions or a strategy
that is actually related to the

00:37:05.229 --> 00:37:05.239
that is actually related to the
 

00:37:05.239 --> 00:37:07.839
that is actually related to the
situation in the problem at hand and

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:07.849
situation in the problem at hand and
 

00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:10.329
situation in the problem at hand and
just drawing on my own personal

00:37:10.329 --> 00:37:10.339
just drawing on my own personal
 

00:37:10.339 --> 00:37:12.789
just drawing on my own personal
experience I would look back to not the

00:37:12.789 --> 00:37:12.799
experience I would look back to not the
 

00:37:12.799 --> 00:37:15.670
experience I would look back to not the
first decision on Iraq in 2003 but the

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680
first decision on Iraq in 2003 but the
 

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.289
first decision on Iraq in 2003 but the
second big decision on Iraq which was

00:37:17.289 --> 00:37:17.299
second big decision on Iraq which was
 

00:37:17.299 --> 00:37:20.620
second big decision on Iraq which was
that related to the surge that was the

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:20.630
that related to the surge that was the
 

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.680
that related to the surge that was the
the fullness of that decision making

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:23.690
the fullness of that decision making
 

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.140
the fullness of that decision making
process by President Bush I think was in

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:26.150
process by President Bush I think was in
 

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.589
process by President Bush I think was in
part a reaction to the the real poor

00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599
part a reaction to the the real poor
 

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:31.210
part a reaction to the the real poor
quality of the decision-making process

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:31.220
quality of the decision-making process
 

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.799
quality of the decision-making process
by the same president in 2003 and

00:37:33.799 --> 00:37:33.809
by the same president in 2003 and
 

00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:35.929
by the same president in 2003 and
a little bit of a learning curve but not

00:37:35.929 --> 00:37:35.939
a little bit of a learning curve but not
 

00:37:35.939 --> 00:37:38.599
a little bit of a learning curve but not
to go into that entire process but just

00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:38.609
to go into that entire process but just
 

00:37:38.609 --> 00:37:40.549
to go into that entire process but just
to say that there are two things I think

00:37:40.549 --> 00:37:40.559
to say that there are two things I think
 

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:43.309
to say that there are two things I think
that do make the interagency more likely

00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319
that do make the interagency more likely
 

00:37:43.319 --> 00:37:46.009
that do make the interagency more likely
to produce something useful and bigger

00:37:46.009 --> 00:37:46.019
to produce something useful and bigger
 

00:37:46.019 --> 00:37:48.559
to produce something useful and bigger
than incremental or one really clear

00:37:48.559 --> 00:37:48.569
than incremental or one really clear
 

00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:50.839
than incremental or one really clear
strategic guidance from the president

00:37:50.839 --> 00:37:50.849
strategic guidance from the president
 

00:37:50.849 --> 00:37:53.239
strategic guidance from the president
and so you know that that would be the

00:37:53.239 --> 00:37:53.249
and so you know that that would be the
 

00:37:53.249 --> 00:37:55.189
and so you know that that would be the
first thing and that's not always there

00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:55.199
first thing and that's not always there
 

00:37:55.199 --> 00:37:56.449
first thing and that's not always there
in any administration but that's

00:37:56.449 --> 00:37:56.459
in any administration but that's
 

00:37:56.459 --> 00:37:57.949
in any administration but that's
probably the most important thing and

00:37:57.949 --> 00:37:57.959
probably the most important thing and
 

00:37:57.959 --> 00:38:02.870
probably the most important thing and
then to is a willingness to keep the

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880
then to is a willingness to keep the
 

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.400
then to is a willingness to keep the
question open for at least a little

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:04.410
question open for at least a little
 

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:07.609
question open for at least a little
while one of the things and I'm sure we

00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:07.619
while one of the things and I'm sure we
 

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:09.199
while one of the things and I'm sure we
all everyone in this room who's been in

00:38:09.199 --> 00:38:09.209
all everyone in this room who's been in
 

00:38:09.209 --> 00:38:10.969
all everyone in this room who's been in
any government has battled with is just

00:38:10.969 --> 00:38:10.979
any government has battled with is just
 

00:38:10.979 --> 00:38:14.120
any government has battled with is just
the desire for an answer you know you're

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:14.130
the desire for an answer you know you're
 

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:15.890
the desire for an answer you know you're
never looking at something that's not a

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:15.900
never looking at something that's not a
 

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.809
never looking at something that's not a
problem and so when you're looking at a

00:38:17.809 --> 00:38:17.819
problem and so when you're looking at a
 

00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:20.150
problem and so when you're looking at a
problem people want answers in the case

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160
problem people want answers in the case
 

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.650
problem people want answers in the case
of Iraq or Afghanistan which are the two

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660
of Iraq or Afghanistan which are the two
 

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.329
of Iraq or Afghanistan which are the two
places I worked on people wanted answers

00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339
places I worked on people wanted answers
 

00:38:23.339 --> 00:38:25.910
places I worked on people wanted answers
yesterday and so the real challenge is

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920
yesterday and so the real challenge is
 

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.650
yesterday and so the real challenge is
to get people to keep the question

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660
to get people to keep the question
 

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.359
to get people to keep the question
opened up long enough that you actually

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:29.369
opened up long enough that you actually
 

00:38:29.369 --> 00:38:32.779
opened up long enough that you actually
can look at different options and then

00:38:32.779 --> 00:38:32.789
can look at different options and then
 

00:38:32.789 --> 00:38:34.660
can look at different options and then
thirdly and related to that is just the

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:34.670
thirdly and related to that is just the
 

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:37.759
thirdly and related to that is just the
openness of very senior people to

00:38:37.759 --> 00:38:37.769
openness of very senior people to
 

00:38:37.769 --> 00:38:39.919
openness of very senior people to
re-examine assumptions and that's a very

00:38:39.919 --> 00:38:39.929
re-examine assumptions and that's a very
 

00:38:39.929 --> 00:38:42.289
re-examine assumptions and that's a very
very hard thing to do when you have been

00:38:42.289 --> 00:38:42.299
very hard thing to do when you have been
 

00:38:42.299 --> 00:38:44.529
very hard thing to do when you have been
invested in a policy or a strategy

00:38:44.529 --> 00:38:44.539
invested in a policy or a strategy
 

00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:46.400
invested in a policy or a strategy
particularly if you're the president

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:46.410
particularly if you're the president
 

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.049
particularly if you're the president
you're personally invested in it to

00:38:48.049 --> 00:38:48.059
you're personally invested in it to
 

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:49.729
you're personally invested in it to
actually be willing to sit down and say

00:38:49.729 --> 00:38:49.739
actually be willing to sit down and say
 

00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:51.739
actually be willing to sit down and say
maybe the assumptions upon which we

00:38:51.739 --> 00:38:51.749
maybe the assumptions upon which we
 

00:38:51.749 --> 00:38:54.380
maybe the assumptions upon which we
based our strategy are wrong and we need

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:54.390
based our strategy are wrong and we need
 

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:55.729
based our strategy are wrong and we need
to re-evaluate them and I think Gary

00:38:55.729 --> 00:38:55.739
to re-evaluate them and I think Gary
 

00:38:55.739 --> 00:38:57.289
to re-evaluate them and I think Gary
sick made a really interesting point

00:38:57.289 --> 00:38:57.299
sick made a really interesting point
 

00:38:57.299 --> 00:38:58.819
sick made a really interesting point
this morning when you said we're at a

00:38:58.819 --> 00:38:58.829
this morning when you said we're at a
 

00:38:58.829 --> 00:39:00.799
this morning when you said we're at a
point we really need to sit down and

00:39:00.799 --> 00:39:00.809
point we really need to sit down and
 

00:39:00.809 --> 00:39:03.019
point we really need to sit down and
look at the assumptions that have been

00:39:03.019 --> 00:39:03.029
look at the assumptions that have been
 

00:39:03.029 --> 00:39:05.749
look at the assumptions that have been
the basis of our strategy towards this

00:39:05.749 --> 00:39:05.759
the basis of our strategy towards this
 

00:39:05.759 --> 00:39:08.900
the basis of our strategy towards this
region so I'm sure that the people

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:08.910
region so I'm sure that the people
 

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:11.469
region so I'm sure that the people
working in government have their hands

00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:11.479
working in government have their hands
 

00:39:11.479 --> 00:39:14.809
working in government have their hands
overflowing but hopefully they will find

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:03.490
many broad lessons that are applicable
 

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.720
many broad lessons that are applicable
and I'll just mention one simply in the

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:06.730
and I'll just mention one simply in the
 

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.060
and I'll just mention one simply in the
interest of time and that would be and

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:09.070
interest of time and that would be and
 

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.090
interest of time and that would be and
this is a lesson from Iraq post 2003 and

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:12.100
this is a lesson from Iraq post 2003 and
 

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:14.910
this is a lesson from Iraq post 2003 and
from Afghanistan post 2001 and that

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:14.920
from Afghanistan post 2001 and that
 

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.920
from Afghanistan post 2001 and that
would be that there are very serious

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:16.930
would be that there are very serious
 

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:19.080
would be that there are very serious
limitations to the use of military force

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:19.090
limitations to the use of military force
 

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:22.430
limitations to the use of military force
in terms of reaching your objectives

00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440
in terms of reaching your objectives
 

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.830
in terms of reaching your objectives
that I mean this is the lesson from a

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:25.840
that I mean this is the lesson from a
 

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.920
that I mean this is the lesson from a
decade working with people in those two

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:28.930
decade working with people in those two
 

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:31.080
decade working with people in those two
theaters and going to many conferences

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:31.090
theaters and going to many conferences
 

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:33.360
theaters and going to many conferences
which many of you have attended that is

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:33.370
which many of you have attended that is
 

00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:35.340
which many of you have attended that is
probably the lesson with the greatest

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:35.350
probably the lesson with the greatest
 

00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:37.920
probably the lesson with the greatest
amount of consensus that military force

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:37.930
amount of consensus that military force
 

00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:41.400
amount of consensus that military force
in itself cannot achieve that much and

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:41.410
in itself cannot achieve that much and
 

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:43.470
in itself cannot achieve that much and
that it always has to be coupled with

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480
that it always has to be coupled with
 

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:47.340
that it always has to be coupled with
other tools of diplomacy economics other

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:47.350
other tools of diplomacy economics other
 

00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:49.770
other tools of diplomacy economics other
things and so that's why it's a bit

00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:49.780
things and so that's why it's a bit
 

00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.060
things and so that's why it's a bit
striking to look at what has happened

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:51.070
striking to look at what has happened
 

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.640
striking to look at what has happened
just in the last 10 days or so with

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:53.650
just in the last 10 days or so with
 

00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:54.410
just in the last 10 days or so with
Libya

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420
Libya
 

00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.599
Libya
and to think about how much the

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:56.609
and to think about how much the
 

00:58:56.609 --> 00:58:58.849
and to think about how much the
conversation is around simply the use of

00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859
conversation is around simply the use of
 

00:58:58.859 --> 00:59:01.640
conversation is around simply the use of
force and how little discussion there is

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:01.650
force and how little discussion there is
 

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:03.799
force and how little discussion there is
about the politics that will inevitably

00:59:03.799 --> 00:59:03.809
about the politics that will inevitably
 

00:59:03.809 --> 00:59:07.010
about the politics that will inevitably
have to follow so how is it possible to

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.020
have to follow so how is it possible to
 

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.680
have to follow so how is it possible to
really say that the u.s. engagement in

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:09.690
really say that the u.s. engagement in
 

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:11.539
really say that the u.s. engagement in
this endeavor can be days and not weeks

00:59:11.539 --> 00:59:11.549
this endeavor can be days and not weeks
 

00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:14.120
this endeavor can be days and not weeks
when in fact it may be that the military

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:14.130
when in fact it may be that the military
 

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:16.400
when in fact it may be that the military
part of this engagement is relatively

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:16.410
part of this engagement is relatively
 

00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:18.829
part of this engagement is relatively
short although I I wouldn't even put my

00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839
short although I I wouldn't even put my
 

00:59:18.839 --> 00:59:20.990
short although I I wouldn't even put my
money on that but it may be but even if

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000
money on that but it may be but even if
 

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.620
money on that but it may be but even if
it is we know that before what happens

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:24.630
it is we know that before what happens
 

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:26.390
it is we know that before what happens
in Libya can be successful from the

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400
in Libya can be successful from the
 

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.190
in Libya can be successful from the
perspective of Libyans or anyone

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200
perspective of Libyans or anyone
 

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.079
perspective of Libyans or anyone
international community it has to

00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:30.089
international community it has to
 

00:59:30.089 --> 00:59:32.150
international community it has to
involve a very big political piece in

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160
involve a very big political piece in
 

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.799
involve a very big political piece in
terms of you know what comes next

00:59:33.799 --> 00:59:33.809
terms of you know what comes next
 

00:59:33.809 --> 00:59:36.620
terms of you know what comes next
another lesson would be don't remove a

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:36.630
another lesson would be don't remove a
 

00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:39.799
another lesson would be don't remove a
regime without having an idea of what

00:59:39.799 --> 00:59:39.809
regime without having an idea of what
 

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:41.299
regime without having an idea of what
comes next or at least what you're

00:59:41.299 --> 00:59:41.309
comes next or at least what you're
 

00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:43.190
comes next or at least what you're
willing to commit to the process of what

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200
willing to commit to the process of what
 

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.530
willing to commit to the process of what
comes next and we can look at

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:45.540
comes next and we can look at
 

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:49.370
comes next and we can look at
Afghanistan and talk about that so there

00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380
Afghanistan and talk about that so there
 

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:51.859
Afghanistan and talk about that so there
really are a lot of lessons which it

00:59:51.859 --> 00:59:51.869
really are a lot of lessons which it
 

00:59:51.869 --> 00:59:53.569
really are a lot of lessons which it
doesn't appear that we have fully

00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579
doesn't appear that we have fully
 

00:59:53.579 --> 00:59:55.400
doesn't appear that we have fully
internalized them some of the lessons do

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:55.410
internalized them some of the lessons do
 

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:56.539
internalized them some of the lessons do
have to do with the decision-making

00:59:56.539 --> 00:59:56.549
have to do with the decision-making
 

00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:58.220
have to do with the decision-making
process and I won't go back into that

00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:58.230
process and I won't go back into that
 

00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:00.440
process and I won't go back into that
but certainly you know we've learned the

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:00.450
but certainly you know we've learned the
 

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:02.569
but certainly you know we've learned the
hard way about what makes for good

01:00:02.569 --> 01:00:02.579
hard way about what makes for good
 

01:00:02.579 --> 01:00:04.339
hard way about what makes for good
decision-making and and what makes for

01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:04.349
decision-making and and what makes for
 

01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:06.349
decision-making and and what makes for
bad decision making but I would say the

01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359
bad decision making but I would say the
 

01:00:06.359 --> 01:00:08.839
bad decision making but I would say the
lesson about the limited utility of

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:08.849
lesson about the limited utility of
 

01:00:08.849 --> 01:00:10.670
lesson about the limited utility of
military force on its own is the number

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680
military force on its own is the number
 

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:18.079
military force on its own is the number
one there's a there's a Marine Corps

01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:18.089
one there's a there's a Marine Corps
 

01:00:18.089 --> 01:00:20.120

01:00:23.339 --> 01:00:26.930
Vietnamese is an American waiting to get
out and I think correlated to this is

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.940
out and I think correlated to this is
 

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.809
out and I think correlated to this is
our Constitution and its evolutionary

the ambassador said about reform in
these own countries the lesson I think

01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120
these own countries the lesson I think
 

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.230
these own countries the lesson I think
that many of these leaders might take

01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:05.240
that many of these leaders might take
 

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.300
that many of these leaders might take
from Egypt and Mubarak if the lesson is

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:07.310
from Egypt and Mubarak if the lesson is
 

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:07.780
from Egypt and Mubarak if the lesson is
that they take

01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:07.790
that they take
 

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:10.690

America turned its back on Mubarak I can

01:09:10.690 --> 01:09:10.700
America turned its back on Mubarak I can
 

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.770
America turned its back on Mubarak I can
understand that that's how they're

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:11.780
understand that that's how they're
 

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.230
understand that that's how they're
seeing it the reality is i think it's

01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:14.240
seeing it the reality is i think it's
 

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.309
seeing it the reality is i think it's
not that america turned its back on

01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319
not that america turned its back on
 

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:21.250
not that america turned its back on
mubarak it is that blue barks people

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:21.260
mubarak it is that blue barks people
 

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:24.370
mubarak it is that blue barks people
turned their back on mubarak and that's

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:24.380
turned their back on mubarak and that's
 

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.170
turned their back on mubarak and that's
certainly if you have a million of your

01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:26.180
certainly if you have a million of your
 

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:28.000
certainly if you have a million of your
citizens or half a million you were

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:28.010
citizens or half a million you were
 

01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:30.610
citizens or half a million you were
citizens out on the streets that we're

01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:30.620
citizens out on the streets that we're
 

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.370
citizens out on the streets that we're
not going to be in a position to uphold

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:33.380
not going to be in a position to uphold
 

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.620
not going to be in a position to uphold
a government against that kind of

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:35.630
a government against that kind of
 

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:37.960
a government against that kind of
popular opposition so i think the lesson

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:37.970
popular opposition so i think the lesson
 

01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:40.390
popular opposition so i think the lesson
would be a very wrong lesson to learn if

01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400
would be a very wrong lesson to learn if
 

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.530
would be a very wrong lesson to learn if
that's the lesson they learned from

01:09:41.530 --> 01:09:41.540
that's the lesson they learned from
 

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.390
that's the lesson they learned from
egypt is that America led its friends

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400

exactly as you said the absence of
reform had led mubarak to an

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:50.390
reform had led mubarak to an
 

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:52.539
reform had led mubarak to an
unsustainable position in which nothing

01:09:52.539 --> 01:09:52.549
