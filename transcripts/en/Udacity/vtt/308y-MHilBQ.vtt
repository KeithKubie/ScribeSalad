00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.480
Now you needn't prefix
yourself to just sums.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.180
Consider this example, imagine this as
a gorgeous terrain of hills and valleys,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.890
and I'm sorry, Georgia Tech and Udacity
only pay me to do eight bit landscapes.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.770
Now suppose at each point in the terrain
you actually know the elevation.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.230
Here are labeled as integers.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.330
Now, suppose you have a friend,
who stands here and

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.680
looks straight ahead, what will he or
she be able to see without occlusion?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.759
I claim one way to figure it out
is to do a prefix-max computation.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.370
The input array to a prefix max
would be the list of elevations.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.790
A prefix max computation would ask for

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.410
each point in the terrain, what is
the largest elevation I've seen so far?

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.990
Your friend could see as long as the
elevations in the terrain were no higher

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.020
than his or her position.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.370
Let's compute the cumulative
max at each point.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.360
Now to figure out whether your friend
could see this awesome landmark in

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.190
the distance, just look at the maximum
elevation at that point and

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.490
compare it to your friend's height.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.970
In this case is 4 is
a lot bigger than 1.5, so

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.600
your friend has no hope of seeing
my beautiful Eiffel Tower.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.020
Now the generalization of a prefix sum
is sometimes called a scan operation.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.840
To use a scan in an algorithm,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.170
all you have to do is say that you're
doing it and say what the operator is.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.100
For example if we were doing
a prefix sum then we would say we

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.440
were doing an add-scan, that's
a scan and the operator is a plus.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.240
Or as in the previous example we did a
max scan, you could have product-scans,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.860
logical add scans, or-scans,
whatever your heart desires.
