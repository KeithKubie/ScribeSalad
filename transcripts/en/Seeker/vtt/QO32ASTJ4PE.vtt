00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.180
These nuclear weapon explosions were 
part of a series of 66 tests

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.200
by the United States government during
the Cold War.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.720
The tests were conducted on the Marshall Islands,
a remote area of the Pacific Ocean

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.140
earmarked for unlimited nuclear destruction.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.000
These are the islands today, which are mostly
abandoned.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.880
Though they look like any tropical paradise,
these scenic views are tainted with radioactivity.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.400
The radioactivity left behind is
so high that you can't move back there,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.280
you can't grow crops there, eat them;
you can't drink the water.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.640
So we're talking 70 years later, we can't
go back to these sites.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.340
But Ken Buesseler and his research team 
went back, to measure

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.760
just how contaminated this paradise is.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.480
When a nuclear weapon explodes, hundreds of
radioactive isotopes are released,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.000
including plutonium-239, which has
 a half-life of 24,000 years.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.820
And though that rate of decay may seem slow,
if you’re unfortunate enough to be exposed

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.040
to a large amount of this over a lifetime,
it could lead to major health problems.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.800
- It’s called global fallout.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.580
And the idea was, where did that end up, right?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.420
And the oceans are one place where it ended up.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.120
Is that in the water?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.380
Did it sink to the bottom?

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.800
Is it in the marine biota?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.040
So one of the goals of our research trip was
to find where the highest levels were

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.260
of these radioactive contaminants: plutonium, cesium.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.520
Places we looked were the craters left behind
from the hydrogen bombs––that would be

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.660
the Mike Test on Enewetak, and Bravo Test
on Bikini, 1954.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.620
So these are tests that are thousands of times
greater in magnitude and strength,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.460
producing a thousand times more fallout locally
and across the globe than the smaller tests.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.760
A challenge that we had to this day is knowing
that, if I find plutonium in the lagoon,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.940
in an organism, is it from a particular test?

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.520
So we do a lot of what we call fingerprinting:
it's a lot like forensics,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.400
as you'd see in a crime scene.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.500
Ken uses radioactive tracers like radium to
determine where the plutonium has settled

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.060
and if it’s leaking from wells, lagoons,
or any other groundwater sites.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.680
Ken and his team found that seafloor sediments
contributed the most plutonium to the ocean.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.840
This wasn’t a complete surprise.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.120
Until atmospheric nuclear testing was banned
in 1963, more than 5 tons of plutonium

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.460
were dispersed in the atmosphere.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.760
Most of this fell into the oceans and sank,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.780
because plutonium is not readily soluble in seawater.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.800
Cesium was only about two times higher.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.480
Plutonium, within those islands, is about 100
times higher than just outside,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.540
so there has to be a source, 70 years later.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.040
Because of these nuclear tests so long ago,
former inhabitants of these islands,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.620
and now their younger generations, may never 
be able to live there again.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.460
- This is definitely one of those nations that
will suffer the most from sea level rise

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.700
due to climate change, 
so they have this double-whammy.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.420
They have the radioactive waste that hasn't
allowed them to move home, and now,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.320
they're experiencing the effects of sea level rise
and loss of their entire island,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.700
all their atolls, a place to live.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.220
Ken’s research here on the Marshall Islands
draw parallels to what can be learned

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.520
from the Fukushima disaster in 2011.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.060
- One's a nuclear reactor accident, one was
an intentional explosion of nuclear weapons, okay.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.080
But still, for the people who live close to
these accidents, these high sources,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.920
there's always the question of, "when can I move back?"

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.390
"What does that mean in terms of my health
and safety?"

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.760
It's been frustrating that we run 400+ reactors 
around the world's oceans

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.840
around the edges and inland, and yet we aren't maintaining a cadre of science

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.120
to deal with the environmental consequences
of doing that.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.600
We live in a radioactive world; we can't get away from it.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.840
So, despite us knowing about levels, what's
considered okay or not, for your exposure

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.930
through food and air, there's always something
that maybe is not considered.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.570
That makes it also very hard to say, when is
it okay to move back to certain areas?

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.400
And that's the same for Japan, and it will
be for Japan for years to come, as it is today,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.000
70 years later in the Marshall Islands.
