00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.756
Almost 50 years ago,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.506
psychiatrists Richard Rahe
and Thomas Holmes developed an inventory

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.616
of the most distressing
human experiences that we could have.

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:32.285
Number one on the list? Death of a spouse.

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.976
Number two, divorce.
Three, marital separation.

00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:38.676
Now, generally, but not always,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.785
for those three to occur, we need
what comes in number seven on the list,

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.281
which is marriage.

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:46.397
(Laughter)

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:51.578
Fourth on the list is imprisonment
in an institution.

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:54.737
Now, some say number seven
has been counted twice.

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:57.413
(Laughter)

00:00:58.356 --> 00:00:59.863
I don't believe that.

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:03.575
When the life stress inventory was built,

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:10.426
back then, a long-term relationship
pretty much equated to a marriage.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.606
Not so now.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.975
So for the purposes of this talk,
I'm going to be including

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:18.370
de facto relationships,
common-law marriages

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:21.128
and same-sex marriages,

00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:25.262
or same-sex relationships
soon hopefully to become marriages.

00:01:26.432 --> 00:01:28.799
And I can say from my work
with same-sex couples,

00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:31.980
the principles I'm about
to talk about are no different.

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.724
They're the same across all relationships.

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:38.225
So in a modern society,

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.125
we know that prevention
is better than cure.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.336
We vaccinate against polio, diphtheria,
tetanus, whooping cough, measles.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.579
We have awareness campaigns
for melanoma, stroke, diabetes --

00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:54.054
all important campaigns.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.615
But none of those conditions come close

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:01.840
to affecting 45 percent of us.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.944
Forty-five percent: that's
our current divorce rate.

00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:10.432
Why no prevention campaign for divorce?

00:02:11.312 --> 00:02:17.248
Well, I think it's because
our policymakers don't believe

00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:22.097
that things like attraction
and the way relationships are built

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:24.331
is changeable or educable.

00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:26.607
Why?

00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:31.198
Well, our policymakers currently
are Generation X.

00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:34.317
They're in their 30s to 50s.

00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:38.489
And when I'm talking to these guys
about these issues,

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:40.502
I see their eyes glaze over,

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.769
and I can see them thinking,

00:02:42.793 --> 00:02:45.689
"Doesn't this crazy psychiatrist get it?

00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:49.553
You can't control the way in which
people attract other people

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:51.427
and build relationships."

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.685
Not so, our dear millennials.

00:02:55.594 --> 00:03:01.487
This is the most information-connected,
analytical and skeptical generation,

00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:06.499
making the most informed decisions
of any generation before them.

00:03:06.523 --> 00:03:09.775
And when I talk to millennials,
I get a very different reaction.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.245
They actually want to hear about this.

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.108
They want to know about how do we
have relationships that last?

00:03:18.278 --> 00:03:23.322
So for those of you who want to embrace
the post- "romantic destiny" era with me,

00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:28.332
let me talk about my three life hacks
for preventing divorce.

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:32.576
Now, we can intervene
to prevent divorce at two points:

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.292
later, once the cracks begin to appear
in an established relationship;

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:42.251
or earlier, before we commit,
before we have children.

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:45.232
And that's where I'm going to take us now.

00:03:46.128 --> 00:03:47.866
So my first life hack:

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.574
millennials spend seven-plus hours
on their devices a day.

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:55.404
That's American data.

00:03:56.056 --> 00:03:58.401
And some say, probably not unreasonably,

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:02.599
this has probably affected
their face-to-face relationships.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.854
Indeed, and add to that
the hookup culture,

00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:08.821
ergo apps like Tinder,

00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:12.384
and it's no great surprise that
the 20-somethings that I work with

00:04:12.408 --> 00:04:16.305
will often talk to me about
how it is often easier for them

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.890
to have sex with somebody that they've met

00:04:18.914 --> 00:04:21.154
than have a meaningful conversation.

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:24.055
Now, some say this is a bad thing.

00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:27.505
I say this is a really good thing.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.026
It's a particularly good thing

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.256
to be having sex outside
of the institution of marriage.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.186
Now, before you go out
and get all moral on me,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.114
remember that Generation X,
in the American Public Report,

00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:45.541
they found that 91 percent of women

00:04:45.565 --> 00:04:48.277
had had premarital sex by the age of 30.

00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:50.069
Ninety-one percent.

00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:55.876
It's a particularly good thing that
these relationships are happening later.

00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:58.675
See, boomers in the '60s --

00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:03.206
they were getting married
at an average age for women of 20

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.140
and 23 for men.

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.761
2015 in Australia?

00:05:07.785 --> 00:05:12.717
That is now 30 for women and 32 for men.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:19.292
That's a good thing, because
the older you are when you get married,

00:05:19.316 --> 00:05:21.012
the lower your divorce rate.

00:05:21.036 --> 00:05:22.204
Why?

00:05:22.228 --> 00:05:24.715
Why is it helpful to get married later?

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:25.908
Three reasons.

00:05:25.932 --> 00:05:30.626
Firstly, getting married later allows
the other two preventers of divorce

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.881
to come into play.

00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:34.175
They are tertiary education

00:05:34.952 --> 00:05:38.006
and a higher income, which tends
to go with tertiary education.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.238
So these three factors all
kind of get mixed up together.

00:05:41.262 --> 00:05:42.539
Number two,

00:05:42.563 --> 00:05:44.925
neuroplasticity research tell us

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:51.183
that the human brain is still growing
until at least the age of 25.

00:05:51.207 --> 00:05:54.009
So that means how you're thinking
and what you're thinking

00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:56.359
is still changing up until 25.

00:05:57.034 --> 00:06:00.879
And thirdly, and most importantly
to my mind, is personality.

00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:03.212
Your personality at the age of 20

00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:06.980
does not correlate with
your personality at the age of 50.

00:06:07.004 --> 00:06:09.545
But your personality at the age of 30

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.985
does correlate with
your personality at the age of 50.

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.030
So when I ask somebody
who got married young why they broke up,

00:06:16.054 --> 00:06:17.534
and they say, "We grew apart,"

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.383
they're being surprisingly accurate,

00:06:20.407 --> 00:06:24.811
because the 20s is a decade
of rapid change and maturation.

00:06:25.197 --> 00:06:30.949
So the first thing you want to get
before you get married is older.

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.062
(Laughter)

00:06:34.218 --> 00:06:35.417
Number two,

00:06:35.998 --> 00:06:40.206
John Gottman, psychologist
and relationship researcher,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.406
can tell us many factors that correlate
with a happy, successful marriage.

00:06:46.853 --> 00:06:48.811
But the one that I want to talk about

00:06:48.835 --> 00:06:50.067
is a big one:

00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:56.373
81 percent of marriages implode,
self-destruct, if this problem is present.

00:06:56.397 --> 00:06:59.153
And the second reason why I want
to talk about it here

00:06:59.177 --> 00:07:03.071
is because it's something
you can evaluate while you're dating.

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:08.969
Gottman found that the relationships
that were the most stable and happy

00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:10.195
over the longer term

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:13.644
were relationships in which
the couple shared power.

00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:16.485
They were influenceable:

00:07:18.854 --> 00:07:23.077
big decisions, like buying a house,
overseas trips, buying a car,

00:07:23.101 --> 00:07:24.522
having children.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:27.818
But when Gottman
drilled down on this data,

00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:33.177
what he found was that women
were generally pretty influenceable.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.768
Guess where the problem lay?

00:07:35.792 --> 00:07:36.815
(Laughter)

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:39.266
Yeah, there's only
two options here, isn't there?

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.986
Yeah, we men were to blame.

00:07:42.497 --> 00:07:44.227
The other thing that Gottman found

00:07:44.251 --> 00:07:48.462
is that men who are influenceable

00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:52.904
also tended to be "outstanding fathers."

00:07:53.323 --> 00:07:58.210
So women: How influenceable is your man?

00:07:58.987 --> 00:08:00.172
Men:

00:08:03.038 --> 00:08:05.123
you're with her because you respect her.

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:11.027
Make sure that respect plays out
in the decision-making process.

00:08:14.445 --> 00:08:16.181
Number three.

00:08:19.213 --> 00:08:22.541
I'm often intrigued by
why couples come in to see me

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.408
after they've been married
for 30 or 40 years.

00:08:26.432 --> 00:08:31.375
This is a time when they're approaching
the infirmities and illness of old age.

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:36.075
It's a time when they're particularly
focused on caring for each other.

00:08:37.376 --> 00:08:40.044
They'll forgive things
that have bugged them for years.

00:08:40.068 --> 00:08:43.639
They'll forgive all betrayals,
even infidelities,

00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:46.024
because they're focused
on caring for each other.

00:08:46.048 --> 00:08:47.674
So what pulls them apart?

00:08:47.698 --> 00:08:50.446
The best word I have
for this is reliability,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.929
or the lack thereof.

00:08:52.563 --> 00:08:54.434
Does your partner have your back?

00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:55.725
It takes two forms.

00:08:55.749 --> 00:09:01.505
Firstly, can you rely on your partner
to do what they say they're going to do?

00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:03.056
Do they follow through?

00:09:03.706 --> 00:09:04.930
Secondly,

00:09:06.356 --> 00:09:08.047
if, for example,

00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:10.877
you're out and you're being
verbally attacked by somebody,

00:09:10.901 --> 00:09:16.023
or you're suffering from
a really disabling illness,

00:09:16.047 --> 00:09:19.923
does your partner step up
and do what needs to be done

00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:22.680
to leave you feeling
cared for and protected?

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:25.257
And here's the rub:

00:09:25.281 --> 00:09:27.206
if you're facing old age,

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.613
and your partner
isn't doing that for you --

00:09:29.637 --> 00:09:31.816
in fact, you're having
to do that for them --

00:09:32.523 --> 00:09:35.718
then in an already-fragile relationship,

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:40.680
it can look a bit like you might
be better off out of it rather than in it.

00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:47.895
So is your partner there for you
when it really matters?

00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:51.617
Not all the time, 80 percent of the time,

00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:53.887
but particularly if it's important to you.

00:09:55.821 --> 00:10:01.430
On your side, think carefully before you
commit to do something for your partner.

00:10:01.454 --> 00:10:05.917
It is much better to commit to
as much as you can follow through

00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:08.731
than to commit to more
sound-good-in-the-moment

00:10:08.755 --> 00:10:10.272
and then let them down.

00:10:14.244 --> 00:10:18.246
And if it's really important
to your partner, and you commit to it,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.341
make sure you move hell
and high water to follow through.

00:10:21.938 --> 00:10:24.623
Now, these are things
that I'm saying you can look for.

00:10:24.647 --> 00:10:27.573
Don't worry, these are also
things that can be built

00:10:27.597 --> 00:10:29.488
in existing relationships.

00:10:32.282 --> 00:10:35.716
I believe that the most important decision

00:10:37.234 --> 00:10:38.788
that you can make

00:10:38.812 --> 00:10:41.511
is who you choose as a life partner,

00:10:43.068 --> 00:10:45.989
who you choose as
the other parent of your children.

00:10:47.137 --> 00:10:49.007
And of course, romance has to be there.

00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:53.226
Romance is a grand and beautiful
and quirky thing.

00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:59.418
But we need to add
to a romantic, loving heart

00:10:59.442 --> 00:11:03.588
an informed, thoughtful mind,

00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:06.597
as we make the most important
decision of our life.

00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:07.813
Thank you.

00:11:07.837 --> 00:11:11.575
(Applause)
