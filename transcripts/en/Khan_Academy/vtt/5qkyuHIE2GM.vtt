00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.050
Let's do some more systems
of equations problem.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.210
In this video, we're going to
encounter systems that might

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.860
have no solutions, or that might
have an infinite many

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.440
solutions, and we'll label
them with words.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.700
So let's start with one.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.680
Let's say we have 3x minus
4y is equal to 13.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.250
Let's say my other equation in
my system is y is equal to

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.320
negative 3x minus y.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620
So the first thing-- this is
kind of in a strange form

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.100
right here.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.940
I want to get into the standard
form and maybe I'll

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.070
do elimination for this systems.
Let me rewrite the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.140
top equation.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.620
We have 3x minus 4y
is equal to 13.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.060
And let me rearrange this
bottom equation here.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.740
So if I were to add 2y-- well,
let me subtract y from both

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.840
sides of this equation.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.820
So if I subtract y from both
sides of this equation, it

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.820
becomes 0 is equal to negative
3x minus 2y, or negative 3x

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.860
minus 2y is equal to 0.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.190
So let me write that
over here.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.735
And it looks nice because I
have a negative 3x here, I

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:17.070
have a positive 3x here.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.076
Looks well suited
for elimination.

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:26.950
So, I have negative 3x minus
2y is equal to 0.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.440
So let's add the left-hand side
of this equation to the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.270
left-hand side of the
yellow equation.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200
And we're going to add 0 to
the right-hand side of the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.850
yellow equation and
we're essentially

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.890
adding 0 to both sides.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.300
We're adding the same quantity
to both sides, which we can

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.210
always do with an equation.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.350
So, the left hant-side, the 3x
cancels out with a 3x and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.410
we're left with negative
4y minus 2y.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.950
You get negative 6y
is equal to 13.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.715
Divide both sides
by negative 6.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.640
We are left with y is equal
to negative 13/6.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.330
Now let's solve for x.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.570
And we can solve for x using
either of these equations.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.050
Let's use that top one,
just for fun.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.210
So we have 3 times x minus
4 times negative

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.540
13/6 is equal to 13.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.800
Now we have a negative times a
negative, so those are both

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.420
going to become positives.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.560
And then the 4/6, that's
the same thing as 2/3.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.430
So this becomes 3x plus 2 times
13 which is 26/3, is

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.840
equal to 13.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.870
Instead of 13, since I'm about
to subtract 26/3 from both

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.520
sides, let me rewrite
13 as 39/3.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.830
right?

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.750
39 divided by 3 is 13.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.785
So, let me subtract 26/3
from both sides.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.500
The left-hand side becomes 3x--
these cancel out-- is

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.770
equal to 39 minus 26 is 13/3.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.360
And then we're going to want
to divide both sides by 3.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.920
Or you can view it as
multiplying both sides by 1/3.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.240
The left-hand side, we're
just left with an x.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.850
The right-hand side, x is going
to be equal to 13/9.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.010
So this system had a well
defined solution.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.050
The solution is x is equal
to 13/9 and y is equal to

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.480
negative 13/6.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.250
It only has one solution.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.810
So if you think of these as
lines, these two lines

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.300
intersect in exactly
one point.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.220
And a system like this, where
it has exactly one solution,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:07.300
is called a consistent
system of equations.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.740
And everything we've been
doing so far has been

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.910
consistent systems. Let's see
if we can stumble upon

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.120
something that's maybe a
little less consistent.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.690
Let's say we have a system.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.190
Let's say it's 5x minus
4y is equal to 1.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.340
And let's say we have negative
10x plus 8y is equal to

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.020
negative 30.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.180
Once again, I'm tempted to do
elimination here, because I

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.010
have a negative 10x
and I have a 5x.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:48.310
If I take this top equation and
I multiply it by 2, I'll

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:58.410
get 10x minus 8y is
equal to 2, right?

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.990
I just multiplied
both sides by 2.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:09.940
And if we add the left-hand
sides, we'll get 0x plus 0y is

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.180
equal to negative 28.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.360
So we essentially get 0 is
equal to negative 28.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.080
That's crazy.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.260
We know that that's not true.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.370
This can never be true.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.430
We're getting an inconsistent
statement.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.190
We're getting a weirdo
statement, and that's because

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.440
this has no solution.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.760
When you solve a system of
equation, it doesn't matter

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.550
how you do it, whether it's
through substitution or

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.830
whether it's through
elimination, like I did here.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.620
When you get one of these
statements where 0 equals

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.630
negative 28 or 5 is equal to 7
or two things that clearly

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.420
don't equal each other, when
they essentially have to equal

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.020
each other in order for the
system to work, we call that

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.510
an inconsistent system.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.010
And it will have no solution.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.960
So what does it mean
for both of these

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.800
equations to have no solution?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.040
Let's actually graph these.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.030
I think you'll have a better
feel for what it means not to

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.840
have a solution.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.060
So the first equation is 5x
minus 4y is equal to 1.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.730
Let me put it into
slope-intercept form.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:25.690
So if we subtract 5x from both
sides, we get negative 4y is

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.870
equal to negative 5x plus 1.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.750
Now if we divide both sides by
negative 4, you get y is equal

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:41.450
to negative 5/4x minus
1/4, right?

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.500
1 divided by negative 4.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.100
So this is the first equation,
right over here, in

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.690
slope-intercept form.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.250
Now let me write the
second equation in

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.870
slope-intercept form.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.390
We have negative 10x plus 8y
is equal to negative 30.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.570
Let's add 10x to both sides.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.770
You get 8y is equal to 10x minus
30, and let's divide

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.450
both sides by 8.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:13.870
You'll get y is equal to 10/8,
is the same thing as 5/4.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.020
5/4x minus 30/8.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:25.030
30/8 is the same
thing as 15/4.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.230
Oh, and actually I made
a mistake here.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.610
When we divide both sides of
this equation by negative 4,

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.020
negative 5 divided by negative
4 is positive 5/4.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.580
So I shouldn't have had
a negative there.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.650
I almost made a blunder.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.170
So there should be no
negative there.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.280
Then a 1 divided by negative
4, is negative 1/4.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.090
So going back to the two
equations, what do you notice?

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.350
Well, when you put them in
slope-intercept form, they

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.400
both have the exact
same slope, 5/4.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.210
but they have different
y-intercepts.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.160
So what would their
graphs look like?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.800
Let me graph them.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.860
Let's say that that
is my y-axis.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.170
That is my x-axis.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.260
This equation, its y-intercept
is at 0 negative 1, 4.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.080
Maybe that's that point
right there.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.370
And it goes up at 5/4x.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.586
That's a little bit
more than one.

00:08:14.586 --> 00:08:16.110
It's a 1.25x.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.050
Every time you go to the right
1, you're going up 1.25.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.490
So this line is going to look
something like this.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.590
I'm just drawing it rough.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.930
I want you to get the
general idea.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.150
That's what that line
looks like.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.800
Now this line, its y-intercept
is at negative 15/4.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.980
15/4 is what?

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.299
3 3/4.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:41.020
So if this is negative 1/4, its
y-intercept is going to be

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.270
way down here someplace.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.590
I'll do it in the same color.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.060
Way down here someplace.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.420
Let me continue my
x-axis down.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.220
This would be at
negative 15/4.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.400
But its slope is the
exact same thing.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.610
Every time you go to the right,
1, you're going to go

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.200
up by 5/4, so its slope
is going to be

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.800
the exact same thing.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.700
So what do you notice about
these two lines?

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.000
They are parallel.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.350
They have the same slope,
different y-intercepts, so

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.690
they will never intersect.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.350
These two lines will
never intersect.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.500
Which means that there is no
point on the coordinate plane

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.250
on the x-, y-coordinate
plane that satisfies

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.000
both of these equations.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.220
Remember, this line represents
all of the points that

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.910
satisfied this equation.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.790
This line represents all
of the points that

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.190
satisfied that equation.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.820
Notice, no point
satisfies both.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.990
There's no point of intersection
and that's why

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.300
this was an inconsistent
system.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.550
Let's do one more.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:10:00.990
Let's say I have 4x plus 5y is
equal to 0, and I have 3x is

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.520
equal to 6y plus 4.5.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.725
Actually, let me do a slightly
different one, because I want

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:13.460
to show you all of the different
types that we can

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.410
see in systems of equations.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.660
Let me clear this.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:30.240
Let's say my first system is
3x minus 7y is equal to 1.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.880
And let's say my other equation
in my system is

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:44.540
negative 6x plus 14y is
equal to negative 2.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.860
So, let's try to find the x's
and y's that satisfy this

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.570
equation here.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.550
And just for a change of pace,
let's do some substitution.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.210
Although this is very tempting
to do elimination here, let's

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.080
do substitution.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.470
You get 3x.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.490
Let's solve it for x.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.120
Actually, let's just do
elimination, because this is

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.860
just so glaringly prepared
for elimination, let's

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.710
just do it that way.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.090
So let's multiply this
top equation by 2.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.340
And what do we get?

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:23.140
We get 6x minus 14y is
equal to 2 right?

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.750
I just multiplied every term
on both sides by 2.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.810
And now let's add the
left sides together.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.866
You get 0 plus 0.

00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:34.870
And on the right hand side,
you get is equal to 0.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.270
You get 0 is equal to 0, which
is always going to be true.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.410
This type of system is called
a dependent system.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.550
So remember, when you get a nice
clean solution, that's a

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.780
consistent system.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.660
When you get something crazy
like 0 equals 1, that's an

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.730
inconsistent system.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.630
That means the lines
are parallel.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.980
When you get 0 equals 0, or 1 is
equal to 1 or anything like

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.210
that, you're dealing with
the dependent system.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.510
Which really means that these
are the exact same lines, even

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.450
though they might look a
little bit different.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.730
And to verify that, let's
put them both into

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.430
slope-intercept form.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.940
So this top line, you have 3x
minus 7y is equal to 1.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.080
Let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.360
You get negative 7y is equal
to negative 3x plus 1.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.510
Now let's divide both
sides by negative 7.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:33.020
You get y is equal to positive
3/7x minus 1/7.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.930
That's that first equation.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.510
Now let's put the second
equation into

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.320
slope-intercept form.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.570
You have negative 6x plus 14y
is equal to negative 2.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.550
Let's add 6x to both sides
of the equation.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:54.140
So you get 14y is equal
to 6x minus 2.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.430
Then divide both sides of
the equation by 14.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:03.490
You get y is equal to
6/14x minus 2/14.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.690
Well, this is the same thing.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:10.900
6/14 is the same thing
is 3/7x minus 1/7.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.390
Notice, they are really the
exact same equation.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.890
So if you want to find x's and
y's that satisfy both, let's

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.470
think about it.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.750
Let's graph it.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.380
So if that is my coordinate
plane, that's the y-axis, that

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.580
is the x-axis.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.600
This graph is going to look
something like this.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.790
I'm going to draw
it very roughly.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.880
It might look something like
that, where its slope is 3/7.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.470
So this line is going to look
something like that.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:39.970
That line looks exactly
like that.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.730
It's the same exact line.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.010
So when you say, well, what
are the x's and y's that

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.500
satisfy both of these
equations?

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.110
Well, it's every x and y
that's on these points.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.070
It's that x and y.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.750
That coordinate.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.310
That coordinate.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.110
That coordinate.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.260
There are an infinite
number of solutions.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.140
And when we use the word
dependent -- because you can

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.200
get to one of these equations
from the other.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.240
These equations are dependent
on each other.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.950
You can just scale one or the
other and rearrange it, and

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:05.930
they equal each other.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.020
So here you have infinite
solutions.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.950
Anything that satisfies one line
will satisfy the other.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.350
So you just pick an x.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:21.080
When x is 1, you get 3/7
minus 1/7 that's 2/7.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.470
So 1, 2/7 satisfies
both equations.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.910
If you pick x is equal to 0.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.490
0, negative 1/7 satisfies
both equations.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.210
And you could pick an infinite
number of values for x, solve

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:38.400
for y, and those coordinates
will satisfy both equations.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.040
Let me review this
a little bit.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.380
So we started off just with
the plain vanilla.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.120
When you actually get a solution
that is consistent.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.240
These lines actually intersect
in one point.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.650
Then you have the situation
where you get something crazy,

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.070
when you solve your system
of equations.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.890
0 is equal to negative 28.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.330
Definitely not true.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.180
This is an inconsistent
system.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.890
It has no solution,
which means that

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.690
these lines are parallel.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.570
They never intersect.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.520
And then finally, if you get
something that's always true--

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.920
that's just kind of silly how
true it is-- this is a

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.910
dependent system.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.700
These are going to
be the same line.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.340
Then you can verify it by
putting both of them into

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.840
slope-intercept form.
