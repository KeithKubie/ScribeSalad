&gt;&gt; CHAN: Hi, I’m Michael Chan. I’m an
Android developer. I want to show you a great

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:12.070
time-saver which is checking traffic on the
Map. Here we go, launch.maps (ph). Go to “Menu,”

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.600
go to Maps mode, let’s got to “Traffic.”
Here it goes, all green. No traffic jam. I

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.830
have this on all the time.
