00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:09.767
Narrator:
THESE ELITE-LEVEL RACING WHEELS
ARE MADE OF ALUMINUM.

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:12.567
THEY'RE DESIGNED
TO GENERATE A SMOOTH RIDE

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:16.567
WITH OPTIMUM RESPONSIVENESS
TO THE RIDER'S ACCELERATION.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:21.501
WORKERS LOAD ONE EXTRUDED TUBE
AT A TIME INTO A METAL BENDER.

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:24.267
THE MACHINE COILS THE TUBE
AROUND AND AROUND,

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:26.801
FORMING FOUR CONNECTED RIMS.

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:30.868
THEY MOUNT THE COIL TUBE
ONTO A CUTTER.

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:35.701
WITH A SINGLE DOWNWARD SLICE,
IT SEPARATES THE FOUR RIMS.

00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:42.400
FIRST, THE RIMS NEED A BATH
IN A TANK OF ACID.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.000
THE ACID REMOVES DUST
AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.133
AND ETCHES THE SURFACE
OF THE METAL,

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.434
BOTH OF WHICH HELP ENSURE
FULL ADHESION

00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:52.767
OF THE ANTI-CORROSION COATING
THEY LATER APPLY.

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:55.734
NEXT A MULTIPHASE
HEAT-TREATMENT PROCESS.

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:58.701
THIS RESTRUCTURES
THE ALUMINUM MOLECULES,

00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.667
MAKING THE METAL HARDER
AND STRONGER.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:04.334
THEY JOIN THE TWO ENDS
OF THE RIM

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:07.400
BY RIVETING ON
AN ALUMINUM CONNECTOR TAB.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.300
THEN THEY WELD THE JOINT
TO REINFORCE IT.

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.467
NOW FOR THAT
ANTI-CORROSION COATING.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:17.901
THE PROCESS
IS CALLED ANODIZATION.

00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:20.167
IN A TANK,
THEY PLATE THE ALUMINUM

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:21.801
WITH A PROTECTIVE CHEMICAL,

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.400
USING AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.667
TO DRAW THE COATING PARTICLES
ONTO THE RIM SURFACE.

00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:32.801
FOR THIS MODEL,
THE ANODIZED COATING IS BLACK.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:37.033
HOWEVER,
THERE ARE SEVERAL COLOR CHOICES.

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.100
NEXT A COMPUTER-GUIDED MACHINE

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.767
SHAVES OFF A MINUTE AMOUNT
OF ANODIZED METAL

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.234
FROM NEARLY A THIRD
OF THE RIM SURFACE.

00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:46.834
THIS CREATES A SMOOTH,
PERFECTLY FLAT AREA

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:50.767
FOR THE BRAKE PADS TO GRIP.

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.601
THE NEXT COMPUTER-GUIDED MACHINE

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:55.200
DRILLS HOLES
FOR THE TINY ALUMINUM NIPPLES,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.968
WHICH HOLD THE ALUMINUM SPOKES
TO THE RIM.

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.033
NOW IT'S TIME
TO ASSEMBLE THE WHEEL.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.801
THE FIRST TECHNICIAN
INSERTS A SPOKE INTO EACH SLOT

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:09.601
OF A CARBON-FIBER-AND-ALUMINUM
FLANGE --

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.968
PART OF THE HUB
AT THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL.

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:15.868
ONCE EVERY SPOKE
IS IN ITS RESPECTIVE SPOKE SEAT,

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:20.167
AS IT'S CALLED, HE SANDWICHES
THEM WITH A LOCKING RING.

00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:24.367
NOW FOR THE RIM END
OF THE SPOKES.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:27.067
THE NEXT TECHNICIAN
PLACES A SMALL STEEL PLUG

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:30.534
INSIDE A SPOKE NIPPLE
TO MAKE IT MAGNETIC.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.801
THEN SHE PUTS THE NIPPLE
INTO THE RIM,

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:39.667
AND, USING A MAGNET,
DRAWS IT TO A SPOKE HOLE,

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:42.868
THEN THROUGH THE HOLE
TOWARD THE INSIDE OF THE WHEEL.

00:02:42.868 --> 00:02:45.400
THEN SHE REMOVES THE STEEL PLUG

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.868
AND INSERTS THE FREE END
OF A SPOKE INTO THE NIPPLE.

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:56.901
SHE REPEATS THE PROCEDURE
FOR EACH SPOKE HOLE.

00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.334
THIS IS KNOWN
AS LACING THE WHEEL.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.701
THE NEXT TECHNICIAN
HOLDS EACH SPOKE STEADY

00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:12.267
WHILE TIGHTENING ITS NIPPLE
WITH A SPOKE WRENCH.

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:14.734
TIGHTENING THE NIPPLE
STRAIGHTENS THE SPOKE.

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:17.133
THE PROCESS OF PERFECTLY
ALIGNING THE WHEEL

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:20.834
BY STRAIGHTENING EVERY SPOKE
IS CALLED TRUEING THE WHEEL.

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:24.133
THIS GAUGE TELLS HIM
WHEN THE WHEEL IS FINALLY TRUED.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.234
FOR QUALITY-CONTROL ASSURANCE,

00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:30.968
THIS ROBOTIC MACHINE
INSPECTS EACH SPOKE

00:03:30.968 --> 00:03:34.200
AND MAKES ANY NECESSARY
TENSIONING ADJUSTMENTS.

00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:42.667
DEPENDING ON THE MODEL,
A HIGH-END BICYCLE WHEEL

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:46.167
CAN HAVE ANYWHERE
FROM 10 TO 46 SPOKES.

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:49.300
DIFFERENT SPOKES
FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS.
