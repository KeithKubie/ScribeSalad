00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 in this capsule we will be reducing the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.560
 problem of computer vision 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.290
 the purpose of this part of the course 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.980
 it is to explore the b to ba of vision 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.070
 by computer 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.599
 we're going to talk about operettas 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.949
 simple ones that you can 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.510
 apply on images found 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.800
 often in vision systems by 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 computer such as detection 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.630
 outline or the calculation of what we 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.490
 calls image gradients and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.689
 finally see an application that of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.400
 object recognition which is a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.679
 possible tasks in vision by 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.780
 computer that will require between 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.550
 others feature extraction 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.170
 useful from the game but the woody 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.500
 on what are called histograms of 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:46.649
 gradient let's start more for by one 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.059
 motivation of the interest of the vision by 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.610
 computer artificial intelligence 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.170
 In fact, it is likely that little 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 near all creatures and and rims 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.809
 already have vision so they have 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.500
 the ability to interpret from 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.510
 information related to the view for for 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.159
 watch pursued so actually on 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.840
 can easily imagine that it's a 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.729
 sense actually the vision that is very 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.610
 helpful to the survival of an organism that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.920
 brings a lot of information about his 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 environment know where is the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.270
 food where the predators are 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.890
 institude so without much surprise if 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.350
 for example, we look at the human being 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.330
 makes 25% of the brain about all that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.970
 this measurement is in town from a source to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.240
 the other but around 25% of the brain's 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.369
 the capacity finally the number of 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.880
 neurons we have in connections 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.689
 in the brain but 1% is either dedicated to 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 auxerre at least to the vision in the being 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.790
 human 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.710
 if we compare with other senses like 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.909
 louis or the touch is much more 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.220
 down around 8 3% so already that shows to 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.590
 what a sense it is of a capacity 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.689
 which is very useful for a being 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.270
 smart then it also gives a 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.149
 idea of ​​the complexity in fact of the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.969
 task the complexity of making networks 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.969
 vision tasks with a computer 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.610
 in practice we are already going a lot 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.900
 application of vision by 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.820
 computer a first is what we 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.000
 calls character recognition 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.680
 so I give an image like this here in 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.270
 input from a computer and I wish 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.050
 determine which character has 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.720
 been written either by a person or 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.280
 maybe print characters which this 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.870
 here we have this system called the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.110
 net 5 which was developed by 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.320
 researchers who are on task and 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.400
 landings 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.100
 in fact it comes from the work of 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.870
 yann that one of his colleagues who puts 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.160
 nokia world that amazes me father city of 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.959
 new york is actually the system that 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.430
 was developed here which is based on this 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.060
 called neural networks to 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.390
 convolution were deployed there to 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.209
 united states to read checks 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.980
 several checks in the systems 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.980
 bank in the united states 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.459
 the application knows it's the detection of 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.880
 faces again here we have an image you 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.050
 pull brien jobs from none 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.430
 so and several different approaches 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.630
 for face detection and that's 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.459
 something that we find more and 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.840
 more in the phones if he has 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.700
 this ability to take a picture 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.080
 then identify where the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.540
 people and specifically where is 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.130
 their faces so that it started from 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.260
 the tool the convoy in everyone's life 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.010
 the days that is usable in life 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.100
 everyday, too, you can 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.610
 do image search so 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.930
 google among others bones his system his 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.340
 search engine that takes input 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.360
 have no written request but a 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.630
 image query so we can give here 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.730
 an image or a system of google images 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.380
 and then came the hour turns and others 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.360
 images on the web that are similar to 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.310
 9 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.660
 we can also do that there are 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.610
 tools to do that in our own 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.570
 collections of sound photos were found 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.959
 the different pictures of a person 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.850
 we only have one hand and 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.549
 that we would like from then all 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.860
 pictures of that same person there so he 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.350
 has more and more in the last 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.299
 years have seen a lot of progress in 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.400
 the ability to interpret an image 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.810
 like that can find other images 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.400
 which were semantically the hymen 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.780
 that contain the same person the same 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.780
 landscape so on 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.470
 and finally we can do the vision 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.480
 by computer on video 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.730
 in this case it is an application of 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.020
 tracking objects that shows here so we 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.290
 has a video ie a sequence 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.200
 image finally distributed in the 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.780
 time and at any time so for each 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.790
 picture of each given moment we are 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.650
 identified in this case also in this 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.639
 example here where are the players 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.440
 soccer in a on a field so 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.600
 a utility on it could be for 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.669
 do an analysis automate the 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.610
 strategy of different teams by 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.710
 example I do not come here to the video in 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.479
 as it is on youtube 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.370
 which you will see as 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.070
 as the video unfolds we see 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.960
 that the rectangles here that identifies the 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.270
 position of the different players 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.690
 move a follow anyway enough 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.190
 well the shape of the players on the ground 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.680
 about examples of applications of 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.720
 computer vision in this part 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.700
 short of it we will really focus 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.100
 on the country addresses the foundations of the 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.479
 computer vision that are often 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.700
 mentioned in in various 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.289
 computer vision applications 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.390
 we'll start with you comment on this 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.880
 how do we manipulate images how do we 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.460
 represents them and what kind of meadow 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.630
 basic treatment are useful in the 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.270
 development of an application in 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.890
 computer vision is really 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.930
 the goal here is first rather 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.789
 an overview of approaches are 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.520
 followed in computer vision have so 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.650
 talked about other tools that are 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.110
 frequently used as a notion of 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.450
 correlation convolution the notion of 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.070
 gradients of an image is also 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.960
 the option of two guardian histograms 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.639
 which is a way of extra a 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.700
 new representation of an image that 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.010
 is more useful for solving 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.630
 different problems in vision by 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.220
 computer including there recognition 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.220
 of objects that we will talk a little
