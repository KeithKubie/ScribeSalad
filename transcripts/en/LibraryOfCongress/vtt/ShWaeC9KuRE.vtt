00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Frederick Augustyn: Welcome to
today's presentation by Valerie Frey

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.970
on Preserving Family Recipes.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.150
My name is Fred Augustyn and I
work as a Reference Librarian

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.440
on a split assignment in
the Manuscript Division,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.010
and also I'm a Past President,
still in this century,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.910
but quite a few years ago, of the
Library of Congress Cooking Club,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.950
and a continuing member of it.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.520
Those of -- both of
the organizations

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.180
that are sponsoring this program.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.300
We are being videotaped

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.480
and by asking a question you're
hereby giving your permission

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.670
to have your voice recorded
and, depending on the angle

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.040
of the camera, your
image as well recorded.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.720
And I ask you to turn off
any electronic devices

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.110
that might possibly
interfere with the recording.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.720
And I'm going to introduce
Laura Kells who is an Archivist

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.020
in the Manuscript Division.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.540
&gt;&gt; Laura Kells: Hi.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.200
Introducing lots of
introductions here.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.120
But anyway, I just want to -- I'm
so pleased to have the opportunity

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.780
to introduce Valerie Frey who has
returned to the Library of Congress

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.590
to speak to us about her book,
<i>Preserving Family Recipes,</i>

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.620
<i>How to Save and Celebrate
Your Food Traditions </i>.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.730
I first met Valerie in 1999
when she was a Junior Fellow

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.360
in the Manuscript Division.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.870
She worked with me on processing
the Herbert Philbrick papers

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.170
that summer.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.340
And while she was here at LC she
also participated in the Library

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.140
of Congress Bicentennial
Cookbook Project.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
By the time she was a Junior Fellow
Valerie had already received a

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.690
Master's Degree in Art Education
from the University of Georgia

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.980
and had just completed a Master's
Degree in Information Science

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.060
with a concentration in
Historical Research in Archives

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.170
from the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.430
I think the thing I remember
about Valerie is right

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.130
after she left she went to Nepal.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.500
I think that was the
best [inaudible] before,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.320
and she sent us a postcard
of Mount Everest [laughter].

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.720
But after she returned she
began her professional career.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.650
She was a Manuscript Archivist
in the Georgia Historical Society

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.720
in Savannah, an Archivist of
the Savannah Jewish Archives.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.620 position:56%
Then she became the Education
Coordinator of the Georgia Archives.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.950
Valerie is currently a writer and
consultant whose projects focus

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.060
on genealogy, local
history, storytelling,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.940
material culture folklife, and home
life, both modern and historic.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.480
Valerie kept in touch with me
over the years and she returned

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.600
to the Library, I think
it was about 2008,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.500
to do some research
for this book here.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.600
Valerie's interests and
experience are quite evident

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.470
in <i>Preserving Family Recipes </i>.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.220
She looks at recipes
as primary documents.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.480
Her book is a mix of personal
stories and fact, tips and guidance

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.400
for books -- for people
interested in gathering, adjusting,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.080
and preserving their family
recipes, and collecting

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.360
and documenting family
food traditions.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.840
But I'll let her elaborate.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.640
So please welcome Valerie Frey.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.810
[ Applause ]

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.980
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: It's really
a pleasure to be here.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.540
Starting off at the largest library
in the world when you're right

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.350
of library school is daunting.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.460
But everybody was so welcoming
here and the things that I learned

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.910
as a Junior Fellow were amazing.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.630
So I've been pushing lots of bright
new shiny faces to come this way

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.920
and hope that you'll get some.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.110
So this books was a long labor of
love and it started off with --

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.680
I worked as Education
Coordinator at the Georgia Archives

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.810
and I was pretty sure
going into the job

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.430
that first day what the
job was going to entail.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.070
But I think as a lot of us know,
sometimes you have to change

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.230
when you realize what the
job really needs most.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.190
I would go into the
classrooms, mostly Atlanta,

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.460
but all over the state of Georgia,
and bringing primary documents,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.880
helping them to learn how
to do historic research.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.340
And there was enough resistance
that one day I finally asked,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.120
how many people here like history?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.610 position:56%
And only two kids raised their hand.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.820
And right there my whole job
shifted of it's not okay, you know,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.280 position:56%
for kids to think that history is
boring or irrelevant to their lives.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.870
They're not going to
be good citizens.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.450
They're not going to have
kind of the grounding roots.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.990
This is a photography of
my grandparents and my dad.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.500
My dad was around three years old.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.490
They lived in -- about an hour
south of Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.190
And they were my memory-keepers.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.540
They were the ones that -- they
were always telling me stories

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.800
about the way life was for
them, but also in the past.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.050
Both sides of that family, my
grandmother and grandfather,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.740
they arrived long before
the Civil War.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.540
And told me stories and shared
recipes and shared things

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.680
so that I grew up caring
about history.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.770
And when I found that these
kids across schools didn't care

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.720
about history, that was
the best way I knew how,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.730
was to start in with stories
and to also find photographs

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.680 position:56%
of kids their age a century ago,
and sort of start in that direction.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.920
And one of the things -- I had
my great-great-grandmother's

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.220
teacake recipe.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.140
She was born in 1830, died in 1900,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.450
would have cooked on
a wood-burning stove.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.950
And so I would make these
teacakes and then bring them in.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.250
And the kids would taste them.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.620
We would talk about how they were
alike and different than Oreos.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.270
How they would have been cooked.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.740
And from there I started
getting their attention.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.300
And I realized that foodways was
one of the best ways to get an in,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.840
to get -- everybody eats,
everybody loves food.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.730
And so from there on out I
started including information

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.410 position:56%
about preserving recipes in my adult
programs that I did on genealogy

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.250
and oral history and
those sorts of things.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.610
And it really struck a nerve.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.080
I think a lot of people
are interested

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.600 position:56%
in preserving it but don't know how.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.660
So I started interviewing people
who had done family cookbooks.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.350
One of the things I learned right
off the bat is people assume

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.940
that once you have some kind
of a recipe you're done.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.730
And it's really not true.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.170
Sometimes they don't work the
way you had hoped they were

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.890
or that you'd make it and
it doesn't taste anything

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.190
like grandma's apple pie.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.570
So what do you do from there?

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.720
So I did a lot of interviews
to sort of figure

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.010
out what you do from there.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.460
Let's see.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.630
The value in a recipe -- here's
some cookbooks from my shelf.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.060
And there are a lot of
buzzwords on the spine labels

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.360
about whether it's simple
or natural or diet or quick.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.490
There's a lot of reasons
we reach for a recipe.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.250
And that's -- you know, for what
you're going to cook tonight

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.080
or tomorrow or next week.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.060 position:56%
But when you look at family recipes,

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.000
I'm hoping that I can expand
your horizons to look at them

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.870
in a little bit different way and
with a little bit different values.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.510 position:56%
There's a nutritional value to food.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.120
Of course we want it to be
something that we want to eat.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.100 position:56%
There is definitely a sensual value.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.620
And it's not just the
way things taste.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.920
It's that smell.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.920
I have some favorite autumn recipes
that almost always include molasses

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.070
and spices, because then the
whole house smells divine.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.460
But just -- I get into biscuits and
when you do biscuits and you pour

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.610
that chilly buttermilk in the
soft flour and you start working

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.870
with your hands, there's a
sensual value to cooking for sure.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.560 position:56%
And there's also an emotional value.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.090
This is my son, Eli.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.700
He was, I think, four
in the picture.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.000
And he's seven now.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.950 position:56%
He's off at the Air and Space Museum
with my permission [laughter].

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.490
My husband was going to come
today and I was like, no,

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.620
you sat through this presentation.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.420
Go ahead, go.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.490
Pictured here is my
mom's chess tarts.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.630
She would make these
in Athens, Georgia,

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.820
where we lived every Thanksgiving.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.720
And she'd pack them in shirt
boxes and carry them to Arkansas

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.190
where we always had Thanksgiving.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.810
And since -- my parents died
when I was in my early 20s.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.670
And Thanksgiving, the first
Thanksgiving was pretty hard.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.090
From then on out, you know, turkey
tastes pretty much the same.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.930
My mom used a boxed stuffing
mix, so that was easy.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.550
But what it boiled down to for
this holiday is this is the taste

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.460
of Thanksgiving for me.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.120
And they didn't work
right off the bat.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.770
Thank goodness my mother
wrote in her cookbooks.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.840
Please write in your
cookbooks even though if --

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.040
you know, as a Librarian I feel
weird telling people to write

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.280
in a book, but please
write in your cookbooks

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.740
because that's an information
trail for the people behind you.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.040
But I still had trouble.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.340
They tasted good.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.080
People who didn't grow up
with them, they ate them up.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.010
But my brother and I would
always kind of look at each other

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.730
and shake our heads the few
times I tried to make them.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.600
And then this year, when
my -- maybe it was my son,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.400
maybe he was the magic mojo,
the grandson that she --

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.920
my mother never got to meet.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.460
But I took my time and one of
the things I thought about is --

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.930
I measure the way the -- Betty
Crocker tells you to measure flour

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.600
where you dump the flour
in and level it off.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.490 position:56%
If you use the scoop, you use it
like a scoop like my mom always did,

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.960
you can pack the flour and you
end up with too much flour.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.070
But I thought, well, that
was the way she did it.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.940
And when I tried it that way --

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.100
I baked them, I handed one
to my brother, he took a bite

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.170
and closed his eyes, and then
his head snapped up and he said,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.280 position:56%
this is a little round time machine.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.580
There's something to that.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.920
When you take a bit of something
that somebody has made for you

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.600
with love, it means a lot.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.970
And so it's something I
make every Thanksgiving now.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.880
So there's definitely an
emotional value with food that kind

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.840
of carries you back to
other times and places.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.300
What I'd like to talk
a little bit more

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.060
about today is the
historic value of recipes.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.430
And we're going to zip through
some recipes and look at them

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.930
for their historic value.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.840
In recipes you will
find family history,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.430
culinary history, and
social history.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.980
And I love social history.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.200
I know some many genealogists
that --

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.380 position:56%
when I worked at a public
reference desk they go leaping right

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.180
for the dates and the
-- confirming the names,

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.320
and without some social
history, and especially

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.860
when you go far enough back that
you don't know real life stories

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.430 position:56%
about those people, the social
history helps you know what life was

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.560
like for your ancestors
and makes them come alive.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.090
And food history is
fantastic for that.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.240
So let's take a little foray into
social history around a recipe.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.080
Actually, let me back
up a little bit.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.290
So my parents got married in 1962.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.090
It was a small church wedding.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.560
My dad was from rural Arkansas.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.930
My mom was from right
along the Columbia River

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.180
in Oregon, not far from Portland.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.130
And he had gone to school up there.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.860
They met, fell in love.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.940
And at that time, travel
was pretty expensive.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.010
They were both poor students.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.310
And so they got married.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.650
But my grandparents --

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.500
my grandmother was sick and wasn't
able to come to the wedding.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.830
She had -- was chronically
ill at that time.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.200
So they married in September.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.520
And in December the gift that all
the parents gave was train tickets

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.290
so they could go to Arkansas and
meet his family for the first time.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.000
So my mother arrives at night.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.980
And the next morning there's this
huge dinner for the whole family.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.950
My dad was the only child,
but my grandpa was one of 14

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.640
and my grandma was one of four,
so the house was just jam-packed

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.160
with all these aunts and uncles
and cousins and everything else.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.570
And my grandpa made -- he
was the cook in the family

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.040
and he made his signature stew.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.940
And when he handed her a bowl, this
is sort of what it looked like.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.550
This is a batch -- I
took a photo in 1991.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.800
And if you'll notice that there's
sort of this strange object

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.270
in the middle of the pot.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.640
To help you picture that,
that's a skull [laughter].

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.630
Nobody thought to tell her
that it was squirrel soup,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.280
squirrel mulligan, and
that was his specialty.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.310
And it was -- for rural Arkansas,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.690
squirrel was quite
common at that time.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.310
I think a lot of people
still eat squirrel and --

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.610
&gt;&gt; Yuck.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.560
&gt;&gt; Laura Kells: But it was not
exactly what she was expecting

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.860
when she reached for that bowl.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.180
So it was this hilarious story
in our family is, you know,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.130
here you're the new bride
going thaaanks [laughter].

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.840
After my parents died
in my early 20s,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.110
I started realizing
that my links were gone.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.220
My grandparents were all still
alive but my parents were gone.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.690
And all these stories
that my parents knew --

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.610
I could no longer ask them.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.790
But there was this
older generation to ask.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.300
And so ask I did.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.600
I recorded stories.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.900
I took lots of photographs.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.740
And I asked about the recipes.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.960
And this was one of the things
that I asked my grandfather for.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.300
And he just kind of laughed.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.700
He said there is no recipe.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.850
Oh, here's another picture
of the skull just to --

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.090
you know, you can see its fangs
-- his little teeth [laughter].

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.350
So I asked my grandpa
for the recipe.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.070
And he was wonderful.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.180
He took a stab at writing it down.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.830
But when I read through
the recipe --

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.010
he was actually a highly
intelligent man,

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.190
but he had a eighth-grade
education, and the recipe

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:27.240
that I got reflected his grammar
and knowledge of spelling.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.050
But that was easy to sort out.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.350 position:56%
What was not easy to sort out was --

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.660
there was so much know-how he
didn't even realize he knew.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.380
He didn't tell me how much
liquid to put in the pot.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.680
He didn't tell me -- real,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.110
the secret to how good it tasted
was his home-grown vegetables

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.590
and how he prepared
those and canned those.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:52.920
So I ended up learning how to
interview him for more information,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.490
how to interview other cooks
that did squirrel mulligan

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.620
for more information, and then
how to search through cookbooks

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:05.050 position:56%
from the time period when he
developed this recipe to learn more.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:09.230 position:56%
So what I ended up learning from the
process was that, just like primary

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.900
and secondary sources are
great when you're a genealogist

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.220
and you're trying to learn
more about your family history,

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.060
it also works for the recipes.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.820
There are so many cookbooks
now that are available.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.630
It used to be, I think, you know,

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.560
30 years ago if you needed old
cookbooks you would have to track

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.530
down a reputable bookseller and
have them do searches for you.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.990
Well, now in the days of the Web,
there's so many of the cookbooks

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.290
that have been digitized.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.330
And the Library of
Congress has digitized some.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.320 position:56%
There are a lot of sources for that.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.650
They're listed in the book.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.670
But so if you need a
help on that it's there.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:49.070
And so to compare a recipe, if
you are missing out on, you know,

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.650
how long do I cook this, how
much liquid do I put in the pot,

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.210
if you compare it with other
squirrel mulligan or soup recipes

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.560
or like my grandpa
actually adapted the recipe

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.940
for chicken, thank goodness.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.500
So I was able to look at a
lot of chicken soup recipes

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.150
to figure out what he did.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.640
And then the secondary sources --

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.190
food history has just exploded
in the last couple of decades

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.490
and they're wonderful sources.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:17.160
And I found a lot of them
that mentioned squirrel.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.790
Thomas Jefferson --
Damon Lee Fowler worked

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.920
with the early Monticello recipes,,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.690
and Thomas Jefferson had
recipes for squirrel.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.970
There's so many good
books that I read through.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.130
Mark Kurlansky wrote <i>Food
From a Younger Land </i>,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.840
and I learned that the
squirrel mulligan recipe

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.940
that was my grandfather's
-- that was a regional dish,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.290
fairly close in range to
where my grandparents lived.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.230
And that it started in the
Golden Age of Railroading.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.940
The hobos would sort of do
these communal one-pot dishes.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.430
And it's a cousin to
burgoo and booya

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.380
and Brunswick stew
and some other things.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.850
So by understanding
this recipe in context,

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.340
the primary documents help
me sort of narrow down when

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.180
and where it came from, but also
how to cook it successfully.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:07.840
And those secondary sources really
help me to know how my family fit

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.670 position:56%
into this culinary history and
social history of the United States.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:16.930
So it's fascinating that
recipes can do this for us.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.610
Every single recipe
you have has a story.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.190
Some of them may be very boring.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.060
I think the most boring recipe
story in the world is --

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.100
I clipped this out of
the newspaper last week

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.340
and I haven't made
it yet [laughter].

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.810
But for so many other recipes
that we have in our boxes

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.300
and our card files, there's
a lot of more there to it.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.420
The story of a recipe is where
it came from if you know that.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.840
Who used it.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.630
How it was served.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.730
You know, the squirrel
mulligan story.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.580
You know, I love this serving
it to the new daughter-in-law.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.210
How it changed over time.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.230
We're going to talk more
about that in a second.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.960
Stories or tales connected to it.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.870
And then again how it fits
into all that food history.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.630
So think about that as you
go through the recipes.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.820
I think a lot of us flip
through family recipes with, no,

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.120
I wouldn't want to make that.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.420
No, I wouldn't want to eat that.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.890
That's how we look at them.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.970 position:56%
But if you look at them as what can
this recipe tell me about the people

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:17.230
who came before me or about the
people that I share my table with,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.620
then they start to have
a new historic value.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.850 position:56%
Let me tell you another recipe story

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.330
that will tell you a little
bit more about recipes here.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.050
This is me back in 2006.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.060
So I got engaged.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.190
And the next year I got married.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.780
If you'll notice the groom has
an Air Force officer's uniform.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.930
What that adds up to very
quickly is moving boxes.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.230
So we got married.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.750
He deployed the next month.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.080
A couple of months
later he came back.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.760
And then in the middle of
the summer, when I had a baby

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.140
on the way, he announces that
we're moving to California.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.250
And I had lived in Washington,
D.C. those three months,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.600
but otherwise I had always lived

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.490
within a four-hour
driving distance of home.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.240
So suddenly I packed up
everything I owned, left everybody

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.780
that I knew except for my
husband, and headed cross-country.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.490
And so really it was
sort of a recipe

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.790
for home sickness is what it was.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.530
This is a picture -- we ate at
Chez Panisse, if you all know

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.830
that famous restaurant in Berkeley.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.620
We ate there on our first
wedding anniversary.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.090
And then the next month
little guy popped up here.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.650
And I was working on this
book at the same time.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.930
And what I realized is
the home sickness was

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.610
so thick you could almost
grab it out of the air

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.900
and squeeze the juice out of it.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.710
I missed my mom and dad.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.510
Especially though when
you're pregnant, you know,

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.490 position:56%
you just really want your mom there.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:46.790
I missed my brother.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.610
I missed all that familiarity.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.610
The first holidays came --
Thanksgiving and Christmas and none

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.620
of the food tasted right.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.150
I realized one afternoon,
through kind of a veil of tears,

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.840
that what I really wanted

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.910
to help make things right
was my mom's spaghetti.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.260
Now, if you're of an Italian
descent I would like you

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.340
to just cover your eyes
please and not look at this

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.890
because [laughter] this is in
no way high-brow spaghetti.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.160 position:56%
But I think that's important because
I think a lot of times the foods

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.790
that are dear to us, they aren't
always highfaluting recipes.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.210
And I think that's fine.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.870
I think when it comes
to family recipes

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.610
that we can just take our snobbery
and kind of put it to the side

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.490
for a little while and
enjoy what we enjoy.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:35.560
So there in my California kitchen
I called my brother several times.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.720
We both had made the
spaghetti with my mom.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.020
It wasn't written down anywhere.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.780
And this is what we figured out.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.400
And when I made it this way
it tasted, it tasted right.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.300
But I noticed that my mom -- I
had inherited my mom's skillet,

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.030
but we had one of those
glass cooktops

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.600
and you're not allowed
to put cast-iron on it.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.470
So I had to substitute
my cast-iron skillet.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.330
And then I realized my mom,
she would buy these tubes

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.280
of ground beef whenever they went
on sale, and she would slice them

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.580
and put them in the freezer.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.640
And, as a kid, you knew it was
spaghetti night because you'd come

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.870
from breakfast and
there'd be this lump

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.180
of beef thawing beside the sink.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.700
Well, I was about to leave
the lump of beef by the side

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.090
of the sink all day the way my mom
did, so I thawed it in a microwave

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.010
which didn't exist when
this recipe came about.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.210
So I'm going to kind of hurry
through this because this isn't --

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.510
this is something I'd like you

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.050
to just get the gist of,
not absorb completely.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.330
But when I started working with
the recipe further I started

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.750
to realize that, hey, I'm living in
Berkeley, California, foodieville.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.930
I'm going to go for the fresh
and, hey, why not grass-fed bison?

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.170
Why not free-range turkey?

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.930
And as I worked my
way through I started

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.440
to realize I was making
all kinds of substitutions

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.540
that my mother didn't
have those choices.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.260
That Athens, Georgia, it
was a fairly small town

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.950
when I was growing up, and the
grocery stores were pathetic.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.530
There wasn't much choice there.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.300
It was like yellow onion
or white onion basically.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.680
But, hey, if you want to see a
happy Georgia girl in Berkeley,

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.800
California, who's pregnant
and homesick,

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.860
try finding a Vidalia
onion from Georgia.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:14.670
I about did a happy dance
in the grocery store.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.690
One of the things my
pediatrician told me is don't eat

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.720
out of cans while you're pregnant,
which was really a scary thought

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.930
to me that, you know, the lining of
the can would have BPA or whatever.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.840 position:56%
So I made sure to track down --
they have the little sealed cartons.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.630
And then I started, hey, might
as well just use fresh tomatoes,

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.280
and organic and heirloom.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.600
And I bought the herbs and
put them on the back porch.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.060
They have the new pastas
that are the high fiber

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.540
and they have the lentil flour,
so they've got the protein

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.260
and by the time my son was, you
know, came along and was old enough

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.660
to eat, you know, the
thought of this vermicelli

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.860 position:56%
that we always twirled at the family
dinner table, that was not going

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.650
to fly with an 18-month-old.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.600
So, you know, you do the little
bowties so they can pick them up.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.760
My mom always put a lump
of shortening in the water

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.340
to keep it from boiling over.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.520 position:56%
And, you know, then we had the whole
trans-free fat thing and then I read

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.260
that you're not even supposed
to put anything in the water

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.690
because then the pasta
doesn't stick.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:16.310
And so I think you can see what's
going to happen with this recipe

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:20.170
that after a while we wonder is
it even mom's spaghetti anymore?

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:23.270
There's all these changes.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:29.650
But it's fascinating when you stop
to look at why all these changes.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.710
It's because technology changed.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.350
You know, the glass cooktop
and the microwave oven

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.340
and the nonstick cookware.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.500
The ingredient availability is --

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.750
it really shows where our culture
has gone in the last 25 years

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.210
that there's all these
fancy things available.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.400
The things we know about health
and the decisions now that --

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.000
I don't think my mom ever made
any decision of to put something

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.480 position:56%
in the grocery cart depending on
how it would affect the environment.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.110
And I do. I care.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.300
She would have cared, too.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.780
But it wasn't, you know,
it wasn't an issue then.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.950
How much time we have available.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.670
Our needs and preferences.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:11.360
So all those things are part
of the story of that recipe.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.590
And, unfortunately, I think
that halts a lot of people

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.180
because they think, well, I
don't do it the way my mom did,

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.010
so I don't even know which
is the real family recipe.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.070
Well, the answer is they're
both the real family recipe.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:26.560 position:56%
And the changes between them, if you
take the time to sort of explain,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.950
is a fascinating trail
for future generations

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.210
to read about how life changed.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.330
I mean, this was just,
you know, one generation.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.920
So let's look at some
other recipes to kind

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.300
of see what historical
trails are inside them.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.320
This is -- I've got these written

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.110
down so I know sometimes
it can be hard to see.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.870
So if you wouldn't mind
passing those along.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.170
&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.500
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: This is a recipe
for boiled Indian Meal Pudding.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.360
Mix one quart of cornmeal
with three quarts of milk.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.150
Take care it be not lumpy.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.350
Add three eggs and
a gill of molasses.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.640
It must be put on at
sunrise to eat at 3 o'clock.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.210
The great art in this pudding
is tying the bag properly,

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:09.370
as the meal swells very much.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:13.350
Now the first time I read this
recipe my only thought was, huh?

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:17.820
I had no idea what it
was even talking about.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.150
Anybody want to hazard a guess

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.770
of what time period this
recipe may have come from?

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:30.040
Yeah. This one's pretty old.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.340
This is a hearth recipe.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:36.070
This one came from <i>The
Virginia Housewife, 1824 </i>.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:41.040
Is it in standard receipt format
according to what you have seen?

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.440
That's one of the first clues, is
a lot of times once you get past

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.950
about 1900 it was the reformers.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.540
Everybody credits Fannie Farmer,
but it wasn't just Fannie Farmer.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.220
It was Eliza Acton and a
bunch of other women reformers

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.960
that were pushing for more clarity
in recipes, a list of ingredients

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.170
that would be moved through
in chronological order.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.470
But that didn't exist here.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:11.100
Are the ingredients
common or easy to get?

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.370
&gt;&gt; Easy.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.670
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: They're
pretty common.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.660
So it's -- this -- I mean
it's basically just cornmeal

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.480
and milk and molasses.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.230
So it would have been
things that, in the South,

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.760
they would have had on the farm.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.650
So it's not a fancy
recipe by any means.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.710 position:56%
Do you think it was a everyday
recipe or a special occasion recipe?

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.010
Is it fancy?

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.310
Can you tell?

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.910
I know it was hard
to tell sometimes.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.850
Some of these questions
you can ask yourself

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:42.050
and you can't maybe not come
up with a clear conclusion

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.970 position:56%
until you've read some more sources.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.170
This is actually a pretty every --

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.250
would have been used for
an everyday occasion.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.060
This is yesteryear's crockpot.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.960
If it's hog-killing
time and the lady

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.650
of the house has her hands full,
you know, she doesn't have time

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.900
to cook a full meal and, you
know, help scald the hog.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:10.200
So this would have been put on
-- I made my little example here.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.090
If you do a image search
on the Web for pudding bag,

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.730
you will see something
that looks more elegant

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.250
than what I was able to do.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.000
This is one of those things, you
know, where -- there's Pinterest.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.860
You see an idea and then
when you actually do it,

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.310
it's much harder than it looks.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.610 position:56%
This is one of those kind of things.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.510
But they would have
put the ingredients --

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.300
the milk and the eggs

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.280
and the molasses would have been
put inside fabric like this.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.440
Sometimes it was buttered and
floured, and sometimes it wasn't.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.740
And it was gathered
and tied with twine.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.280
And then this whole thing
would have been set in a pot

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.120
of boiling water over the hearth.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.710
And so the lady of the house would
have had to just come in once

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.520
or twice just to bank the fire,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.140
make sure that it was
bubbling along nicely,

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.440
and then would have been
able to lift this out.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.270
And it would have been solid by
then and she would slice it up

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.670
and everybody would
have had a slice.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.240
But one of the things that
they're eluding to, the trouble.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.260
If you tie it too tight
then the cornmeal's pulls

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.750
in liquid from the outside.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.050
It would burst it.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:16.400 position:56%
So you come in from the field hungry
and what you have is a burst bag

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.240
and everything is floating
around in water

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.570
and you can't even just put the
kids in the car and go to McDonalds

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:25.670
because it doesn't exist yet.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:29.210
And a gill, by the way, was
four ounces or a half cup.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.730
So, again, that's one of the clues
to this recipe that it's older,

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.960
is it -- there's an
unusual measurement there.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.750
Let's jump a little bit up in time.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.610
Anybody want to hazard a guess for
eggless, milkless, butterless cake?

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.810
&gt;&gt; World War II I'd say.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:48.110
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: That -- as --

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.410
I always thought it
was just World War II.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.140
It's actually -- this recipe
was a World War I recipe

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.740
which was a surprise for me.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.820
But it had a big resurgence
during the Great Depression

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.520
and during World War II.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.080
When you didn't have to
use eggs, milk, and butter,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.400
you saved ration coupons and
also saved expensive ingredients.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.740
So is it in standard recipe format?

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.190
It is. We've reached that,

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.370
that period where that's
becoming more common.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:18.580
Are they ingredients that you
could have gotten off the farm?

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.880
&gt;&gt; No.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.180
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Not anymore.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.480
We're reaching that age.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.220
Probably 20 or 30 years before,

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.340 position:56%
some of these ingredients would have
been really rare and hard to get.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.980
And this would have been a super
fancy item to make for company.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.430
But we've reached the age
where nutmeg and cinnamon,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.580
they were coming from a long
way away around the world,

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.030
but they were becoming more common.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:43.050 position:56%
You could get them in the, you
know, the grocery store or whatever.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.350
No, they wouldn't have
had a grocery, but a --

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:49.110
I want to say trading post,
but that's not the right word.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.490
Just your general store
would have had these items.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.810
Another clue if you're -- you
know, if you found this recipe

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:59.360
in a family recipe trove and
you didn't have any indication

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.970
of where it came from, the
seeded raisins is one indication.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:09.020
Older recipes would tell you to
use the seeded raisins or seedless.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.760
Seedless came later.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.710
And seeded raisins -- I actually
found a recipe not long ago

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.890
to tell you if -- let's
see, it was a 1909 cookbook

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.190
that told how you did that.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.610
And you soaked the raisins and then

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.460
with a knife you would slit each
raisin and pick out the seeds.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.750
So my father's -- it's
also a recipe you only make

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.050
for people you like [laughter].

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.970
It would have been a lot of work.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.770
And then the citron is
an ingredient that --

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:43.140
it was very popular in
cookbooks in the 1800s.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:47.080
And it's a citrus fruit, but you
use the rind instead of the pulp.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.760
And now we see it really only once
a year, and about this time of year

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.000
when all the fruitcake
materials pop up.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.290
You find it in little tubs now and
it's already been candied for you.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.040
And that's really the only
time we see citron anymore.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.590
Ingredients come and go in terms
of popularity just like, you know,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.900
recipes come and go or, you know,
the fondue pot that was so popular

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.180
in the '70s, you know,
went the way of the dodo.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.820
But now it's had a resurgence.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.760
I think a lot of people
are doing fondue again.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.590
All right.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:19.890
We'll jump up one more time.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:23.650
Anybody want to guess where
Sock It to Me Cake, what decade

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.140
or so that might have been from?

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.440
&gt;&gt; The [inaudible].

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.740
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.010
That's <i>Laugh-In </i>in the 1960s
had that as their catch-phrase.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.560
It was fascinating.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.920
When I searched for Sock It
to me Cake the first time,

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.560
I didn't find much about it.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.410
And then last week I talked to
the Southern Festival of Books,

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:46.430
and I met Anne Bern who's -- she's
the Cake Doctor who does the books

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:48.860
where you work on the cake mixes.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.920
She has a new book
called, <i>American Cakes </i>.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.190
so if you love food history,
this is a beautiful book.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.490
And she really tested
those recipes so they're --

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.640
and she had a selection
of cakes for us to try,

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.090
so I know that they're good.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.900
But she has a little sidebar
about Sock It to Me Cake.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.970
And I discovered that it started
in Texas and kind of circulated

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.730
through Oklahoma, so the fact that
my Arkansas grandmother had it

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.650
in her cookbook makes sense, how
very close they are geographically.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.550
But I did find out that
later on Duncan Hines put it

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.620
on one of their cake mix boxes.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.870 position:56%
But the recipe's a little different.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.330
And I brought that for you --

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] much the same though.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.460
I used to make the Sock It to Me --

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Did you [laughter]?

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.230
I printed it up for you here.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.070
A lot of times people ask me sort

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:37.640
of what my ideal format
would be for recipes.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.410
So I did the Sock It to Me
Cake that way so you could see

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.890
where I've done, you know,
put it in the standard format

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.400
with the ingredients listed first,

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.270
because the way my
grandmother had it here --

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.870
I mean, that's the whole recipe,

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.750
so people have always asked
me, wait, what do you do?

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.080
So I looked it up.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.880
I looked through all the -- and
came up with directions for it.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.140
I love doing them in steps --
one, two, three, four, five,

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.120
so if I get interrupted I
remember what step to go back to.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.160
I always put cooking
notes and history notes.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.790
And then, if I can, I'll put a
little image of the original recipe

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.360
so that the handwriting's there.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.950
And here's a picture of my grandma.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:17.030
So I'll have that for you today
as sort of a template on things.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:21.470
So this one is no longer in
your standard recipe format,

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.600
but is it unusual ingredients?

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.840
Not very common for the 1960s.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.160
Any grocery store, even a
little country grocery store

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.360
like my grandma had,
would have worked.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.470
Is it fancy?

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.120
Not particularly.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.160
You know, I could see making
it for when company comes

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.970
but it would have been very easy
and quick and cheap to make.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.570
It is very mid-century.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.580 position:56%
You know, we looked at that Eggless,
Milkless, Butterless Cake recipe

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.210
that would have been scratch and
you'd have done the whole thing.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.120
Well, by the time you get to
the middle of the 20th century,

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.700 position:56%
you know, get the lady out of the
kitchen, make things quick and easy,

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.110
just doctor up a cake mix.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.610
That's a lot of the recipes
that I was left with,

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:05.960
are those kind of recipes.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.570 position:56%
And it's not the way I cook anymore.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:13.030 position:56%
So when I've made Sock It to Me Cake
I have a favorite yellow cake recipe

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:15.900
that's from scratch, and
then I make that and go

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.090
on with the rest of it from there.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:21.300
So with these old family recipes
you can go those directions.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.520
If it's fancy, you can,
you know, swap a --

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.330
instead of mush make
your own mushroom sauce,

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.630
you can put in a can
of mushroom soup.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.780
Or you can go the other
direction and go fresh with it.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:38.130
The main thing is to play with it
and enjoy it and have fun with it.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.070
So let's talk -- I'm going to
switch gears on you a little bit

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.160
and just talk about some
of the things that I notice

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.850
when people worked
with family recipes,

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.250
the things that I heard
over and over again.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.900
That they would be
excited about them

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.680
but then they wouldn't
end up working with them.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.980
Well, why?

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.590 position:56%
What can we do to get you past that?

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.630 position:56%
One of the things I heard a lot is
that the old recipes are out of date

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.730
and nobody wants them anymore.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:03.220
And, as we just talked about,
please play with those recipes.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.330
If you are a from-scratch person,

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.930
and it has a cake mix,
you can get around that.

00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:13.050
You would record the original in
its original format so that any,

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.150
anybody else wants to
play with that recipe,

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.220
they can go back to the original.

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.930
But make your own version.

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.260
I type all mine into the
computer and so I just hit Save As

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:26.830
and then I go to town using other
cookbooks, using other recipes

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:30.630
for ideas, and testing it,
tweaking it until it's something

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.110
that really fits my
needs and my purposes.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.730
I lighten up a lot of things.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.600
I go fresh with a lot of things.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.150
But they're still those
original recipes.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:43.150
Another thing I've heard is that,
you know, how many great cooks

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.830
or great recipes in our family?

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:47.120
And I think that's
kind of true for me.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.580
I mean, that chess tarts
recipe that was one

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.080
of my absolute favorites
is Betty Crocker.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.140
My mom may have put
her own twist on it,

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.910
but it started with Betty Crocker.

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:57.220
And that's okay.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.000
Not everybody has the Italian
grandmother who knows how

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.320
to do things from the old country.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.210
You take what you have
and you play with it

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.790
and you make it into
something special.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.860
But it's still grounded
in those original roots.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.430
One of the things that -- I worked

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:14.880
with my great-great-grandmother's
teacake recipe a lot,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.780
and when I first made it, my
family didn't like it very much.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.670
They're a very crisp cookie
and there's no extract

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:26.010
and they basically -- they're
very shortbread-like in a way.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:30.260
You just taste the flour and
it was made with shortening.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.580
So it didn't even have that
buttery taste like shortbread.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:33.880
So I played with it a bit.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.320
I took out a little
bit of the flour.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.490
I reduced the baking time and the
baking temperature a little bit

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:43.500
until we got this wonderful
cookie that -- with the --

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.190
a little bit of lemon
or orange extract.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.380
They're mild and they hold
their shape wonderfully.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.700
So when you make them with those
-- these intricate cookie-cutters,

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.000
you don't have to chill the dough.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.300
You just do it.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.140
And that recipe is in
the book, by the way.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.440
So it's become a favorite
recipe because I played with it.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.640
And by the way, I included
this photograph.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.870
I love this cookie-cutter
because of the button shape

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.800
and so I ordered them online.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.230
And when they arrived I realized

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.140
that they had been
printed on a 3D printer.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.130
And I thought, this
great-great-grandmother,

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:19.500
who was born in 1830, could she
have ever pictured, number one,

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.900
this PowerPoint slide with
the picture of her dough,

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.260 position:56%
but this cookie-cutter that was made

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.920
on somebody's home
computer and printed 3D?

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.500 position:56%
So sometimes I think that these
recipes, they can travel a long way,

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.760
and they're very flexible and
can do a lot of different things.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.800
Another roadblock I hear
often is either I don't cook

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.450
or I don't cook anymore, so I
don't have anything to offer.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.240
And I would say that
capture the whole foodways

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.310
of your family, not just recipes.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.150
If you don't have a lot of
recipes or there's just a few,

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:55.600
you can still write about the
things that you are for holidays.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.710
My uncle used to always take
us out for blueberry donuts

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.500
and whenever I eat a
blueberry donut I think

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.320
of my uncle even though I
don't think he's ever baked

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.100
or cooked a thing in his life.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.980
But in my family cookbook I found
a great recipe for blueberry donuts

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.540
and I credited where it came from,
but that it was in his honor.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.460
And it has a place in
the family cookbook.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.790
So those family foodways, if
you don't have enough recipes,

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:19.790 position:56%
you can kind of bring in surrogates.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:24.030 position:56%
Don't try to pass them off as
uncle's, you know, blueberry donuts.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.220
But you can do things in honor.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.990
Add supplementary materials.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:32.560
So stories and photographs and
things to add to those recipes.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.100
They mean so much more
than just this little bit

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.950
of writing on a card.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.970
And then there are lots of ways --

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.470
if you're going to go about
collecting recipes, to work either

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.420
by yourself or to work with family.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.720
And my experience is working
here with the Cookbook Committee

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.130
for the <i>Bicentennial Cookbook</i>
, are mentioned in my book.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:57.530
I learned a lot about working as a
group on recipes and testing them

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.950 position:56%
and how that can be very beneficial.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:05.580
Another roadblock I hear is getting
recipes together is too hard.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.290
My recipe stash is a mess.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.600
And a lot of the people I
interviewed, they would, you know,

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.980
hold out these little
stacks, so they'd be digging

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.660
out of the junk drawer
and behind the microwave.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.370
It's a challenge to organize
recipes and -- but as an archivist,

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:23.600
and many of us here are archivists,
organizing papers is our job.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.160
So I gave some hints and clues on
how to go about getting organized.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.050
Also how to identify which
recipes are heirloom.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:35.590
When I looked at things from
my grandmother's generations,

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.550
they each left me a small handful.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:40.620
So I saved everything
that they passed on.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.100
But my mom had a lot of
recipes and whoa be, you know,

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.910
what I leave to my son because
I have shelves and shelves

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:49.590
of cookbooks and stacks
and stacks of recipes.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:52.260
So how you sort of
go about identifying

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.630
which ones are really heirloom
recipes you want to pass on.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.250
And then what's near
and dear to my heart

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.660
in this book is I put my
best archivist tips on how

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.840
to make sure those materials last
as long as possible because a lot

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.030
of people want to save those
things but don't know how to go

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:12.860
about properly housing them and
what to do to make sure they last.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.390
So that information is there.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.170
Another roadblock.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:20.300
The recipes just don't work for
me the way they did for Grandma.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.450
And that was one of my biggest
challenges because I'm not a cook

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.580
or a chef in a classic sense.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.410
I was never trained.

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.740
But I had to learn.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.430
You can clarify a recipe by
adding a little more information,

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:35.200
making sure you know exactly how
much liquid to put in the pot

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.410
or clarifying at what point
you slide it into the oven.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.930
But then sometimes
you modify a recipe

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:42.880
like I did with the teacake recipe.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.000
I have the original version
just as it was worded.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.160
But I also have my version.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.330
So if my son wants to make the
Christmas cookies he always

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:55.220
remember, that he knows
how I modified it.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:58.400
So how to research
and adjust a recipe.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.810
I tried to leave a trail of
information that I discovered.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:09.320
I also did some appendices to
kind of give learn-by-example.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.900 position:56%
So I looked at biscuits and how it's
a -- you know, biscuits are simple.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.600
There are just a few ingredients.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.390
But there's a lot of
ways to adjust them,

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.570
whether you want them taller
or fluffier or whatever.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:22.850
So I have an appendix where I
looked in depth at biscuits.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.850
So if you're into biscuit-making
it is the cheat sheet.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:30.300
You can find a way to
make your perfect biscuit

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.600
through that appendix.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.690
And it's sort of an example of how
you would do that with other foods.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:37.480
I also put in information about --

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.940
for many of us, if we go very
far back, suddenly we're working

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:45.480
with recipes from another time
or place, another culture.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.780
So I had to go about that --

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:50.450
the finding ingredients and
translating and converting.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.650
But sometimes it's just
a matter of region.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:54.950
When I lived in Berkeley,

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:58.930
the trouble I had finding a decent
bag of grits was incredible.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.900
So how you go about finding,
you know, the ingredients

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.520
that you really need to
make a recipe happen.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.710
Another roadblock is the books
in my family don't use recipes,

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.580
so there's nothing to share.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.880
And that was a tough one with me.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:16.480 position:56%
A lot of my Arkansas relatives, they
didn't have anything written down.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.620
I've taught at oral history
workshops so I put in a lot

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.750
of the information
that I had from there.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.050
But I learned a lot of tricks.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:26.910
One of the things that I realized
early-on is that if you stop them

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.620
to try to make them
measure something,

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.220
it's [inaudible] screws them up.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.170
They can't continue
their cooking process.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.370
So I figured out to
get an electronic scale

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.220
and weigh everything
and then let them cook

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.010
and then you weigh it
again and do a subtraction,

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.140
you know how much they used.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.750
That was a big breakthrough for me.

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.260
There were several recipes
that, once I figured that out,

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.570
it suddenly came clear
and were usable.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:54.050
So how to interview people,
how to do an interview plan,

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:58.030
some sample questions on what
to ask, and I also developed,

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:02.030
with the help of a couple of fellow
cooks, a kind of a checklist.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.760
If you have a complicated
recipe that's just not working,

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.310
how you go about sort of
narrowing it down to figure

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:11.600 position:56%
out where the problem spot is in it.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.900
I'm too late.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.030
All the good family cooks are gone.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.320
And that's one I've heard a lot.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.840
I put in how to research things.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:26.420
How to go -- these community
cookbooks are a goldmine.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.140
And a lot of times
people have written things

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.090
down that you didn't even
know that they had written.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.820
They've written them
for other people.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.860
These great old family cooks, a
lot of times they didn't write

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.910
down a recipe because
they knew it by heart.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.980
They didn't need to
have it written down.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.290
But sometimes they would
write it down for a new bride

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.530
or someone leaving home
for the first time.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.690
And by knowing ways to track
it down, sometimes you discover

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:51.680
that those recipes that you
thought were unwritten got written

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.650
down at some point
if you can find them.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:43:00.870
I also did some appendices that
help with that, with biscuits.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.630
I researched sort of the origins
of biscuits and how they came about

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:08.890
and the ingredients that needed
to come together to develop,

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:12.910
to make those kind of fluffy
baking powder biscuits.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:15.930
And then when I was
growing up our --

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.610
my next door neighbor
was a fantastic cook.

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:20.500
She was Cajun and she
was going to --

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.070 position:56%
she talked often about how she going

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.660
to write a cookbook
when she retired.

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.200
And then died of cancer,
and never got there.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.980
So I interviewed her husband and
her three sons, trying to figure

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.700
out if someone's gone, how do
you pull out some of that legacy?

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.290
How do you make sure that
-- you can't save it all.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:39.590
But how do you make sure

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.570
that something is carried
forward to the next generation?

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.730
And I learned a lot
about doing that.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:53.690
I don't have time for a big
project is another one I heard.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.270
So there's one chapter about
sort of different ideas.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:59.850
I interviewed a family that they're
scattered across the United States

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:01.530
and then as far as Saudi, Arabia.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:05.020
And they have a cooking blog
where they all have the password

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.940
and so they post and they
post pictures and comments

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.070
and then periodically
they print it all out.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.600
And it's their way of
this scattered family

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.360
of sharing these family foodways.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.470
So there are a lot of neat
ideas now that are out there.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:21.150
And then I brought
show show and tell.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.700
It never has to be too elaborate.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.670
Here's a little cookbook
that somebody made.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:31.570
They just typed out the recipes,
sewed it with a sewing machine

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.360
to make the binding,
and then cut up a piece

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.970
of a Christmas card for the cover.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.320
Simple, but a goldmine.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.180
Here's another one that
somebody did the same thing.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.350
This one, thankfully, they added
a few sentences about the recipe

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.240
which I think is really important.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.410
And they just punched a hole
in the side, added a ribbon,

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:52.980
and gave it to everybody
for Christmas.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:59.400
Here is one -- this is a woman,
that she did this one with --

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.950
she had lots of recipes and
then she put it together

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:05.200
with her favorite quotations
to inspire her grandchildren --

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.390
family stories, took it
to the office supply place

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.500
and had them put a
spiral binding on it.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.710
It's not fancy, it's not
expensive, but it's very effective.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.840
Then this is my favorite
way to do gift ones.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.000
I think -- like Snapfish
and Shutterfly, Walgreens,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.680
there's lots of places
that do these photo books.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:31.620
And by -- you can type out recipes
and print them and turn them

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.460
into JPEGs with a scanner.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.890
Or you can just scan
the original recipe

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:38.680
so you see the handwriting
and all that.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.140
Oops, I'm sorry.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.870
By doing it this way, you
can sort of share copies

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:47.510
of all these family recipes
sort of in all their glory along

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:52.330
with the photographs and the life
dates and those sorts of things.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:56.730
These things, they live on the
server of the photo company

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.230
that you're, you know,
working with their software.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:01.690
So what I do is I make them
and then I let them sit there,

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.070
and when I know another
gift occasion

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.490
like somebody else is
getting married in the family,

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:09.460
you can do a Save As on that
website and design, you know,

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.640
like a frontpage for that specific
person and then print it out,

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.620
you know, a new copy
for that new person.

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.890
They also do a lot of sales,
so if I do something like this,

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.840
I'll get it done as early as I can

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.320
and then every week
I check the coupons,

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.490
and when they hit the three-for-one
sale, bing, I order everything

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.470
for Christmas in one fell swoop.

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:32.610
And then the last thing I
want to share with you --

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:35.190
this is the cookbook
I made for my son.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:38.600 position:56%
We love to cook together and we were
always sort of missing peach season.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.010
We'd come and go and we'd
forget to do the peach recipes.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.880
So we put it together
in chronological order

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.960
and it's all the recipes.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.370
I had typed them up so I
printed them out on pretty paper

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.510
because it makes it more
interesting for a seven-year-old.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:55.170
I did some little photo collages,
again just at the drugstore,

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:58.550
printed them out, of pictures
of things we cooked and pictures

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.310
of the two of us cooking together.

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:03.780
But also pictures of the people
where the recipes came from.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.030
So my son, even though he's seven,
he knows the names of his --

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:11.230 position:56%
the grandparents he never got to
meet, and knows what they look like.

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:14.240
He knows what his great
grandparents' names are

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.540
and what they look like.

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.050
He's connected to it and he
knows a lot of the special things

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:22.320
that we've done and where
they've come from over the years.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.040
And we have a lot of fun
pulling out those same things

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.140
at the same time every year.

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.450
It's a easy way to do it.

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.550
I can wipe off if there's
spatters because they're

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:33.460
in those little plastic sleeves.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.580
And if it ever, you know,
falls into the fire I can print

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.630
out another copy which
is always good to know.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.880
It can't get lost at time.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.160
The last roadblock
I'd say is people --

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.140
I've heard often said that
nobody is interested but me.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.640
And I put this as the last one

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.740
because it sort of
comes back on you.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:57.570
I think to teach your children,
your nieces, your nephews,

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.420
but also the people that are
on the same generation as you.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.840
The more you talk about food, the
more you talk about family history,

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.050
the more they start to
feel interested in it.

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.490
And even if they feign
indifference now,

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:11.960
or maybe they are indifferent
now, but as time goes

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.520
on they may become interested.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.340
I think -- one of the
things I've seen is a lot

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.740
of times people get interested
at about retirement age,

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.220
so right about the time that the
generation before them has all

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.520
died out.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.800
They suddenly think,
I didn't think to ask.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.620 position:56%
Well, if you save these things,
then the people who come behind you,

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.690
if they didn't think
to ask early enough,

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:34.540
you've been kind enough
to save things for them.

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.620
The last thing I would say is

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:40.500
that sometimes you think
there's not a lot out there.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.720
When I started this book
I had two recipes from one

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.590
of my great grandmothers.

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:48.850
And by learning how to do the
research and learning who to ask

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.470
and learning some of
the tricks, I now --

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:55.570
this recipe that's pictured here is
for uncooked peanut butter fudge.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:56.940
My aunt sent it to me.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.500
I did ask her several
times about family recipes

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.610
and she told me, oh,
I don't have any.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.920
When my book came out and I
sent her a copy of the book,

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.620
the next week I got
this in the mail.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.270 position:56%
She said, I knew you wanted recipes.

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:09.570
I knew I had this.

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:10.950
But I just didn't connect
it in my head.

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:14.370
And once I -- she finally
did and sent this.

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:17.640
Now I have recipes from all
four of my great-grandmothers

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.830
which I would have
thought was impossible

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.850
because they didn't live
for me to meet them.

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:27.680
But sometimes it is
possible, which is fantastic.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.610
That was kind of fast.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:32.030
So are there any questions
or comments?

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:34.910
Lots of those people like to tell
me stories which I love, too.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.210
Yeah.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.510
&gt;&gt; If you're living
[inaudible] a little bit.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.660
If you get a recipe
that [inaudible].

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:44.480
I got two -- not so
much the food itself,

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.880 position:56%
but the memory that was [inaudible].

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.820
This is [inaudible] when I was
around 11 years old, we were living

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.120
at my grandmother's
house [inaudible],

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:56.680
and she was making cookies, and
I used to sneak in the middle

00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:02.710
of the night, take two
cookies, bring them to my bed,

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:04.270
and I couldn't get up in
the morning [inaudible].

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:07.010
It was the memory of
an idea [inaudible].

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:11.120
But that's an item
itself, but what it evokes.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.420
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: It's true.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.030
What he said is it's
not the item itself.

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:15.330
It's what it evokes.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:16.630
And I think that can be true.

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:20.210
One of the things that several
people I interviewed mentioned was

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:24.290
that not knowing when they
finally found a recipe and made it,

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:26.080
is this really what it tasted like?

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.330
Sometimes it's disappointing
like this isn't good.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:34.900
I think the memory of it
is probably everything.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:40.480
You know, if you -- you know, if
you make something and it's not,

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.700
it doesn't taste as
good as it used to.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:46.320
The memory is still very
important and compelling.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.290
One of the most interesting essays
I've read about the concept was

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:55.430
in the <i>Cornbread Nation </i>which
is a collection of food-writings,

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:56.730
and they've done several.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.210
And I think it was
<i>Cornbread Nation Four </i>.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:03.560
It was a essay about the -- there
was a lull after Hurricane Katrina,

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.790
and then all of a sudden the recipe
boards on various websites were hit

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:14.780
and hit hard with people desperate
to find copies or surrogates

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:18.890 position:56%
of recipes as a birthday came around
and you're living in a FEMA trailer.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:22.440
But if you can make the
cake that tastes like home,

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.910
we would all feel better.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:28.270
And people trying to find those
recipes and track them down again.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:31.470
There is real meaning, emotional
meaning, behind those recipes,

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.410
like with our chess tarts.

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:34.810
You know, to take a bite.

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.770
It means something to me that that
recipe is there and I've been able

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:39.500
to make it the way it tastes.

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.630
And it means something
to my brother.

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:43.470
It does.

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:48.070
&gt;&gt; Judith Jones, who
edited Julia Childs,

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:49.390
always invited the [inaudible].

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:52.100
She did many cookbooks.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:57.740
But she invited the authors to
cook in her penthouse apartment

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:02.070
which had a kitchen
the size of a closet.

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:06.560
But she has Lidia Bas Tianich
and she was observing her.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:14.230
And she saw her make a dry spot
in the middle of the frying pan

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:19.270
and squirting in some tomato paste.

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:23.260
And so she said to Lidia,
"Lidia, whatever are you doing?"

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.100
And said, "Well," she said,

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.710
"I always toast the tomato
paste before I stir it

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:34.490
in because it gives me an
extra layer of flavor."

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:39.640 position:56%
And Judith put her hands upon her
shoulders and said, [inaudible] that

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.220
and worse, you're going to
tell your readers this?"

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:48.950
And Lidia said, "I didn't know
I did it, you know [laughter]."

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:50.250
And --

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:51.550
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah.

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:54.960
&gt;&gt; -- and that was the very
reason that Judith had her do it,

00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:00.530 position:56%
because she knew that if she watched
the cook that she would catch up.

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:02.910
That's some of these little
things that make a difference.

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:04.210
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:05.510
The kitchen visit can
make all the difference.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:08.370
This, you know, recipe for
mulligan that my grandfather sent,

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:10.700
he thought he had sent
the complete recipe.

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.310
There were so many things he did
without even thinking about it.

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.270
It made a difference in the flavor.

00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:17.790
So being able to watch
sometimes is really key.

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:19.830
Yeah.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:24.130
&gt;&gt; My mother was a very good cook.

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:28.530
And my best friend really liked
this [inaudible] made from pork.

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.370
So she asked her for the recipe.

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:34.660 position:56%
And she said, I don't have a recipe.

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:39.290
Well, please give me the recipe.

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:42.850
So she finally, you
know, said, [inaudible].

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:49.390
But she cooked it and
it tasted [inaudible].

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:52.690
And the thing is, what
my mother did,

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:55.720
she put all what she
said in her cooking.

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:59.700
But then she changed it.

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:06.040
And then, oh, it's not enough
salt, so she added salt.

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.250
There's not enough
sugar so she added it.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:13.860 position:56%
So the adding stuff is not included.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.740
That's why it tastes different.

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.040
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: It's true.

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.360
And I think a lot of times
what I discovered was --

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:22.850
like my grandpa, he couldn't
tell you exactly what to do

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:25.920
with the tomatoes because it
depends on how juicy the tomatoes

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.150
or acidic the tomatoes, you know.

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:29.830
Have we had much rain lately?

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.970
How were the tomatoes
turning out this year?

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:36.380
But the more I cooked with him,
I got him in the habit of talking

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:39.170
out loud to me of -- he
would say, taste this.

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:41.150
It has that taste.

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:45.270
And I would suddenly realize
that, okay, it's a little acidic.

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:47.100 position:56%
That's what we're dealing with here.

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:48.540
It's not an exact science.

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:51.540
And there's no way to -- for me
to promise you that if you go

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:55.580
through these five steps you will
get a successful recipe at the end.

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:58.100
But I think one of the things
I learned is that when you work

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:02.370
with another cook, it develops
a really beautiful relationship

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:06.210
as the two of you as sort of
co-artists work together and learn

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:08.250
to talk together and
learn to really look

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:12.650
and watch what each
other's doing to get close.

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:15.910
And then to -- you know, in the
end, a lot of times you have

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:17.850
to have your own way of doing it.

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:21.100
It may not taste exactly
like grandma's.

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:24.400 position:56%
But you've gotten close and maybe if
she's still here you've spent time

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.590
with her and really sort
of gotten into her head

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.460
of how she makes her
cooking decisions.

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.610
Not exact science, but a
beautiful thing when you're talking

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:37.940
about connections and
foodways and why it matters.

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.170
You know, working with those
cooks is one of the best,

00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:42.470
best time you'll ever spend.

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:45.430
&gt;&gt; Valerie, thank you
for being an inspiration.

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:47.230
I can actually --

00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.340
I'm a social entrepreneur.

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.390
Kind of work my [inaudible].

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:55.690
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Oh.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:59.890
&gt;&gt; I also did a lot of [inaudible].

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:03.710
So I've been to Greece
a couple of times

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.470
when the [inaudible] first come in.

00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:14.210
There's a restaurant called
Damas, short of Damascus.

00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:16.120
And it's fascinating.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:21.380
So [inaudible] the first thing
you lose is your language

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.240
when you go to a new land.

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.660
Then some of your customs.

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:32.990
The last of your connections
with food.

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:34.290
So it's interesting.

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:38.720
It's fascinating to have people
leave Syria, go across to Turkey,

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.650
and take this really biggest
journey across the Aegean.

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:43.950
And they come to Greece.

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:45.550
Their native food in this
restaurant [inaudible].

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:46.900
So I'm not [inaudible] going back
to [inaudible] and their recipes.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.460
So this is very important
to me [inaudible].

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:49.760
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Oh, thank you.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.060
That's really, really important.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.430
Yeah. To be a stranger
in a strange land.

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:53.730
I've only tasted, you
know, that by, you know,

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:55.030
leaving when I was pregnant

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:56.330
and having a baby somewhere
thousands of miles away.

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.630
It still is nothing compared
to what they're dealing with.

00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:58.930
And the challenges of
finding the recipes

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.230
that work and the ingredients.

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:01.530
So, I hope that goes very well.

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:02.830
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:04.130
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:05.510
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:13.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; -- my grandmother [inaudible]
the first step [inaudible] from her.

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:19.330
But when I made it, it
just didn't [inaudible] --

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:20.630
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Right.

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:21.930
&gt;&gt; -- right.

00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:23.230
And that really [inaudible]
in the kitchen with her.

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:28.220
And then realizing that
she left out something.

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.520
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah [laughter].

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:33.890
&gt;&gt; Because it's like, oh,
well, writing it down.

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:39.960
I'll make sure I do this.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:43.970
And she didn't write it all down.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:50.300
So really having that connection
and being able to work [inaudible].

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.600
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.900
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] really.

&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah.

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, I forgot
to add this, you know.

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:58.630 position:56%
And even if you get the same recipe.

00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:04.470
For instance, you cook a
recipe and I cook a recipe,

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.890
and we did exactly
what they tell you,

00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:09.190
it's still comes up [inaudible].

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:10.490
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: It can.

00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:17.660
&gt;&gt; And because I think our
taste buds are different.

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:22.120
And I also know this, you
know, like I'm buying food

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.070
for different -- from
different people.

00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:26.370
So I [inaudible].

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:32.970
So I have two friends
[inaudible] and from one friend,

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:35.980
whatever she cooks, I like it.

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.340
And the other, you
know, I [inaudible].

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.110
So, first page, from
the one that I like,

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:40.410
is exactly like my [inaudible].

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:42.500
That's why I like all --
whatever she cooks I like it.

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.800
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Right.

00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.100
It's true.

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.260
I mean it's a fascinating thought
that people who are good cooks,

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:51.240
that they -- without being able
to articulate it, there's a range

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:55.990
of flavors and techniques that
they've adopted that's sort of --

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:58.970
that person in cooking form,
which is -- it's fascinating.

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.320
And when you've lost that --

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.410
that appendix that I wrote
about the Cajun chef,

00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:07.550
I think her sons have kind
of -- you struggle with that.

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:10.480
But after a while, at
least to be inspired

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.290
and learn to cook your own way.

00:59:12.290 --> 00:59:19.110
But it's still grounded in those
roots because you've taken the time

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:27.380
to collect those recipes and learn
from that way of doing things.

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.680
It's fascinating.

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very personal.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:34.780
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: It
is very personal.

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.740
Yeah.

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.500
&gt;&gt; I've been lucky
enough to be in a family

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.210
of pretty good [inaudible]
all the time.

00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:46.990
However, my grandmother, who
would [inaudible] was apparently a

00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:48.290
terrible cook.

00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:51.330
My mother and my aunt
have no interest in --

00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:54.890
I know that you've kind of talked
about this already, but you know,

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:56.330
they feel very above all of the
stuff that their mother made.

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.010
What advice do you have for me
to kind of spark their interest

00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:59.360
and say, hey, I know that, you
know, you can doctor this up

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.660
and make it better,
but how can I get --

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.960
convince them that
it's worth it, I guess.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.260
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.560
Well, apparently a lot of sources
-- there's a lot of cookbooks

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.860
and websites and blogs
that are very interested

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.160
in the mid-century cooking.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.060
And if that's what they're sort
of dealing with, is opening a can

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.440
of this, opening a mix of that --

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.820
Julia Child called them
assemblies, not recipes.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.520
But they do have value.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.820 position:56%
I mean, one of my favorite things --

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:21.160
my mom would open cans of cherry
pie filling and then you --

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.870
I'm sure some of you
are nodding this.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:25.530
You dump cake mix over
it, and then some butter.

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:26.860
It's called a dump cake.

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.510
And it's fantastic [laughter].

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.540
It's really low-brow
and it's fantastic.

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:35.160
I guess to -- if you can show
them some of those cookbooks.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.730
You know, go to the library
and see if you can grab some

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:39.810
of those mid-century celebration
kind of cookbooks and show them

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.530
that there are people who
are interested in this

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:42.970
and there are people who love this.

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:46.010
And that you would really
like to know the way,

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:47.310
you know, that those were done.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:52.820 position:56%
And it's true that -- I've developed
a mushroom sauce that's the right --

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.000
it's the right proportion, so
you can use it instead of any

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.420
of those cream of mushroom soup.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.300
And you can do things like that.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:04.710
And if you let them know that, hey,
this is the trail I want to follow,

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:06.530
but I want to stay
grounded in these roots.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.410
I hope that they'll
listen and [laughter] --

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:10.360
that's kind of difficult.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.660
But I hope so.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.960
Yeah.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.260
&gt;&gt; Sort of picking up
on that [inaudible].

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.560
It seems to me that holidays,

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.940
whatever your family
holiday traditions are,

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.360
is that it has to be a prime place.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.890
Because, you know, your chess
tarts or grandma's sugar cookies

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:33.050
or whatever your family tradition
is, even if it wasn't great,

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.090
there has to be pretty solid
memories, right [laughter]?

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.630
So that would be a
pretty good [inaudible] --

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.040
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.500
&gt;&gt; -- to talk about where that
came from or where your --

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:46.210
what their parents
did [inaudible], too.

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:47.510
I mean [laughter].

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:48.810
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: That's true.

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:51.850 position:56%
And so if you go far enough back you
hit the fresh and local thing again.

01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:53.910
You know, my great grandparents --

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.140
that was the only way they
cooked was fresh and local

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.690
and you could say, hey, there's
a lot of interest in that now.

01:01:58.690 --> 01:01:59.990
I want to learn how to do it.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:01.290
Yeah.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:04.970
&gt;&gt; Will you be at the Smithsonian's
Food [inaudible] Festival

01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:06.270
this Saturday?

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:07.570
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: No.

01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:08.870
I wish I could.

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:10.930
My husband was a VMI graduate and
their reunion is this weekend.

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:13.530
But I would love to.

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:16.270
Yeah.

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:20.440
&gt;&gt; So one of the pushbacks
that I got as I try

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.740
to show value [inaudible]
cookbooks, is, well,

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:25.350
I can get a recipe off Google.

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:34.190
And, you know, I try to say, well,
how about [inaudible] in memories

01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:40.190 position:56%
and -- what do you usually -- how do
you stop and see that [inaudible]?

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.490
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: I don't know.

01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:42.790
I mean there's some times like,
you know, trying to teach somebody

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:46.200
to love history or teach them
to love their family history.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.560
It can be a long road.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.710
But sometimes it can always
again turn on a dime, you know,

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:54.250
to get them to understand
that the recipes

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:55.650
that they have are very specific.

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:59.360
They were chosen -- brought into
the family for various reasons.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.660 position:56%
And they really reflect that family.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.180
And it's sort of a
unique conglomeration

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.700
that will never ever come
again, that collection.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.860
So that's probably the
way I would approach it,

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:14.170
is even if they're not the most
unique recipes in the world,

01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:16.550
it's a unique collection.

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:18.020
And I guess we're getting
sort of short on time.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.090
Let me take one more
question though.

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:24.190
&gt;&gt; When you did your cookbook,
and there was a relative

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:31.870
who had not given you a recipe,
do you think sometimes they're --

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:35.120
well, I'm not going to
give that one recipe.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.430
You know, that's my recipe.

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:39.730
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yeah.

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:41.440
&gt;&gt; And any suggestions
that you would have --

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.630
I think producing the
cookbook, that's a good thing

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:46.550
because they under -- they see it.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:48.820
But yet that recipe was
contained in it [inaudible].

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.540
You understand what I'm saying.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.840
&gt;&gt; Valerie Frey: Yes.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.140
That was a problem I came
across over and over again.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.300
And I did, I did talk
about it in the book.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.810
That a lot of times it's
a quality control issue.

01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:03.190
This is my pet recipe and what if
you don't do a good job with it

01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:04.830
and then you say it's mine?

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:07.860
So a lot of times when I --

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.630
when someone is kind enough to
give me a real signature recipe,

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:14.050
I assure them that I will
take great pains with it.

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.080
Also a lot of times, people
really want to be credited

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.520
for that something special
that they've developed.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.050
And so I will tell them, this
will have your name in the title.

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:25.160
And I will not change
anything about it.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.160
And sometimes that puts
people's fears to rest.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.780
But I came across so
many stories about that.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.820
And what I recommended is
if they just can't stand

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:37.540
to not have the corner on the
market, have them write it

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:41.180
down in detail as best they can
and put it with their last will

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.570
and testament [laughter].

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:45.300
That's the -- sort
of they can have it.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.640
But one of the things that
I pointed out to them --

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.430
if you hold that recipe
forever and you die with it,

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:56.140
people will talk longingly about
it for, oh, a decade, maybe two,

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.020
and then you vanish into the ether.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.800
But if you've saved that
recipe and you've shared it,

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.920
and you've taken pains with it,
you'll become legendary [laughter].

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks.

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:13.400
[ Applause ]

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.700
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.990
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
