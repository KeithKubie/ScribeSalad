00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.790
&gt;&gt; We're proud to have Aaron Santos here,
the author of, "How Many Licks? Or How to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:34.570
Estimate Damn Near Anything.”
So, Aaron is a local Ann Arbor resident.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:54.560
He's not only an author, but a physicist,
and also an occasional actor and director.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:32.570
So he's currently out doing some research
here at U of M.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:46.710
Just to give you a little bit more background
about Aaron, he attended MIT where he got

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.840
his B.S. in physics.
After graduating, he taught physics and chemistry

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:05.660
in the Boston Public School system.
And then, he attended Boston University where

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:19.230
he actually had his Ph.D. in physics.
So, we're in the presence of a very smart

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.400
man.
So, like I said, currently he is studying

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:39.799
at U of M, the various nanoscale systems,
so maybe you could expand on that a little

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.639
bit.
And then, without further ado, just please

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.209
help me welcome our author, Aaron Santos.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.209
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.700
Aaron Santos: You guys want me to do without
this, or? Okay.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.700
[pause]

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:12.980
Aaron Santos: Lindsay, can you hear me?
Is the camera going to be able to pick me

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:21.029
up fine?
Or should I use this one?

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:25.269
&gt;&gt; Maybe use that. Yeah. Sorry.

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:35.790
Aaron Santos: First of all, thank you all
for having me.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:49.370
It's an honor to be here, but I have to say,
I'm a little bit nervous, because this is

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.719
kind of a new experience for me.
I'm not really used to the whole author thing.

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:03.530
And I haven't really given very many talks
on it.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:14.849
So this is a little bit of an experiment for
me.

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:28.410
And it's not made easier by the fact that
the book that I wrote is essentially a book

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:39.600
of math problems.
So, trying to talk for an hour or so about

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.490
essentially just doing the math that you all
hated in high school.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:56.380
It's really hard to make that interesting.
So I spent the last week really trying to

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.710
find a way to make this entertaining for you
guys.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:15.280
So toward that end, I'm going to talk a little
bit about, first of all, why you want to do

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.860
the things like approximations, and why would
you want to calculate things.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:39.770
I'll tell you a little bit about one method
that I used in the book to show how to approximate

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:51.870
just about anything.
And then, I'll give you a few hopefully fun

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.910
examples of that.
So, when I was putting this together, I was

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:04.170
thinking, "What -- you know, why did I want
to write a book on this?

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:14.750
And what are the reasons?
And what did I want to get out of it?”

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:28.490
And the first thing I was thinking was that,
you know, doing math really helps you develop

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:39.210
critical thinking and reasoning skills.
But, that was also the most boring reason

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:51.889
I could come up with.
Of course, that's the reason why you take

00:06:51.889 --> 00:07:07.440
math in high school, but, you know, it's also
not very exciting.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:20.430
But one of the more practical reasons for
doing it is, it provides a good idea culture.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:47.210
So anybody who's watched the news lately has
heard a lot about the health care debate.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:56.750
You hear a lot of things like "socialism"
and, you know, "killing your grandma" and

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:05.960
things like that.
But, when you get down to it, the health care

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:14.190
problem, and health care in general, is really
just a math problem.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:26.780
You have X number of people that are in the
United States.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:45.129
Some fraction of them are going to get sick
during the next six months.

00:08:45.129 --> 00:08:58.959
And it's going to cost an average amount to
pay for that sickness.

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:11.110
So we just spread out the average.
By just averaging over all people, we just

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:24.279
get a rough estimate of how much we're going
to have to pay for everybody.

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:34.959
It's a very simple math problem.
It's not very complicated at all.

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:51.600
So really, if we're going to solve things
like this, it's helpful to just be able to

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.880
go through the math, and have a very informed
public opinion on things like this.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:07.010
So that's kind of a practical reason for doing
these kinds of problems.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:16.510
And then, the last one is really that it's
just kind of a fun game to play.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:28.339
And I'll give you an example of what I mean.
So I was at the original Spiderman movie.

00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:44.759
I was sitting there with a friend.
And Tobey Maguire is on screen.

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:54.100
He's, "Shoot the web. Shoot the web. Shoot
the web.”

00:10:54.100 --> 00:11:08.639
And if you look at it, the web's like this
thick.

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:15.500
And it's going, you know, 30 meters out from
him.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:36.260
And the friend sitting next to me was just
like, "How much does he have to eat to produce

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:46.930
all that web?”
And nobody actually ever sits down and takes

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:58.279
the time to calculate it, unless you're a
geek like me.

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:07.720
But that's basically the types of things that
I do.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:19.050
It's akin to doing -- I imagine doing with
a Sudoku or a crossword puzzle for anybody

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:31.290
else.
So, I want to talk a little bit about how

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:37.240
exactly we go about calculating something
like this Spiderman problem.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:48.740
And one method that you could use to do that
is something called the "Fermian Approximation.”

00:12:48.740 --> 00:13:00.999
So Enrico Fermi, who was an Italian physicist
 -- and a little bit of trivia for you -- half

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:07.050
of the particles in the universe were named
after him.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:20.939
Well, he popularized this method of computing
things to within an order of magnitude.

00:13:20.939 --> 00:13:27.060
The approximation varies with -- .
It's called Fermian approximations.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:37.829
And basically is, he would go up to his students
and say, "You.

00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:53.189
Tell me the number of piano tuners in Chicago.”
And of course, you know, I can tell by the

00:13:53.189 --> 00:14:05.269
blank stare on your face that you have no
idea how to do that.

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:25.339
And that's basically what his students thought.
But what he showed was that through very simple

00:14:25.339 --> 00:14:35.809
approximations, you can actually calculate
this and just about anything else.

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:46.929
Just by starting to look at, you know, using
very simple math to do these order of magnitude

00:14:46.929 --> 00:14:52.720
estimates.
So the first step in this process is to use

00:14:52.720 --> 00:15:08.980
what you know or look up what you don't know.
So I can start by saying, "Well, you know,

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:26.230
I can't figure out offhand just how many -- I
don't know offhand just how many piano tuners

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:34.160
are in Chicago.
But I know roughly five percent of my friends,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.879
you know, or like one out of 20 of my friends
owns a piano.

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:45.709
If I go down my Facebook page I say, "Well,
this person's musical.

00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:52.429
This one's not. This one's not. This one's
not."

00:15:52.429 --> 00:16:05.690
And five percent seems like a reasonable number.
Now, you say, "Well, you know, you can be

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:19.570
way off on that.”
You're true. I could be way off on that.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:35.940
But I know that it's less than 50 percent
of people, because that would just be like,

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:47.519
half of my friends don't own a piano.
So it's definitely less than that.

00:16:47.519 --> 00:17:06.830
But I know it's also more than one out of
every 200 people, because I know quite a few

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:20.040
people with pianos and it would be odd to
have that few pianos.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:36.090
So I know that that's somewhere in the bounds
of what you'd expect to be reasonable.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:48.480
And you basically go down the line.
You write down all the things you know.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:18:02.510
So the next thing is that, if you have a piano,
generally get it tuned about once a year.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:14.040
Now, if you're very neglectful, you might
get it tuned once every three years.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:34.590
But you're not going to get it tuned once
every 30 years.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:55.690
So we're in the bounds of what's reasonable.
You're also not going to get it tuned, you

00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:06.680
know, five times a year.
Because that would be very expensive, unless

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:21.690
you're somebody who really plays it often.
Most people are just getting it tuned, you

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:34.880
know, one or two times a year.
You go a little bit further.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:42.920
You say, "Maybe a piano tuner tunes two pianos
a day.”

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:55.190
And it's helpful to know the number of people
in Chicago is about three million people.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:11.080
You could just look that up on Google, or
you could know that roughly the number of

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:20.020
people in a big city is about a million people,
but Chicago is a pretty big city, so maybe

00:20:20.020 --> 00:21:06.260
it has a few million people in it.
So these are all

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:22.380
the things that you want to start off with.
And the next thing you want to do is, just

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:36.760
like you did in high school chemistry class,
you just want to cancel units.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:52.190
So if I wanted to calculate the number of
pianos, well, I know there's three million

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:59.620
people in Chicago.
I know there's one piano for every 20 people.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:09.830
So I just cancel units in the same way that
I did canceling grams per mole or whatever

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:15.980
you did in high school.
Yeah. It's the same exact thing.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:23.000
So two divided by two is one.
Three divided by three is one.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:38.120
And people divided by people is one.
And then you just do that excessively.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:53.230
So people will cancel with people, pianos
will cancel with pianos, years cancel with

00:22:53.230 --> 00:23:02.950
years, days cancel with days, tunings cancel
with tunings.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:08.740
And if you multiply all these numbers together,
at the end of the day, you calculate, you'll

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:14.820
get about 200 piano tuners in Chicago.
So starting from absolutely nothing, you really

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.030
can just build up and figure out a way to
come up with a reasonable answer.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:37.530
Now, you might ask, "Well, how do you know
that this is anything close to the actual

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:54.680
number?”
Well, if you look in the Chicago Yellow Pages,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:06.570
there's about 40 listings for piano tuners.
So we're off by less than a factor of ten.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.390
And we're probably even a little bit better
than that, because not every tuner is going

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:19.450
to pay for a listing.
And the ones that are listed might have several

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:26.740
tuners in them.
So we're actually pretty close in this regard.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:25:05.170
So, next, I'm going to get into -- what I
hope will be -- some fun examples for you

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:15.600
guys.
I'm going to start with a disclaimer that,

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:26.470
I just want to say, These are all just estimates.
I'm making no claims about their factualness.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.180
So, please don't sue me if I'm getting anything
wrong.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:35.120
And we're going to start with this guy, which
I'm assuming most of you all know him.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:44.840
For those of you who don't know him, this
is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:52.960
I suppose you could call him the character
who appears in the last enacted battle in

00:25:52.960 --> 00:26:01.370
Ghostbusters -- we were always trying to follow
them -- but the Ghostbusters movie leaves

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:09.700
one question that's unresolved.
How long would it take to eat it?

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.600
So again, you want to start with what you
know.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:26.320
If you take a marshmallow, you know it's about
an inch tall, maybe half an inch wide.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:38.150
So from that, I can calculate the volume of
the marshmallow.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:46.280
Just by taking an inch by half-an-inch by
half-an-inch.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:27:01.530
And if you look on the back of a package of
marshmallows, you could find that there are

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.420
about 25-calories in a marshmallow.
So, putting those things together, I could

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:11.180
say that there's about 75-calories for every
cubic inch of marshmallow.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:22.810
Now, looking at Mr. Stay Puft, he's about
the size of a ten-story building.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:33.520
Each story of the building is going to be
about 14 feet.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.530
Therefore he's going to be about 140 feet
tall.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:48.040
He's going to be a little less than half of
that amount wide.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:57.380
So we'll say 60 feet wide.
We'll say 60 feet deep.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:12.340
And from that, I just multiply all those numbers
together.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:30.720
I get his total volume, which will be on the
order of 500,000 cubic feet.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:36.320
And I can also convert that to inches.
So then the last part is, like we said before,

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.240
just cancel the units, multiply "calories
per inches cubed" by "inches cubed," you get

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.700
the number of calories, about 64 billion calories.
Now, if you take the FDA recommended 2000

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.670
calories per day, now we can calculate it
would take about 80,000 years to eat it.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:59.310
So this is a pretty fun example, I hope.
But I know there was a little bit of math

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.880
there.
And math can tend to lose people, so I want

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:16.660
to hopefully get your attention back.
So our next problem we'll be talking a little

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.500
bit about sex.
And since you all work at Google.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.400
I can only assume you're thinking one thing.
But I'm here to tell you that there's more

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.400
things in life than just coming up with the
world's greatest search--.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:51.640
So there's a problem with this calculation.
It's hard to start with what you know.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:30:03.717
Because there's many different types of people.
And as you can see by the wide variety of

00:30:03.717 --> 00:30:07.280
people that I've included in this slide, some
of them are going to be having more sex than

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.630
others.
In some cases, a lot more sex than others.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.900
But we need to come up with some numbers for
this.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.810
So we're going to use upper and lower bounds
to get a rough idea of where the average amount

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.150
of sex that people are having.
So the question we're considering is, "How

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.280
many people are having sex right now?”
Now, if I ask each of you how often you had

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.580
sex, each of you would give me a different
number.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.820
Now, there's a lot of different people in
the world.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.820
There's everything from babies to really old
people.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.820
You guys all look like mostly you're in your
20's and many of you are probably in committed

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.610
relationships.
So you're going to be having sex a lot more

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:42.250
than most people.
But that being said, the babies really bring

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:59.800
the number down.
So on average, people are probably not going

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:06.930
to be having sex once a day.
At the other end of the spectrum, the people

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.590
who are having sex can have a lot of sex.
So you're probably going to be having sex

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.980
more than once a year.
So, on average, you'd expect that once a month

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:18.460
seems like a reasonably good number.
It fits within the bounds of what we would

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:25.610
consider acceptable, at least by my standards.
So the next question is, you want to ask,

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:30.160
"Well how long does a typical sexual encounter
last?”

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:35.300
Well -- ten hours, at least if you trust your
Viagra commercials -- seems a little excessive.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.550
If your sex is lasting ten hours, you should
probably call your doctor about that.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:32:11.010
So that one's out.
Now, if your sex is only lasting ten seconds,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:27.020
we should probably just skip this one, you
know and not even count it. Don't add.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.380
So ten minutes seems like a reasonable amount
of time for a typical sexual encounter.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.920
So, if you take ten minutes and divide that
into a month and get your units to cancel,

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.920
you'll find out that people are roughly having
sex .02 percent of the time.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:51.140
Or put another way, the probability that any
of you in this room are having sex at this

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.190
instant is about .02 percent.
So I take that fraction and multiply that

00:32:54.190 --> 00:33:01.480
by the 6.7 billion people that you have on
the Earth.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480
You find that about two million people are
having sex at any given instant on the planet.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:09.430
So I know what you're thinking, "This is fun
for Marshmallow men and sex problems, but,"

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:29.410
you're probably thinking, "Is this actually
useful for anything?”

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:47.510
So, to answer that question, you know, I talked
a little bit about how you can use this in

00:33:47.510 --> 00:34:15.900
health care and government policy, but another
thing that's been in the news lately is the

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:24.000
energy crisis and How are we going to supply
energy as we run out of fossil fuels?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.320
What's a cleaner more efficient way of doing
that?

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:37.619
So you might want to ask, "Well, how much
area would it take to just tile some large,

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:44.430
you know, section of desert with solar panels
and Do we have enough space to get all of

00:34:44.430 --> 00:35:01.440
our energy with solar power?”
So to do this one, most of us don't have facts

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.590
about solar power stored away unless we do
research in that area.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:22.660
So it's helpful to do a quick Google search
just to find out some numbers.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:34.240
And doing that, we can find -- there's actually
a mistake in this slide.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:45.450
It should be 3.2 times 10 to the 12 watts
used by Americans.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:55.800
-- That's the amount of power that we use
at any given time.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.120
And if you look at the amount of sunlight
that's actually hitting the Earth, you'll

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120
find that there's about 650-watts per meter
squared.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.120
So roughly the size of your windshield is
getting hit with 650 watts of power every

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.120
second, which is why your car gets hot if
you park it in the sun for too long.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.120
So I can use these numbers to calculate how
much power I'll get now.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.120
But, unfortunately, even the best solar panels
are only about 40 percent efficient.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.120
And this is even assuming that you have the
best, top-of-the-line, just-coming-out-of-research-labs

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120
solar panels.
So again, you just do the mess in that part.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.120
You take the 3.2 x 10 to the 12 watts that
you need, divide that by the amount of energy

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.120
that you're getting now, and you'll find that
you'll need about 4600 square miles of area

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.120
just to power all the United States.
And that's about the size of Rhode Island.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.120
Now, obviously the good people of Rhode Island
probably don't want to give up their state

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.120
just so they can power all the other states.
So there's a lot of different people who are

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.120
thinking about, you know, Where can we actually
put these?

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.120
There's like a Solar Roads Project, where
people are saying, "We should tile the roads

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.120
with solar panels.”
When you have the power of these approximations

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.120
at hand, you can start to think about how
to solve these problems in a practical and

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.120
efficient way.
So I'm going to do one more problem, and then,

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.120
I'm going to end with the age-old question
 -- this is also where my book gets its title

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.120
 -- How many licks does it take to get to
the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop?

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.180
So again, you want to start with things that
you know.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:23.570
So I have somewhere the deep, dark recesses
of my pocket a tootsie pop.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:24.570
As you can see tootsie pops are about an inch
thick.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:29.400
So to get to the tootsie roll center, it's
going to be about a little less than a centimeter

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.400
to actually hit the tootsie pop.
Now, if I lick it, [licking] you can tell

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.400
it's been licked, because you can see there's
a little bit -- aside from the saliva -- you

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.400
can tell it just changes the shape of the
dome.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.400
Now, I'm going to hand this to you.
So go for it.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.400
That is all you if you want it and you think
I'm healthy.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.400
Well, that might be well to doing some Google
searches to find out about my health background.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400
You can just barely tell it's been licked.
All right?

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400
I can hand that to you, and you are not going
to want to eat it yourself.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.500
So it makes sense to assume that the amount
of material that I remove from the surface

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.500
of the tootsie pop is just barely the amount
that I can see.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.500
And if you look up online the smallest resolution
of the human eye can see things for now about

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.640
ten microns, which is about ten thousand times
smaller than a centimeter.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.640
So all I have to do is divide the distance
I have to travel by the distance removed per

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.640
lick and I will get about 800 licks.
Now again, you might want to check the factualness

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.640
of this.
This is a true story.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.640
I had a friend in college who actually sat
down and counted the number of licks it takes.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.640
Now, of course, it's going to depend a little
bit on how big your tongue is, and you know,

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.640
how much saliva you have, things like that.
But they got 900 licks, and I got 800.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.970
So I feel like I'm pretty close, definitely
within a power of ten.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:55.231
So with that, I'm going to end here, and I
will take questions from you guys if you have

00:36:55.231 --> 00:36:56.231
any.

00:36:56.231 --> 00:36:57.231
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:36:57.231 --> 00:36:58.231
Q So what made you decide to write this for
your book?

00:36:58.231 --> 00:36:59.231
Aaron Santos: That's a good question.
It was during my graduate quals, and the Fermi

00:36:59.231 --> 00:37:00.231
problem was just something that -- it was
one of the problems on the qualifier exam.

00:37:00.231 --> 00:37:04.810
And I just got enough of preparing for that,
I said, "Hey, this would make a good book.”

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.043
It was that in mind.

00:37:06.043 --> 00:37:07.120
Q Is there a real life experience where you
estimated something that turned out to be

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.120
really valuable for more than just?

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120
Aaron Santos: Yes. Plenty, actually.
So whenever you're doing -- this would be

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.600
useful for you guys too.
If you want to figure out how fast something

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.940
you're -- do takes.
You always want to do some rough estimate

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.900
on it.
And in physics, a lot of times you don't know

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:24.280
 -- you have a very little information about
where you're supposed to be looking for something.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.660
So an experimentalist will want to know where
to set their dial.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.361
And to do that -- the best way to do that
is, just have a rough estimate of where you

00:37:31.361 --> 00:37:33.080
are looking to see whatever phenomenon you
are searching for.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.790
And doing computational physics -- that's
something I do a lot.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:35.910
I try and calculate.
In the introduction, you mentioned that I

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.440
study nano particles and nanoscale self-assembly.
So if you're trying to get something to self-assemble,

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.840
a lot of times it happens in a rare event.
So you want to know how long your simulation

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.200
is going to run.
You don't want to run a simulation once a

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.100
month and not get any data and then never
be able to take your thesis or paper out of

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.520
it.
So it's something that I use in research every

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.520
day.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.520
[pause]

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.520
Q [inaudible]

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.520
Aaron Santos: Well, the math is always the
same and the ______ version is always the

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520
same.
So it's the same math but just with bigger

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520
numbers.
But one of the things that I think if you

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520
do enough of these sort of problems is, it
gives you an appreciation.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.520
You start to get what I call "numerical landmarks"
in number space.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.520
You know, that you can spend a thousand dollars
a day with -- if you have a million dollars

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520
you can spend a thousand dollars a day for
like three years.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.520
But if you have a billion dollars, you can
spend a thousand dollars a day going back

00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.520
to the time of like Christ.
So you start to -- big numbers and small numbers

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520
are just like anything else.
Once you've worked with them enough, you kind

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520
of, I guess, build a conception for how big
they are.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520
So another thing you can -- another example
is, numbers of stars in the sky or how big

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.520
the universe is or how long the universe has
been around.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.520
And these are all things that physicists estimate
all the time.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520
It's basically the same thing that they're
doing there.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520
[pause]

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.520
Q I have a question back here.
So one thing that we do a lot here at Google

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.520
is, we try and forecast what our advertisers
will be spending and how we may be able to

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520
get that impact and help build their business
even more.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.520
So do you have any suggestions or tips on
how, you know, how better to forecast?

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.520
Aaron Santos: How to better forecast.
Well, I don't know very much about advertising

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.520
or business in general.
But I think any time that you can sit down

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.520
and say you can set bounds on where things
are going to be.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.520
You know, if company X wants to sell this
much product, and you have some rough idea

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520
of how many advertisements you're going to
have to send out there 'til you hit somebody

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.520
who that advertisement is going to reach.
Then you can start to make some progress in

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.520
terms of where you should be directing things.
And then, this sort of approximation technique

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.520
would definitely be useful for that, much
like anything else.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520
But as far as specific examples for how to
be useful, I'm a little bit at a loss just

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.520
because I'm not familiar with that.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520
Q Did math always come easy to you, or do
you have tricks that you learned along the

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520
way that help simplify it for you?

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520
Aaron Santos: Does math always come easy for
me? Yes and no.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520
I think -- and you always learn tricks along
the way, right?

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.520
Your math teachers tell you that.
Every integer, multiply it by five or zero.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.520
There's always these sort of tricks for it.
But I think for me, I think I was always pretty

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.520
good at math, but any time you can come up
with a trick, it's useful.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.520
I can't point to anything in particular and
say, "That's what helped me get over the hump.”

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.520
I will say that, since I started doing a bunch
of these problems, I've been able to conceptualize

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520
numbers a lot better than I was before.
So I think it's pretty useful for that regard.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.520
[pause]

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.520
Aaron Santos: [in an incredulous tone] You
dropped it?

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.520
[laughter]

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.520
Aaron Santos: Now you're definitely not going
to want to lick it.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.520
Yummy. Anybody else?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.520
Q So do you always win contests where you
have to guess how many jelly beans are in

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.520
the jar?

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.520
Aaron Santos: I always come pretty close.
I don't always win.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.520
That's, you know, usually they put it in some
odd-shaped container to try to fool you a

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.520
little bit.
This is a great -- in fact, if you're ever

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.520
at a carnival, now you know how they guess
the number of jelly beans in a jar.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.520
There's a funny story about that actually.
So I was at -- like I said, I'm new to this

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.520
whole author thing -- so when I -- we were
going through different titles of the book,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.520
and naturally, one of the original book titles
or covers that they had, was this jelly bean

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.520
jar filled and just that it's the standard
problem that you could use this for.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.520
Well, the problem is, the title we really
wanted to use was, "Great Estimations," something

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.520
my friend came up with.
We thought it was like a clever pun.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.520
But it turned out there was already a book
on the market called Great Estimations.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.520
So, anyways, I was telling some people about
it, and they were like, "Don't worry.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.520
Don't worry. Titles are not copyrightable.
You can get away with it.”

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.520
So then the first thing that my publishing
company gets back to me with the picture with

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.520
the cover is the exact same cover picture
as the book that's already published called

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.520
Great Estimations.
It was the jelly bean copy.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520
So as much as I wanted to use the jelly bean
example, I just couldn't do it, because there

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.520
was already a book out there on it.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.520
[pause]

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.520
Aaron Santos: I'll say one more thing.
Calculating stuff is pretty fun, and you can

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.520
almost always get answers for questions.
But I stress "almost," because there have

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.520
been two or three problems that I could just
not come up with a good answer for.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.520
I'll throw this one out there.
If any of you can solve it, please let me

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.520
know.
A friend of mine knew I was writing a book,

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.520
and they said, "I've got a great problem for
you.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.520
If you took all the fish out of the ocean,
how much would it sink?”

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.520
So if any of you guys can come up with an
answer for this, please let me know.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.520
I can probably come up with an average size
for a fish, but I just have no idea figuring

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.520
out how many fish there are in a population.
Any of you guys can come up with any other

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.520
way to figuring that one out, please let me
know, because that one has been bugging me

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.520
for years.
The other one I couldn't come up with? There

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.520
was one suggested by my sister, and it was,
"How many fireflies would it take to produce

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.520
the output of a lighthouse?”
And I just could not come up with a way of

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.520
estimating the light coming out of a firefly
without thinking that I was going to be really,

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.520
really far off.
So there's definitely -- I think there's always

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.520
 -- There's always questions I won't even
attempt.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.520
Like, somebody asks, "What's the probability
that God exists?”

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.520
It's not really a physical question.
Philosophers have been dealing with it for

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520
centuries, and I'm not likely to interdict
anything useful.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.520
So as long as it's a physical question, usually
you can come up with a pretty good estimate

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.520
for the answer.
Yeah, way back there.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.520
Q So we were trying to solve a problem and
realized we were way off after you actually

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.520
looked at it?

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.520
Aaron Santos: Oh, yeah. All the time. All
the time.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.520
Usually, though, it's because I do the math
wrong, as opposed to getting the method wrong.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.520
It's usually -- because usually you can come
up with a pathway to get the answer, and then,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.520
you just have to stick with that mistake.
And then, those are easy to correct.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.520
Occasionally, you get -- one of the assumptions
I made in the beginning is that, it's important

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.520
to try to be careful about -- and that's usually
the time you're most skeptical them, about

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.520
the whole process.
And usually you think, "I can do math.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.520
I'm not going to make any mistakes there.”
And that's where you run into problems.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.520
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.520
Aaron Santos: So I have to ask. Is this like?
I mean, I remember being in school.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.520
And they would have like, you know, every
once in awhile, they'd have a convention where

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520
you could get out of English class.
Is this like that for you guys?

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.520
Are you guys like trying to come up with questions,
because you don't have to go back to work

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.520
if you stay here?

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.520
Q I'd say there are more people who didn't
come, because they're stressed out about a

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.520
number of things.
I think part of our corporate culture faults

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.520
is not -- we don't get out of anything, and
you put bust your butt at night.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.520
So we're probably like the more prudent ones
that are like try to work like everyone else.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.520
[inaudible]

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.520
Aaron Santos: I'm not, but I see the video
arcade over there.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.520
I see the piano over there.
I see what looks like some sort of ________

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.520
over there.
So I assume you guys are very busy and professional.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.520
Oh. So you want me to estimate this.
Well, given by the numbers of chairs here,

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520
I'd say about six by ten rows.
You could fit about a hundred people in here,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.520
so I want to say maybe a hundred or so people.
150 people.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.520
&gt;&gt; Within a power of ten.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.520
Aaron Santos: What's the actual number?

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.520
&gt;&gt; About 63. Maybe more.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.520
Aaron Santos: I'm going to be looking for
the opposite, if you're looking for more people.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520
[inaudible]

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.520
Aaron Santos: I'm not sure do you like ______
I'm not sure _____________ do for you guys

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.520
though.
I'd be _________ by your research stuff they

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.520
are pretty hard core on research.
Yeah.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.520
They were the guys who were going around in
individual atoms and spelling out IBM on that.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.520
So they're pretty ____.
It would be harder to spell out Google just

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.520
because they have more letters.
So any more questions? Things you would like

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.520
me to measure an estimate for.
Yeah?

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.520
Q So this is kind of silly, but I feel like
anyone going through the interview process

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.520
here they estimate.
Sometimes these are questions that you get

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.520
asked at interviews.
And I was like always afraid of teachers.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.520
I know, I still haven't figured out if it's
meant to like throw you off, put you on the

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.520
spot, like show how you'd solve the problem,
or or think outside the box or what?

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.520
I know one that I got was, How would you estimate
the number of cans you would need to paint

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.520
half the houses in the U.S.
with?

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.520
Aaron Santos: Oh yeah. That's pretty standard.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.520
Q Well, I guess so I'm kind of curious?

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.520
Aaron Santos: There's about 300 million people
in the U.S.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.520
Presumably you can fit four people -- We'll
say three people to make the math a little

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520
easier -- three people per home.
That's all.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.520
About a hundred million homes.
Some people live in apartments or -- for now.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.520
So let's see.
Where would you go from there?

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.520
The amount of paint. Oh.
I had a can of paint that painted basically

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.520
one wall in my apartment.
And I imagine an actual house would be anywhere

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.520
from 10 to 50 sizes of that wall.
So that gives you a rough idea of how much

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.520
paint you would need per house.
And then, you just multiply that by the number

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.520
of houses.
So, is that something close to what you said?

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.520
So, cool. So you already know what you are
doing.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.520
Q We'll see.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.520
[inaudible]

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.520
Aaron Santos: What? Did it have to be blue
or did I have to take into account there was

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.520
going to be a shortage of blue paint eventually,
or is that?

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.520
Q Yeah, so actually, the way I answered was
say that I would paint every single house,

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.520
but only paint half the house blue just because
I couldn't figure out how much paint it would

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.520
take to do a half of one house, so it's easier
to muliply it out.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.520
Aaron Santos: Right. Right.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.520
Q No one would probably want half of a house
painted, so I'm not sure if my answer is right.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.520
[inaudible]

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.520
Aaron Santos: You were not popular here; are
you?

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.520
Q No, we have a pretty good group here.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.520
[inaudible]

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.520
Aaron Santos: What's that?

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.520
Q In his office?

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.520
Aaron Santos: In the office?

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.520
Q In Ann Arbor.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.520
Aaron Santos: In our state vs. university
feds.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520
Well, that would be hard to estimate, because
the state feds had to be a lot quieter, because

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.520
they know they're outnumbered.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.520
Q Not me. Not here. Not in this office.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.520
Aaron Santos: When are they playing State?

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.520
Q November third.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.520
Aaron Santos: November third. Okay.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.520
[inaudible]

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.520
Aaron Santos: I wonder if there are going
to be if is it as loud or three hundred people

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.520
louder by state like on campus like are they
just much more vocal? No?

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.520
It doesn't really matter anyway you guys don't
count, only out of state counts.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520
Q I have one last approximation question.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.520
Aaron Santos: Sure.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.520
Q So the Google logo is, you know, the colors
of legos.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.520
So how many legos are there in the United
States?

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.520
Aaron Santos: Oh, Geez. That's a good question.
Well, you mean ever, or now?

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.520
Q Right now.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.520
Aaron Santos: Right now.
Well, you can say roughly 50 percent of the

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.520
population is children.
So that's 150 million kids.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.520
I know I had legos when I was a kid.
And since you guys work at Google, I'm going

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.520
to assume that there's a large factor here.
So I'm assuming most of you guys had legos.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.520
But I'm not sure in general, the population
had.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520
Let's say 50 percent of the kids have legos.
You know, so I would say 150 million kids,

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.520
50 percent have legos -- We're talking about
individual lego pieces?

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.520
God, how many lego pieces did I have when
I was a kid? All right.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.520
I built things that were like yea big.
So if you are taking lego pieces that are

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.520
this big, probably be 10 x 10 x 10.
So it'd be like 1,000 lego pieces per kid.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.520
150 million kids, half of those.
I'm going to think about this one a little

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520
bit more, but I would say on the order of
one to ten million legos pieces.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.520
But it could get -- I want to think about
this one a little bit more, though, because

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.520
it could get thrown off, because rich kids
could have billions of legos.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.520
So, you know, I definitely need to think about
that one more.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.520
That's a good question.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.520
Q They make big legos now, are these only
like 30 pieces per box.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.520
Aaron Santos: I always assumed those were
for like, I mean, they're closer to Lincoln

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520
loggers, because you couldn't do much with
them.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.520
It's classic legos, or nothing for me.
That's where I draw the line.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.520
And then megablocks don't count.
Those are like the cheap legos you got when

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.520
your parents didn't want to buy you the actual
legos.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.520
That's all I have.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.520
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much for coming.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:15.521
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
