00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.460
[music playing]

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.086
All right, you
guys getting ready?

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:03.795
Yeah.

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.547
Yes, we are.

00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:08.425
NARRATOR: On the waters of Lake
Michigan, treasure hunter Kevin

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:13.179
Dykstra, his brother Al, and
researcher Jeff Zehr, or about

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.559
to dive on what may be the
remains of a wooden boxcar,

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:22.772
a boxcar that once contained
a reported $140 million

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:26.651
in stolen Confederate gold.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:27.986
I think we're on it.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.863
Everything is working
according to plan.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.698
All the resources are great.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.492
So I'm very excited.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:37.579
NARRATOR: Unfortunately,
in the last several minutes

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.331
the waters of Lake Michigan
have become noticeably

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:44.627
choppier, and more dangerous.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:47.839
The water out in Lake
Michigan can be very rough.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.842
Diving off from the main deck
of the boat is just really hard.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.677
Those waves can be treacherous.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:57.974
[grunts]

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:10.695
NARRATOR: The rough waters
caused Kevin's body to collide

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.906
with the steel dive platform.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.325
He appears to be
seriously injured.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:44.229
[grunts]

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.652
[grunts]

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.112
Yeah!

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.828
Al and Jeff, out!

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:06.543
NARRATOR: What began as a day
of optimism and excitement

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:10.088
has now become one
of anxiety and fear.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:10.630
He's hurt.

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:30.859
NARRATOR: Because Kevin
could be seriously injured,

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.988
the team cannot risk moving
him onto the deck of the boat.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.782
They must tend to him
on the dive platform,

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.034
as Captain Dave
van Farowe rushes

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:42.412
the Neptune back to shore.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.539
What's going through
my mind is panic.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.291
It's devastating.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.625
He's my strong brother.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.753
He's the one that's,
you know, active.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:52.839
He's always doing something.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.592
You know, I don't want
him seriously injured.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.843
I'm super worried.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:57.677
Super worried.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:20.992
Come on back here.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:21.534
Hello.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.541
He jumped off this
ladder and hit this metal

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.210
casing on the way in.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.671
You know, I'm very worried
at this point for Kevin.

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.006
You know, I just
thank the Lord that we

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.424
were able to get him out.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.676
But it's a scary moment
for all of us right now.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.767
NARRATOR: Having been alerted
by Al Dykstra, Kevin's

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.186
wife, Joanna, has
rushed to the dock

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.772
at the news of Kevin's accident.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:51.648
One--

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:52.440
Don't twist me over.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.608
--two, three.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.402
[screams]

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:59.405
NARRATOR: With Kevin back
on shore and in the hands

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.283
of medical professionals,
he and his team

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:05.286
must now face a
troubling question.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:08.373
Could Kevin's quest to
find a fortune in stolen

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:11.584
Confederate gold
be over just when

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.879
he thought he was so close,
he could almost reach out

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:15.546
and touch it?

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:17.590
[siren]

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.513
Or might there be a darker and
more mysterious force at work?

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:27.475
A force that remains determined
to keep the gold at the bottom

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:32.647
of the lake, and that curses the
souls of anyone who ever dares

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.316
to bring it to the surface?
