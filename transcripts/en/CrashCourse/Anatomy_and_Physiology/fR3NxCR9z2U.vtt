00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.410
I weigh about 80 kilograms.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.890
Most of that, let’s say 64 percent, is water
-- though you can’t tell by looking.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.680
I mean, as organisms go, I like to think that
I look fairly solid.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.910
After water, the next largest proportion of
me is protein, about 16% -- not just in my

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.820
muscles, but also in things like the tiny
sodium-potassium pumps in my neurons, and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.640
the hemoglobin in my blood, and the enzymes
driving the chemical reactions in every one

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.750
of my 37 trillion cells.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.720
Then another 16% of me is fat, which I’m
totally OK with;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.600
Four percent of me is minerals, like the calcium
and phosphorus in my bones, and the iron in my blood;

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.090
and 1 percent is carbohydrates, most of which
is either being consumed as I talk to you,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.660
or is sitting around as glycogen waiting to
be used.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.340
But here’s the thing: It’s not like I just ate 80
kilograms of food and then all this happened.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.010
Instead, my body, like yours, is constantly
acquiring stuff, extracting some of it to

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.899
keep, burning some of it for energy, and getting
rid of the rest.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.559
But even the stuff that my body does hold
onto doesn’t last forever. Some of the chemicals

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.879
that I absorb in my food eventually become
a part of me. But enzymes wear out, and membranes

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.440
break down, and DNA gets oxidized. So, they
get discarded.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.020
And then I need more of those chemicals to
reconstruct the material that I’ve lost.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.469
As a result, over the course of my lifetime,
my cells will synthesize somewhere between

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.109
225 and 450 kilograms of protein …

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.630
That’s like 3, or 4, or 5 separate me’s
-- just made of protein.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.510
And all of the protein and fat and 
carbohydrates nucleic acids that

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.810
make up me, of course, come from food.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.679
Every organism has to keep taking in and breaking
down food, to keep resupplying itself with

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.560
the raw materials it needs to survive.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.749
And all that activity requires energy, which
we also gain from food.

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.990
So, how do our bodies actually convert what
we eat into energy and raw materials?

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.889
The answer is a neverending series of reactions
that are dedicated to doing two vital, and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.179
totally contradictory, things:

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.020
One set of chemical reactions destroys the
reactants that you give them, reducing big,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.299
complex substances into molecular rubble.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.649
And the other set reassembles that rubble
into new and bigger products that are put

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.559
together again to make you.

00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:03.679
So our bodies are constantly reinventing themselves --
in a perpetual state of loss, but also always rebuilding.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.479
And even though all of this is happening at the
cellular level, its consequences could hardly be larger.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.969
These two sets of reactions are where everything
that we’ve learned so far -- about the digestive,

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:16.930
endocrine, circulatory, and respiratory systems
-- really starts to come together.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.150
Together, these processes make up your metabolism.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.640
Now the sciencey word metabolism has
come to have a meaning in popular speech,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.060
but metabolism isn’t just one thing.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.189
People talk about metabolism as meaning, like,
how fast your body burns the fuel in your

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.150
food, or how high your personal energy level
is.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.859
And that’s fine for use by personal trainers
and fitness magazines.

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:53.039
But physiologically, metabolism really describes every
single biochemical reaction that goes on in your body.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.400
And maybe more importantly, it reconciles
two conflicting chemical processes that are

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.620
always, simultaneously underway inside of
you.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.069
One of those chemical forces is anabolism.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.310
Anabolic reactions construct things and consume
energy.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.989
These are the processes that take the small
monomer building blocks in your food -- like

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.689
monosaccharides and fatty and amino acids
-- and build them into bigger, more complex

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.989
polymers like carbs, and fats, and proteins
that are used in your cells.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.459
Then, when you need new building blocks, or
you need to release some energy, those polymers

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.319
in your body, or new ones in your food, get
broken up -- by catabolic reactions.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.999
The processes of catabolism break down bigger
molecules, and in breaking their bonds, release

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:35.409
the energy you need to stay warm, and move
around, and provide your cells with fuel … to

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.269
build the polymers back up again.

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.429
To be honest, your metabolism is a lot like
Sisyphus. It works really hard. But it is never finished.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.329
And the boulder that your inner Sisyphus is
always pushing uphill and watching fall back

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.090
down? That’s nutrients -- the molecules
that your body is forever breaking up, and

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.719
then rebuilding, only to have them break apart
again.

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.970
And these nutrients -- the materials your
body needs to build, maintain and repair itself

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.829
-- come in six major groups.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.370
By volume, the majority of what we consume
-- and what makes up our bodies -- is water,

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.159
so that’s maybe the most vital nutrient.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.730
Then there are vitamins, compounds that come
in either fat-soluble or water soluble forms.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.359
They aren’t used as building blocks or for
energy, but they’re essential in helping

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.810
the body make use of other nutrients that
do do those things.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.620
Vitamin C, for example, helps improve iron
absorption, while vitamin K is crucial to

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.039
blood clotting, and some B vitamins are important
in the production of ATP from glucose.

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.830
Minerals, like vitamins, they don’t provide
fuel, but they have all sorts of other functions.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.130
Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus harden
bones and teeth, while iron is, of course,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.009
crucial in hemoglobin. Plus, potassium, sodium,
and chlorine help maintain your body’s pH

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.289
balance and are used in action potentials.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.880
So water, vitamins, and minerals are all … necessary.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.590
But the three major nutrients that everyone
always talks about -- the ones you find on

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.400
food labels, from oatmeal to Pop-Tarts -- are
carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.480
Most of the carbohydrates you’ve ever eaten

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.600
-- with the exception of lactose in milk --
originally came from plants.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.210
Mono- and disaccharides come from fruits, honey,
sugar beets and sugar cane, while polysaccharide

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.250
starches come from veggies and grains.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.889
The main thing you need to know is that the
monosaccharide glucose is the be-all-end-all

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.930
molecular fuel that your cells need to make
ATP.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.400
ATP being the molecule that your cells use
to drive anabolic reactions, when they need

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.110
to make new polymers or get anything else
done -- whether that’s operating a sodium-potassium

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.490
pump, or detaching the head of a myosin filament
to contract a muscle.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.090
But ATP is too unstable to store, so cells
often store energy in the form of glucose,

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.360
which they can then catabolize and convert
to ATP when they need it.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.169
Now, some of your cells can get their energy
from fats. But many of the most important

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.930
ones, like your neurons and red blood cells,
feed exclusively on glucose. So most of the

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.360
carbs that your intestines absorb are converted
to glucose for that reason.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.660
But, if it’s not needed right away, that
energy can also get stored as glycogen in

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.590
your liver and muscles, or converted to glycerol
and fatty acids to make triglyceride fats.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.050
And even though there seems to be a marketing
war going on against dietary fats,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.909
we most definitely need them.

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.460
The fats in your adipose tissue store energy,
of course, but they also store fat-soluble

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.970
vitamins, and cushion your organs.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.699
Lipids also form the myelin that insulates
the neurons in your brain and throughout your

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.339
body, as well as the oil in your skin, and they
provide the vital calorie content found in breast milk.

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.919
But there are other important lipids, like
cholesterol, which is the precursor to things

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.060
like testosterone and estrogen...

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.979
...and, of course, phospholipids, which form
the cell membrane in every single one of the

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.229
three-dozen-or-so-trillion cells you have.

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.470
Now, if you’re into eating meat, a lot of
the fat that you ingest might come from that.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.780
But guess what: Plants have fat too.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.990
Plants use lipids for energy storage just
like we do, except they do it in fruits, and

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.900
nuts, and seeds. Which, when you think of
it, are kind of like plant breast milk -- it’s

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.069
food for their growing babies.

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.460
Either way, though, when you eat lipids, your
body breaks down triglycerides into glycerol

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.550
and fatty acids.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.940
Those molecules can then be processed and
used in the making of ATP. Or they might be

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.770
converted into other kinds of fatty acids,
which your cells can then re-assemble into

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.930
your very own triglycerides or phospholipids.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.110
And your liver happens to be great at converting
one fatty acid into another, but there are

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.009
some it just can’t synthesize.

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.960
For example, omega 6 and 3 fatty acids are
called essential fatty acids, because your

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.610
body can’t make them, so they have to be
ingested.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.560
They get turned into all kinds of useful molecules,
like the ones used for synapse formation in

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.120
the brain, and for signalling inflammation
during the healing process.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.639
But -- if carbohydrates provide energy, and
fats insulate and store energy, then just

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.599
about everything else is done with proteins.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:26.229
They form the bulk of your muscle and connective
tissue, but they’re also what the ion channels

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.689
and pumps are made of in your neurons and
muscle cells, and they make up your enzymes,

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:33.949
which are responsible for pretty much every
chemical reaction in your body.

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:38.110
In other words, your body runs on protein,
and pretty much is protein.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.580
Nutritionally speaking, meats, dairy products,
eggs, legumes, nuts, cereals are particularly

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.199
high in protein. But because everything we
eat was once alive, and every cell of every

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:52.039
living thing contains protein, as long as
you’re eating whole foods, you’re at least

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.289
partially re-stocking your protein supplies.

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:59.259
Now it might seem like you’d have eat muscle
to make muscle, or eat enzymes to make enzymes,

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:00.189
but that’s not how it works.

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:04.150
Since all of your proteins are made up of
just 20 amino acids, the differences between

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.629
the thousands of unique proteins are simply
in the sequence of those amino acids.

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:12.800
And, of course, you have a specialized molecule
that knows just which amino acids to put together

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.880
in what order to make a certain protein.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.539
It’s called DNA.

00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:19.949
When you consume some hamburger, for example,
the protein actin in the meat gets catabolized

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:24.449
into its component amino acids, which gets
mixed up with all the amino acids from the

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:29.039
other proteins in the meat -- like the collagen
and elastin and titin and myosin -- as well

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:32.110
as all the protein from the bun and the tomato
and the mayonnaise.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.840
Those amino acids then get reassembled using
anabolic reactions into your very own, but

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.960
somewhat different, proteins, as defined by
your DNA.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.910
Each cell is like a picky little Gordon Ramsay
and it has to have every amino acid needed

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:49.410
-- every ingredient present -- before it will
even think about starting to make a protein.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.450
And just like with your lipids, your cells
can improvise, and convert some amino acids

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.450
to others if they’re missing an ingredient.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:00.920
However, there are nine essential amino acids
that you cannot make from others, and have to eat.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.390
Now lots of foods don’t provide every essential
amino acid, but when you combine foods, like

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.520
beans and rice, or pasta and cheese, you do
get all of the essential amino acids. Which

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.800
is important because, remember: after water,
you are mostly made of protein. On the order of 16%

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.810
But what about the one percent of you? The
carbohydrates?

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.700
How that tiniest fraction of you ends up creating
all of the energy, is what we’ll discover next time.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.550
But for now, you’ve learned all about the
vital nutrients -- including water, vitamins,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:31.330
minerals, carbs, fats, and proteins -- as
well as how anabolic reactions build structures

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.950
and require energy, while catabolic reactions
tear things apart and release energy. And

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:41.000
together, these competing forces form the
wonderfully conflicted process known as metabolism.
