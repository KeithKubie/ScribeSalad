00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
 

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.900
We've already made a few
definitions of operations that

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.080
we can do with vectors.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.620
We've defined addition in
the context of vectors

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.460
and you've seen that.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.440
If you just have two vectors,
say a1, a2, all the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.330
way down to a n.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.600
We defined the addition of this
vector and let's say some

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.180
other vector, b1, b2,
all the way down to

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.300
bn as a third vector.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.390
If you add these two, we defined
the addition operation

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.360
to be a third-- you will result
in a third vector where

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.230
each of its components are
just the sum of the

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.020
corresponding components of the
two vectors you're adding.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.780
So it's going to be a1 plus b1,
a2 plus b2, all the way

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.900
down to a n plus bn.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.170
We knew this and we've done
multiple videos where we use

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.900
this definition of
vector addition.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.710
We also know about scalar
multiplication.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.455
 

00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:00.107
Maybe we should just call it
scaling multiplication.

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:04.129
 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.070
And that's the case of look, if
I have some real number c

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.170
and I multiply it times some
vector, a1, a2, all the way

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.600
down to a n, we defined scalar
multiplication of a vector to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.820
be-- some scalar times its
vector will result in

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.020
essentially, this vector were
each of its components are

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.260
multiplied by the scalar.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.990
ca1, ca2, all the way
down to c a n.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.540
And so after seeing these two
operations, you might be

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.950
tempted to say, gee, wouldn't
it be nice if there was some

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.440
way to multiply two vectors.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.280
This is just a scalar times a
vector, just scaling it up.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.990
And that's actually the actual
effect of what it's doing if

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.100
you visualize it in three
dimensions or less.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.260
It's actually scaling the
size of the vector.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.820
And we haven't defined size,
very precisely just yet.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.810
But you understand at least
this operation.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.440
For multiplying vectors or
taking the product, there's

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.450
actually two ways.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.620
And I'm going to define one
of them in this video.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.000
And that's the dot product.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.570
 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.750
And you signify the dot product
by saying a dot b.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.150
So they borrowed one of the
types of multiplication

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.680
notations that you saw, but you
can't write across here.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.390
That'll be actually a different
type of vector

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.650
multiplication.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.810
So the dot product is-- it's
almost fun to take because

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.475
it's mathematically pretty
straightforward, unlike the

00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:29.540
cross product.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.040
But it's fun to take and it's
interesting because it

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.860
results-- so this is a1, a2,
all the way down to a n.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.550
That vector dot my b vector: b1,
b2, all the way down to bn

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.330
is going to be equal to the
product of each of their

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.020
corresponding components.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:03.780
So a1 b1 added together plus a2
b2 plus a3 b3 plus all the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.750
way to a n, bn.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.370
So what is this?

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.640
Is this a vector?

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.740
Well no, this is
just a number.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.950
This is just going to
be a real number.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.580
You're just taking the product
and adding together a bunch of

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.160
real numbers.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.720
So this is just going to be
a scalar, a real scalar.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.440
So this is just going to be
a scalar right there.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.300
So in the dot product you
multiply two vectors and you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.890
end up with a scalar value.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.090
Let me show you a couple of
examples just in case this was

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.040
a little bit too abstract.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.590
So let's say that we take the
dot product of the vector 2, 5

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.740
and we're going to dot that
with the vector 7, 1.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.490
Well, this is just going to be
equal to 2 times 7 plus 5

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.640
times 1 or 14 plus 6.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.820
No, sorry.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.980
14 plus 5, which
is equal to 19.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.980
So the dot product of this
vector and this vector is 19.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.790
Let me do one more example,
although I think this is a

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.200
pretty straightforward idea.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.920
Let me do it in mauve.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.540
OK.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.500
Say I had the vector 1, 2, 3 and
I'm going to dot that with

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.000
the vector minus 2, 0, 5.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.120
So it's 1 times minus 2 plus
2 times 0 plus 3 times 5.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.620
So it's minus 2 plus
0 plus 15.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.020
Minus 2 plus 15 is
equal to 13.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.620
That's the dot product
by this definition.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.795
Now, I'm going to make
another definition.

00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:39.100
I'm going to define the
length of a vector.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.710
 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.050
And you might say, Sal,
I know what the length

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.730
of something is.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.520
I've been measuring things
since I was a kid.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.860
Why do I have to wait until a
college level or hopefully

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.300
you're taking this before
college maybe.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.830
But what is now considered a
college level course to have

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.280
length defined for me.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.110
And the answer is because we're
abstracting things to

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.270
well beyond just R3 or just
three-dimensional space is

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.990
what you're used to.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.540
We're abstracting that these
vectors could have 50

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.110
components.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.740
And our definition of length
will satisfy, will work, even

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.720
for these 50 component
vectors.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.240
And so my definition of length--
but it's also going

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.990
to be consistent with what
we know length to be.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.240
So if I take the length of a
and the notation we use is

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.610
just these double lines
around the vector.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.770
The length of my vector a is
equal to-- and this is a

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.290
definition.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.150
It equals the square root of
each of the terms, each of my

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.820
components, squared.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.020
Add it up.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.740
Plus a2 squared plus all the
way to plus a n squared.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.140
And this is pretty
straightforward.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:03.240
If I wanted to take let's
call this was vector b.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.310
If I want to take the magnitude
of vector b right

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.680
here, this would be what?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.350
This would be the square root
of 2 squared plus 5 squared,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.200
which is equal to the square
root of-- what is this?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.460
This is 4 plus 25.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.820
The square root of 29.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.180
So that's the length
of this vector.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.210
And you might say look,
I already knew that.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.010
That's from the Pythagorean
theroem.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.050
If I were to draw my vector
b-- let me draw it.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.800
Those are my axes.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.510
My vector b if I draw
it in standard

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.510
form, looks like this.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.570
I go to the right 2.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.580
1, 2.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.600
And I go up 5.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.650
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.660
So it looks like this.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.030
My vector b looks like that.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.090
And from the Pythagorean theorem
you know look, if I

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.650
wanted to figure out the length
of this vector in R2,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.390
or if I'm drawing it in kind
of two-dimensional space, I

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.330
take this side which is length
2, I take that side which is

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.380
length 5; this is going to be
the square root from the

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.650
Pythagorean theorem of 2
squared plus 5 squared.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.340
Which is exactly what
we did here.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.690
So this definition of length is
completely consistent with

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.310
your idea of measuring things
in one-, two- or

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.900
three-dimensional space.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.580
But what's neat about it is that
now we can start thinking

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.950
about the length of a vector
that maybe has 50 components.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.630
Which you know, really to
visualize it in our

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.580
traditional way,
makes no sense.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.920
But we can still apply this
notion of length and start to

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.010
maybe abstract beyond what
we traditionally

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.500
associate length with.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.230
Now, can we somehow relate
length with the dot product?

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.350
Well what happens if I
dot a with itself?

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.550
What is a dot a?

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.990
So that's equal to-- I'll
just write it out again.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:57.250
a1, all the way down to a n
dotted with a1 all the way

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.590
down to a n.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.290
Well that's equal to a1 times
a1, which is a1 squared.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.960
Plus a2 times a2.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.970
a2 squared.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.760
Plus all the way down, keep
doing that all the way down to

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.990
a n times a n, which
is a n squared.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.810
But what's this?

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.090
This is the same thing
as the thing you

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.220
see under the radical.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.080
These two things
are equivalent.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.540
So we could write our definition
of length, of

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.010
vector length, we can write it
in terms of the dot product,

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.650
of our dot product definition.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.929
It equals the square root of the
vector dotted with itself.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.820
Or, if we square both sides,
we could say that our new

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:45.240
length definition squared is
equal to the dot product of a

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.310
vector with itself.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.280
And this is a pretty neat--
it's almost trivial to

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.300
actually prove it, but this is
a pretty neat outcome and

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.850
we're going to use this
in future videos.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.720
So this is an introduction
to what the dot product

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.360
is, what length is.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.670
In the next video I'm going
to show a bunch of

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.500
properties of it.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.230
It will almost be mundane, but
I want to get all those

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.680
properties out of the
way, so we can use

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.040
them in future proofs.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.726
