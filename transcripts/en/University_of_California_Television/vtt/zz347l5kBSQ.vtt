- [Matthias] So, as Ed mentioned, I'm sort
of a biochemist by training and I've been

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.420
wondering for many years how it is
possible actually that ancient DNA is

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.860
preserved in fossils over tens of
thousands of years. I'm also wondering how

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.770
much further can we go in time. How will
it be in 5 or 50 years, perhaps, if I can

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.060
still see that if someone giving a talk
here what material are they going to talk

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.110
about. Is it a million years? In order to
address the question of how long DNA can

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.330
be preserved in bones, I think it's
worthwhile to look a bit into bone

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.710
structure. The bone consists of two major
components one is an organic component,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.290
collagen, it's a protein that gives some
level of elasticity to bones so that they

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.060
don't break easily; and there's another
very interesting component which makes up

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.640
up to 50% of the bone mass which is
hydroxyapatite. It's a form of calcium

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.440
phosphate that has a very interesting
biochemical property which is shown in

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.730
this experiment here. If you take a
mixture of DNA of different sizes, sort of

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.210
similar to what you might find in an
ancient bone, and you dissolve this DNA in

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.020
water and you add a suspension of pure
hydroxyapatite, DNA will instantly bind to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.990
the hydroxyapatite. Then, you can wash
that hydroxyapatite part off with water or

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.360
with all sorts of low salt buffers and you
will not release this DNA from

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.850
hydroxyapatite. It will only come down if
you give it a harsh chemical treatment

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.410
such as, using a decalcifier to break up
the hydroxyapatite structure or using a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.410
strong phosphate buffer. You can repeat
this experiment using ancient bone. This

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.920
is shown here. The DNA, pool of DNA
fragments, immediately binds to ancient

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.840
bone that is also known to contain
endogenous ancient DNA and that is of age

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.650
40 to 100,000 years. It only gets, comes
down, after intense treatment with

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.140
chemicals. That even works if you have
bones that are much older and bones that

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.790
are actually known, at least to current
level of resolution, not to carry any

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.830
ancient DNA like this one from a site in
Germany that's 600,000 years old, or this

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.150
bone of a dinosaur that's 18 million years
old. While this is sort of a very

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.390
interesting proof that you can recover DNA
from dinosaurs, it's not yet proof yet

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.730
that this can also be done for authentic
dinosaur DNA. But, an important take home

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.952
message here is that the bone structure
itself sort of provides a very good

00:04:37.952 --> 00:04:44.868
carrier for DNA and there's basically no
limit in the DNA binding capacity of bone

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:50.708
over time. So, what is it, then, that sort
of limits us in our ability to study

00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:58.486
ancient DNA through time? Obviously there
are also other processes taking place that

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:05.047
degrade DNA over time. There are a lot of
reactions: some hydrolytic, some oxidative

00:05:05.047 --> 00:05:10.929
reactions, and the most, the ones that are
thought to damage DNA most are those ones

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:17.613
with the red arrow here which is
hydrolysis of purine bases, or the letters

00:05:17.613 --> 00:05:21.909
As and Gs coming off the DNA and then over
time your DNA breaks down into shorter and

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:27.178
shorter molecules. You can model this, for
example here, assuming a strain break

00:05:27.178 --> 00:05:31.900
every 50 base pairs in your DNA then you
will see that you've very few long

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.308
molecules but a lot of very short
molecules. The more you damage your DNA,

00:05:36.308 --> 00:05:40.618
the more this distribution gets shifted to
the left end until all your DNA has

00:05:40.618 --> 00:05:47.400
disappeared or broken down into fragments
that are too short to make sense of. It's

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.140
important to know that these chemical
processes are temperature dependent. They

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.884
occur much slower at lower temperature
which is also why if you look for the

00:05:56.884 --> 00:06:02.760
world record of, sort of, ancient DNA
genome sequencing you have to go to the

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.240
permafrost. Two years ago, I think, there
was a very exciting paper published; an

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.970
almost full genome for a 700,000 years old
horse from permafrost. It gets more

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.170
complicated if you leave permafrost and if
your fossils are subject to these

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.058
temperature cycles that occur during the
Pleistocene. For the last, roughly,

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:29.869
100,000 years temperatures are mostly
colder than they are now then you enter

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:33.357
these interglacials where you have
elevated temperature and these are very

00:06:33.357 --> 00:06:38.885
detrimental to DNA preservation.
Nonetheless, sort of being limited to the

00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:43.567
last 100,000 years and temperate climate
zones is not too bad after all. There are

00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:50.436
some very interesting events taking place
in human evolution and one of them has

00:06:50.436 --> 00:06:54.308
been mentioned before by Sriram is the
human dispersal out of Africa which may

00:06:54.308 --> 00:07:01.484
have occurred, with the major wave, around
50,000 years ago. Humans when they left

00:07:01.484 --> 00:07:07.536
Africa, they were still Neandertals living
in Western and Central Eurasia. And we

00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:12.018
have generated genome sequences from
several Neandertals also ones of very high

00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:18.640
quality and we could make inferences from
these genome sequences that show that

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.262
Neandertals are, as expected also by
morphological evidence, a sister group to

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.562
modern humans. So, they're different
evolutionary lineage, but we could also

00:07:28.562 --> 00:07:34.596
see the analysis of these genomes, was
first time shown by Ed Green in 2010, that

00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:39.265
there was actually admixture going on.
There was some contribution of the

00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:44.286
Neandertal genome into modern humans and
we've seen more recently sort of a weak

00:07:44.286 --> 00:07:48.730
signal also for the other way around so
that some Neandertals may have picked up

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:54.904
modern human DNA when they interacted. So
the analysis of genomes from the last

00:07:54.904 --> 00:07:59.479
100,000 years has also brought us
Denisovans. They were discovered based on

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:05.074
just a few small fossils, a tiny finger
bone and a few teeth, that were found in

00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:10.187
Denisova cave. Based on the analysis of
their genome, we could show that they are

00:08:10.187 --> 00:08:16.574
indeed a sister group to Neandertals. They
are like the Eastern brothers or sisters

00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:21.659
of Neandertals and they have contributed
also their DNA to modern humans. But

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:29.057
unlike Neandertals, not to all humans
outside of Africa but to humans in Eastern

00:08:29.057 --> 00:08:36.173
Asia and mostly the highest proportion of
ancestry, of Denisovan ancestry, you'll

00:08:36.173 --> 00:08:40.339
find in Oceania here which makes us
believe that Denisovans were once much

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:45.911
more widespread than just located in
Denisova cave. Now, the problem is, still

00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:49.882
we are looking sort of at the tips of
these evolutionary branches. So we're

00:08:49.882 --> 00:08:54.195
looking at the last sort of Denisovans,
the last Neandertals, sort of relatively

00:08:54.195 --> 00:08:58.506
late modern humans and it would be
tremendously exciting to look further down

00:08:58.506 --> 00:09:04.104
in the past and try to understand sort of
what are the genomes like of these

00:09:04.104 --> 00:09:10.034
ancestors of the archaic ancestor. What
for me would be very exciting is to find

00:09:10.034 --> 00:09:16.923
the genome of the last ancestor between
humans and the archaics. As I mentioned

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:23.489
before, chemical reactions make DNA break
down in very short pieces. So, if you want

00:09:23.489 --> 00:09:27.767
to address that problem from a biochemical
perspective, what you have to do is you

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:31.656
have to go for this extremely short
fragments and hoping that you would find

00:09:31.656 --> 00:09:39.057
some surviving DNA in this size range. The
question then is where are we currently in

00:09:39.057 --> 00:09:43.989
doing this? And this is sort of a typical
fragment size distribution of DNA

00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:49.054
sequences that we recover from fossils
from a few years ago from the world record

00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:54.456
holder, the horse genome, the 700,000 year
old horse genome that was sequenced by a

00:09:54.456 --> 00:09:59.368
group in Copenhagen. As you can see, the
DNA sequences coming from this horse are

00:09:59.368 --> 00:10:07.860
indeed quite short, sort of centering on
about 70 base pairs. But even so, we

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.750
could, in principle, make use also of
sequences that are shorter than this, up

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.780
to maybe 30-35 base pairs. So, the
question is are these sequences lost in

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:24.900
sample preparation or is it that truly
there's no longer DNA preserved in these

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.650
bones? I, and several graduate students in
my group, have sort of intensely looked at

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.120
this over the past years and we've
basically gone through every step of the

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.310
sample preparation process in trying to
refine it so that we maximize the number

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.450
of molecules that we keep in each step and
that we also extract the shortest possible

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:48.370
DNA fragments. This starts, obviously,
with DNA extraction so it's a process of

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:53.280
isolating the DNA fragments from the bones
or teeth and purifying them so that they

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.090
can be used in downstream reactions.
There's a second very important process

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:04.060
involved in DNA sequencing these days
which is Library preparation. In this

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:09.110
process you attach short artificial pieces
of DNA to the ends of each DNA fragment

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:14.380
and these short adapters, so-called
adapters, can then be used to make

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.020
thousands of copies of each molecule and
then also to prime the sequencing reaction

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.380
and read the molecule out. As the last
step of this process, you're taking the

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.870
sequences coming out of the sequence and
trying to match them to a known reference

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.940
genome. In our case it's the Human
Reference genome which has been sequenced

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:38.940
to very high quality in 2001. Even this
process, actually, has some issues and

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.880
we're also working on optimizing the
bioinformatic algorithm that we use to

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.880
identify human-like sequences. Going
through all this in several cycles for

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.020
several years, we eventually sort of
determined a fragment size distribution in

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.530
ancient bones that looks more like this.
This is what I've shown you before. This

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:05.711
was the distribution of fragments from the
permafrost. This now is a typical fragment

00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:11.130
size distribution that we see in most
bones from caves and temperate climate

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:16.340
zones. What you see indeed are very very
short fragments in the bones. Many

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.490
fragments much shorter than we can
currently use for analysis because

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.640
sequences are so short you can't even
identify it as a human sequence anymore.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.570
But it's not that we're sort of losing
these long ones and gaining the short

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.420
molecules Indeed, it's a sort of extra
gain of short molecules. These small black

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.570
stripes are the fragment size distribution
that I've shown you before. Sort of this

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:44.120
gain of short molecules is on top of this.
From the methods perspective, we're all

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:49.620
ready to sequence older DNA than before,
but the problem, of course, still is you

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.040
also need a site that allows an
extraordinary level of DNA preservation.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.450
We were lucky enough to identify this site
in Northern Spain. The site is called the

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:04.860
Sima de los Huesos, the Pit of Bones. It
carries the remains of at least 28

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:11.920
virtually complete hominin skeletons that
were dated to 430,000 years ago. This is

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.450
the biggest assemblage of fossils from the
middle Pleistocene in Eurasia, the time

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:22.350
period preceding 130,000 years. The site
is very special in that it's 30 meters

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:29.854
below ground. It's very difficult to reach
it, it's only through a very hidden cave

00:13:29.854 --> 00:13:33.660
entrance and you have to sort of crawl in
there. So, there's very little air

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.210
exchange with outside and very stable
temperature in the cave, around 11

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:44.150
degrees. This basically makes it a perfect
fridge. We were indeed successful in

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:50.420
recovering DNA fragments from several
fossils from this site. In blue here, I'm

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:55.150
showing sort of the part of the size
distribution we find evidence for the

00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:00.710
presence of short, highly damaged, ancient
DNA molecules. The rest of this

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.760
distribution is mostly made up by
microbial sequences and modern human

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:11.640
contamination. The problem is there are
very few sequences only coming out. We had

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.620
to, in order to make some sense out of
them, we first had to look at one

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:21.330
particular type of DNA, a mammalian cell
which is mitochondrial DNA. This DNA is

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:26.280
special in that it's not present in only
two copies per cell, as the 23 chromosomes

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:32.550
that everyone knows about, but it's indeed
present in several copies in hundreds of

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:40.130
mitochondria. So for each part of the
nuclear genome, you have hundreds of

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:45.830
copies of the mitochondrial genome. Even
so, we still needed around two grams of

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:52.910
material, which is a lot with current day
standards. To just get one, sort of, nice

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.890
assembly of the mitochondrial genome. And
if you want to compare this to what we

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:02.130
typically get from late Pleistocene sites
from moderately preserved Neandertal

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:06.770
remains, there we get much more, many
more, copies of the mitochondrial genome

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:12.090
from much less material. In summary, it's
about 1,000 times less than what we've

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:18.400
seen in other Neandertal samples. Having
the mitochondrial genome, we could build a

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.850
tree from mitochondrial DNA. And the first
thing to note here is that if you look

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:29.330
just at the size of the branches, you will
see that all of these lineages here,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.900
modern humans, Neandertals, Denisovans,
they're relatively long and the Sima de

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.880
los Huesos sequences on a short branch
indicate an extraordinary age. While the

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.940
other individuals kept mutating, this
individual died few hundred thousand years

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:49.300
earlier and thus less mutations. Further
than this, the tree is actually very

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:54.060
confusing and this is because
mitochondrial DNA, even though it is

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.310
preferable for technical reasons, only
shows a very limited, gives very limited

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:03.020
information about the ancestry. It's only
inherited from mothers to their children

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:09.080
and it reflects only a small part of the
population history. So instead of looking

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.000
at mitochondrial DNA, it's much better to
look at nuclear DNA to determine how this

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.760
individual was related to Denisovans and
Neandertals. After screening more samples

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.116
from this site, we were eventually able to
recover as much as 1,000 of the genome of

00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:30.787
an individual from Sima de los Huesos.
There's extremely little data, but still

00:16:30.787 --> 00:16:36.143
it's enough to do a very simple analysis.
Having so few sequences, one thing you

00:16:36.143 --> 00:16:39.496
cannot do is actually compare these
sequences to a high quality reference

00:16:39.496 --> 00:16:44.465
genome and then ask where does it differ.
You see these red dots here which indicate

00:16:44.465 --> 00:16:49.569
sequencing errors because on average 1 in
100 base pairs is wrong. What you can do

00:16:49.569 --> 00:16:54.000
instead is use a trick and use the data,
the reference data set of high quality

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.970
genomes including the genomes of many
present day humans, but also the archaic

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:04.598
genomes that we have sequenced to high
quality and identify positions in the

00:17:04.598 --> 00:17:10.407
genome where, for example, the Neandertal
differs from all the other humans, where

00:17:10.407 --> 00:17:13.098
the Denisovans differ from the
Neandertals, humans, and the chimpanzee,

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:18.112
and so on. You can then just count
positions overlapping these sites how does

00:17:18.112 --> 00:17:24.422
the Sima do los Huesos sequence look like.
We did identify 100 sequences that overlap

00:17:24.422 --> 00:17:28.592
sites that are sort of diagnostic for
Neandertals; and 42 of them actually

00:17:28.592 --> 00:17:33.466
showed the Neandertal state. In contrast
to this we had a sort of roughly equal

00:17:33.466 --> 00:17:37.408
number of sequences matching a Denisovan
specific site but only 10 shared the

00:17:37.408 --> 00:17:43.667
Denisovan state. This is a highly
significant difference, and there's a very

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:48.567
simple inference from this is that indeed,
the Sima de los Huesos hominins were

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:53.914
closer to Neandertals than Denisovans
which also means, that Neandertals and

00:17:53.914 --> 00:18:00.999
Denisovans must have diverged by the time
these individuals lived. One sort of

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:05.663
important message from this is that it
gives us for the first time, a relatively

00:18:05.663 --> 00:18:10.476
stable anchor point in the timeline of
human evolution. Both the geological

00:18:10.476 --> 00:18:14.615
dating methods as well as sort of the
branch lengths of the mitochondrial DNA

00:18:14.615 --> 00:18:19.865
that we've looked at arrive at an age
estimate of about 400,000 years. So we can

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:23.990
say that the common ancestor of these two
archaic lineages must have lived before.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:30.380
There have been in the past a number of
attempts to infer the population split

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.642
times using the genomes of Neandertals and
Denisovans and depending on the parameters

00:18:35.642 --> 00:18:41.817
that you use you arrive at different ages.
If I use the most compatible estimates,

00:18:41.817 --> 00:18:46.082
the estimates that are most compatible
with this number, then indeed I would

00:18:46.082 --> 00:18:53.068
estimate that the human archaic diversion
is something like 550 to 7-800,000 years

00:18:53.068 --> 00:18:59.218
ago and probably even towards the higher
end of this. The good, or the bad news,

00:18:59.218 --> 00:19:02.835
is, as you will, that if you want to
sequence the common ancestor between

00:19:02.835 --> 00:19:06.620
humans and Neandertals, we have to go much
farther back in time. There's still

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.191
challenges waiting for us here and I'm
looking forward to hopefully being able to

00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:17.243
present this at some point. I want to
thank all my colleagues in Leipzig,

00:19:17.243 --> 00:19:21.666
especially Svante Pääbo who's sort of the
mastermind behind all the ancient DNA work

00:19:21.666 --> 00:19:27.518
in Leipzig; the Max Planck Society for the
very good funding that we have; and all

00:19:27.518 --> 00:19:33.462
the colleagues in my lab and the graduate
students as well as, importantly, our

00:19:33.462 --> 00:19:37.088
collaborators in Spain who've done
brilliant work in excavating these samples

00:19:37.088 --> 00:19:40.865
very cleanly, I must say. Thank you for
your attention.
