00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.680
There's some very
talented comedians that

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:16.015
are going to represent Detroit.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.550
Alton "Boogie"
Williams, Mike Geeter,

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:20.586
Jeff Horste, and J Bell.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.656
In Detroit, how long have you
guys have been doing comedy?

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.891
- 13 years.
- 13 years.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.092
This chose me.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.660
I didn't-- you know, I
found a way to, you know,

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:28.795
make money doing it.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:29.796
You know what I mean?

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.064
I was like, this
is actually an art.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.698
This is actually-- you
know, because I didn't know.

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:33.866
I just knew what funny was.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.269
I personally feel like
you can't teach funny.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.738
I feel like either you
have it or you don't.

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:39.872
Do you guys feel the same?

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:42.208
You can't force it,
and you can't fake it.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.609
Like, you can't
fake being funny.

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:44.343
[interposing voices]

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:45.144
Right here in Detroit.

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:46.846
That's not funny.
- Right.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:47.680
Thick skin.

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:48.481
You've got to have it.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:49.248
I can believe it.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.516
this crowd slaps people.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:51.851
I don't know if you heard
the history [inaudible]..

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.019
[inaudible] and stuff?
Yeah, man.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.387
We'll see you in
the parking lot, cuz!

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.555
Yeah.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.123
What about the comedy
scene here in Detroit?

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.257
I like a lot of
the independent.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.092
There's a lot of
independent shows

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.726
that have been going lately.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:03.262
Like, we had a recycling
center, an ice cream shop.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:06.466
So I feel like there's never
ending amount of stage time

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.900
around here.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.403
Especially if you're not judging
the room, then you can go up.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:11.537
The people love comedy here.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.305
Yes, they do.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:15.074
Are the comedians close?

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:16.809
Are you guys a tight-knit group?

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:18.344
You want people to succeed.

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:20.246
Because if they succeed,
that puts Detroit

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.581
even further on the map.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.850
Look, you're representing
Detroit comedy.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.017
So you go out there,
and you do it.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.785
You bring it.

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:26.686
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.453
100%, man.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:28.888
it's the D.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:29.822
Was there ever a moment where
you guys were like, you know,

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.791
this ain't-- this ain't it.

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:32.592
No.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.459
Mm-mm.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:34.293
This is-- this is all I have.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:35.528
This is like, I ain't got--

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.763
I don't have no plan
B [inaudible] You

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.031
know them eggs in that basket?

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:41.267
They all in that
basket, brother.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.069
If that basket break,
I'm going to be out there

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.137
washing cars or something.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.971
Man, this is it.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:45.738
This is it.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:46.839
This is it.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.174
What I really
like and respect,

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:51.711
I mean, the love that you
obviously have for your city.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:52.945
Oh, absolutely.

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:53.846
There's a sense of
urgency for you guys

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.582
to bring attention to Detroit.

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:59.085
You want to bring that light,
and you want it to shine.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.387
And so I think you
should seize the moment.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.722
Make the best of it, all right?
- Absolutely.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:03.755
Do it.
