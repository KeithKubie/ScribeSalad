WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.330
Okay.
I need two volunteers here at the beginning.

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.390
While we're waiting for everybody else to come in.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.950
You have to come up here and do something

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.903
<v 1>one up.</v>

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.383
Okay.

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.020
<v 0>So each of you actually,
I don't want to people that are sitting together.</v>

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.700
So Lucas,
you enjoy your stay,
but yeah.
Rick,

8
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:32.810
why don't you come up here?
Come here.
Come here.

9
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.640
So your job is to grind.
This is a spice.
So you grind it up good.

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.520
And then we're going to take it back and show it to the people around.

11
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:43.520
You are going to smell it.
Okay?
See if you can,

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.830
you have to really grind it like this.
Look.

13
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.610
<v 0>So we got two spices here that we need to identify.</v>

15
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.531
Okay?

16
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.380
You can go back and grind them at your seat and then show it to your neighbors

17
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.290
later on.
I'm going to ask you whether you know what it is.

18
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.690
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

19
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.040
<v 0>Okay.
So here's how we're going through the history of organic chemistry and the</v>

20
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:25.720
development of the molecular model.
So generation by generation.

21
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:29.620
And last time we got up to the students of Calculi,
uh,

22
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.710
who actually did experiments to allow people to figure out something about

23
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:35.884
structure,

24
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.330
not only what was connected to what that's constitution,

25
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.770
remember the nature and the sequence of bonds.
So we had composition,

26
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.090
what elements are there,
what ratio they're in,
how many atoms,
right?

27
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.750
Then constitution,
the nature of sequence and bonds.

28
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.220
And now we're going to see if you can go beyond that without cheating and using

29
00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:01.660
ex-ray diffraction to figure out how things are arranged in space.

30
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.640
So structure and we talked last time about coroners proof,
uh,

31
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.900
positions in benzene and his proof that all the positions in benzine were

32
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.220
equivalent to one another.

33
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.670
And today we're going to go really to the next generation.

34
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.400
Kerner wasn't all that much younger than he was,

35
00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:20.470
at least halfway in the generation there.

36
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.420
But van Hoff is a full generation beyond.
So we've got to look at him.

37
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.520
It says under him tetrahedron,
and it says down here tetrahedral carbon.

38
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.860
And also,
uh,
we'll see,
uh,

39
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.770
something about Albert Loddon Borg and about your,

40
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:42.490
uh,
whatever.
Great,
great chemical grandfather,

41
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.690
Peter Kohler at uh,
Harvard.

42
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.080
Okay.
So as we were closing last time,

43
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:54.640
we were looking at this definite picture of the arrangement of atoms in space

44
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.970
where the models are clearly real models held together by rubber and their

45
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.000
tetrahedral.

46
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.120
And it explains why there can be three isomers of dye substituted a symmetrical,

47
00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:09.610
he die,
substituted,
um,
ethane.

48
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.330
Of course it was wrong.
Do you know why it was wrong?

49
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.510
Why they're not three different bottles?
Yeah,

50
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.650
because you can rotate about the middle bond freely.

51
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:24.280
It's not frozen in one rotation here or is it?

52
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.080
We'll see something about that later on that turns out to be what's called con

53
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:31.540
formation.
Remember,
that's the one of the C's,

54
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.220
but now we're in configuration how things are attached to the tetrahedron.

55
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.751
Okay.

56
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:42.751
So after Paterno had published that he got a letter from his former sponsor who

57
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:47.550
had moved on adult Lieben,
uh,
Austrian,

58
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.700
who was at this time in Italy,
first in,
uh,

59
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.560
first in Palermo.
And then at this time I think he was,

60
00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:00.010
he was in northern Italy,
I think in Pisa.

61
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.260
Oh Torino,
it says up at the top,
Torino 25th to June,

62
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.140
1869 and you can see a translation there if you click.
But anyhow,

63
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:11.080
it says permit me deer,
my deer and Manuel,

64
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:14.320
I they corresponded like several of these people who are great friends where for

65
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.600
a very long time,
uh,

66
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.580
permit me to make an observation regarding the isomerism pointed out by you.

67
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.050
And by Cannizzaro it's a little bit of a misleading to say by Cannizzaro.

68
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:29.470
He was very cautious about this as you know,

69
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:34.390
but he introduced the paper between and he shows those two structures here which

70
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.660
looked like type structures with those brackets.

71
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.720
And you can see what's fastened on the two carbons is h two HDCL and HCL hcl.

72
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.180
But he wrote the CLS differently obviously meaning to denote this difference in

73
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:54.040
phase of rotation.
Certainly it's not absurd.

74
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:59.041
This kind of a isomerism even without any differences among the four valence as

75
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:00.881
of carbon.

76
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:04.360
Remember one could have been straight one crooked and short and long or

77
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:06.850
something like that.
Uh,

78
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.400
I believe however,

79
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:14.401
that I don't earlier when I suppose that the same cause which keeps me from

80
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:19.741
accepting it will also keep all the other chemists from doing so in a silent

81
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.030
agreement with one another.

82
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.590
You perhaps haven't thought that in this kind of,

83
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.850
I saw Marisela crosses the Rubicon which separates speculation.

84
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:37.351
That's considered legitimate about the mode of combination of Adams from

85
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:38.770
speculation,

86
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:43.090
which is less legitimate about the position of the atoms in space.

87
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.360
And notice here that he added as an afterthought Vedo the true position to the

88
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:53.200
atoms in space rather than just chemical position.
Right.

89
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.220
In all speculations that had been made up to this time,

90
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.260
people have always been careful never to let enter in either the relative

91
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:08.120
positions in space,
distances and and surroundings of the Adams.

92
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.540
This idea doesn't even enter into the speculations of Calculi about isomerism in

93
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:15.740
the aromatic series,

94
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.130
so he draws the picture of the hexagon and numbers one to six.

95
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:22.120
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

96
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.100
<v 0>calculate believes that chlorine one chlorine to positions is different from</v>

97
00:06:27.101 --> 00:06:31.300
chlorine one three and from one four because in the first case,

98
00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:35.320
the two carbon chlorine is find themselves combined with one another.

99
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.490
But in the second case they're separated by ch and then the third case they're

100
00:06:39.491 --> 00:06:44.491
separated by two [inaudible] and two except this one has no need to make

101
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:47.740
hypotheses about the surroundings of the atoms.

102
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.740
That's really weird,
isn't it?

103
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.040
He says in one case they're connected to one another.
Another case,

104
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:57.940
there's a ch in between and in another case there are two ch is in between,

105
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.170
but to talk about this,

106
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:01.720
you don't have to talk about the surroundings of the atoms.

107
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.180
That doesn't make sense to us,
right?

108
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.640
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

109
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.980
<v 0>but it's the difference between drawing a graph,</v>

110
00:07:07.981 --> 00:07:11.610
which is just a graph and drawing something that's supposed to show something in

111
00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:15.660
space.
He goes on and says,
uh,

112
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.500
it could be that the two chlorine and positions one,

113
00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:24.300
two are in truth more distant from one another than the ones in positions one

114
00:07:24.301 --> 00:07:26.850
for,
and he draws an exclamation point there.

115
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.433
<v 1>All right.</v>

116
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.170
<v 0>This just doesn't let her,</v>

117
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.180
it calculates hypothesis making hypotheses about the relative positions of the

118
00:07:37.111 --> 00:07:42.111
atoms in space would make possible two isomers of dye chloro methane,

119
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.790
even accepting the symmetry of the four valence is that is that all the valence

120
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:52.830
is of a single carbon are equal equal to one another and the existence of a

121
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:57.630
single isomer of methyl chloride for example.
And he draws the two structures.

122
00:07:57.631 --> 00:08:00.660
Here are the ones where the fluorines are far from one another and when they're

123
00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:03.540
near one another,
but that's just the graph,
right?

124
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.840
That's not where they are in space.
Okay.

125
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.720
There would all he added as an afterthought between the lines here.

126
00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:13.800
There would also result two isomers of ethyl chloride.

127
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.653
<v 1>All right,</v>

128
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.910
<v 0>I repeat that.
I don't consider this,</v>

129
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.720
this kind of isomerism absurd,

130
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.380
but since we have no means to know the topographic position to the Adams,

131
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.020
while we have many to know how they are connected to one another,

132
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.470
I consider it a bit dangerous for science shooting off into space in search of

133
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:43.820
Adam's one risks losing the ground under his feet,

134
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.500
right?
So be careful.

135
00:08:46.501 --> 00:08:50.760
Former student greetings to Cannizzaro and Kerner Amato.

136
00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:53.850
I'll write soon to come piza your friend out awfully but

137
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.930
okay,
so be careful.
This isn't what structures are about right there.

138
00:08:59.931 --> 00:09:04.260
Just graphs that show constitution.
So here's coronary.

139
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:08.180
You remember before you went south and get with Calculi and on the right of this

140
00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:12.140
group is Albert Loddon Borg who once you know,

141
00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:13.580
once you've read what he wrote,

142
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.640
you can sort of read into his attitude there that he was a hard guy to deal

143
00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:21.140
with.
Okay.

144
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.190
He thought he knew a lot and he didn't know a lot but not as much as he thought.

145
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.270
So he published this paper the next year in 1869 or the same year that that

146
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:36.590
Paterno published his thing calculate adopts two hypotheses.

147
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.630
One the six hydrogen atoms of benzene or equivalent.
That's what,

148
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.800
uh,

149
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.800
what current or actually proved and to each hydrogen atom of benzene has two

150
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:53.180
sets of two others which are symmetrically arranged with respect to it.

151
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.230
That is one.
Two is one is the same as one.

152
00:09:57.231 --> 00:10:00.530
Six and one three is the same as one.

153
00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:04.850
Five although for is unique with respect to one.
Okay.

154
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.170
So there are two that are symmetrically arranged already.

155
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:14.171
Several years ago I had occasion to make calculate aware that is graphical

156
00:10:14.271 --> 00:10:19.190
formula for benzene is not adequate.
Right.
Since here one,
two,
one,

157
00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:21.020
one six must be in equivalent.

158
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.760
While one could have various views about whether positions three and five are

159
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:26.720
equivalent or not,

160
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.900
why would one and to be certainly in equivalent to two and six that is be

161
00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:36.200
certainly an equivalent but three and five might or might not.

162
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.160
Kate [inaudible]

164
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.480
<v 0>both have a single and a double.
But what about,</v>

165
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.410
what about one three and one five are they a hundred percent equivalent?

166
00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.150
<v 1>It's a double lines or anything.</v>

167
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:00.940
<v 0>Uh Huh.</v>

168
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.360
Cause one is single double and the other is double single going the other way.

169
00:11:04.361 --> 00:11:06.160
So that might or might not be equivalent.

170
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:11.170
A lot in Borg says both conditions could however be fulfilled through

171
00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:15.940
alternative formulas which so far as I know have not been proposed before.

172
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:21.390
So here are Loddon Borg's formulas and the one in the middle,

173
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.900
the triangular prism actually came to be called a hundred years later,

174
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:31.060
or little 70 years later.
Uh,
Loddon Borg,
benzene,
right?

175
00:11:31.061 --> 00:11:33.070
Because someone was able to synthesize that.

176
00:11:33.071 --> 00:11:37.420
It's also called prisma main cause it looks like a prison,
right?

177
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:42.460
And then there's this funny structure on the right.
Okay.

178
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:47.140
So this is 1872 and we're going to,

179
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.920
there's van Hoff who is an 18 year old student,

180
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.370
come to bond

181
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.690
<v 2>to see the great calculi.</v>

182
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.130
And he writes in 1876 at the age of 24,

183
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.300
uh,
reply to Loddon Borg,

184
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.960
proof that the prism formula of Lawton Borg suffers from the same problem as the

185
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:13.540
hexagon with fixed double bonds.

186
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:18.340
Removes the previously asserted superiority from the former,

187
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:23.110
from the prison,
and makes the original calculate notation dot only simpler.

188
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.440
But also the presentation with which the facts conform best cause calculate had

189
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:33.751
the idea that what these lines really meant was how often the bonds collide,

190
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.680
how often the Adams collide with one another.
They collide more often.

191
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:41.260
He thought when it's a double bond than when it's a single bond.

192
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.850
So we thought that in this case,

193
00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:44.950
although you would draw a single double single double,

194
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:48.250
that the number of collisions actually was the same one way or the other.

195
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.280
So you'd draw both formulas to be in between what we would call now residents

196
00:12:53.281 --> 00:12:56.440
formulas.
So anyhow,
this young student,

197
00:12:56.441 --> 00:13:00.790
24 years old now says Loddon borgs off base in saying the prison is better

198
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.250
because it has the same problem and does,

199
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:07.780
you can't get out of it with his vibration thing.
Okay.

200
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:12.760
The one,
two,
five,
six,
and three four derivatives are completely similar,

201
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.130
although differing from four or five,
two,
three,
six,
one.
So one,
two,

202
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.380
five,
six and three four are completely similar.
So here's one,

203
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:26.890
two,
three,
six,
one,
five,

204
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.750
six and three four.
Right?

205
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.200
And you can see that just by rotating by a 120 degrees,

206
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:35.860
you go from one to the next.
So those who says are completely similar,

207
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.900
although differing from four or five,
two,
three,
six,
one.

208
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.990
Do you see how they differ?
Four or five.
Two,
three,

209
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:49.170
six.
One,
four,
five,
two,
three,
six,
one.

210
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.140
Now are the red and the blue different or not?

211
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.360
The reds are obviously just rotate.
You get from one to the next.

212
00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.310
How about from a red to a blue?

213
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.020
Can you rotate to get from one to the other?

214
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.380
From a red to a blue?
Say the ones in front?

215
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.400
<v 2>What happens if you rotate to put a red line on a blue line?</v>

217
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.990
<v 1>So him sitting on a square face,</v>

218
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.400
<v 2>ah.
Then it's sitting on a square face instead of a triangular face.</v>

219
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:30.160
It's not the same anymore.
Everybody see that?
Right?
This,

220
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:34.750
this as drawn.
It has a triangle on top.
If you turn it 180 degrees,

221
00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:38.830
so as the impo super impose the blue in front on the red,

222
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.360
then you no longer have a triangle on top.
It's not the same thing.

223
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.250
Van Hoff 24 years old says,

224
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.680
what do you think Loddon Borg would say about that?

225
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.720
<v 0>Well,
we'll see,
but then talk goes on.</v>

226
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.750
He says a one three product is different according to whether a or B occupies

227
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:07.550
position.
One in the right,
there's single double,
double single.

228
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:12.290
When you go from a to B.
Okay.
Exactly.

229
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:17.291
The same thing happens in Lauden borgs formula with the prison and adequate

230
00:15:18.141 --> 00:15:22.760
consideration shows that one and two are absolutely different.

231
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.910
So one and notice he puts dashed lines in y.

232
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.740
<v 2>Why is one bond shown dashed says so,
right?</v>

233
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.650
Because it's behind.
It's hidden.

234
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.010
So he's definitely showing this in three dimensions.

235
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.580
And if it's in three dimensions,
then a B goes left

236
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.340
<v 0>to write in one and right to left and the other and you can't superimpose them.</v>

237
00:15:47.341 --> 00:15:50.430
They're not the same thing according to van off.

238
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.380
Now what would Loddon Borg say about this?
He wouldn't take it lying down.

239
00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.080
He wrote back and said,
Vance Hall found,
finds the two formulas below.

240
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.850
Absolutely different.

241
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.780
How is what he wrote different from what Van Hoff wrote?

242
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.000
How are Loddon borgs formula's different from Vat offs.

243
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.330
<v 2>It's got a three d.
Pardon me?
It's not,
what is it in three d?</v>

244
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.230
How do you know whether it's in three D or not?
It doesn't use dashboard.
Ah,

245
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.090
he doesn't use the dash line.
Okay,

246
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.770
so he says they're absolutely that bad off fines.
That my absolutely different,

247
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.820
but he's just drawing constitution.
What's linked to what?

248
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.293
<v 1>Right.</v>

249
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.840
<v 0>I cannot agree with him in this van took off is dragging something into the</v>

250
00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:52.941
formulas which I together with most chemists expressly exclude.

251
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.810
I refer to the arrangement in space.
Right,

252
00:16:57.811 --> 00:17:01.170
so keep that out.
Okay.

253
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.200
The formula takes account of the composition,

254
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:08.340
molecular weight and mode of union of the Adams,

255
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.440
so composition and what else,

256
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:16.120
<v 2>what others see
constitute composition,</v>

257
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:21.160
that composition of molecular weight,
he says,
and the mode of union,

258
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.170
right,
which is constitution.
It doesn't talk about arrangement in space.

259
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.593
All right.

260
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:28.640
<v 0>Tops,</v>

261
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.480
view of space really will not tolerate the two formulas above to be identical.

262
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.750
Then I invite him for his own special purposes to use a different benzene

263
00:17:38.911 --> 00:17:39.391
formula,

264
00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:44.391
which was proposed by me in the year 1,869 when I compared the hexagon and the

265
00:17:44.671 --> 00:17:49.671
prison for the first time together with the prism to which it for me,

266
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:54.510
certainly identical.
It is a so called cross of David.

267
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

268
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.440
<v 0>Even van Hoff.</v>

269
00:17:57.441 --> 00:18:01.940
We'll have to find that these two formulas are absolutely identical.

270
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.460
Okay.
Now,
how could the prism be identical?
To this.

271
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.040
There's the prison.
They certainly don't look identical,
but watch this.

272
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.520
Let's twist it,
keep all the bonds,
but twist it.

273
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.780
<v 1>All right?</v>

274
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.590
<v 0>So as long as you don't have dashed lines for three D,</v>

275
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.000
they're the same.
One is just twisted.

276
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.720
Okay,
so Lundberg is expressly keeping this out.
Now,

277
00:18:34.721 --> 00:18:37.720
this point of view survived for quite a while here.

278
00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:42.220
Here's some notes taken by a former Yale colleague,
RM Fou us,

279
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.330
uh,

280
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.890
at night in the 1920s when he was a student at Harvard in Kohler's course,

281
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:53.610
his notes say benzene gives one mono substitution product and three dice

282
00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:58.761
substituted cyclohexyl trying if you had the ring with double single,

283
00:18:59.021 --> 00:19:03.670
double single apparently requires four die substitution products.

284
00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.630
So,
uh,
one,
two and one six would be different.

285
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.460
It was argued,

286
00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.620
but then he shows another example of a experiment that's been done here with

287
00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:18.340
this molecule.
Now these hydrogens could be it.

288
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.950
It turns out that,
uh,

289
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.760
that those hydrogens will call later Alpha hydrogens because they're the first,

290
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.540
next to a carbonyl group.
So here's a carbon oxygen double bond.

291
00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:34.960
And then to see that has the h carbon oxygen double bond to see that has the h,

292
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.760
those are called Alpha.
And it was known that it's possible to eat,

293
00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:44.290
to easily substitute Alpha carbons with other things more easily than other

294
00:19:44.291 --> 00:19:46.390
carbons,
typically other hydrogens.

295
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.400
So you'd expect to get two possible structures.
You could,

296
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:54.310
you could do this Alpha one and get the are in that position or this one and get

297
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.060
are in that position.
So you'd get two products,
right?

298
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.513
Those two

299
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:07.080
we can alkylate that is put the r group on gluconic acid in several ways,

300
00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.330
but we always get the same product.
One,

301
00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.260
two cannot be made no matter how we go.

302
00:20:14.261 --> 00:20:19.261
Hence it is not surprising that only one Ortho die substituted product for

303
00:20:19.421 --> 00:20:20.650
benzene exists.

304
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.270
The double bonds shift until the stable system is reached,

305
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.440
right?

306
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.950
So you can't make one or if you make it in immediately transforms to the other

307
00:20:29.951 --> 00:20:34.090
ones.
So there could be too,
but there aren't.
Okay.
So this is,

308
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.560
this is what,
this is a 40 years later,
almost half a century later,

309
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.030
and he's still saying the same thing.
Okay.

310
00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.030
Now,
uh,
is it really that,
well,

311
00:20:46.031 --> 00:20:50.530
you can calculate by that the minimum energy really is symmetrical with equal

312
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.490
bond distances,
but it vibrates.
It can vibrate like this,

313
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.450
right?
Yeah.
In and out.

314
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.940
And that the frequency of that is 1276 wave numbers.
You've taken spectra,

315
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.200
you've seen that kind of thing.

316
00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:07.650
Although this particular one is not active in the infrared,

317
00:21:07.651 --> 00:21:12.330
you can't see it in the air.
It's called breathing.
Right.

318
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.910
Okay.
But there's another way it can vibrate like this distorted that direction.

319
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.300
Then back to symmetrical and in the other direction,
see what that is.

320
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.670
That's distorting in the calculate direction.
Single double,
single double,
right.

321
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.590
So that,
that one is at 1367 wave numbers.

322
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.090
The calculate distortion,
but it's around a single minimum.

323
00:21:39.091 --> 00:21:43.890
So at any given time,
the thing is probably vibrating.
So it is single,

324
00:21:43.891 --> 00:21:47.670
double single double,
but the lowest energy is all the same.

325
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.990
Intermediate distance.

326
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:51.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

327
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.273
<v 0>Okay.
Now,</v>

328
00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.280
might you be able to push on benzene and make it favor the calculi structure

329
00:21:59.091 --> 00:22:03.310
with alternating bond distance as well?
That's a challenge.
So,
uh,

330
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.120
uh,
a chemist named Jay Segal,
uh,

331
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.670
and his colleagues synthesize this one,

332
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:16.030
which you'll notice has a four membered ring with funny bond angles attached to

333
00:22:16.881 --> 00:22:18.680
one side of the benzene.

334
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.640
That means those angles are going to be stretched and so on.

335
00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:25.280
So they're going to distort and make that bond different.

336
00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.060
And indeed that bond one six is a little different.

337
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.840
But on the other side of there,
if it made that one,

338
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.550
let's say it's a little bit long,

339
00:22:34.551 --> 00:22:38.060
make it single in the neighbor's double because of the way it's being stretched,

340
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:43.070
then if that propagated around the ring,
single,
double,
single,
double single,

341
00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:46.100
double the ones on the left would be different lengths,

342
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.690
but in fact they're the same,
right?
So it does,

343
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.130
it doesn't happen here.

344
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:56.960
So that's the kind of thing that people sometimes do to test out the limits of

345
00:22:56.961 --> 00:23:01.010
these kinds of theories.
Okay.
So we've seen,
uh,

346
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:06.110
the position determination and now more about tetrahedral carbon.

347
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.330
And to get there,
we're going to step back just a bit to look at Louie Pastor,

348
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.370
who was a different,
in a different line of business at this time.

349
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.490
Now it's hard to prove that two samples are identical because there could always

350
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:26.250
be some other tests in which they are.

351
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.320
They appear to be different even though everything you've done so far shows them

352
00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:33.700
the same.
But let's take Carbone as an example.

353
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:38.110
Here's a,
here's a sample of Carbone,
a bottle of Carbone.

354
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:43.410
And if I crack it a little bit,
I can smell it.
It has a very nice smell.
Yeah,

355
00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.710
let's pass it around here.

356
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.960
<v 2>Don't spill it.
Obviously
you recognize the odor.</v>

357
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.330
Actually I have another bottle too.

358
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.970
Yeah.
Let's start this one over here.
I'll start it with Catherine.

359
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:06.060
So just smell that one.
Don't put your nose right down in it.
It's not,
but it's,

360
00:24:06.061 --> 00:24:08.610
it's not that strong.
It's very pleasant.
Actually.

361
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.170
Now this stuff is called Carbone.
Uh,

362
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.780
there's a reason it's called Carbone.
Uh,
how are you doing Rick?

363
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.990
You're with your grinding.
Can you smell anything on it?

364
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:24.900
What does it smell like?

365
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:30.750
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

366
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.950
<v 2>a little like sesame seeds,
but there's another pass it pass it to shy.</v>

367
00:24:36.951 --> 00:24:38.210
Next to you.
Here.
Let him smell

368
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.380
<v 1>so familiar.</v>

369
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.560
<v 2>How about anybody?
How about the bottle here coming?
Do you notice it?</v>

370
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.330
Is that a familiar set?
It's spearmint.

371
00:24:52.331 --> 00:24:55.900
Not peppermint,
but your close tie.
How are you doing?

372
00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:57.280
Does it smell like peppermint to you?

373
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.480
<v 1>Like men.</v>

374
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:09.930
<v 2>Okay.
Uh,
how are you doing?
You enjoy,
you're grinding up a different stuff.
You're,</v>

375
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.910
you're grinding dill seed in fact.

376
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.180
Does it smell?

377
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.220
<v 1>Yes it does.
They said at his seat.</v>

378
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.390
<v 2>What does it smell like?
Bill seed maybe.
Right,</v>

379
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:26.580
but co but Carbone comes from that.

380
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.700
This is a familiar scent.
I'm surprised you didn't get it shy.

381
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.170
And did anybody else recognize?
Did you get it Andrew?

382
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.880
No.
How about the bottle that's coming along the back row there?

383
00:25:38.881 --> 00:25:43.560
That little bottle?
Yeah.
Notice it rolling.
It's Rye.

384
00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.750
Rye Bread has that.
It's caraway.

385
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.960
Those seeds are caraway and caraway is carve is the Latin root for it.

386
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.870
It's like caraway,
right?
So Carbone the substance we're passing around.

387
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.670
Carbone caraway.
Okay.
Now,
so let's look at the,

388
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.790
I suppose we talked these two bottles and you distilled and found the boiling

389
00:26:05.791 --> 00:26:10.360
point.
Both bottles have two 30 to two 31,
right?

390
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.830
The densities are exactly the same.

391
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.890
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

392
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.080
<v 2>The refractive indices for those two bottles,</v>

393
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:20.930
how much they bend light when it goes through exactly the same.

394
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.570
The infrared spectrum are identical to the extent that any I IRS specter of

395
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:27.111
identical,

396
00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:31.010
you know from experiment that if you put up more than one sample than in
another,

397
00:26:31.011 --> 00:26:35.570
they don't look the same.
Right.
Did you notice that in lab if something,

398
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:37.550
if you ground up more stuff in less stuff,

399
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.470
the spectra don't really look the same,

400
00:26:39.471 --> 00:26:42.140
but then you can find there is a peak to peak correspondence.

401
00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:44.760
The intensities are never going to be exactly the same,

402
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.570
but to the extent IRR spectrum could be the same.
These are the same.

403
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.480
If you take their Nmr Spectra,
they're the same.

404
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.680
So they must be the same or is there any property in which they differ?

405
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.630
Any property that those two bottles differ in?

406
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:06.360
The smell is different.
Now those bottles,

407
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:10.500
if they're in dark bottles,
right,
to protect them from light.

408
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.320
But if I poured them out there,
they should be coalesced liquids.

409
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:15.960
But I bet anything they're Brown,
right?

410
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:18.360
Because they've sat around in a little bit is oxidized.

411
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.210
So it's very difficult with,

412
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.730
with scent because little bits of other things could make them smell a little

413
00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:27.300
different.
Right?
You don't need much stuff for scent of the proper thing.

414
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.610
So it's hard to be confident that this difference that one of them is,

415
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.570
is Rye bread,
caraway,
and the other is spearmint.

416
00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:38.670
It's hard to be sure that that's a difference,

417
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.230
but it turns out there's another property you could measure too.
And that,

418
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:48.231
and Carol Sierra has that property and I'm going to show it to you.

419
00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:52.650
It's the ability to rotate polarized light.
Now let,
oh,

420
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.990
did I bring,
oh,
I forgot to bring my Polaroids.
Uh,

421
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.920
so what I'm going to do is ask a ta to go back to my office and on the table in

422
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:06.450
my office there,

423
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:10.410
there's a brown package about that big that has two sheets of Polaroid in it.

424
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.320
There's the key.

425
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

426
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.130
<v 2>Yeah,
it's not here.
Sorry.
Uh,
let me think a second.</v>

427
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.810
What we can go on to.
Uh,
there's,

428
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.080
I'll tell you the,
the measure of this,

429
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.480
which is you have light that's polarized.

430
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.810
Have you all dealt with polarized lights?
Probably have polarized sunglasses,

431
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:40.770
you know,
and you can turn it and see different light reflecting off things.

432
00:28:40.771 --> 00:28:42.610
So have you done that?
Okay.

433
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.630
That's why you have polarized sunglasses cause life that reflects,

434
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:48.870
doesn't go through the particular direction that's in the sunglasses.

435
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:53.510
So you get rid of reflected light.
Okay?
So,
uh,

436
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.600
but what you measure is when light,
when light goes through a Polaroid filter,

437
00:28:57.601 --> 00:28:58.560
it's as if it were,

438
00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:01.230
you were shaking a rope and it was going through a picket fence.

439
00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:03.990
It can vibrate one way,
but it can't vibrate the other way.

440
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.370
What vibrates in light?

441
00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:06.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

442
00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.080
<v 2>What is vibrating?</v>

443
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:09.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.170
<v 2>What's light?
We went through this before.</v>

445
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.500
Electromagnetic radiation.
What's vibrating?

446
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.730
The electric field and it set up.
So one of these,

447
00:29:19.731 --> 00:29:23.930
if you have a Polaroid filter gets absorbed and the other one comes through.

448
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.420
Okay,
so light that comes through as vibrating this way.

449
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.140
And if you put another one that's crossed with it like this,

450
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.010
what do you get at the 40?
You see nothing.

451
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.070
Because the first one stops one,
the second one stops,
the other one.

452
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.530
If you turn it like this,
then it goes on through,
okay?

453
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:46.860
But suppose that you put something in the middle that rotated the plane of

454
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:50.380
polarization.
So,
so the lights vibrating like this.

455
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.050
Suppose it's going like this,
right?

456
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.840
Suppose by the time it gets to the second filter,
it's like this,

457
00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.190
right now you have the second one like this.
What?
What do you see?

458
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.930
Light comes right on through because that's the way it's vibrating.
Now,

459
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.590
if you rotate it,
the plane of polarization,
okay?

460
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.700
That's what rotation means.
Okay?
Now,

461
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.880
uh,
uh,

462
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:21.950
you measure this property of a substance and call it specific rotation,

463
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.540
which is how many degrees it's rotate.

464
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:31.070
And you have to say what light rotates so that the units of Alpha,

465
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:36.150
our degrees,
how many degrees it changes per,

466
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.610
uh,
PR for per gram,

467
00:30:40.611 --> 00:30:44.480
per millimeter milliliter.
If you put more stuff in,

468
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.120
then you get a bigger effect,
right?
So it depends on the concentration.

469
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.170
So how many degrees per mole you might say.
Okay,

470
00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:58.760
but then it's per decimeter for cause the longer path you'll go.

471
00:30:58.761 --> 00:31:02.180
If it's rotating,
the further you go,
the further it twists.

472
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.070
So the old style cells were uh oh,

473
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:12.010
that's not it.
A nice try.
Um,

474
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.170
this is,
this is really embarrassing.
It's an envelope.
Okay.

475
00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.650
Did you see it?
Okay,
good.

476
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:28.090
Uh,
okay,
look,
let me show you the other thing.

477
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.780
Is that going to show you,
okay,
here you actually,
here's,
we'll do,

478
00:31:30.781 --> 00:31:35.400
we'll do a trick.
Here are models of Carbone.

479
00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.500
Okay,
now I'm going to give him to you guys

480
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.390
and I want you to compare and see if they're the same.

481
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:47.800
Stand up and let people see what,
so decide.
Hey,

482
00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.600
start maybe at the top with a methyl group.
No,
you,

483
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.010
each of you turn both of you turn and face the thing so they can see.

484
00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:00.270
Now hold us.
Start with a methyl group at top.
It starts with a methyl group.
Now,

485
00:32:00.271 --> 00:32:04.110
Russell,
you describe that and John and uh,
and uh,

486
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:07.740
and then check and see whether Eric,

487
00:32:07.741 --> 00:32:12.450
you check and see whether your model is the same as,
as a,
as Russell's.

488
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:15.890
Okay.
Well,
while you're doing that,
I'll go help find the,

489
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:20.100
the thing.
So tell me when I get back.

490
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:28.950
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

491
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.530
let me at this point.

492
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.900
[inaudible] [inaudible] it's like

493
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.240
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

494
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.040
<v 2>so is that real?</v>

495
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.320
Is that just a peculiarity of the models or does that relate to molecules?

496
00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:01.980
Okay,
well have a,
if I catch my breath,

497
00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.880
these are polarized cheats.
So here you see me

498
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:12.710
and hear or you don't,
okay,

499
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:17.360
now let's see a case of rotation.

500
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.120
So here you see crystals.

501
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.870
And I'll put this,

502
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:34.180
I'll get light coming through and there's Polaroid filter.

503
00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.660
And here's another polar I'd filter,
right?

504
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:43.560
So I turn it 90 degrees and now let me put the crystals in there.

505
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:49.330
Now,
so there most of it's coming through,

506
00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:55.780
but now watch,
what do you notice?

507
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.233
<v 1>What's happening?</v>

508
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.870
<v 2>What's surprising about this?</v>

509
00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.110
Obviously they're rotating the plane of polarization,
right?

510
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:27.400
So that I have to set a different angle in order to stop the light.

511
00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.370
But what's special about this set of crystals?

512
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.760
Some are right handed and some are lefthanded,

513
00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:39.243
<v 1>right?</v>

514
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:45.060
<v 0>That's sodium chloride.
That's the stuff that gala sock used,
right?</v>

515
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:49.260
So this property was discovered of crystals early in the century.

516
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.730
Now how about liquids?
Will liquids do it?
Well,
here's a,

517
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.900
here's glass.
A glass doesn't do anything special,

518
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.900
right?
It's just like the air around it.
But let me pour water in here.

519
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

520
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.370
<v 0>And see if water does the trick.</v>

521
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.130
<v 1>Nothing special.
Right?</v>

522
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.500
<v 0>So let's try Kero Syrup.</v>

523
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

524
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.040
<v 0>It's not quite January,
but it takes a little while.</v>

525
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:33.663
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

526
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.960
<v 0>it's a little bit yellow is sat around a while.</v>

527
00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.013
<v 1>What's happening?</v>

528
00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.490
<v 0>Well,
there's an underlying yellow that biases this,</v>

529
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.460
but we can get different colors.

530
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.970
So different colors of the spectrum are being blocked out.

531
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.440
<v 1>How can that be okay</v>

532
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:13.830
<v 0>for different angles?
Different colors.
So the,</v>

533
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.760
this Kero Syrup is rotating the polarization,

534
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.120
but it's rotating different colors,
different amounts,

535
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.033
<v 1>right?</v>

536
00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.810
<v 0>So we block off different colors at different angles.</v>

537
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.873
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

538
00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.913
<v 0>Okay.</v>

539
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:35.360
So if we're going to make a measurement of the angle,

540
00:37:35.361 --> 00:37:38.330
how much it,
it,
uh,
how much it rotates,

541
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.030
we're going to have to say what color we're talking about.

542
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:46.100
And that's what the D is.
The D is the color.

543
00:37:46.101 --> 00:37:49.550
There's a so called d line of sodium,
a yellow color,

544
00:37:49.551 --> 00:37:52.580
the yellow streetlights or that color.
Right?

545
00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:56.330
So that's the color that was used because it was easy to generate in the old

546
00:37:56.331 --> 00:38:00.620
times.
And 20 is how many degrees because it's different for different content,

547
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.660
different temperatures.
Okay.

548
00:38:02.661 --> 00:38:06.950
So you could measure the specific rotation of a sample.
Uh,

549
00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.330
and if it's in the solvent,

550
00:38:08.331 --> 00:38:12.380
you have to say what solvent it is because it can vary with solvent.
So anyhow,

551
00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:15.320
back to our comparison,
these odors were the same,

552
00:38:15.321 --> 00:38:19.670
but we not might not believe it.
But if we measure the specific rotation,

553
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:24.970
it's equal and opposite one is plus 62 degrees and the other is minus 62

554
00:38:25.911 --> 00:38:26.744
degrees.

555
00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.040
So these things somehow are mirror images of one another.

556
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:36.250
Now here is what you've already seen.
You can write the structure of Carbone,

557
00:38:36.251 --> 00:38:41.110
either a long hand or shorthand and they're the two models and you correctly

558
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:42.820
identified a difference between them.

559
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:47.170
That one has a hydrogen pointing backwards and the other coming out toward you.

560
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.290
And is this difference real?

561
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.460
Of course there were differences in the sausage formulas too,

562
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.050
but those weren't real.

563
00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.190
Remember those two compounds turned out to be the same compound.
The question is,

564
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:01.630
is this difference real?

565
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:07.150
Are there to carve owns but with different impurities in them so they smelled

566
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:11.930
different or is there just a or is there just one?
Uh,

567
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.250
pardon me,
vice versa from what I said there.
Okay.

568
00:39:15.251 --> 00:39:17.890
So tartaric acid turns out to be the same thing.

569
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:23.130
Remember Butts alias coined the name isomer to talk about tartaric acid and

570
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.700
receive make acid,

571
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.290
which both came from the as byproducts of the wine industry and had very,

572
00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:30.700
very different melting points.

573
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.810
So obviously they're are quite different from one another and one of them turns

574
00:39:34.811 --> 00:39:38.290
out to rotate light.
If you'd make an experiment like this,

575
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:43.590
it rotates light to the right by 13 degrees per gram per milliliter per

576
00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:49.270
decimeter.
Okay.
But the,
but if you heat it,

577
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:54.750
you get another compound called pyro tartaric acid or sometimes Mizaro tartaric

578
00:39:56.411 --> 00:40:01.240
acid.
Mezzo doesn't mean anything except between,
do you know any,

579
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:06.300
any cases where mezzo means between Mesopotamia means between the Tigris and the

580
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.700
Euphrates river.
Right.
So it just means in between.

581
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:13.870
So there was another one in between.
Tartare can receive me.
Casad it's,

582
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.850
it wasn't between and melting point.

583
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:20.170
It had 140 degrees as a smelting point and it didn't rotate light either.

584
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.020
So there were these three different forms of tartaric acid,

585
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.890
but all were found to have the same constitutional formula,

586
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:29.110
the same things linked to the carbons.

587
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:35.350
So here's a problem with the model in terms of isomer numbers.
Okay.

588
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:40.620
Sometimes too many isomers are predicted like paternos die Bromo ethane.

589
00:40:40.781 --> 00:40:44.350
He had different phases of rotations said those were different.
In fact,

590
00:40:44.351 --> 00:40:45.071
they weren't different.

591
00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:48.070
It was just experimental errors of someone who thought they were different.

592
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.550
So sometimes the model predicts too many isomers,

593
00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.540
but often,

594
00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.600
or sometimes at least it predicts too few as in the case of maleic and fumaric

595
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.550
acid where you have a double bond,

596
00:41:00.551 --> 00:41:03.910
there are two different substances with different melting points and properties,

597
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.140
uh,
with a lactic acid.
Remember that,
uh,

598
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.560
that Shayla had found lactic acid from milk,

599
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.180
but leiby could found it from,
from,
uh,
meat.
And they,

600
00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:17.560
they were the same.

601
00:41:17.561 --> 00:41:21.610
It was found out about this time by a guy named vizslas say news.

602
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.890
They had the same constitution,

603
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.760
but one rotated to the right and the other rotated to the left.

604
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.170
There was tartaric and received me Casad,

605
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:35.090
which was even more complicated because there was also mezzo tartaric and also

606
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:38.330
what's called k came to be called El tartaric acid.

607
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.770
And that was the discovery of Pasta.
So at 1848,

608
00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:46.970
which was another revolutionary time in France of poster,

609
00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:51.920
was 26 years old and was becoming an interdisciplinary scientists,

610
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.160
chemistry,
physics,
crystallography,
all he was studying.

611
00:41:55.730 --> 00:42:00.730
And he wrote a paper called on the relations that can exist among crystal and

612
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:05.210
form.
So crystallography,
chemical composition,

613
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.130
chemistry,
and the direction of rotation,
rotator re polarization.

614
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.640
That is the stuff we're talking about,
which is physics.

615
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.460
Now remember we talked about myths,
relation,

616
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.770
the ability to measure angles on crystals,

617
00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.890
intel distinguished crystals by their angles.

618
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:31.060
So these are pictures that posture was using to,
uh,
to,
uh,

619
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.880
draw of his,
uh,
uh,

620
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:37.130
assaults of tartaric acid in particular,
sodium.

621
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.040
It's a dye acid,
so you can have different cad ions,

622
00:42:40.041 --> 00:42:43.980
sodium ammonium tartrate as this one.
And uh,

623
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:49.060
there's his picture that he drew of it and he said some new,

624
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.860
mostly you see the faces that are shown in that picture,

625
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.340
but sometimes you can see other little faces,
right?

626
00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.690
And you notice that,
that this crystals have symmetry.

627
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:04.310
They have a horizontal plane of symmetry,
and also a vertical plane of symmetry,

628
00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.480
right?
So if you can see one of those edges,

629
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:13.250
you should see the others that are related by symmetry,
this direction,
symmetry,

630
00:43:13.251 --> 00:43:17.660
this direction,
and also symmetry this direction.
So you should see all eight,
uh,

631
00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:21.140
in the tartrate,
but always,

632
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:25.240
only four of them are observed in sodium ammonium tartrate.

633
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.800
Not all eight Mitsa relish.

634
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.520
Had studied this stuff and he was sort of the father of measuring angles like

635
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:34.790
this.
But when pastor was trying to learn the technique and repeat it,

636
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:38.150
he noticed that you don't very often get these edges all together,

637
00:43:38.151 --> 00:43:41.150
these little tiny ones.
Usually it looks like the original picture did.

638
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:45.380
But when those sharp edges or truncated by little additional faces,

639
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.460
you only see four,
you don't see all eight.
So Mitzi,

640
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:51.530
Alicia had reported that the,

641
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:56.890
and now how that was tartrate right now they had the idea that Rasamayi,

642
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.041
which remember,

643
00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:03.041
didn't rotate light postures idea was that molecules were twisted in a right

644
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:08.750
hand or left handed helix and therefore they had this effect on light to make it

645
00:44:08.751 --> 00:44:12.650
twist,
right?
But ones that aren't twisted,

646
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.490
like received make acid where the molecules aren't twisted,

647
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:21.730
then at least in those you should see all eight because you will have mirror

648
00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:23.180
images.
Okay.

649
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.080
So he thought untwisted molecules would be what's called Hola.

650
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:31.510
He'd roll that is have all their faces.
So he studied,
uh,

651
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:33.930
the sodium ammonium morass,
a mate,

652
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:38.760
and was quite surprised to find that sometimes he saw the red ones.

653
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:43.050
Sometimes he saw the green ones,
but never on the same crystal.

654
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.580
Some crystals were right red and some were left green.

655
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:52.160
So he separated those crystals.
The red,
the right ones from the left ones he's,

656
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:53.043
he wrote,

657
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.220
I carefully separated the right from the left crystals and observing their

658
00:44:56.221 --> 00:45:00.870
dissolution separately with monsieur [inaudible] polarization apparatus.

659
00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:05.490
The thing that measures the rotation I saw with surprise and delight that the

660
00:45:05.491 --> 00:45:09.720
right crystals deviated the plaintiff of polarization to the right and the left

661
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.930
to the left.
So why did receive,

662
00:45:12.931 --> 00:45:15.330
make acid not rotate light?

663
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.540
Cause it was a 50,
50 mixture of things that would rotate at one way.

664
00:45:22.541 --> 00:45:23.950
It's not that it was untwisted,

665
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:27.670
it was that some of them would rotate it one way and some would rotate at the

666
00:45:27.671 --> 00:45:29.110
other and they'd cancel out.

667
00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:37.270
Okay,
whoops,
I improve this and forgot to take that one out.
Sorry.

668
00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:43.450
Okay.
So now he knows what's going on.
Received make acid is actually a 50,

669
00:45:43.451 --> 00:45:48.451
50 mixture of right handed Dextro tartaric acid d that has a plus rotation and

670
00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:54.490
lefthanded tartaric acid l Livo,

671
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:59.290
which has a minus rotation,
but the same melting point,
the same rotation,

672
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.880
but opposite in direction.

673
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:06.250
So those are mirror images of one another now.
And the receiver make acids of 50,

674
00:46:06.251 --> 00:46:08.950
50 mixture.
Now this was 1848.

675
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:12.460
So that's a long time from where we've gotten to,
right?

676
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.400
That was 10 years before the idea of bonds.

677
00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:17.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

678
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.030
<v 0>So that was resolution,
the separation of a mixture into the two components.</v>

679
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:29.070
Right?
But what is Mezzo tartaric acid?
Why doesn't it rotate?

680
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.310
So now we go forward 24 years,

681
00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:37.230
the bond and there's van Hoff's studying with Calculi at the age of 20.

682
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:39.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

683
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:44.010
<v 0>So that's a quarter of a century.
That's a long time,
right?</v>

684
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:48.270
It's longer than you've lived.
So here's Van Hoff.
He had some,

685
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:53.370
uh,
opinion of himself.
He,
he,
uh,
uh,

686
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.380
he won the first Nobel prize.
I mean,
he had a,

687
00:46:57.381 --> 00:47:02.130
a high opinion that was a completely justified,
uh,
he in 19 one,

688
00:47:02.131 --> 00:47:04.890
the first Nobel prize in chemistry.
And he didn't get it for this,

689
00:47:04.891 --> 00:47:08.850
which he should have gotten it for.
He got it for inventing physical chemistry.

690
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:13.680
The most admired trait he had was imagination.

691
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:18.480
So he liked poets and artists.
In fact,

692
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.480
his hero was Lord Byron.

693
00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.240
<v 1>Look at that.
Okay.</v>

694
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.700
<v 0>And in 1874,
as we said,
he was a student and he wrote this,</v>

695
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.100
a pamphlet in Dutch,

696
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:40.450
which was then translated into German and called the arrangement of atoms in

697
00:47:40.451 --> 00:47:43.030
space.
And it was published in 1877.

698
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:47.350
It was 53 pages long and heavily illustrated.

699
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.110
And look at the website for this.

700
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:55.030
One of the Wikis I've assigned does that website.
And also,

701
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.920
uh,
this website about criticism of Van Hoff by of guide named Colby.

702
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.850
So here's Herrmann Colby.
He was twice more than twice.

703
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.230
Van Hoff's age and a pillar of,
of,
of traditional chemistry.

704
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:10.090
He wrote in a review of this book,

705
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.890
it is completely impossible to criticize this booklet in any detail because the

706
00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:19.891
fancy trifles in it are totally devoid of any factual reality and are completely

707
00:48:20.591 --> 00:48:23.530
incomprehensible to any clear minded researcher.

708
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.260
The brochure begins with the words.

709
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.680
The modern chemical theory has two weak points.

710
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:34.180
It says nothing either about the relative position of the or the motion of the

711
00:48:34.181 --> 00:48:37.630
atoms within the molecules.
This is absurd,
right?

712
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:42.810
But he was wrong right now am I like calculate cause I'm more than twice as old

713
00:48:45.191 --> 00:48:46.630
as you are.
Right.

714
00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.200
So those are three websites you should read about this.

715
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:55.500
But in fact it's not true that Vantiff was devoid of any factual reality cause

716
00:48:55.961 --> 00:48:59.530
we've already seen some of his evidence and we'll see more next time.
