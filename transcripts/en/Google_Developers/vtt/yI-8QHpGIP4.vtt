Flutter has a lot of widgets
to help with explicit animations,

00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:13.076
ones that you, the developer, code up.

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:15.668
But there are also widgets
for implicit animations,

00:00:15.668 --> 00:00:17.957
those that animate changes for you.

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:20.656
A good one to know
is <i>AnimatedContainer</i>.

00:00:20.656 --> 00:00:24.347
You can build it once
with a particular attribute, like color.

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:26.779
And when you rebuild it
with a different value,

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.169
say, in response to a <i>setState</i> call,

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.057
<i>AnimatedContainer</i> performs
a linear interpolation

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:33.385
between the two values.

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:34.866
And it's more than just colors.

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.716
You can animate borders,
border radii, background images,

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:41.376
shadows, gradients, shapes,
padding, width, height,

00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:43.435
alignment, transforms, and more.

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:46.496
The length of the animation is controlled
by the duration parameter,

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:49.598
and you can also specify your own curve
to customize the effect.

00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:53.139
There are a bunch of other widgets
to help with implicit animations, too.

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:55.778
So head to <i>flutter.io</i> for more info.
