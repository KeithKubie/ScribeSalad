00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.950
I've been sent is pretty
interesting algebra problem,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.760
and I think the question isn't
properly formed, or it might be

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.400
missing some piece
of information.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.050
But it's an interesting
question nonetheless so I

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.340
thought I'd work it out,
and we can talk about why

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.150
it's not properly formed.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.520
So they give us a
function, f of x.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.910
They say it's a third degree
polynomial of the form

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:28.020
ax to the third plus bx
squared plus cx plus d.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.280
And they tell us a couple of
the 0's of this polynomial.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.330
They say that we have 0's at
the point minus 1, 0 and

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.150
the point 2 comma 0.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.360
And they tell us we have a
y-intercept, y-intercept,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.760
at the point 0, minus 2.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.320
And what they ask us is, what
is a plus b plus c plus d?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.330
So let's see if we can make
some headway on this.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.830
So the first thing is to think
about, is what would a third

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.010
degree polynomial look like and
what are we even talking

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.070
about when we say 0's.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.430
So let me just draw a
little bit of a graph.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.280
And I don't know exactly what
this third degree polynomial

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.150
looks like just yet.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.840
Let me draw my axis.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.880
Now a third degree polynomial
can have as many as three 0's.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.350
And 0's are just the
points where the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.750
function is equal to 0.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.730
So, we have a 0 at minus 1, 0.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.320
So that's minus 1, 0,
that's right there.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.640
We have a zero 2, 0.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.110
1, 2, 0.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.530
So those are the two 0's
that they've given us.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.290
They also told us the
y-intercept at 0, minus 2.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.720
So it intersects the
y-axis right there.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.200
But this guy can have
as many as three 0's.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.270
Now some of them
might be complex.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.750
But complex 0's come in
pairs of two, the two

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.980
complex conjugates.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.710
I won't go into too
much detail here.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.630
So this one must have a third
real 0, because if the third

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.060
one was complex, you'd need
another complex 0, and you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.920
can't have four 0's for a
third degree polynomial.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.760
So that third root, it could
be sitting some place out

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.460
here, maybe over here.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.910
Or it could even be a
repeat of one of these

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.850
two roots over here.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.890
But let's just assume that
there's some third root, we

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.260
don't know what it looks like.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.610
Let's say it looks something
like-- let's say that third

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.410
root is sitting out
here some place.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.550
And then a potential graph, and
I could be completely wrong,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.750
I'm just guessing, but just to
get a sense of what third

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.980
degree polynomials look like,
and how can a graph intersect

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.160
the x-axis three times, a
potential graph might look

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.880
something like this.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.305
Curves and bam, hits the other
0, hits the y-intercept, and

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:40.530
then goes back up like that.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.040
It might go like that, it might
go the other way, go like that.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.120
Up, and then down like that.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.920
Well, there's many ways you
could draw something that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.580
essentially curves twice to
intersect these three points

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.870
and also that y-intercept,
but I'm not going to go into

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.720
all of those right now.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.190
But let's see if we can figure
out the coefficients here.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.590
So the key point is me
telling you that there

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.250
must be a third 0 here.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.600
Let's call that third 0, it's
at the point, it's at the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.470
point-- let's call
it --r3 comma 0.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.390
And I'm using the
letter r for roots.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.890
Roots are the x
values of the 0's.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.950
So if we say f of minus 1 is
equal to 0, we say that x is

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.720
equal to minus 1 is a root.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.360
Similarly, we know that f of
2, f of 2, is equal to 0.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.780
Or we could say x equals 2
is a root, these are roots.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.160
So when someone tells you a 0
they're also essentially

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.360
telling you the roots, and then
we know there must be a third

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.300
root at x is equal to r3.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.340
So x is equal to r3.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.980
Now, if we have a third degree
polynomial where these three x

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.570
values make it 0, we can
rewrite this third degree

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.270
polynomial as-- we can rewrite
it as-- I'll do it in a

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.820
slightly different color --f of
x is equal to x plus 1-- you'll

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.300
see why I'm doing x plus 1
instead of x minus 1 in a

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:20.230
second --plus 1 times x
minus 2 times x minus r3.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.015
And we want to put an a out
front, and I'll tell you in

00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:26.550
a second why I'm putting
this a out front.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.400
Because if you were to multiply
just the x terms here, when

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.370
actually do your distributed
property and multiply out these

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.260
binomials, you'll just get x to
the third, but we had

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.390
an ax to the third.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.360
So you just needed a constant
a there to make this

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.100
an ax to the third.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.490
Now, why did I write
out like this?

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.520
Well, if you put a minus 1 in
here what's going to happen?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.660
This term is going to
be minus 1 plus 1.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.850
It's going to be 0.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.210
Who cares what these are
or what a is, the whole

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.380
thing's going to be 0.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.170
If we put x is equal
to 2, this term right

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.610
here is going to be 0.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.190
Who cares what the other
terms or the a is, f

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.070
of 2 is going to be 0.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.360
Similarly, when x is equal to
r3, this last term is 0, who

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.170
cares about anything over here.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.550
So we know that this guy
up here can be rewritten

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.520
in this form over here.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.490
And so if we can solve for r3
we can just multiply this thing

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.370
out and try to do a little bit
of pattern matching to figure

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.760
out what these coefficients
are going to be.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.100
Now, the other big clue they
gave us is a y-intercept.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.640
That point right there,
the point 0, minus 2.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.160
They're telling us that f
of 0 is equal to minus 2.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.940
Well what's f of 0?

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.730
f of 0-- I'll write it here --f
of 0-- If you put 0 in here,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.420
this term becomes 0, this term
becomes 0, that term becomes 0,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.840
you are just left with the d.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.940
So f of 0 is equal to d.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.760
Or we could say that d
must be equal to minus 2.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.530
d is equal to minus 2, so
we solved at least one

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.090
of the call efficient.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.450
The constant term. d
is equal to minus 2.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.970
Now, if d is equal to minus 2,
that means all of these

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.740
constant terms, when you were
to multiply out this

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.340
expression, and I would include
the a, because the a is scaling

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.620
everything, that must
be equal to minus 2.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.730
Let me be clear here.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.910
So let me rewrite
this expression.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.970
This is equal to, I'll just
multiply this a times

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.740
this last term.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.400
We do it in any order you want,
so this is the same thing as x

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:36.450
plus 1 times x minus 2 to times
a a minus r, let me

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.870
write, minus ar3.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.400
This is the exact same thing as
this thing up here, I'll just

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.860
write this is with f of x is
equal to, and this is the exact

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.460
same thing is that up there.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.560
Now, to solve for an r3, or
attempt to solve for an r3, you

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.540
just have to realize that when
you multiply this thing out,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.690
the way to get the constant
term over here, or the d over

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.840
here, that's going to be a
product of the constant

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.310
terms in our expressions.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.920
Because if I introduced any
products with any x terms,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.870
you're going to get one of
these other terms over here.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.300
The ax cubed term is generated
from that term, that term,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.320
and that term, being
multiplied together.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.680
and then the constant term
is multiplied by the

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.790
constant terms to be
multiplied together.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.080
And then the two in the middle
are multiplied by different

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.260
combinations of constant terms.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.460
And you'll see that if
you actually want to

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.260
multiply this out.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:35.000
But if you take my word for it,
that times that times that

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.340
times, actually let me
write it this way.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:43.820
That times that times that,
have got to be equal to date we

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.550
can then attempt to find some
relationship between a and d,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.500
which is mine is minus 2.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:57.890
So we could say 1 times minus
2 times minus ar3, these two

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.050
minuses will cancel out.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.170
It is going to be
equal to our d terms.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.110
It's going to be equal to minus
2, and so if we simplify that a

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:14.720
little bit we get 2ar3 is equal
to minus 2, divide both sides

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.755
by 2a and you get r3 is
equal to minus 1/a.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.010
So we haven't solved for the
third root, we've just gotten

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.990
it in terms of, in terms
of our coefficient a.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:33.060
But letls see if we can still
use that in some useful way.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.710
So if r3 is minus 1/a, this
term right here becomes what?

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.210
Let me rewrite it.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.260
Let me rewrite it.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.030
All right, I'll do it in blue.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:50.700
f of x is going to be equal to
x plus 1 times x minus 2 times

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.610
ax-- now minus a times r3.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.250
Let me do it over here.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.780
Minus a times r3
three is minus 1/a.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.340
So that's a minus
times a minus.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.420
That's a plus.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.420
The a's cancel out.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.210
You just get a 1.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.300
So this term now if we
substitute r3 with this will

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.140
just turn into a this will
just turn into a plus 1.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.640
Minus a times minus
1/a that's plus 1.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.450
Plus 1.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.160
We just substituted that for
that to get this right here.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.790
Now let's multiply
this thing out.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.120
Let's actually do the
algebraic multiplication

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.130
and see what we get.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.980
So first I'm going to
multiply these two terms.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.580
I'm going to do it in
a different color.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.050
Let me multiply those
two terms right there.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:39.740
So this is going to be equal to
x squared, x squared plus 1x

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.400
minus 2x So that's
minus x, right?

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.235
1 times x is x, minus 2
times x is x minus 2x.

00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:53.110
So it's minus x, and then minus
2, just multiplied these two

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.940
binomials out right here.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.000
And then I'm going to have to
multiply that times ax plus 1,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.880
so I'm going to write the
ax plus 1 down here

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.720
just to save space.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.810
ax plus 1.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.600
And now we just do a little bit
of algebraic multiplication.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.140
1 times minus 2 is-- I'll do
it in magenta --minus 2.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.150
1 times minus x is minus x.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.690
1 times x squared is x squared.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:26.820
Now ax times minus
2 is minus 2ax.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.910
Minus 2ax.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:37.680
ax times minus x is minus
ax squared, right?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.160
Minus ax squared and
then ax times x squared

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.020
is ax to the third.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.750
ax to the third.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.220
Then we add everything
together, and we get our f of x

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.380
is going to be equal to ax to
the third-- let me scroll to

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.710
the left a little bit
--ax to the third.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.920
x squared minus ax squared.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:04.620
So that's plus 1 minus
a, 1 minus a x squared.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.360
And then we have these two
added together so this is minus

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:17.660
1 minus 2a or we could call
this equal to-- so minus 1

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:25.890
minus 2a --or we could say
minus 1 plus 2ax and then we

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.090
have our minus 2, which makes
sense because that is our d.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.300
That's our d.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.030
So this is really the solution.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.410
This is the form that are
equation is going to take and

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.590
the reason why I said in the
beginning of the problem that

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.270
the equation or the problem
wasn't well defined is that I

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:48.430
can pick any real number a
and this equation will

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.280
satisfy these conditions
that we were given.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.270
So I suspect that I wasn't
given all of the constraints

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:54.940
on this problem.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.930
Maybe there was a third
constraint that a is equal to

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.990
1, or b is equal to something
else, or a plus b is

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.860
equal to something else.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.060
But just using these
constraints, just using these

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.050
constraints, the equation
will take this form.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.690
So, if it was in this form, of
course this is a, this is b,

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.800
which would be 1 minus a,
that's b, that's a, and then

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.540
this right here is equal to c.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.730
So we could pick, you know, we
could pick one particular

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.320
choice if we just want to get
an answer to their problem, but

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.210
it might not be the answer they
were looking for because they

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.670
might have picked
a different a.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.290
But if you just pick a simple
a is equal to 1, than

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.690
what's b equal to?

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.750
Then b is equal to 1 minus
a, which is equal to 0.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.730
Then b is equal to 0, and then
c is equal-- actually c would

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.530
include this minus sign right
there --c would be one plus 2a.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.470
So 2a is 2, 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.790
Put a minus sign.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.920
So c would be equal to minus 3.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.280
And of course no matter
what we do, d is going

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.480
to be equal to minus 2.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.230
So if we pick a is equal to 1,
the answer here to what is a

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:07.970
plus b plus c plus d, would
be equal to 1 plus minus 3.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.410
1 plus minus 3 is minus 2.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.530
Minus another minus
2 is minus 4.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.110
That's another possibility, but
we just as easily could have

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.310
picked, you know a could have
been something, it could be a

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.630
fraction, it could be anything.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.310
It could be, you know
a could be minus 1.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.990
a could be equal to minus 1, if
a is equal to minus 1, then b

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.930
is equal to 2, then b
is equal to 2, right?

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.400
1 minus minus 1.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.790
And then c is equal to 1 minus
2, which is minus 1, but then

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.400
you have a minus out front.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.040
So then c is equal to 1,
and then d is always going

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.230
to be equal to minus 2.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.930
d is equal to minus 2.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:53.020
And then you have a plus b plus
c plus d would be equal to.,

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.350
well these would cancel out,
you'd get them equal to 0.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.110
So, we don't know exactly what
answer the problem writer

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.500
was looking for, but it is a
pretty interesting problem.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.530
And then you know, just out of
curiosity, it-- let's take this

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.750
first example that we took
--where a is equal to 1, we

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.280
could then look at what
our root must be.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.470
If a is equal to 1, then our
third root is that r3 would be

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.790
equal-- that's just for this
situation right here --than r3

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.330
would be equal to negative 1
divided by 1 would be equal to

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.410
minus 1, which means that we
would have a repeated root, we

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.940
would have a repeated
root, right there.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.830
We wouldn't necessarily have
a distinct root out there.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.730
And if we're curious about what
that would look like, let's

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.130
look at the situation
where a is equal to 1.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.280
Actually maybe we wil
look at both of them.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.710
When a is equal to 1, our
equation is x to the third--

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:54.140
where is the x button --x to
the third, there's no x

00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:03.040
squared term, minus 3x minus
3x, minus 3x, minus 2.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.880
So let's grab both of
them simultaneously.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.160
So that's this one, where
we picked this choice

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.210
of coefficients.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.760
And then let's do this choice
of coefficients, if we have, if

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:23.270
we have minus x to the third,
right? a is minus 1 plus 2 x

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:31.350
squared, and then we have, plus
x, c is 1, plus x minus 2.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.520
So those are 2 graps.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.370
Let's see what they look like.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.640
Let's graph them.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.500
So our first one, there we
go, we hit that point,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.500
that's our double root.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.200
Notice, both of these
two graphs meet our

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.480
two constraints.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.790
They both have a root
there at minus 1.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.310
They both have a y-intercept
at y is equal to minus 2.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.780
And they both have a
root at x is equal to

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.420
positive 2 right there.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.480
Now the second one right here
had a separate distinct third

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.960
root, while the first one,
here, has a double root

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.000
right over there.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.230
Anyway, I actually think this
problem was somewhat more

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.850
interesting by the fact we
had to actually look at the

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.240
different solutions to it.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.030
And there's actually an
infinite number of solutions

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.180
to this based on what
you choose for your a.
