00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:14.420
I'm a professional troublemaker.

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:15.809
(Laughter)

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.229
As my job is to critique the world,

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:25.245
the shoddy systems and the people
who refuse to do better,

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:29.166
as a writer, as a speaker,
as a shady Nigerian --

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.215
(Laughter)

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.220
I feel like my purpose is to be this cat.

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:36.395
(Laughter)

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:39.075
I am the person
who is looking at other people,

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:40.663
like, "I need you to fix it."

00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:42.486
That is me.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.691
I want us to leave this world
better than we found it.

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.000
And how I choose to effect change

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:51.437
is by speaking up,

00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:53.845
by being the first
and by being the domino.

00:00:55.245 --> 00:00:57.299
For a line of dominoes to fall,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.564
one has to fall first,

00:00:59.588 --> 00:01:02.453
which then leaves the other
choiceless to do the same.

00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:04.839
And that domino that falls,

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:07.121
we're hoping that, OK,

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:10.597
the next person that sees this
is inspired to be a domino.

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:15.303
Being the domino, for me,
looks like speaking up

00:01:15.327 --> 00:01:17.564
and doing the things
that are really difficult,

00:01:17.588 --> 00:01:19.683
especially when they are needed,

00:01:19.707 --> 00:01:22.069
with the hope that others
will follow suit.

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.600
And here's the thing:
I'm the person who says

00:01:25.624 --> 00:01:29.081
what you might be thinking
but dared not to say.

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:31.872
A lot of times people think
that we're fearless,

00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:33.874
the people who do this, we're fearless.

00:01:33.898 --> 00:01:35.056
We're not fearless.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.554
We're not unafraid of the consequences

00:01:37.578 --> 00:01:39.788
or the sacrifices that we have to make

00:01:39.812 --> 00:01:41.808
by speaking truth to power.

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:44.031
What happens is, we feel like we have to,

00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:46.658
because there are too few
people in the world

00:01:46.682 --> 00:01:48.309
willing to be the domino,

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.691
too few people willing to take that fall.

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.437
We're not doing it without fear.

00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:53.833
Now, let's talk about fear.

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.741
I knew exactly what I wanted
to be when I grew up.

00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:58.703
I was like, "I'm going to be a doctor!"

00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:00.289
Doctor Luvvie was the dream.

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:03.129
I was Doc McStuffins
before it was a thing.

00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:04.352
(Laughter)

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:06.583
And I remember when I went to college,

00:02:06.607 --> 00:02:10.313
my freshman year,
I had to take Chemistry 101

00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:11.726
for my premed major.

00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:16.183
I got the first and last D
of my academic career.

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:17.881
(Laughter)

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:20.477
So I went to my advisor, and I was like,

00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:22.755
"OK, let's drop the premed,

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.002
because this doctor thing
is not going to work,

00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:26.770
because I don't even like hospitals.

00:02:26.794 --> 00:02:27.945
So ..."

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.000
(Laughter)

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:31.152
"Let's just consider that done for."

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:34.148
And that same semester,
I started blogging.

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:35.601
That was 2003.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:38.484
So as that one dream was ending,
another was beginning.

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:42.077
And then what was a cute hobby
became my full-time job

00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:44.996
when I lost my marketing job in 2010.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.394
But it still took me two more years
to say, "I'm a writer."

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:53.636
Nine years after I had started writing,
before I said, "I'm a writer,"

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.459
because I was afraid of what happens

00:02:56.483 --> 00:02:58.499
without 401ks,

00:02:58.523 --> 00:03:01.031
without, "How am I going
to keep up my shoe habit?

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:02.221
That's important to me."

00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:03.364
(Laughter)

00:03:03.388 --> 00:03:06.383
So it took me that long to own this thing

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:08.041
that was what my purpose was.

00:03:08.065 --> 00:03:09.500
And then I realized,

00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:11.834
fear has a very concrete power

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:16.050
of keeping us from doing and saying
the things that are our purpose.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.496
And I was like, "You know what?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.122
I'm not going to let fear rule my life.

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:24.568
I'm not going to let fear
dictate what I do."

00:03:24.592 --> 00:03:27.576
And then all of these
awesome things started happening,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.179
and dominoes started to fall.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.529
So when I realized that,
I was like, "OK, 2015,

00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:33.818
I turned 30,

00:03:33.842 --> 00:03:36.030
it's going to be my year
of 'Do it anyway.'

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:39.079
Anything that scares me,
I'm going to actively pursue it."

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.857
So, I'm a Capricorn.

00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:44.003
I like my feel solidly on the ground.

00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:48.022
I decided to take
my first-ever solo vacation,

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:50.827
and it was out of the country
to the Dominican Republic.

00:03:51.827 --> 00:03:54.422
So on my birthday, what did I do?

00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:56.911
I went ziplining through
the forests of Punta Cana.

00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:00.093
And for some odd reason,
I had on business casual.

00:04:00.117 --> 00:04:01.299
Don't ask why.

00:04:01.323 --> 00:04:03.525
(Laughter)

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.403
And I had an incredible time.

00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:07.563
Also, I don't like being
submerged in water.

00:04:07.587 --> 00:04:09.941
I like to be, again, on solid ground.

00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:14.511
So I went to Mexico
and swam with dolphins underwater.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.632
And then the cool thing
that I did also that year

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.745
that was my mountain

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.659
was I wrote my book,

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:23.735
"I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual,"

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.912
And I had to own --

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:25.950
(Applause)

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.771
that whole writing thing now, right?

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:29.038
Yes.

00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:32.090
But the very anti-me thing
that I did that year

00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:33.906
that scared the crap out of me --

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:36.410
I went skydiving.

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.347
We're about to fall out of the plane.

00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:42.831
I was like, "I've done some stupid
things in life. This is one of them."

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:43.858
(Laughter)

00:04:43.882 --> 00:04:45.806
And then we come falling down to Earth,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.073
and I literally lose my breath
as I see Earth, and I was like,

00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:51.747
"I just fell out of a perfectly good
plane on purpose."

00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:52.795
(Laughter)

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.261
"What is wrong with me?!"

00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:56.201
But then I looked down at the beauty,

00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:58.975
and I was like, "This is
the best thing I could have done.

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.232
This was an amazing decision."

00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:04.105
And I think about the times
when I have to speak truth.

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.440
It feels like I am falling
out of that plane.

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:10.319
It feels like that moment
when I'm at the edge of the plane,

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.206
and I'm like, "You shouldn't do this,"

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.868
but then I do it anyway,
because I realize I have to.

00:05:15.674 --> 00:05:17.360
Sitting at the edge of that plane

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:20.178
and kind of staying on that plane
is comfort to me.

00:05:20.202 --> 00:05:22.511
And I feel like every day
that I'm speaking truth

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:25.334
against institutions and people
who are bigger than me

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.687
and just forces that are
more powerful than me,

00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:29.770
I feel like I'm falling out of that plane.

00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:31.900
But I realize comfort is overrated.

00:05:31.924 --> 00:05:34.634
Because being quiet is comfortable.

00:05:34.658 --> 00:05:37.979
Keeping things the way
they've been is comfortable.

00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:40.699
And all comfort has done
is maintain the status quo.

00:05:40.723 --> 00:05:43.405
So we've got to get comfortable
with being uncomfortable

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:46.162
by speaking these hard truths
when they're necessary.

00:05:46.835 --> 00:05:48.136
And I --

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.331
(Applause)

00:05:51.355 --> 00:05:55.082
And for me, though, I realize
that I have to speak these truths,

00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:57.055
because honesty is so important to me.

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:59.322
My integrity is something I hold dear.

00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:01.887
Justice -- I don't think justice
should be an option.

00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:03.391
We should always have justice.

00:06:03.415 --> 00:06:06.753
Also, I believe in shea butter
as a core value, and --

00:06:06.777 --> 00:06:08.075
(Laughter)

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.689
and I think the world would be better
if we were more moisturized.

00:06:12.483 --> 00:06:15.295
But besides that, with these
as my core values,

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.594
I have to speak the truth.

00:06:16.618 --> 00:06:18.473
I have no other choice in the matter.

00:06:18.497 --> 00:06:20.890
But people like me,
the professional troublemakers,

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:24.213
should not be the only ones who are
committed to being these dominoes

00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:25.974
who are always falling out of planes

00:06:25.998 --> 00:06:27.933
or being the first one to take this hit.

00:06:27.957 --> 00:06:30.286
People are so afraid
of these acute consequences,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.362
not realizing that there are many times
when we walk in rooms

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:36.375
and we are some of the most
powerful people in those rooms --

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:39.162
we might be the second-most powerful,
third-most powerful.

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:42.043
And I firmly believe
that our job in those times

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:44.116
is to disrupt what is happening.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.239
And then if we're not the most powerful,

00:06:46.263 --> 00:06:48.489
if two more of us band together,

00:06:48.513 --> 00:06:49.970
it makes us powerful.

00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:52.457
It's like cosigning
the woman in the meeting,

00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:55.376
you know, the woman
who can't seem to get her word out,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.804
or just making sure that other person
who can't make a point

00:06:58.828 --> 00:07:00.137
is being heard.

00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:03.415
Our job is to make sure
they have room for that.

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.547
Everyone's well-being
is community business.

00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:07.794
If we made that a point,
we'd understand that,

00:07:07.818 --> 00:07:09.480
for the times when we need help,

00:07:09.504 --> 00:07:11.455
we wouldn't have to look around so hard

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.815
if we made sure
we were somebody else's help.

00:07:14.313 --> 00:07:16.083
And there are times when I feel like

00:07:16.107 --> 00:07:20.127
I have taken very public
tumbles and falls,

00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:22.832
like the time when I was asked
to speak at a conference,

00:07:22.856 --> 00:07:25.849
and they wanted me to pay my way there.

00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:27.704
And then I did some research

00:07:27.728 --> 00:07:30.831
and found out the white men
who spoke there got compensated

00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:32.752
and got their travel paid for.

00:07:32.776 --> 00:07:35.800
The white women who spoke there
got their travel paid for.

00:07:35.824 --> 00:07:40.106
The black women who spoke there were
expected to actually pay to speak there.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.828
And I was like, "What do I do?"

00:07:42.417 --> 00:07:45.158
And I knew that if I spoke up
about this publicly,

00:07:45.182 --> 00:07:46.677
I could face financial loss.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:50.175
But then I also understood
that my silence serves no one.

00:07:50.658 --> 00:07:53.762
So I fearfully spoke up about it publicly,

00:07:53.786 --> 00:07:56.405
and other women started
coming out to talk about,

00:07:56.429 --> 00:07:58.981
"I, too, have faced
this type of pay inequality."

00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:02.110
And it started a conversation
about discriminatory pay practices

00:08:02.134 --> 00:08:04.649
that this conference was participating in.

00:08:04.673 --> 00:08:07.065
I felt like I was the domino

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:09.812
the time I read a disturbing
memoir by a public figure

00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:11.203
and wrote a piece about it.

00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:15.148
I knew this person was more powerful
than me and could impact my career,

00:08:15.172 --> 00:08:16.990
but I was like, "I've got to do this.

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:20.415
I've got to sit at the edge
of this plane," maybe for two hours.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.878
And I did. And I pressed
"Publish," and I ran away.

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:23.939
(Laughter)

00:08:23.963 --> 00:08:25.875
And I came back to a viral post

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:29.501
and people being like, "Oh my God,
I'm so glad somebody finally said this."

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:31.037
And it started a conversation

00:08:31.061 --> 00:08:33.853
about mental health and self-care,

00:08:33.877 --> 00:08:35.728
and I was like, "OK. Alright.

00:08:35.752 --> 00:08:39.136
This thing that I'm doing,
I guess, alright, it's doing something."

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.580
And then so many people
have been the domino

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:47.760
when they talk about how
they've been assaulted by powerful men.

00:08:47.784 --> 00:08:52.206
And it's made millions of women
join in and say, "Me Too."

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.086
So, a shout-out to Tarana Burke
for igniting that movement.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:01.735
(Applause)

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:06.501
People and systems count on our silence
to keep us exactly where we are.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:13.597
Now, being the domino sometimes
comes down to being exactly who you are.

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:17.175
So, I've been a shady somebody
since I was three.

00:09:17.199 --> 00:09:18.278
(Laughter)

00:09:18.302 --> 00:09:19.978
This is me on my third birthday.

00:09:20.923 --> 00:09:23.267
But I've been this girl all my life,

00:09:23.291 --> 00:09:25.360
and I feel like
even that's been the domino,

00:09:25.384 --> 00:09:27.684
because in a world
that wants us to walk around

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:29.548
as representatives of ourselves,

00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:31.832
being yourself can be a revolutionary act.

00:09:32.428 --> 00:09:34.781
And in a world that wants us to whisper,

00:09:34.805 --> 00:09:36.359
I choose to yell.

00:09:37.001 --> 00:09:41.987
(Applause)

00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:44.412
When it's time to say these hard things,

00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:46.074
I ask myself three things.

00:09:46.098 --> 00:09:47.937
One: Did you mean it?

00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:50.626
Two: Can you defend it?

00:09:51.221 --> 00:09:53.344
Three: Did you say it with love?

00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:55.600
If the answer is yes to all three,

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:57.481
I say it and let the chips fall.

00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:00.696
That's important.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.245
That checkpoint with myself

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.975
always tells me, "Yes,
you're supposed to do this."

00:10:06.595 --> 00:10:08.980
Telling the truth --
telling thoughtful truths --

00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:10.788
should not be a revolutionary act.

00:10:12.267 --> 00:10:15.624
Speaking truths to power
should not be sacrificial, but they are.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.558
But I think if more of us chose
to do this for the greater good,

00:10:19.582 --> 00:10:21.882
we'd be in better spaces
than we are right now.

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:24.789
Speaking of the greater good,

00:10:25.438 --> 00:10:28.870
I think we commit ourselves
to telling truths to build bridges

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.371
to common ground,

00:10:30.395 --> 00:10:33.607
and bridges that aren't based
on truth will collapse.

00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:35.492
So it is our job,

00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:38.844
it is our obligation, it is our duty

00:10:38.868 --> 00:10:41.040
to speak truth to power, to be the domino,

00:10:41.883 --> 00:10:43.502
not just when it's difficult --

00:10:43.526 --> 00:10:45.515
especially when it's difficult.

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:46.733
Thank you.

00:10:46.757 --> 00:10:52.906
(Applause)
