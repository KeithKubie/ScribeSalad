00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.400
“Good” is a really subjective term, and
we all have our individual preferences when

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.030
we go to the movies.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.360
So when it’s time to decide what to watch,
everyone’s criteria is a little different.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.090
Wether it’s because of box office bank,
critical acclaim, or a general audience consensus,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.150
here are 10 Famous Actors With Only One Good
Movie Performance.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.281
Daniel Radcliffe - Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows: Part II

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:38.780
To some people, the proof about if a movie
is “good” or not lies in the amount of

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.649
money it brings in at the box office.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.940
If that’s true, then Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows: Part II is the best movie

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.030
Daniel Radcliffe has ever done.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.380
It’s one of the highest grossing movies
of all time, and none of his other roles have

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.600
gotten anywhere close to the same amount of
attention.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.270
We know that fanbase size isn’t the best
way to judge quality, but in this case the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180
masses are actually right.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.280
It’s Radcliffe’s best role.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.590
Even JK Rowling approves, and she invented
the character.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.970
Jessica Alba - Sin City
The people of Basin City are a rare breed.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.310
Everything about them is just a little more
dramatic.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.370
And thanks to Frank Miller, they’re eloquent
and tough as hell.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.030
2005’s Sin City brought a huge ensemble
cast together and delivered an experience

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.980
like we’d never seen.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.979
The movie is visually stunning, and will supply
more than enough story to keep you entertained.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.030
It’s a shame we can’t say that about the
rest of Jessica Alba’s movies.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.270
The actress isn’t known for her acting chops,
but she argues that it’s hard to give a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.369
good performance when the material sucks.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.159
Point: Alba.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.229
Orlando Bloom - The Lord of the Rings franchise
When Orlando Bloom came on the scene as Legolas

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.270
in 2001, the Lord of the Rings actor got a
lot of attention.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.500
But teenage girls weren’t the only ones
swooning.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.020
Even the franchise’s diehard fans were pleased
with the casting.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.320
Everyone’s favorite woodland elf has some
of the most badass moments in the entire series.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.170
And Bloom does it well.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.500
But life after Legolas has been less awesome,
and so have the actor’s movie choices.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.170
This doesn’t mean he hasn’t made any money
though.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.519
But even in Pirates of the Caribbean, he’s
outshined by Johnny Depp at very turn.

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.350
Cameron Diaz, The Mask
For someone who’s played a range of different

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.850
characters, Cameron Diaz’s work has started
blending together over the last decade or

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.850
so.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.920
The actress has starred in multiple rom-com
flops, and been the very recognizable voice

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.750
of Princess Fiona in the Shrek franchise.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.050
But there’s one performance that sticks
with us until this very day, from her breakout

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.810
role in The Mask.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.661
1994 was a long time ago, so if the Jim Carrey
classic is a little hazy in your mind, we

00:02:55.661 --> 00:02:57.650
recommend that you give it another viewing.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.480
Especially since it’s Diaz’s best.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.070
John Travolta - Pulp Fiction
Disco does not have a reputation for being

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.290
cool.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.479
And even though John Travolta had all the
right moves in Saturday Night Fever, the movie

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.910
has some inescapably cheesy elements.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.690
So when Quentin Tarantino offered him the
role of Vincent Vega in 1994’s Pulp Fiction,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.120
the actor took the opportunity to shake his
dorky disco image for good.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.660
The director must foster a creative environment
on set, because Travolta’s at his best.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.940
And while he seemed to be everywhere in the
nineties, none of his other work is as memorable

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.470
or iconic.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.150
Mila Kunis - Black Swan
Mila Kunis has been on television since she

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.350
was a kid.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.620
But really grabbed everyone’s attention
when she landed the role of Jackie on That

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.910
70’s Show, and has been the voice behind
Meg on Family Guy.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.060
While small-screen success is powerful in
it’s own right, it doesn't guarantee victory

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.160
at the box office.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.730
And the actress has talked about how embarrassed
she is of some of her roles.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.920
But her turn as Lily in Black Swan is not
one of them.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.970
As a supporting character, Kunis totally stole
the show, and a lot of critical acclaim.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.970
But then Jupiter Ascending happened, and everyone
forgot.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.650
Marlon Wayans - Requiem for a Dream
Requiem for a Dream is not an easy movie to

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.650
watch.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.510
It’s heavy story and dark atmosphere are
specifically designed to throw viewers off

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.530
balance.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.660
So obviously Darren Aronofsky is the perfect
person to direct it.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.500
And while audiences were confident about the
man behind the camera, they were surprised

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.970
to see Marlon Wayans in front of it.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.030
Yep, the guy from In Living Color and Scary
Movie.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.131
His comedic background made him seem like
an odd choice for such a humorless film, but

00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:45.760
Wayans nails the performance.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.130
But the accolades end there, since he also
starred in White Chicks.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.470
Lindsay Lohan - Mean Girls
When a star’s personal life becomes public

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.960
knowledge, it has the potential to overshadow
their work.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.570
And it’s easy to forget how talented someone
is when their mugshot is constantly being

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.950
shoved in your face.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.900
Take, for example, Lindsay Lohan.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.580
A string of DUI’s and sub-par career choices
have made her a punchline.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.340
But in 2004, the team behind Mean Girls knew
what they were doing when they cast Lohan

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.470
as the lead.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.650
Working with comedic heavy-hitters Tina Fey,
Amy Poehler and Tim Meadows, the actress held

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.100
her own and brought a lot of genuine innocence
to a movie full of backstabbing.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.660
Cuba Gooding Jr. - Jerry Maguire
Another way people measure an actors success

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.000
is to look at the trophies on their mantle.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.560
And if you’re one of those people, then
as far as you’re concerned, Cuba Gooding

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.250
Jr. has only been in one good movie.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.280
But after winning an Oscar for his performance
in Jerry Maguire, the actor got in his own

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.280
way.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.730
In the afterglow of his win, he turned down
a few roles that would have been huge.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.150
When he was ready to come back to showbiz,
the offers stopped coming.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.810
Well, not ALL the offers stopped, just the
good ones.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.220
Kate Hudson - Almost Famous
As the daughter of Goldie Hawn, Kate Hudson

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.300
knew that if she was going to be an actress,
she had some high stilettos to fill.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.170
And when she transformed into Penny Lane for
2000’s Almost Famous, she succeeded.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.990
Her performance was interesting and dynamic.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.160
And even though she’s not the main character,
she’s easily the most nuanced.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.770
After, despite her obvious talent, Hudson
was cast in a string of fluffy and forgettable

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.810
romantic comedies.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.040
Where her characters are reduced to generic
tropes.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.470
But hey, if Matthew McConaughey’s career
can recover from How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.650
maybe hers can too.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.280
What do you think of our list?

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.650

one good performance in a movie?
