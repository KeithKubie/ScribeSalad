again now here's the thing if you think
about the abandonment bunbun rate like

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
about the abandonment bunbun rate like
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.770
about the abandonment bunbun rate like
the number of people starts installing

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
the number of people starts installing
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689
the number of people starts installing
installing a game and actually play the

installing a game and actually play the
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.049
installing a game and actually play the
game is the number of people who don't

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
game is the number of people who don't

installation is very very high if you
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.730
installation is very very high if you
think about the numbers probably higher

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
think about the numbers probably higher
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320
think about the numbers probably higher
than the numbers you're thinking about

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
than the numbers you're thinking about
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.340
than the numbers you're thinking about
now now we are taking this problem here

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
now now we are taking this problem here
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140
now now we are taking this problem here
at Google with Google Play instant and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
at Google with Google Play instant and

in this new word I send a link to my mom
she opens the link and instead of going

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
she opens the link and instead of going
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.920
she opens the link and instead of going
to the Play Store she brought she starts

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
to the Play Store she brought she starts
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.719

immediately into the game like few
seconds the game starts running and it's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
seconds the game starts running and it's

downloading a native application with no
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.899
downloading a native application with no
installation whatsoever so there's no

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
installation whatsoever so there's no
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.080

more friction there now my mom is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
more friction there now my mom is
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.670

happened quite a few times actually the
key points here are the code that is

may not have seen it or who may not get
 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.650
may not have seen it or who may not get
the opportunity to see it so and you can

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660
the opportunity to see it so and you can
 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.449
the opportunity to see it so and you can
you know you can sidestep some of the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459
you know you can sidestep some of the
 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.460
you know you can sidestep some of the
drop offs that you see when you acquire

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470
drop offs that you see when you acquire
 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.009
drop offs that you see when you acquire
users on the Play Store for example if

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019
users on the Play Store for example if
 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.009
users on the Play Store for example if
you have you know a really large game

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019
you have you know a really large game
 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.619
you have you know a really large game
you get that prompt you know if you're

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629
you get that prompt you know if you're
 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.689
you get that prompt you know if you're
not on Wi-Fi you may want to avoid

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699
not on Wi-Fi you may want to avoid
 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.990
not on Wi-Fi you may want to avoid
downloading this game on cellular so you

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000
downloading this game on cellular so you
 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.750
downloading this game on cellular so you
know all those things you know those are

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760
know all those things you know those are
 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.550
know all those things you know those are
friction points those are funnel

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560
friction points those are funnel
 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.089
friction points those are funnel
drop-offs so with instant you can really

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099
drop-offs so with instant you can really
 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.119
drop-offs so with instant you can really
sidestep those and you know also if

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129
sidestep those and you know also if
 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.740
sidestep those and you know also if
people aren't ready to commit to

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:37.069
far as the fidelity goes we also added
we also added AR mode which is a feature

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:37.079
we also added AR mode which is a feature
 

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:39.769
we also added AR mode which is a feature

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480
because why not so so let's let's see
 

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.030
because why not so so let's let's see
how each of these were done going

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040
how each of these were done going
 

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.980
how each of these were done going
through depth here a little bit first

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:15.990
through depth here a little bit first
 

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.140
through depth here a little bit first
let's talk some about the requirements

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.150
let's talk some about the requirements
 

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.730
let's talk some about the requirements
of being on the Google Play Instant

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740
of being on the Google Play Instant
 

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.040

platform so the most significant thing

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.050
platform so the most significant thing
 

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.090
platform so the most significant thing
that you're going to have to deal with

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100
that you're going to have to deal with
 

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.490
that you're going to have to deal with
is that 10 Meg initial apk limit so

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:27.500
is that 10 Meg initial apk limit so
 

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.320
is that 10 Meg initial apk limit so
you're you're going it can it can also

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:30.330
you're you're going it can it can also
 

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.240
you're you're going it can it can also
be the hardest to overcome right so

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:32.250
be the hardest to overcome right so
 

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.310
be the hardest to overcome right so
which is why it's so important to focus

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320
which is why it's so important to focus
 

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.730
which is why it's so important to focus
on the absolute core gameplay experience

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740
on the absolute core gameplay experience
 

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.930
on the absolute core gameplay experience
that really you know captures what the

that really you know captures what the
 

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.310
that really you know captures what the
essence of the game is so you know you

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320
essence of the game is so you know you
 

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.440
essence of the game is so you know you
can download as much as you want after

the game starts running but the initial
 

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.870
the game starts running but the initial
apk that you that users download has to

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880
apk that you that users download has to
 

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:59.060
apk that you that users download has to
be under 10 Meg's so these experiences

00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.070
be under 10 Meg's so these experiences
 

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.700
be under 10 Meg's so these experiences

the platform so there's no obvious way

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:30.510
the platform so there's no obvious way
 

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:35.900
the platform so there's no obvious way
to re-engage your users so that's why we

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:35.910
to re-engage your users so that's why we
 

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.880
to re-engage your users so that's why we
kind of focus on getting the user into

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:37.890
kind of focus on getting the user into
 

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.470
kind of focus on getting the user into
instant and then as soon as they get a

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480
instant and then as soon as they get a
 

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.750

sense for the gameplay we try to drive

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760
sense for the gameplay we try to drive

them to install as quickly as possible

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.110
them to install as quickly as possible
 

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.890
them to install as quickly as possible
so you have a few other things like a

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:48.900
so you have a few other things like a
 

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.680
so you have a few other things like a
reduced set of permissions for example

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:51.690
reduced set of permissions for example
 

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.710
reduced set of permissions for example
you can't ask for you can't request

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720
you can't ask for you can't request
 

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.060
you can't ask for you can't request
external storage permissions things like

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:56.070
external storage permissions things like
 

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.940
external storage permissions things like
that you need to use HTTPS for all of

00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:58.950
that you need to use HTTPS for all of
 

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.910
that you need to use HTTPS for all of
your network calls and there's a few

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920
your network calls and there's a few
 

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.190
your network calls and there's a few
Android API s that are not available

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200
Android API s that are not available
 

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.120
Android API s that are not available
things like

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.130
things like
 

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.280
things like
you know getting persistent IDs and

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.290
you know getting persistent IDs and
 

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.340
you know getting persistent IDs and
stuff like that

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.350
 
 

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.620
 
and finally we when you build your game

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:16.630
and finally we when you build your game
 

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.450
and finally we when you build your game
you need to use a relatively recent

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:18.460
you need to use a relatively recent
 

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.460
you need to use a relatively recent
version of Gradle that supports the

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:20.470
version of Gradle that supports the
 

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:29.900
version of Gradle that supports the
instant app structures and features so

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:29.910
instant app structures and features so
 

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.320
instant app structures and features so
this is a little bit about solitaire you

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:34.330
this is a little bit about solitaire you
 

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.510
this is a little bit about solitaire you
may or may not be familiar with the

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:36.520
may or may not be familiar with the
 

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.090
may or may not be familiar with the
diagram on the side but this comes from

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:39.100
diagram on the side but this comes from
 

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.850
diagram on the side but this comes from
the Google Instant apps documentation

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:41.860
the Google Instant apps documentation
 

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.840
the Google Instant apps documentation
basically you have features which are

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:45.850
basically you have features which are
 

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.440
basically you have features which are
basically a unit of functionality or

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:49.450
basically a unit of functionality or
 

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.740
basically a unit of functionality or
gameplay and you're in your game or app

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:51.750
gameplay and you're in your game or app
 

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.030
gameplay and you're in your game or app
and then you have your instant app

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.040
and then you have your instant app
 

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.610
and then you have your instant app
module which depends on features and you

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:56.620
module which depends on features and you
 

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.829
module which depends on features and you
have your egg Euler app module so you

00:11:58.829 --> 00:11:58.839
have your egg Euler app module so you
 

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:01.430
have your egg Euler app module so you
have a unified build that can actually

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440
have a unified build that can actually
 

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.550
have a unified build that can actually
target both platforms instant and and

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560
target both platforms instant and and
 

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.960
target both platforms instant and and
installable so for solitaire we're

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:09.970
installable so for solitaire we're
 

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.570
installable so for solitaire we're
actually able to refactor the Android

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:12.580
actually able to refactor the Android
 

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.360
actually able to refactor the Android
studio project into a simplified version

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:15.370
studio project into a simplified version
 

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.290
studio project into a simplified version
of of this diagram namely we were able

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:19.300
of of this diagram namely we were able
 

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.540
of of this diagram namely we were able
to fit the entire game into just a

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:21.550
to fit the entire game into just a
 

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.050
to fit the entire game into just a
single base feature which is not not

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:25.060
single base feature which is not not
 

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.500
single base feature which is not not
typical usually well you wouldn't have

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:28.510
typical usually well you wouldn't have
 

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.800
typical usually well you wouldn't have
your full game available as an instant

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:31.810
your full game available as an instant
 

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.900
your full game available as an instant
app usually but for this one it turned

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.910
app usually but for this one it turned
 

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.600
app usually but for this one it turned
out to be so small that we could put the

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:36.610
out to be so small that we could put the
 

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.100
out to be so small that we could put the
entire thing in there so the game was

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.110
entire thing in there so the game was
 

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.019
entire thing in there so the game was
already relatively small it's just a

00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:43.029
already relatively small it's just a
 

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:46.380
already relatively small it's just a
standard solitaire game so you know we

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:46.390
standard solitaire game so you know we
 

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.930
standard solitaire game so you know we
enabled asset minification and a few

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:48.940
enabled asset minification and a few
 

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.850
enabled asset minification and a few
other settings and it fit pretty much

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:50.860
other settings and it fit pretty much
 

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.250
other settings and it fit pretty much
right into 8 megabytes so not too much

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:53.260
right into 8 megabytes so not too much
 

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.710
right into 8 megabytes so not too much
to worry about there one of the

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720
to worry about there one of the
 

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.829
to worry about there one of the
challenges that I had to overcome when

00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839
challenges that I had to overcome when
 

00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:02.940
challenges that I had to overcome when
doing this game was upgrading an older

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:02.950
doing this game was upgrading an older
 

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.510
doing this game was upgrading an older
Gradle build script actually a set of

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:06.520
Gradle build script actually a set of
 

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.550
Gradle build script actually a set of

older Gradle build scripts to the later
 

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.190
older Gradle build scripts to the later
Gradle version and I hadn't had much

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200
Gradle version and I hadn't had much
 

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.540
Gradle version and I hadn't had much
experience with Gradle before this and

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:14.550
experience with Gradle before this and
 

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.620
experience with Gradle before this and
there is a fairly large jump in

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:17.630
there is a fairly large jump in
 

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.360
there is a fairly large jump in
require changes between the two versions

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:19.370
require changes between the two versions
 

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.140
require changes between the two versions
so just getting familiar with all those

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.150
so just getting familiar with all those
 

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.910
so just getting familiar with all those
changes was really helpful in you know

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920
changes was really helpful in you know
 

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.830
changes was really helpful in you know
getting familiar with the required

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:29.840
getting familiar with the required
 

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.420
getting familiar with the required
things you have to do to make an instant

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:31.430
things you have to do to make an instant
 

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.240
things you have to do to make an instant
app and also help with our other instant

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.250
app and also help with our other instant
 

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.690
app and also help with our other instant
apps that we did after solitaire and

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:37.700
apps that we did after solitaire and
 

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.120

then when I was ready to submit to the

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.130
then when I was ready to submit to the
 

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.300
then when I was ready to submit to the
alpha track on the Play console going

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:43.310
alpha track on the Play console going
 

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.740
alpha track on the Play console going
through the process was really helpful

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:44.750
through the process was really helpful
 

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.710
through the process was really helpful
because turns out when you submit an

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720
because turns out when you submit an
 

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.820
because turns out when you submit an
instant app it'll probably tell you some

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:51.830
instant app it'll probably tell you some
 

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.500
instant app it'll probably tell you some
of the things that you might not have

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:53.510
of the things that you might not have
 

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.040
of the things that you might not have
done correctly for example supporting

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.050
done correctly for example supporting
 

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:01.570
done correctly for example supporting
Android app links and linking your your

those kind of those that whole process
 

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.930
those kind of those that whole process
understood really well was was really

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.620
 
so and then words with friends was

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:20.630
so and then words with friends was
 

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.990
so and then words with friends was
actually relatively easy which kind of

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.000
actually relatively easy which kind of
 

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.420

says a lot you know most of the work was

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:25.430
says a lot you know most of the work was
 

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.270
says a lot you know most of the work was
specific to the game into Zynga code not

runtime or Android so that was good

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:35.810
runtime or Android so that was good
 

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.630

and we didn't really have to optimize it

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:37.640
and we didn't really have to optimize it
 

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.700
and we didn't really have to optimize it
that much you know removing some

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:39.710
that much you know removing some
 

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.470
that much you know removing some
unneeded SDKs things like that and when

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480
unneeded SDKs things like that and when
 

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.990
unneeded SDKs things like that and when
when we focused on the core experience

texture atlases and game modes things
 

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.560
texture atlases and game modes things
like that and when we removed all those

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:02.570
like that and when we removed all those
 

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.480
like that and when we removed all those
things it pretty much got us within

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:04.490
things it pretty much got us within
 

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.840

this kind of summed up what we were

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:16.790
this kind of summed up what we were
 

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:21.370
this kind of summed up what we were
thinking not not not an obvious path

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.310
 
but the solution was pretty much

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320
but the solution was pretty much
 

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.160
but the solution was pretty much
the same as for other games which we

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.170
the same as for other games which we
 

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.890
the same as for other games which we
need we wanted to refocus on really the

out that we scaled down the game quite

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240
out that we scaled down the game quite
 

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.370

most of it so originally what we were
 

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.770
most of it so originally what we were
going to do was a playable race from the

00:15:59.770 --> 00:15:59.780
going to do was a playable race from the
 

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:04.240
going to do was a playable race from the
tutorial level but but we decided to

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.250
tutorial level but but we decided to
 

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.130
tutorial level but but we decided to
pare it down because it's not just about

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.140
pare it down because it's not just about
 

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.280
pare it down because it's not just about
the race it's actually what makes it fun

our grasp for the initial attempt at
 

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.610
our grasp for the initial attempt at
this and that's kind of what we focused

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:24.620
this and that's kind of what we focused
 

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.950
this and that's kind of what we focused
on

everything else from the game which was
quite a lot and we had a lot of fun

quite a lot and we had a lot of fun
 

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.600
quite a lot and we had a lot of fun
doing it as well we we had commit

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:37.610
doing it as well we we had commit
 

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.880
doing it as well we we had commit
messages that were like now down to

hundred Meg's so we had some fun with it
 

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.730
hundred Meg's so we had some fun with it
so a few other things that we had to

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:48.740
so a few other things that we had to
 

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.780
so a few other things that we had to
keep in mind so the game relied pretty

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:52.790
keep in mind so the game relied pretty
 

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.180

that the platform only supports GL ES 2
 

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.670
that the platform only supports GL ES 2
this is something we had to think about

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:05.680
this is something we had to think about
 

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.130
this is something we had to think about
we never really got around the issue

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.140
we never really got around the issue
 

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.690
we never really got around the issue
just due to lack of time and a few other

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:10.700
just due to lack of time and a few other
 

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.770
just due to lack of time and a few other
things but this was mainly a prototype

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:14.780
things but this was mainly a prototype
 

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.570
things but this was mainly a prototype
so fortunately we didn't have to really

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:16.580
so fortunately we didn't have to really
 

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.290
so fortunately we didn't have to really
worry about it

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:19.300
 
 

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.750
 
so and you know when building the game

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:22.760
so and you know when building the game
 

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.180
so and you know when building the game
unity outputs a Gradle project this

instant app is so this is something I

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:30.700
instant app is so this is something I

here we had to basically manually modify

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120
here we had to basically manually modify
 

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.920
here we had to basically manually modify
the Gradle scripts add basically

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:44.930
the Gradle scripts add basically
 

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.730
the Gradle scripts add basically
references to all of the feature targets

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:48.740

the refactoring the modules this game
was relatively involved because it used

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:54.950
was relatively involved because it used
 

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.000
was relatively involved because it used
a lot of third-party libraries a lot of

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.010
a lot of third-party libraries a lot of
 

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.760
a lot of third-party libraries a lot of
native libraries so all of that had to

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:00.770
native libraries so all of that had to
 

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:12.070
native libraries so all of that had to
be tied into the Gradle set up so let's

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080
be tied into the Gradle set up so let's
 

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.900

yeah let's talk about a few things to

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:13.910
yeah let's talk about a few things to
 

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.520
yeah let's talk about a few things to
keep in mind when you're developing your

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:15.530
keep in mind when you're developing your
 

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:20.230
keep in mind when you're developing your
own instant games so one of the most

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240
own instant games so one of the most
 

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.420
own instant games so one of the most
important things to keep in mind is to

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:22.430
important things to keep in mind is to
 

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.910
important things to keep in mind is to
keep things focused on the core of what

so if your game loads data at runtime

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:07.820
so if your game loads data at runtime

especially across both Android 7 and
Android 8 because the instant app

I'm just wondering if you can or anyone
from Google can share any like stats on

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:00.540
from Google can share any like stats on
 

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.350
from Google can share any like stats on
like how that improves their stall rate

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360
like how that improves their stall rate
 

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.430
like how that improves their stall rate
of fill funnel that is unfortunately

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440
of fill funnel that is unfortunately
 

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:25.660
of fill funnel that is unfortunately
it's the only thing I can't talk about

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:25.670
 
 

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.730
 
you can actually see you know the stats

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740
you can actually see you know the stats
 

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.580
you can actually see you know the stats
of installs from the store directly or

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:31.590
of installs from the store directly or
 

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:35.180
of installs from the store directly or
and separated from the ones through in

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:35.190
and separated from the ones through in

Google's developer Day keynote
presentation at GDC I believe they did

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:44.790
presentation at GDC I believe they did
 

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.520
presentation at GDC I believe they did
talk about that a little bit and they

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:46.530
talk about that a little bit and they
 

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.650
talk about that a little bit and they
talked about for the early launch

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:48.660
talked about for the early launch
 

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.320

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.500
 
you said you stripped out some of the

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:10.510
you said you stripped out some of the
 

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.330
you said you stripped out some of the
bug reporting architectures are you

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:12.340
bug reporting architectures are you
 

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.160
bug reporting architectures are you
still getting some bug reporting are you

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:14.170
still getting some bug reporting are you
 

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.320
still getting some bug reporting are you
still having metrics on yeah losing the

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.330
still having metrics on yeah losing the
 

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.070
still having metrics on yeah losing the
instrument yeah we left one and turns

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080
instrument yeah we left one and turns
 

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.960
instrument yeah we left one and turns
out there was more than one and are you

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:24.970
out there was more than one and are you
 

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.060
out there was more than one and are you
still able to gather metrics from like

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:27.070
still able to gather metrics from like
 

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.760

within the instant play mm-hmm yep these

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:29.770
within the instant play mm-hmm yep these
 

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:34.140

are you know they're standard or they're

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.150
are you know they're standard or they're
 

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.570
are you know they're standard or they're
pretty much just like normal apps you

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:36.580
pretty much just like normal apps you
 

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.080
pretty much just like normal apps you
can run all those libraries and get the

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.090
can run all those libraries and get the
 

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:54.120
can run all those libraries and get the
same data so my Samsung Galaxy s8

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.130
same data so my Samsung Galaxy s8
 

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.350
same data so my Samsung Galaxy s8
doesn't show the try now any idea why

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360
doesn't show the try now any idea why
 

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.950
doesn't show the try now any idea why
that might be for which game forwards

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:01.960
that might be for which game forwards
 

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.860
that might be for which game forwards
with friends - I think I know why that

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:07.870
with friends - I think I know why that
 

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:13.110
with friends - I think I know why that
is okay that's a bug that just surfaced

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120
is okay that's a bug that just surfaced
 

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.820
is okay that's a bug that just surfaced
last week but yeah it normally does so

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:17.830
last week but yeah it normally does so
 

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.800

don't need to be on the Play Store to
 

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.780
don't need to be on the Play Store to

s8 is probably eight zero zero Android
version so you need to wait for an

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320
version so you need to wait for an
 

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.800
version so you need to wait for an
update to 8 or 12 also make sure that

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:09.810
update to 8 or 12 also make sure that
 

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.950
update to 8 or 12 also make sure that
instant apps are enabled

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960
instant apps are enabled
 

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.530
instant apps are enabled
which they they should be by defaults I

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:15.540
which they they should be by defaults I
 

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:20.840
which they they should be by defaults I
think yeah so with your instant app with

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:20.850
think yeah so with your instant app with
 

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.270
think yeah so with your instant app with
unity did you actually make a separate

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:23.280
unity did you actually make a separate
 

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.130
unity did you actually make a separate
app because you're sharing the game code

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140
app because you're sharing the game code
 

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.300
app because you're sharing the game code
and that's of stuff because they were

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:26.310
and that's of stuff because they were
 

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.620
and that's of stuff because they were
talking about stripping out that many

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:27.630
talking about stripping out that many
 

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:28.820
talking about stripping out that many
libraries did you actually make a

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:28.830
libraries did you actually make a
 

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.830
libraries did you actually make a
separate app for it or did you do a

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840
separate app for it or did you do a
 

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.540
separate app for it or did you do a
subset of its it's an extreme subset

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:35.550
subset of its it's an extreme subset
 

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:39.350
subset of its it's an extreme subset
it's it's basically it's sharing the

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360
it's it's basically it's sharing the
 

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.670
it's it's basically it's sharing the
same code it's branched but you know the

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:43.680
same code it's branched but you know the
 

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.620
same code it's branched but you know the
the it outputs like a completely

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:45.630
the it outputs like a completely
 

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.450
the it outputs like a completely
separate apk okay so you use a different

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460
separate apk okay so you use a different
 

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.520
separate apk okay so you use a different
builds because I do a lot of shared

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:49.530
builds because I do a lot of shared
 

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.110
builds because I do a lot of shared
build systems that stuff is I used to

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120
build systems that stuff is I used to
 

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.760
build systems that stuff is I used to
separate build kind of flow for that

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:52.770
separate build kind of flow for that
 

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.910
separate build kind of flow for that
instant app with unity right so yeah in

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:55.920
instant app with unity right so yeah in
 

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.370
instant app with unity right so yeah in
the game we had an extremely customized

00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.380
the game we had an extremely customized
 

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.250
the game we had an extremely customized
build script and we just kind of

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260
build script and we just kind of
 

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:17.220
build script and we just kind of
extended that for the instant app target

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:17.230
 
 

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.330
 
the strength to understand the

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:18.340
the strength to understand the
 

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.340
the strength to understand the
connection between the instant app and

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.350
connection between the instant app and
 

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.200
connection between the instant app and
the app you installed later like if you

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:22.210
the app you installed later like if you
 

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:24.509
the app you installed later like if you
want to persist your data save game data

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:24.519
want to persist your data save game data
 

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:25.860
want to persist your data save game data
from one to another what are the

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:25.870
from one to another what are the
 

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:31.620
from one to another what are the
mechanisms there so on Android 8 it's

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:31.630
mechanisms there so on Android 8 it's
 

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.200
mechanisms there so on Android 8 it's
automatic it actually it shares the same

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:34.210
automatic it actually it shares the same
 

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:38.220
automatic it actually it shares the same
app container on the device so you

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:38.230
app container on the device so you
 

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.990
app container on the device so you
there's like an API called show install

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000
there's like an API called show install
 

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.180
there's like an API called show install
prompt you call that and the user clicks

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:42.190
prompt you call that and the user clicks
 

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.519
prompt you call that and the user clicks
install and the app gets the full app

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:44.529
install and the app gets the full app
 

00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:47.940
install and the app gets the full app
gets downloaded and installed and they

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:47.950
gets downloaded and installed and they
 

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.460
gets downloaded and installed and they
use whatever user data you stored in the

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:50.470
use whatever user data you stored in the
 

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.680
use whatever user data you stored in the
instant app container will be available

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:52.690
instant app container will be available
 

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.440
instant app container will be available
to the main app just as if it was put

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:55.450
to the main app just as if it was put
 

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.990
to the main app just as if it was put
there by the game itself and on Android

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000
there by the game itself and on Android
 

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.659
there by the game itself and on Android
7 I believe there's a migration API that

00:28:00.659 --> 00:28:00.669
7 I believe there's a migration API that
 

00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:05.669
7 I believe there's a migration API that
you can call okay thank you
