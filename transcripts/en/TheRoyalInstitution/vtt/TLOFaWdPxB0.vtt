00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.730
So I've come up to the
University of Leicester, and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.270
I've brought with me a tube
here containing Caesium.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.300
Caesium is found in the
far corner here.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.460
And it is the most reactive
metal in the entire periodic table

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.280
Even more reactive
than Francium.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.490
This is a radioactive element
and it decays.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.520
But actually, Caesium is more
reactive than this.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.540
It's the most reactive
thing we can find.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, why have I come
up to Leicester?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.580
I brought this because I want to
see how it reacts with the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.170
most reactive, non-metal in
the entire periodic table.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.650
And that's the element
Fluorine.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.890
And we don't think this has
ever been shown before, so

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.160
we're not entirely sure
how it's going to go.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.610
So I'm gonna go and see.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.870
Having decided that I wanted to
do this crazy reaction, I

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.030
needed to find just the right
person to handle the Fluorine.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.740
And this is Professor Eric Hope
here from the University of Leicester

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.820
So, thank you very much for
helping me out with this.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.060
-You're welcome.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.490
And what was your first
reaction, by the way, when I

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.570
said I want to try Caesium
with Fluorine?

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.090
I thought you were totally
and utterly mad.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.520
Uh huh.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.430
That's probably most
people's reaction.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.920
Now we've designed this
apparatus with

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.820
quite a lot of thought.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.480
One of the problems here
is that we want to do this at the Ri

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.810
And transporting Fluorine is
a little bit tricky, is it?

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.570
Certainly.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.090
It reacts vigorously, as we will
see, with virtually any

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.580
element in the periodic table.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.770
Eric's come up with this
fantastic idea of just filling

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.610
the coils in the apparatus, this
plastic tubing that has

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.510
been sensitised to fluorine
so it's not going

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.480
to react with it.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.230
Basically, what we have in here
is Fluorine, but at the

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.690
same pressures there is in the
atmosphere around it that

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.000
nothing's going to leak in,
nothing's going to leak out.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.440
So even if there was a major
event, then the Fluorine would

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.580
not be released from
the apparatus.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.960
To show the extreme reactivity
of Fluorine, we're going to set fire to something

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.400
We all know how hard it is to
start a barbecue using this stuff

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.280
This is charcoal, trying
to get it to burn with the oxygen from the air

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.985
I'd be easy, though, if the
atmosphere contained Fluorine.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.490
Is this your one or
is this my one?

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.450
-No that was yours, I think.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.080
OK, was it?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.430
-No.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.680
You see.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.150
OK, should we see the
reaction then?

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.400
-Let's have a go.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.690
This demonstrates the extreme
reactivity of Fluorine gas.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.510
This was a tiny quantity of
Fluorine being played onto the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.220
surface of the charcoal there.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.080
And as soon as the two came into
contact, there was this

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.700
very violent reaction, generated
a lot of heat, as

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.400
you saw the flames there.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.650
But the charcoal isn't
terribly reactive.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.180
Caesium is much more reactive.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.000
So I think we should try
this reaction now then.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.420
This is my Caesium.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.480
Have you seen Caesium before?

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.280
-No.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.410
There's quite a lot of
it, isn't there?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.820
Quite beautiful.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.720
-Beautiful, yes.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.950
And so dangerous.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.060
So this is a combination between
the two most reactive

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.676
elements in the periodic
table.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.950
We've got Fluorine, the most
reactive non-metal, and

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.519
Caesium, the most
reactive metal.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.896
Let's push them through again.

00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:47.355
-Yep.

00:03:47.355 --> 00:03:50.109
Yeah, it looks good.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.580
All right, we are
nearly ready.

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:54.715
I'll lower this.

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:56.035
-Yep, and I'll turn.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.840
You look after your pipes.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.100
Incredibly beautiful
reaction there

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.100
between Caesium and Fluorine.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.430
This intense light.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.313
And I don't think many people
have seen that before.
