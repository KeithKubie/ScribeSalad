00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.510
Let's say we've
got some function

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.259
f that is continuous over
the interval between c and d.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.550
And the reason why I'm using
c and d instead of a and b

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.370
is so I can use a
and b for later.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.890
And let's say we set up
some function capital

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.490
F of x which is
defined as the area

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.450
under the curve between
c and some value x,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.320
where x is in this interval
where f is continuous,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.980
under the curve-- so it's the
area under the curve between c

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.590
and x-- so if this is x right
over here-- under the curve

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.550
f of t dt.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.580
So this right over here,
F of x, is that area.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.130
That right over there
is what F of x is.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.150
Now, the fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.100
tells us that if f is continuous
over this interval, then F of x

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.430
is differentiable at
every x in the interval,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.370
and the derivative of capital
F of x-- and let me be clear.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.440
Capital F of x is differentiable
at every possible x

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.250
between c and d, and the
derivative of capital F

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.640
of x is going to be equal
to lowercase f of x.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.350
Fair enough.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.850
Now, what I want
to do in this video

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.190
is connect the first
fundamental theorem of calculus

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.890
to the second part, or the
second fundamental theorem

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.860
of calculus, which we tend
to use to actually evaluate

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.670
definite integrals.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:41.940
So let's think about what F of
b minus F of a is, what this is,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.290
where both b and a are
also in this interval.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.460
So F of b-- and we're going to
assume that b is larger than a.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.790
So let's say that b is
this right over here.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.380
And we'll do that
in the same color.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.810
So let's say that b
is right over here.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.005
F of b is going to be equal to--
we just literally replace the b

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:02.760
where you see the
x-- it's going to be

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.530
equal to the definite integral
between c and b of f of t dt,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.400
which is just
another way of saying

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.750
the area under the
curve between c and b.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.550
So this F of b,
capital F of b, is

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.880
all of this business
right over here.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.830
And from that, we
are going to want

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.660
to subtract capital
F of a, which

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.990
is just the integral between
c and lowercase a of lowercase

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.070
f of t dt.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.380
So let's say that this
is a right over here.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.610
Capital F of a is just
literally the area

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.370
between c and a under the
curve lowercase f of t.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.640
So it's this right over here.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.890
It's all of this
business right over here.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.840
So if you have this blue
area, which is all of this,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.000
and you subtract out
to this magenta area,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.340
what are you left with?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.810
Well, you're left with this
green area right over here.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.380
And how would we represent that?

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.790
How would we denote that?

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.420
Well, we could denote that
as the definite integral

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.540
between a and b of f of t dt.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.700
And there you have it.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.110
This right over here is the
second fundamental theorem

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.660
of calculus.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.700
It tells us that if f is
continuous on the interval,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.420
that this is going to be
equal to the antiderivative,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.070
or an antiderivative, of f.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.860
And we see right over
here that capital F

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.090
is the antiderivative of f.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.280
So we could view this as
capital F antiderivative--

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.301
this is how we defined capital
F-- the antiderivative-- or we

00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:50.550
didn't define it that way,
but the fundamental theorem

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.990
of calculus tells
us that capital F is

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.790
an antiderivative
of lowercase f.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.630
So right over here,
this tells you,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.200
if you have a definite
integral like this,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.740
it's completely equivalent to an
antiderivative of it evaluated

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.275
at b, and from that, you
subtract it evaluated at a.

00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:13.110
So normally it looks like this.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.810
I've just switched the order.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.029
The definite integral
from a to b of f of t dt

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:23.820
is equal to an antiderivative
of f, so capital F, evaluated

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.420
at b, and from that, subtract
the antiderivative evaluated

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.301
at a.

00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:33.550
And this is the second part
of the fundamental theorem

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.960
of calculus, or the
second fundamental theorem

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.850
of calculus.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.830
And it's really the core of
an integral calculus class,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.989
because it's how you actually
evaluate definite integrals.
