MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: Hi, my
name is Mikkel Rasmussen

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.200
and this is my partner,
Christian Madsbjerg.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.620
And tomorrow we are
launching a book

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.414
called "The Moment of Clarity."

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:11.580
It's a pretty exciting book.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.530
It's about people.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.030
It's about how to
understand people,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.120
how to understand
who we are as people,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.710
really understand your
customers-- not so much

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.320
what they think they want,
but what they really want.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.640
But the book is also about
how you can sometimes

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.280
get people dramatically
wrong, really misunderstand

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.250
who we are.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.460
And it happens all the time.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.930
And I would like to start with
a little story about kitchens.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.680
And most of us cook.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.860
A couple of years ago
I went to a conference

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.450
called Kitchens of the Future.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.890
It was a super
exciting conference

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.580
where people are showing lots
of new technologies coming

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.660
into the kitchen.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.740
And there was one
presenter from Ikea

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.120
together with a couple of
Japanese technology companies.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.300
And they presented this
vision of a future kitchen,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.780
I think it's supposed
to be in 2040.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.090
And if you imagine you go
into this kitchen in 2040

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.849
it's what's called
a smart kitchen.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.540
So it recognizes you, it
has face recognition, voice

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.430
recognition, there's
laser beams guiding you

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.810
to how to cut the fish.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.860
There's a fridge
with herbs in that's

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.600
grown to your health
profile that's in the cloud.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.480
And if you look up in
one of the corners,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.420
there's a little thing called
a nanobot, which is basically

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.120
a machine where you go and you
say, I would like a tiramisu,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.780
for example.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.560
And it basically,
out of nanomaterials,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.800
makes that cake for you.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.740
And I was completely
energized by this vision.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.110
I said, this is so great.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.110
There are still people
having big ideas.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.869
Until somebody
noticed that in 1956

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.910
there was a couple of
people from General Motors,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.590
actually, doing
the same exercise.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.600
But they were thinking, how
will the future kitchen look?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.430
But seen from the
perspective of 1956.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.300
That means, how will the
kitchen look in 2006?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.120
So now we can evaluate, really.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.610
So I want to pay a
little film that they

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.032
made about the kitchen
of the future in 1956.

00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:06.990
Can you play the movie?

00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:32.170
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.780
-But this was a kitchen
like none I'd seen.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.530
Put a card in the slot
and onto the screen

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.664
pops a picture of just
how your dish will

00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:42.842
look plus all the
ingredients you need to cook.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.100
No need for the
bride to feel tragic.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.080
The rest is push-button magic.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.750
So whether you bake
or broil or stew,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.410
the Fridgidaire kitchen
does it all for you.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.510
Don't have to be chained
to the stove all day.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.178
Just set the timer and
you're on your way.

00:03:04.178 --> 00:03:08.660
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.640
Tick tock, tick tock, I'm free
to have fun around the clock.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:32.564
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:35.006
Jeepers, I'm exhausted.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.870
[RINGING]

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.234
The kitchen of
tomorrow is calling me.

00:03:43.234 --> 00:03:45.575
My cake is ready.

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:55.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.820
-Time for the show.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.345
Everybody on stage.

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.470
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: I think
what's really interesting

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.490
to think about is if you look
at the core idea of the kitchen

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.900
of tomorrow as Ikea
thought about it

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.740
and this idea it's
exactly the same idea.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.970
And the idea is
cooking is slavery.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.360
Technology can free
us from making food.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.750
It can do it for us.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.410
It can recognize who we are.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.730
And simply, we don't have to
be tied to the kitchen all day,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.380
as they sing in this movie.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.460
And it's the same vision
you see again in 2006.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.550
When we imagine the
kitchen of the future

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.650
it's still a kitchen
that's automated.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.530
We don't have to think about it.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.850
And it has a lot
of technology that

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.630
actually takes the
human condition out

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.240
of the whole thing of cooking.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.750
Now if you're an
anthropologist--

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.430
we work a lot with
anthropologists--

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.110
they would tell you
that cooking is perhaps

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.870
one of the most complicated
things you can think about when

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.540
it comes to the human
condition or human behavior.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.920
That if you think about
your own cooking habits,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.370
that they probably come from
your childhood, the nation

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.870
you're from, the
region you're from.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.690
It takes a lot of skill to cook.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.460
It's not so easy.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.210
And actually, it's
quite fun to cook.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.710
There's also a lot
of improvisation.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.001
I don't know if you ever
tried to come home to a fridge

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:16.000
and you just look into
the fridge-- oh there's

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.130
a carrot and some milk
and some white wine

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.570
and you figure it out.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.900
That is what cooking is like.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.510
It's a very human thing to do.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.910
And therefore, if you think
about it, having anything

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.960
that automates this for you or
decides for you or improvises

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.750
for you is actually
not doing anything

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.980
to help you with what you want
to do, which it's nice to cook.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.330
And therefor if you
make technology,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.490
for example, that has
that core idea about who

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.540
we are as people that cooking is
slavery and the idea is wrong,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.920
then your technology will fail.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.970
Not because of the technology,
but because it simply

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.440
gets people wrong.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.120
And this happens all the time.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.800
And you cannot swing a cat
these days without hitting one

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.410
of those refrigerator companies
that make smart fridges.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.400
I don't know you've
ever seen them,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.670
like the intelligent fridge.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.270
There's so many of them
that there is actually

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.130
a website it's called fuck
your internet fridge-- I'm

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.370
sorry-- and is a guy who
every month he tracks failed

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.590
prototypes on
intelligent fridges.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.910
And here you have
April, 2011, May,

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.770
2000-- you can actually
go in today and see

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.990
are there any failed
internet fridges today?

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.560
My guess is, there probably is.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.510
Why?

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.900
Because basically, the idea
is wrong-- not the technology

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.390
but the idea about who
we are, that we do not

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.200
want the kitchen to
be automated for us.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.270
We want to cook.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.400
We want Japanese knives.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.420
We want complicated cooking.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.460
And so what we are
saying here is not

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.450
that technology
is wrong as such.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.800
It's just you need to
base it, especially

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.580
when you innovate
really big ideas,

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.050
on something that's
a true human insight.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.840
And cooking as slavery is
not a true human insight

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.380
and therefore the
prototypes will fail.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.090
There are many
interesting ways to think

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.700
about technology and cooking.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.120
For example, molecular
cooking like this,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.400
where people experiment
and broaden what cooking

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.070
is, and make it
more complicated,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.170
expands what we can
do with cooking,

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.562
as opposed to automating.

00:07:16.562 --> 00:07:19.020
So we're not saying there's
something wrong with technology

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.770
but we're saying,
sometimes it's a good thing

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.730
to understand what your core
idea about the human behavior

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.700
that you want to attack.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.820
Now, this is not
relevant all the time.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.680
This is only relevant
sometimes in a company.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.730
We have been working
with really big companies

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.780
for over the last 20 years.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.120
And sometimes
there's a situation

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.030
where things become
really uncertain.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.620
We talk about it in the
book as navigating in a fog.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.712
Here's an example-- this is
one of the biggest sports

00:07:46.712 --> 00:07:47.670
companies in the world.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.950
And I was attending
a workshop where

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.350
we talked about the future.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.900
And they were presenting sport
shoes and tennis catchers

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.407
and all kinds of technology.

00:07:55.407 --> 00:07:57.740
And all of a sudden, in the
midst of this big discussion

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:03.270
about design, product
innovation, consumers, markets,

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.780
there was a creative
director who

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.790
raised a question that made
the room go completely quiet.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.460
And the question
was, is yoga a sport?

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.390
And it's a really weird
question to ask yourself.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.670
But think about this company.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.680
This is a company--
one of the biggest

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.480
sports producers in the world.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.560
And if you work there, you
are surrounded by sport.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.444
People are doing
sports all the time.

00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:29.110
They wear sport shoes, they play
sports, they talk about sports.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.610
Even their language has sports
metaphors built into it.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.659
And the core idea behind
that type of thinking

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.830
is that sport is
really about winning.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.419
It's about athleticism.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.710
It's about winning in
the marathons and so on.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.159
And that's an idea that
this company has also when

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:50.700
they discuss in a
workshop like this.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.060
I could clearly see it.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.820
So they would take
up a shoe and say,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.545
so what should the consumer
get out of the shoe?

00:08:56.545 --> 00:08:58.420
And they would talk
about that this shoe will

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.190
make the consumer run a
marathon two minutes faster.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.820
And that's super great.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.440
I remember there was even
a swimming technology

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.440
with some stripes
on that supposedly

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.090
would make you do a crawl
a little bit faster.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.920
Things like that--
and it's great ideas

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.870
if you want to win gold medals.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.590
But what this guy
was discovering,

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.960
slowly it was dawning on
him and the [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.690
is there's something big
we are not getting right.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.750
There's something-- I
can't put my words to it,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.730
but the best way he could say it
was to provoke these gentlemen

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.950
and say, is yoga a sport.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.520
And what he was talking
about was not yoga.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.410
It was the whole
phenomenon around sport

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.560
that he was questioning.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.940
He was seeing that there are now
more fitness centers than post

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.920
offices in every
town in the world.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.270
He was seeing people
doing 24 hour bike races.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.780
He was seeing the marathon
times coming down,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.070
with one hour on average,
because everyone now

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.200
does a marathon.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.260
And he was basically seeing that
sports was being democratized.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.060
And it's not only about
winning gold medals.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.110
It's also about
slimming yourself,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.570
feeling good about yourself,
and things like that.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.140
But he had no way to
say that to the company

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.420
because he didn't really
know how to voice it.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.034
And it was such a
big problem for him

00:10:13.034 --> 00:10:14.700
that he really didn't
know how to do it.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.090
And then in this
situation-- that's

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.910
the situation
where we would say,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.780
this is the most
important point where

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.100
you need to get people right.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.265
If you get people
right on this question,

00:10:25.265 --> 00:10:27.390
you get people-- wrong,
sorry, about this question,

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.677
you get them wrong
all the way through.

00:10:29.677 --> 00:10:32.260
So if you think about your own
business-- now we are in Google

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.260
but you could think about
any other business--

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.930
and you have problems that you
deal with in your everyday,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.390
we would say there are
three types of problems.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.410
Some of them require that
you get people right--

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.630
you're really strong in
that-- and some of them

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.990
require that you can
just use your intuition,

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.430
especially if you're really
familiar with the problem.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.430
So if you look at the
three types of problems,

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.365
we can start in the
bottom and say, there

00:10:52.365 --> 00:10:54.860
are problems where it's
not really so uncertain.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.800
We've tried it before.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.034
We are pretty predictable.

00:10:57.034 --> 00:10:58.200
And those are called knowns.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.160
You can basically put an
algorithm to those problems--

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.540
things like, if we put
money from this channel

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.220
to that channel we'll
sell this much more.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.740
And that's something
you can just

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.470
use an MBA kind
of thinking to do.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.020
They're good tools
and good methods

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.110
and you don't have to get
people so right, really.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.210
You can base your decisions
on assumptions about people.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.000
Then it becomes a little more
difficult, more unpredictable,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and you go to what we
call hypotheticals.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.190
And those are you know
what the problem is

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.820
but there are various ways that
you could solve the problem.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.740
For example, we are
putting more money into R&amp;D

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.710
but we're not selling more.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:39.565
Why is that?

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:43.200
And there could be
various reasons for that.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.700
Also here there are some
good tools and methods

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.300
that you can use from a
business school, for example,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.360
calculating your way
through it, figuring out

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.010
how big are things and so on.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.150
And then we get to
the yoga question.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.020
Is yoga a sport?

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.950
That's not a known and
it's not a hypothetical.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.610
It's what we call a
big unknown, that it's

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.810
something big you're
uncertain about.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.890
And this is the point
when you don't even

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.200
know what the answer is and
you've never solved it before.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.130
And in the case of
the sports company,

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.690
this was the situation.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.480
That to deal with
this problem they just

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.730
couldn't calculate their
way through the problem.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:22.100
They had to figure out well,
how is sports changing as such?

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.620
When you're in this
situation there's something

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.260
happen that we have seen in
a lot of businesses, which

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.920
is that we have
assumptions about people

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.890
that we're nearly born
with or we learn somehow

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.590
and they're really
difficult to take off.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.010
And one of the biggest
assumptions about people

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.300
is this-- sorry,
I'll just go on--

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.960
that we can be understood
as the smallest substances,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.940
like atoms.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.810
So here's a physician
that once said,

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:55.320
"Everything is made of atoms,
there's nothing living that you

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.860
cannot understand from the
point of view that they are made

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.910
of atoms according to
the laws of physics."

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.496
And I just have to say, really?

00:13:03.496 --> 00:13:05.750
Are we sure about that?

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.460
If you take your own company I
could provoke you a little bit

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.680
and say, could you take
this quote and put bits in?

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.210
Everything is made of bits.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.370
There's nothing living that
you cannot understand from

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.390
the point of view of a
bit or a calculation.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.660
And there's nothing wrong with
thinking this way if you're

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.590
familiar with what you're doing.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.300
It's by far the most efficient
way to think about people,

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.960
that we are basically
atoms and you

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.470
can reduce people to
the smallest substance

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.380
and then understand
the totality from that.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.890
But when you're in a big
unknown this is toxic.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.500
Because what will happen is that
you get people completely wrong

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.280
and then your ideas will
end up as smart fridges

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.465
that nobody wants, nobody
buys, and nobody uses.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.780
Now we have seen that there is
many assumptions about people.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.700
There are five I just
want to talk about

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.700
and then I'm going
to hand it over

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.491
to Christian who will
give you a little bit

00:14:01.491 --> 00:14:03.560
of a philosophical
background before this.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.110
And then we will
give you an idea

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.119
of how to get out of this mess.

00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:08.410
But there are five assumptions.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.680
So think about when you
talk about users, consumers,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.910
customers, what are
you talking about?

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.846
Very often there's an
idea that human beings

00:14:18.846 --> 00:14:20.740
are first and foremost
thinking beings.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.572
That means you can understand
people by scanning their brain.

00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:25.780
That's one very, very common
assumption about people,

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.060
that everything there is to
know about you is in your brain.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.332
Another assumption is
you know what you want.

00:14:32.332 --> 00:14:33.650
You know your intentions.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.700
That means you can go
and ask a consumer,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.020
so would you like
this in red or green?

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.042
And they would actually know.

00:14:41.042 --> 00:14:44.330
A third assumption
is that consumers--

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.970
they're all about
options and choices.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.770
So what you study is,
how do you make choices?

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.520
So when you go out
down to the supermarket

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.922
and you want to
buy a juice, do you

00:14:52.922 --> 00:14:54.296
want the juice
with the things in

00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:56.170
or the juice without
the little things in.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.878
And that's the very,
very important thing

00:14:57.878 --> 00:14:59.330
about consumers.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.950
The fourth thing that's
toxic is the assumption

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.190
that your consumers, your
customers, your users

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.800
actually know what they want.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.240
So you actually become
a slave to their needs.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.350
You just ask them,
what do you want?

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.310
Oh, I want a red car.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.730
Hey, let's produce a red
car-- that kind of thinking.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.680
And the fifth one
is that people--

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.240
because you can understand
them from their brain

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.410
and have access to
their inner minds--

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.700
that they are the
same, regardless which

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.830
social situation
or mood they're in.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.525
These five assumptions--
you may think

00:15:33.525 --> 00:15:35.910
that this is pretty
banal or stupid

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.760
or something like that--
but these assumptions

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.580
are at the core of many,
many business decisions

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.750
every single day that we make.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.210
When we ask people in a focus
group to evaluate a product,

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.840
for example, it's based
on these assumptions.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.860
When we go and scan
people's brains

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.610
to figure out whether they like
the red logo or the green logo,

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.280
it's based on these assumptions.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.600
When we ask people,
can you just evaluate

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.280
what you want on a survey?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.845
It's based on these assumptions.

00:16:03.845 --> 00:16:05.470
And I would even have
to say, sometimes

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.600
when we do these
big data analyses,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.120
it's based on these
assumptions, that you

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.140
can take people and pull
them down to what they need

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.810
to put it together
to a bigger question

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.100
and then here you have the
understanding of people.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.370
Now this plays out in
many interesting places.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.700
And here's an example
of what can happen.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.330
So in many companies
what they do is

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.670
they do these big surveys about
what people need and then they

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.570
try to data analyze
their way through this.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.154
And they end up with
what's called segments.

00:16:36.154 --> 00:16:37.070
And here's an example.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.860
This is actually a
spirits producer.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.650
They get us drunk.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.060
That's what they do.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.220
And they looked at the
Asian market and women.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.005
And they did a
huge data analysis

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:48.380
to figure out how many women
there are, how old are they,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.130
what do they need.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.490
They did surveys, focus
groups, everything,

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.370
and boiled it down to
four types of people.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.440
I'm not going to go
through all of them.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.694
But one of them was called
the modern life seeker.

00:16:57.694 --> 00:16:59.610
And they figured out
those were the people who

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.870
had the most money, who
loved to drink the most,

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.730
and who we wanted to go for.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.780
And we were asked to go
out in the supermarket

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.280
and help them identify these
people to study them further,

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.800
get deep inside
into who they were.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.798
But we didn't
understand-- my mom,

00:17:16.798 --> 00:17:18.089
she's not a modern life seeker.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:18.589
I know that.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:19.700
And my sister is not.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.819
And my daughter is not.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:24.000
I just couldn't figure out,
what is a modern life seeker?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.900
And we went out to the
supermarket in Bangkok.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.880
And in this supermarket--
it's the biggest

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.611
in the world-- it's the most
instagramed, sorry, shopping

00:17:31.611 --> 00:17:32.360
mall in the world.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.610
There are thick women and thin
women, clever, smart, dumb--

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.570
there are all types of women.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.780
And we asked, could you point
out the modern life seeker?

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.880
And they kind of started
sweating and said,

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.700
she's not here.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.320
And you know why she's not here?

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.630
Because she does not exist.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.070
Why does she not exist?

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.760
Because it's based on wrong
assumptions on who we are.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.610
And it becomes a tool where
you as a company can say,

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.190
oh our consumers are
out here in a nice model

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.280
and we don't really
have to be part of that.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.340
We can just analyze them and
tell them what they want.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.307
And there are many other
examples of this going on.

00:18:09.307 --> 00:18:10.640
Maybe you should take over here.

00:18:12.802 --> 00:18:14.260
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
So what we see

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.230
is the same research project
in many different ways.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.260
So the research
project is basically,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.180
as we try to write in the
book, a Cartesian-- a Rene

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.770
Descartes-inspired project.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.410
Which is that we have
access to our inner states.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.230
We can see what
we want and need.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.900
And the mind is us.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.770
And the mind is the
brain-- so a set

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.320
of reductions about who we are.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.649
And if we look at the
world it's different.

00:18:41.649 --> 00:18:43.440
And we'll show you a
little bit about that.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.340
But there's a couple of baseline
things we see all the time.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.730
The first one is that you can
get it down to algorithms.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:55.530
You can create systems
for understanding the data

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.350
that people generate
in their activity.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.040
And if you take me-- where
I work, what I click on,

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.670
where I'm with my phone, where
I drive, and so on-- that's me.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.160
That's a very good
picture of who

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.510
I am and the kinds
of decisions I make.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.170
The second one is
atomized, that you

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.750
can think of people as
self-contained entities,

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.490
that we are basically
individual subjects that

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.220
stand against objects
and give meaning

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.080
to the world in that way.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.220
And the last thing is
that we're rational.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.460
Everybody knows that we're
not rational all the time.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.221
But it's something-- and
there's been economists

00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:33.470
that go a little further and
say that irrational might

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.130
be a category we
could use as well.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.580
But basically, it's the
rational irrational model.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.300
And we think that's wrong.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.930
And I'll show you a picture here
to explain what it is we mean.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:48.770
This is a picture from a project
by a guy called Paul Radcliff.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.790
And he asked people to take
pictures of the best moment

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.180
in a week, the time in
the week that was best.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.259
And it's this lady-- she
sends a picture of umbrellas.

00:19:59.259 --> 00:20:00.800
And I think you know
this kind of day

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.164
in New York City where
it's soaking wet.

00:20:05.164 --> 00:20:07.075
And she lost her
crappy umbrella.

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:09.630
Her umbrella was
destroyed by wind.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.404
And she tried to trash it.

00:20:11.404 --> 00:20:12.820
And when she tried
to trash it she

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.060
saw that that happened
to others as well.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:20.290
Which meant that the most
absurdly annoying situation

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.150
of getting completely soaked
and losing your umbrella

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.580
became delightful
because it was funny.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.190
It's funny that other people
were in the same situation.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.720
And I think you can also imagine
what that situation is like

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.420
because you've been there.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.620
So you're connected to
humanity in a bigger

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.286
way than just
rational processes.

00:20:39.286 --> 00:20:40.910
You're connected to
humanity in the way

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.440
that we understand each other.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.060
I was at an art
museum in Los Angeles

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.290
not long ago when
I met this guy that

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.120
was sitting on a bench crying.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:58.326
And he looked at a big Syrian
tapestry from the 1600.

00:20:58.326 --> 00:20:59.950
And I asked him, so
why are you crying?

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.740
And he said, because I
don't feel lonely anymore.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.900
I feel that somebody, in a place
I don't know, 400 years ago,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.720
felt exactly the same as me.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.360
So the picture was
about paradise.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.930
And he'd just lost his mother.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.780
And he was thinking,
where is she?

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.240
What's going to happen to her?

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.590
And somebody in a place
completely distant,

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.806
400 years ago, had the
exact same feelings as him.

00:21:21.806 --> 00:21:23.430
So he felt connected
to humanity and he

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.120
didn't feel atomized anymore.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.950
He felt connected to something.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.790
And that's a fairly deep
insight, if you think about it.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:36.050
It is that we are, first and
foremost, not thinking things.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.530
We're social things.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.420
We're geared into worlds, and
if you strip us of our world,

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.120
we make no sense at all.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.790
We're not interesting at all.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.620
It is how we are in the
world that is meaningful.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.190
And we navigate our world
through familiarity.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.840
You know this, I
guess, when you go

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.600
to a city you've
never been to before.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.950
Everything looks new.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.862
Right now the street
you go down looks

00:21:59.862 --> 00:22:02.320
like the street to the baker
or to the cleaner or something

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.100
like that, because you're so
familiar with your own city.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.000
But when you move to someplace--
I moved to New York City

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.950
from Denmark five years ago.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.190
And it's only now I understand
how extremely Danish I am.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.734
When I lived in Denmark
I didn't see it at all.

00:22:17.734 --> 00:22:19.150
It wasn't at the
forefront for me.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.165
I couldn't see it.

00:22:20.165 --> 00:22:22.290
In the same way, when you
stand in line for coffee,

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.460
it's only when somebody
breaks the rules

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.730
of standing in line that you
understand that there are rules

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.650
for standing in line, right?

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.360
So our familiarity
with the world

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.390
is how we find our way around.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:37.060
And that whole layer
is not in the data

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.650
normally-- the understanding
of how we act upon the world

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.052
and how we make sense of it.

00:22:43.052 --> 00:22:44.510
In the philosophical
tradition they

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.650
call that understanding,
as opposed to knowledge.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.990
Knowledge is data
in the way that you

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.730
have a fair bit of data.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.660
But understanding is
how you interpret that.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.300
In the philosophical
tradition there's

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.060
also been the
debate about how do

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.300
you make sense of lots of data.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.020
And Francis Bacon,
400-ish years ago,

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.400
said that the conclusions will
fall out of the data itself.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.560
If you look to the
big data people,

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.739
they will often say that we
don't need theory anymore.

00:23:14.739 --> 00:23:16.280
We don't need
interpretation anymore.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.535
Because we have so
much data now that it

00:23:18.535 --> 00:23:20.786
will conclude by itself, OK?

00:23:20.786 --> 00:23:23.330
If this is true,
you can't do that.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.520
You do it based on something.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.160
And it's only when you don't
have familiarity with something

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.890
that you need this kind of
analysis that we are proposing.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:37.080
We basically are in
the world already.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.200
We're always already
in the world,

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.720
and we're always already
making sense of it

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.060
before it even happens.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:47.110
So we know that's a chair
without taking our subjectivity

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.350
and looking at the object
and then seeing what it is.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.550
We just know it's a chair.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.049
And we're very
familiar with chairs.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.870
So what we say that there
are three building blocks

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.376
you need in order to
be in situations where

00:24:01.376 --> 00:24:03.750
the business doesn't work,
where you're not making sense.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:09.820
So if you systematically launch
products that gain 1% to 2%

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.080
market share, you might
want to think about it.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.350
So the first thing is
a humanized mindset.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.030
So, a mindset about
humanity that's

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.970
different than the rational one.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.410
The second one is what
we call thick data, which

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.492
is data about our
familiarity with the world.

00:24:25.492 --> 00:24:26.950
And the third thing
is what we call

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.230
non-linear problem solving.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.510
And I'll give you a
couple of examples fast.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.920
The first one is we
say, the differences.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.880
There's a big difference
between properties

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.900
about something and
aspects about something.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.869
The property of a woman
is that she's a woman.

00:24:42.869 --> 00:24:43.910
You can say it like that.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:44.660
It's biological.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.493
It's pretty clear that
you can analyze that.

00:24:46.493 --> 00:24:49.400
You can use natural science
methods to see that.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.170
The aspects about whether she's
feminine or not is an aspect.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.460
It's a human thing.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.800
It's layered into our
familiarity with the world.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.620
And what we are proposing
is that lots of people

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.890
miss the aspects by only
focusing on the properties.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.300
And that's what you get
when you use natural science

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.870
methods understanding humanity.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.150
Thick data is trying to analyze
what does something mean?

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.290
How are things layered
into our behavior?

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.690
So for instance,
if you go to a bar,

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:25.230
and you see an attractive person
winking to you at the bar,

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.990
you would know within a second,
without even thinking about it,

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:34.650
whether it's suggestive, ironic,
critical-- whatever kind of all

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.070
the options a small movement
with the eye can be.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.170
Understanding that and the
understanding of how you easy

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.285
gauge whether that wink is
suggestive or not-- means,

00:25:44.285 --> 00:25:48.970
let's leave together or not--
is important for your success

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.410
at that situation.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.540
And it's something
you all know but it's

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.140
hard to analyze unless
you get thick data.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.980
And the way we do
that is we import it

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.930
from the human sciences.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.030
So that is sociology,
anthropology, and so on,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.300
that have methods
in order to do this.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.190
And it analyzes what's below
the threshold of awareness.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.740
Now Mikkel told you
before about sports.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.470
At the time, when we're
talking about this company that

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.710
is in the sports
industry, they called

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.620
fitness "sports preparation."

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.910
If think about that for
a moment the reason why

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:23.570
it's called sports
preparation is, of course,

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:25.520
that you prepare yourself
to win gold medals.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.580
The only reason for
going to the gym

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.590
or doing yoga or anything
like that could only

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.200
be-- if you are in the mindset
that sports is about winning--

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.640
is to prepare yourself
for something real,

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.020
instead of just
going to the gym.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.720
And what we found when
we looked at these things

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.120
was we found what
in this case we

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.990
call it the little
black dress phenomenon.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:48.830
But it was basically a fitness
measurement tool for women

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:54.610
that we found across
generations, across geography,

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:59.110
which was a dress that was
a little bit too small.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.820
So it was an
ambition, and it was

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.260
layered into-- the
whole reason they

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.259
did what they did was
embodied in that dress.

00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:08.425
And that's the kind of data
that we call thick data.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.860
It's not the kind of data I
guess you work with the most,

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.450
and we're not saying that
that's in any way wrong,

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.910
we're just saying this is
another type of data that

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.850
can be very helpful if you don't
have familiarity with an area.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.540
So what we call
default thinking,

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:34.980
hypothesis-based inquiry,
answers what and how much,

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.115
research on what is and has
been or is happening right now--

00:27:39.115 --> 00:27:41.240
and what we're saying is
that there's another type.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.540
And we call it sense
making in the book.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.870
It's an exploratory inquiry.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.800
You're not basing
yourself on-- you're not

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.640
trying to test a hypothesis.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.650
You are trying to cast
a net and understand

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.200
patterns of behavior.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.470
And in the bottom you
can see the difference

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.370
between correctness and truth.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.950
This is a classic Martin
Heidegger distinction.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.200
It's that there's lots of
things that are correct

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.990
but that isn't true.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.070
So for instance, if
I ask my daughter,

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:14.630
could you please put
six plates on the table,

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.630
she would go and put
six plates on the table.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.879
And I'll come in and
they're all in a stack.

00:28:18.879 --> 00:28:20.670
And I'll say, well
that's not what I meant.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:24.210
I meant around the table with
forks and knives and stuff.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.755
And she will say, well six.

00:28:26.755 --> 00:28:27.880
So it's completely correct.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.120
There are six
plates on the table.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.780
But that's not the
truth about how

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.120
you eat together in a sense.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.790
And what we're
trying to get to say

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.740
is that there is a
method for getting

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:44.057
to that shared, common
humanity truth about us.

00:28:44.057 --> 00:28:45.140
You want to say something?

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.320
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: Yes.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.270
And I just want to show you how
one company works with this.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.070
It's a company that
many of you know well.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.290
It's Lego.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:57.740
And many years ago
they were in trouble

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.770
because they were losing money.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.800
But also they were
expanding into territories

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.810
that they didn't know so well.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.130
And somehow they
got people wrong.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.880
At that time, when
we met Lego, they

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.160
had some pretty
strong assumptions

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.240
about what's going
to happen to play.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.280
And one of them is, we're
to die because PlayStation

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.840
is going to take it all.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.910
Another one was a phenomenon
called instant traction.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.400
Have you heard about this?

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.310
The idea is that kids these
days-- they have no attention,

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.240
you can't get them
to do anything.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.630
So when you go into
a toy store, the toy

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.760
needs to be very noisy and
very easy to play with,

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.970
because that's the only way
you can get their attention.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.410
They also had a
creativity idea which

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.730
was called crisp, cool, wow.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.379
And that was, anything
was evaluated on

00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:47.920
is it crisp, is it
cool, or is what--

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.450
nobody knew what it meant.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:51.980
Is it crisp, cool, or wow.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.960
So that means you
can just do anything.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.460
That boys wanted evil-- so you
can see when they did Bionicle

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:02.460
that there's dark and
red and blood and death.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.990
And that girls
wanted pink-- and you

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:08.620
can see that it's pink princess,
everything was pink, and so on.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.340
And basically they assumed
that because of this the brick

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.970
has no future.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.280
We have to head in
another direction.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.010
And they did that by launching
a lot of new innovations

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.100
that was beyond the
brick-- software

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.810
and toothbrushes and violent
toys and all kinds of things.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:30.120
And it basically got
them into trouble.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.190
They got a new CEO
who at one point

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.470
said, I think we
need to understand,

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.740
before we take any
decisions, why do kids plays

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.720
and what role do
we play in that?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.600
And the first step in getting
the human condition right,

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.150
like Christian
was talking about,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.290
is not really doing
any research or meeting

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.930
any consumers or
anything like that.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.710
It's looking at the
assumptions you have

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.800
and trying to
change the question.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.657
We talk about this as framing
your problem as a phenomena.

00:31:00.657 --> 00:31:02.490
And that's a very
academic way of saying it.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:06.920
A simpler way is, try to ask
your business question in a way

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.460
that a person can experience.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.240
So for example, the big business
question for Lego at that point

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.320
was, how can we sell more toys?

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.140
It's a very natural,
very good question.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.960
It's just that it's not
something anybody experiences.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.500
And what they did is change that
around to a question which was,

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.670
why do kids play?

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.740
It's a very simple little
trick but it does wonder.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:35.560
Because you start looking
at very different behaviors

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.634
when you look at
why do kids play.

00:31:37.634 --> 00:31:39.800
It's actually a little
tricky, if you look at a kid,

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.984
why do they play?

00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:42.400
Jesus, I don't
know why they play.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.580
They just do it.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.140
Yeah, but why do they play?

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:51.130
And what Lego did was they spent
half a year going out to kids,

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.340
living with kids, observing
kids, figuring out

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.600
what's their world like,
figuring out parents, figuring

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.900
out how school works,
and trying to go down

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.690
to that thick data that
could reveal why do kids play

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:09.870
and then try to make sense of
that to find their own future.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.080
Now this was a really
interesting experience

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.980
and lots of interesting stories.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.010
Here's one of them.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:21.260
This is a shoe worn by a
boy in Germany, I believe.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:27.620
And the shoe is 1,000 times more
worth for him than a new shoe.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.430
And we asked him why.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:33.070
And he says, because it's
worn in the right places it

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.380
shows that I can
do a kick flipper.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.430
This shoes is worn
in the right places

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.350
because he has tried
a million times

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:43.100
to do the trick on the
skateboard that makes him stand

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.200
out in the hierarchy
among his friends.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.240
And if you look
at that, it really

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.580
means that he does not
suffer from attention span

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.510
or loss of mastery or
de-skilling or anything

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.290
like that.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:59.350
This kid is deeply
into one thing

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:02.690
and he does it everyday for
hours and hours and hours

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.300
and hours.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.160
And what Lego found
was all the kids

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.910
that they met had this
deep mastery of something.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:16.160
They met one little guy who
knew everything about sharks.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.130
So he was building
a shark in Lego

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.844
and they asked him so what
shark is the one with 23 teeth?

00:33:21.844 --> 00:33:23.510
Because there's one
shark that has that.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.340
And he knew the whole
history of sharks.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.640
Now they also found
another interesting thing,

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.250
which was that a lot of kids,
when you play with them--

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:42.810
not talk to them-- they reveal
a big world of inside knowledge

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.930
that we don't know as adults.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.259
We call it under the radar.

00:33:46.259 --> 00:33:47.300
We don't know it's there.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.440
So here's an example.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.010
It's a German boy who Lego met.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:59.030
And his mum told them that this
boy was really bad at maths.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:03.910
He was not good at school,
probably had ADHD, and so on.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.010
And she was kind of
worried about him.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:10.129
And to show that, she
had given him a trumpet.

00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:11.920
Do you think he was
playing on the trumpet?

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.429
Not really.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:14.350
But what he was doing
was he was doing

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.100
something called
fantasy football.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.190
And we observed that.

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.860
And he was sitting with
a big piece of paper.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.714
And then he was in like
soccer-- so he's going

00:34:24.714 --> 00:34:26.790
and Luftkicker was going--
and he was coming up

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.909
with these imaginary football
teams, imaginary players.

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:31.760
And then he would
make a statistic,

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.320
after 90 minutes of playing
the game, about who won.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.630
But not only that, he would
also make probabilities of,

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:43.380
if you put your money on
Luftkicker against Litana,

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.560
it's probably a nine to one.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.509
So here's a kid where his
mom and probably his school

00:34:48.509 --> 00:34:51.100
and all the psychologists
in the world would say,

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.090
he suffers from attention span.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.960
He's not good at math.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.860
We're worried about him.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.060
But what LEGO discovered
was that behind all that,

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.140
there was a kid who had so much
talent and so much mastery.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.080
It's just nobody was seeing it.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:14.310
They took this insight
and really thought about,

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.190
what does it mean for us.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.460
And basically they
saw three big things.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:24.020
One was kids have mastery
and they strive for mastery.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.880
Anything that's difficult
and complex and deep

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.950
is great for kids.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.940
The other thing--
this was the thing

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.600
with the shoe and
the skateboard--

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.100
is that a lot of kids these
days are looking for hierarchy.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.970
I'm meaning, if you
ask any kid, so who's

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.500
best at maths in your class?

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.820
She will say, oh that's Jim.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.050
And who's number 17?

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.640
That's Jack.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.590
Ask any European kid,
so which Italian player

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.250
scored the most goals
three years ago?

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.790
They'd know.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:56.650
And so we found hierarchies
everywhere, everywhere.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.880
So mastery and hierarchy.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.160
And the last thing
was the sensation

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:09.610
of building something big
and complex and challenging.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.200
If you looked at
those three things

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.460
and just think about-- we're
moving into girls' toys,

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.370
we're moving into toothbrushes,
violent toys, stories

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:22.300
with a lot of storytelling,
and we're move ourselves away

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.590
from the core experience
of building something,

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.070
creating something.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.530
And you look at the three
things that kids really

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:34.250
need, which is-- mastery,
hierarchy, and challenges.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.960
LEGO found, but maybe the
answer is just right here

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.850
in front of us and
it's called a brick.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.250
Because a brick can
give you mastery.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.840
A brick can give you hierarchy
if you've built something

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.380
and show other people.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.890
And a brick can give
you a challenge.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:53.370
And if there was a way we
could put that idea into all

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.890
of the things we're
doing, all the innovations

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.400
we're coming up with, all the
products we're coming up with,

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.410
the way our shops look, the
way our digital tools are going

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:06.700
to look-- and they took
that very idea of back

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:10.440
to the brick and mastery,
hierarchy, and challenges

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.640
and put it into
their core offerings.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.770
So they created tools where
kids could design their own LEGO

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.020
and get it printed, basically.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.920
They created LEGO games that
gave you skill and hierarchy

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.400
and they went into the digital
universe with a much bigger

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.780
precision than
they could before.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.920
And if you ask the CEO,
he says today they're

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.020
number two toy
company in the world.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.510
They're really profitable
and successful.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.460
And not only because
of that but also

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.345
because of that-- if you
ask him, he would say,

00:37:42.345 --> 00:37:43.470
well there are two reasons.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:47.010
One is that we basically did
the hygiene on the company

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.751
and we now have
cost control and we

00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:50.000
know where we're making money.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.541
And all that you
can learn in am MBA.

00:37:51.541 --> 00:37:53.290
So that was one thing.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.030
And the other thing
was that now we

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.780
understand why kids
play-- hierarchy,

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.810
mastery, and challenges.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.720
And we can put that
into everything we do.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.610
OK, so that's the story
about how to do that.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.840
And in this book we say there
is a generic method behind this

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.730
that any company could
learn, any company can do,

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:16.560
if you do it right.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.360
If you start by framing your
question as a phenomenon,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.500
then you dig into
how people really

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.850
are, how they really live, and
get a thick understand of that.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:26.674
Then you find the
patterns in that and say,

00:38:26.674 --> 00:38:28.090
what are the
interesting patterns?

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.530
Then you say, what are the
consequences for our business?

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:32.450
And then you frame
that as an idea that

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.070
can create impact
for your business.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:36.337
That's basically the
simple way of doing it.

00:38:36.337 --> 00:38:37.420
It's really simple to say.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.060
It's not so easy to do.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:43.680
But it is simple to say,
because I just did it.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.330
OK so really what
we are saying is,

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:50.980
we think that in an age
of a lot of big data

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.730
and a lot of rational
thinking, there

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:57.800
is a need also for getting
a little bit of humanity

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.010
into business again.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.060
And there is a science
of understanding people.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.660
It's called human science,
anthropology, social science,

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.750
political science,
parts of economics,

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:13.180
literature, linguistics--
that has 100 to 200 years'

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.760
tradition of
understanding people.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.740
And all they're
really saying is,

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:20.170
there is something about us
that's not on the surface,

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.010
they can only be
discovered if we reveal it.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:26.150
And I think that one of the most
emotional moments of mine when

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:28.590
I wrote this book was when
I was listening to a song--

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:31.310
I write and listen to
songs at the same time--

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:35.060
and there was a song
by Tom Waits which

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.040
is called "San Diego
Serenade," and he

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:43.920
sings about how he
never saw the morning

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.650
until he stayed up all night.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.050
And I can remember
that from when

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.620
I was a teenager, the first
time I went out to a party

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.930
and came home and the bird were
singing, it was in the summer,

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:55.350
and I could just
feel the sensation

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.330
of what a morning really is.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.330
I never saw that before.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:39:59.788
And that's what
he's singing about.

00:39:59.788 --> 00:40:01.550
He sings about, I
never saw the sunshine

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.700
until you turned out the light.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.310
He says, I never
saw my home town

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.300
until I stayed away too long.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:11.020
And then he's saying,
I never heard a melody

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.390
until I needed a song.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.500
And that's the
very simple message

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.930
that we have for you
guys, that there is a way

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:21.800
to get both the top layers
of our experience as humans

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.630
but also get to
the deeper layers.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.100
And both are needed
in the future.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.166
Thanks a lot.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.310
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
What do you do now?

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:39.980
Any questions?

00:40:42.694 --> 00:40:43.860
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.710
Hi, thanks for joining us.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.530
Can you talk a
little bit about how

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:51.120
you identify the
right question to ask?

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.230
So sort of the process
of getting to the why

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.806
do kids play-- what's that like?

00:40:56.806 --> 00:40:59.180
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: See, this
is a really good question.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.560
And it's interesting because we
got that question a few times

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.490
before.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:07.060
And the literature
doesn't reveal anything.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.506
So our main inspirations,
which are German philosophers

00:41:10.506 --> 00:41:12.130
basically-- so Martin
Heidegger-- later

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:17.240
on French philosophers,
have no method to this.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.750
The way we do that is
we turn it into a verb.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.420
So we say, what's
the main, most banal,

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.240
we call average, everyday
experience that people

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.370
have here.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:32.850
And then say, what
might that be like?

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:36.030
So we say, what's the average,
everyday practice that people

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:40.835
have, and are there
interesting and juicy questions

00:41:40.835 --> 00:41:43.210
that once you think about it--
once you think about play,

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:45.170
I mean, I know kids play.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.850
But I don't really know why.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:49.280
And if we don't know
why, how can we ever,

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.280
ever produce toys that
are helpful in that case?

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.080
Why do people work out?

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.990
So it's so dumb and average,
everyday and intuitive

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.709
that people, in the beginning,
feel, well what does mean?

00:42:06.709 --> 00:42:08.750
And the way that the
traditional talks about this

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.195
is as a phenomenon.

00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:12.710
That's also why the
philosophy behind this

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.140
is called phenomenology.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.690
So it's-- what's the human
phenomenon that we can all

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:21.540
share and all experience and
that's so close to us that we

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.230
never see it.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:24.880
It's like wearing glasses--
maybe not Google Glasses,

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:32.410
but any old glasses-- that
you don't think much about.

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:35.430
So like I said before,
when you go out

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.870
to what is called a
mini kitchen-- which

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:41.880
is a fairly large kitchen--
but if you go out there

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.530
and there are many people
around the coffee machine,

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:45.920
there would be a line.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.860
There's somebody that's
next to get coffee.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.260
But you only see that
once somebody breaks it.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:57.140
So other than that, it just
works as our everyday dealings

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.480
in the world.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.750
And that's exactly what
we're interested in.

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.700
So we're interested in the
things that are so everyday

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.400
that we don't see them.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.480
And there's a German
filmmaker called

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.566
Wim Wenders that made a movie
called, "Far away So Close."

00:43:17.566 --> 00:43:18.690
And that's the whole point.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:22.897
It's so close to us
that it's far away.

00:43:22.897 --> 00:43:24.980
And it's because we can't
think about those things

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.550
all the time.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:27.425
You can't think about
how do I stand in line?

00:43:27.425 --> 00:43:28.095
You just do it.

00:43:28.095 --> 00:43:31.087
Or how do you drive a car--
if you move to New York City--

00:43:31.087 --> 00:43:32.670
I moved to New York
City and I'm still

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.270
trying to figure out
how traffic works here.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.872
People speed up at the
wrong times and break at--

00:43:37.872 --> 00:43:39.080
and they get annoyed with me.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.350
I don't know why they
get annoyed with me.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:44.560
A space between two
cars is an opportunity

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.145
to get ahead and get to the
red light as fast as possible.

00:43:48.145 --> 00:43:49.270
AUDIENCE: Just don't drive.

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:50.478
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Exactly.

00:43:50.478 --> 00:43:51.210
Exactly.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.200
So places have styles.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.810
And I guess, in a
couple of years,

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.320
I might figure
out how it works .

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.360
And I'll start get
annoyed with people

00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.640
when they break those laws.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.300
But I don't think
any of the people

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.860
in the system would
ever think about,

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.780
what's the style of
driving in New York City.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.820
It's just what happens, right?

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.490
And that's exactly
the object of study.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.150
So we study familiarity, how
we are familiar with things.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.540
And familiarity withdrawals.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.230
In the sense, the classic
example is a hammer.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.800
Hammering-- the
last thing you want

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.870
to do when you hammer
is think about it.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:28.970
You want to be-- you will
hit your hand and so on.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.840
And that is when hammers
are most hammers,

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.940
is when they are engaged with
skillful people using it.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.590
That's when hammers
reveal themselves.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:38.430
You can also look at
the properties and say,

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.321
it has a wooden shank and
a metal blob at the end

00:44:41.321 --> 00:44:41.820
and so on.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.250
You can decode it from a
natural science perspective,

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.990
how much it weighs and so on.

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:49.980
But it doesn't weight anything,
except if it's too heavy.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.850
It's just perfect
when you use it.

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:56.920
In that sense, the hammer
withdraws from our experience.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.920
And hammering becomes the
experience, in a sense, right?

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.200
Does that answer the question?

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.500
OK, good.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.496
So again, familiarity.

00:45:04.496 --> 00:45:07.400
AUDIENCE: All right, so
a question from here.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.030
So when I was
listening to your talk,

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.210
first with the example
of the kitchen and later

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.970
with the LEGO example, I
noticed that the examples

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.560
were all very male centric.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.380
They were about soccer.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:24.980
All the kids in
question were all boys.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.260
So which made me think, when
you're doing this process

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.940
and you're asking
about the why, how

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:35.830
do you guard against
your implicit biases

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:39.340
finding only part of the answer.

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.580
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: So that's
a methodological question

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.340
that you can't get out of.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.190
And it's called the
hermeneutic circle.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.330
It's basically, in order
to understand something,

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:53.215
you need to use yourself
and your own experience.

00:45:53.215 --> 00:45:56.360
A Shakespeare comedy
isn't funny unless you

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.190
use your own experience.

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:01.310
Because-- yeah well,
that's obvious.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:04.700
So the way that
we try to do this

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.640
is to work with our
biases, be aware of them

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.300
and try to adjust for
them as much as you can,

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:14.010
but accepting that you
can never-- there is

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:16.930
no view from nowhere
when you study people.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.022
When you study quarks and
atoms and bits and bytes

00:46:19.022 --> 00:46:21.230
or something like that,
there is a view from nowhere.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.271
And the natural sciences
is a pretty good example

00:46:23.271 --> 00:46:24.950
and a very successful
example of that.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:27.700
But for human
sciences, your insight,

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.760
the interpretation yourself,
so you have to work with it

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.110
and be honest, basically, about
your own biases and so on.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.920
Now we just did a study
about women and drinking,

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.570
which are two very
exciting topics.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:45.260
And we found that women
are starting going out,

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.600
in places like
Russia, China, Brazil,

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.540
where they never, ever went out
with their friends and so on.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.750
And it turns out it
freaks out the men.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.220
They sit at home and don't
know really what to do.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:00.800
And a whole new
culture is starting,

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.980
especially in Asia
it's quite prevalent

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.930
and it's a whole new
market and so on.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.460
So it's not just men we study.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.190
I guess the examples were
biased in that direction.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.490
But in that case, you
need to, again, work

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:15.900
with your own assumptions
and your own biases

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.740
as much as you can.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.186
And there is no
view from nowhere.

00:47:20.186 --> 00:47:21.120
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.745
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN:
When Christian talked

00:47:22.745 --> 00:47:25.590
he talked about three things
you need and one of the last one

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:28.370
was called non-linear
problem solving.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:31.010
And it basically means exactly
what you are talking about now,

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:35.220
which is you cannot take your
own ideas out of the picture.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.890
That means this type
of analysis will never

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:42.970
be a completely 100% percent
exact analysis of how it always

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:43.480
will be.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.130
It will be a hunch about
how something works.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.280
Like when you go
in and see a movie,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.080
and you talk about
it afterwards,

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.670
you have an interpretation
of that movie.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.400
But we are saying
is if a company can

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.600
have a conversation about the
customers they are serving

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.620
and start making interpretations
based on deep data,

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:06.960
it's much, much better
than having a numbers-based

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.250
and very thin data because
it gives them an insight.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.000
But you have to place a bet.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.340
It's not like a one-to-one
where you can say,

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.470
oh they all have red shoes.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:16.480
Let's make red shoes.

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.590
It's not like that.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:18.740
I hope that makes sense.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.250
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Yeah, and
you can say that there's-- you

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:24.130
can go to school.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:27.900
And anthropology is
a tradition that's

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.250
100 years old which is
about understanding culture.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:35.720
And just like you wouldn't ask
somebody that's not an engineer

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.980
to build a bridge, it
can be helpful to have

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.210
that kind of training if you
want to do cultural analysis.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:45.590
But that doesn't give them--
anthropologists-- a view

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:50.286
from nowhere, either, in the
sense of natural sciences.

00:48:50.286 --> 00:48:51.210
Oh, sorry.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:52.090
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:53.180
When you guys are
working with leaders

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.704
who are so focused on the bottom
line, what's the persuasion

00:48:55.704 --> 00:48:58.120
conversation like to say,
you're focused on this question,

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.980
but the actual one
is like, why play,

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.920
instead of how to
make more money?

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.720
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: So,
first of all, it works.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.320
That tends to help.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.740
But it feels
intellectual to them.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.165
It feels non-familiar.

00:49:14.165 --> 00:49:15.540
It doesn't feel
familiar to start

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.890
talking about lived experience
in this kind of complex way.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:24.000
But if they're in enough
trouble, they tend to listen.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.810
So a healthy crisis
is always a good sign.

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:31.000
And you can say that the LEGO
company had, at that point

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.780
that we're talking about here,
lost around $300,000 a day

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.040
for 10 years.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.225
That makes people start
listening a little bit.

00:49:39.225 --> 00:49:44.780
And it's a private company so
it's-- they were in trouble,

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.270
so that tends to help.

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.670
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN:
I also think we've

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:49.280
experienced, when we talk
especially to people pretty

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.810
high up, that there's a kind
of fatigue with the tools

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:52.900
they have available.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.605
There's a fatigue with
the way strategy is done,

00:49:55.605 --> 00:49:57.680
the over-quantification
of everything,

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:01.170
the million PowerPoint show,
how all the strategies end up

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.640
with the same idea that
we need to fight our core,

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.390
we need to go into
new areas, and we

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:07.619
need to build capabilities.

00:50:07.619 --> 00:50:08.910
It's always those three things.

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:11.326
It doesn't matter whether it's
soap or [? tennis cases ?].

00:50:11.326 --> 00:50:12.840
It's the same strategy.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.660
And we can sense
that there's time

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:21.070
where those discussions-- and I
think many leaders are looking

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:23.480
for something new, something
that is deeper and more

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.340
inspirational,
basically, I think.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.881
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
And I would say,

00:50:26.881 --> 00:50:30.110
I'm surprised by how complex
thinkers some of these leaders

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.890
are, actually.

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:33.180
Which is a nice thing.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:36.274
That if you are at
that level, there's

00:50:36.274 --> 00:50:37.690
a reason why you're
at that level.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:42.000
And you have bandwidth enough
to deal with many things

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.290
at the same time.

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:45.790
So that's very
positive, in a sense.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:47.130
Thank you.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:47.710
MIKKEL RASMUSSEN:
You have a question.

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:49.876
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so my
question is around thick data.

00:50:49.876 --> 00:50:55.740
And I think guys describe
qualitatively what

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.120
it was, I guess,
in your own style.

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:02.250
But before you had
this dichotomy of it's

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:05.015
not focus groups, it's
not explicit questions,

00:51:05.015 --> 00:51:09.360
it's a little more tacit
or a little more subtle.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.430
And I was wondering
how do you go

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.520
about collecting
that thick data?

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.990
Or what's that process like?

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:19.280
Because it seems more subtle
and a little more responsive

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.320
to the environment.

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:24.350
And for example, with the
playing with kids example,

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:28.420
it wasn't just observing
them or taking notes

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.140
but it was also the process
of actually playing with them

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.880
and maybe putting yourself
in their shoes a little bit.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.870
So I was wondering if
you have any thoughts

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.340
about that methodology
on a larger scale.

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.700
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
So anthropology

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:45.610
has developed a tools set called
ethnographic data gathering

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.270
from the 1920s and on.

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:51.020
And it's basically
largely misunderstood

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.180
in business today.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:56.940
Because it means in-house,
in-context interviews.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.530
So interview is
one thing and what

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:01.670
we say and so on is important,
but it's also important

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:02.540
what we do.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.190
And so what we
normally is say is,

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:06.630
we're not interested
in people, really.

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:08.390
We're interested in worlds.

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:11.490
And a world has people
in it, for sure.

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:13.590
So let's say the
world of cooking,

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:17.060
or the world of business,
or the world of Google.

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.250
They're all-- or the art world.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.385
They all have--
it's not a thing.

00:52:22.385 --> 00:52:23.850
The art world is not a thing.

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:26.780
It consists of galleries
and artists and pencils

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:30.480
and paper and canvases
and all sorts of things.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.250
And it has roles in there,
so people that feel they're

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.270
artists.

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:35.660
And it has identities.

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.900
And it has money.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.500
It has all sorts of things.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.460
In order to understand
a world, you

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.230
need a hook into that world.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:45.370
And the way we do that
is through getting

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.580
people and seeing how
they deal with things

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:50.720
and how they do the
things that they do.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.580
So it's not that
they can-- I mean,

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.240
they always lie to themselves.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.840
We all like to ourselves
all the time about,

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.330
I need to cook for my
children all the time

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:00.980
and then I can't find
my pots and pans.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.730
That sort of situation.

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:06.410
And we just try to cut
through that by saying,

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:10.380
individuals are less
interesting than worlds,

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.640
the worlds of people.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.430
So what we study
is not individuals.

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:15.340
It's world.

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:17.152
So in a sense--
Margaret Thatcher

00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:19.110
used to say, there is no
such thing as society,

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:19.780
only individuals.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:20.946
We say the other way around.

00:53:20.946 --> 00:53:24.130
We say there is no such thing
as individuals, only societies.

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:27.600
You are what you do and
the way you do it, but also

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.210
because of all these
other people that

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:30.350
deeply influence you.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:33.201
And you might feel that you
have rational decisions on what

00:53:33.201 --> 00:53:33.700
you do.

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.852
But you don't.

00:53:34.852 --> 00:53:37.310
You make all sorts of decisions
because of your surrounding

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:40.552
and because the world you're in.

00:53:40.552 --> 00:53:42.690
Heidegger calls it the one.

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:44.780
One does this and one does that.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.440
That's most of the time.

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.216
We do things because
that's what one does.

00:53:48.216 --> 00:53:49.340
One gets up in the morning.

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.370
One asks questions
when it's uncomfortable

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:54.290
that nobody's asked questions--
that sort of situation.

00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:56.300
And that's exactly
what we study.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.890
We study how people
live in worlds

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:03.660
and how those worlds interact
with them, in a sense.

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:07.425
So it's observational, but it's
with a theoretical framework

00:54:07.425 --> 00:54:09.752
behind it, in a sense.

00:54:09.752 --> 00:54:10.460
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.630
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Did
I answer the question?

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:12.588
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.

00:54:12.588 --> 00:54:16.970
CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG:
Great, thanks Good?

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.750
Thank you.
