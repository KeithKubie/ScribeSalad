00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.860
Because grits is an equal opportunity fragging environment, we need to allow

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.530
players without mice to be able to still compete in our environment. This

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.410
means, that we need to allow them to shoot with keyboard controls, as already

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.327
mentioned. The code for this is very similar to what we've seen before. For

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:19.295
example, we need to simply go through and pull the key state of our shooting

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:23.327
directional keys, to create a directional vector that we then use to launch

00:00:23.327 --> 00:00:28.371
projectiles. Your task is to fill in the supplied code below, to sum up the

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:31.600
keyboard input, and normalize the resulting vector.
