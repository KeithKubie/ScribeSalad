00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.810
&gt;From these individual QRDA files,
popHealth aggregates and

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.210
summarizes quality metrics.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.890
Here, for example, are 500 patients
from a 10 provider practice,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.860
in which, individual physicians
could be using different EMRs.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.570
This practice might be under
an outcome based contract,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.320
where their revenue is tied to meeting
goals, for these quality metrics.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.190
Here, they're doing well on
smoking screening, but not so well

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.800
on weight screening, particularly for
adults in the 18 to 64 group.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.920
This points out the need to identify the
right group of patients for each metric.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.120
For example, you would not normally
perform screening mammograms on men for

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.520
breast cancer.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.000
And the recommendations for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.980
this screening are increasingly pointing
to a specific age range for women.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.760
Note that in recognition of this key
point, the numerator, typically,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.580
the number of patients who's care
met criteria is in green for

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.959
each metric, while the denominator,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.860
the applicable target patient group for
the metric is in blue.
