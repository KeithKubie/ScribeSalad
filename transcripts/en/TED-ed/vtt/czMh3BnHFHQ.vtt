00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.496
Every second,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.696
one million tons of matter
is blasted from the Sun

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.136
at the velocity
of one million miles per hour,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.360
and it's on a collision course with Earth!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.496
But don't worry,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.936
this isn't the opening
of a new Michael Bay movie.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.200
This is The Journey of the Polar Lights.

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:40.456
The northern and southern lights,
also known as the aurora Borealis

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.456
and aurora Australis, respectively,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.616
occur when high energy
particles from the Sun

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.096
collide with neutral atoms
in our atmosphere.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.176
The energy emitted from this crash
produces a spectacle of light

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.056
that mankind has marveled at
for centuries.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.296
But the particles' journey
isn't just as simple

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.296
as leaving the Sun and arriving at Earth.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.896
Like any cross-country road trip,
there's a big detour

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.096
and nobody asks for directions.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.936
Let's track this intergalactic voyage

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.336
by focusing on three
main points of their journey:

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.656
leaving the Sun, making a pit stop
in the Earth's magnetic fields,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.880
and arriving at the atmosphere
above our heads.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.976
The protons and electrons
creating the northern lights

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.576
depart from the Sun's corona.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.296
The corona is the outermost layer
of the Sun's atmosphere

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.976
and is one of the hottest regions.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.016
Its intense heat causes the Sun's hydrogen
and helium atoms to vibrate

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.936
and shake off protons and electrons

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.640
as if they were stripping off
layers on a hot, sunny day.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.656
Impatient and finally behind the wheel,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.416
these free protons
and electrons move too fast

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.376
to be contained by the Sun's gravity

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.760
and group together as plasma,
an electrically charged gas.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.256
They travel away from the Sun
as a constant gale of plasma,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.560
known as the solar wind.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.016
However, the Earth prevents the solar wind
from traveling straight into the planet

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.136
by setting up a detour, the magnetosphere.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.016
The magnetosphere is formed
by the Earth's magnetic currents

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.056
and shields our planet
from the solar winds

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.256
by sending out the particles
around the Earth.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.296
Their opportunity to continue the journey
down to the atmosphere

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.736
comes when the magnetosphere is
overwhelmed by a new wave of travelers.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.496
This event is coronal mass ejection,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.336
and it occurs when the Sun shoots out

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.480
a massive ball of plasma
into the solar wind.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.336
When one of these coronal mass ejections
collides with Earth,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.856
it overpowers the magnetosphere
and creates a magnetic storm.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.496
The heavy storm stresses the magnetosphere
until it suddenly snaps back,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.696
like and overstretched elastic band,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.776
flinging some of the detoured
particles towards Earth.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.696
The retracting band of the magnetic field
drags them down to the aurora ovals,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.560
which are the locations
of the northern and southern lights.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.816
After traveling 93 million miles
across the galaxy,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.736
the Sun's particles finally produce
their dazzling light show

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.216
with the help of some friends.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.376
20 to 200 miles above the surface,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.056
the electrons and protons meet up
with oxygen and nitrogen atoms,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.536
and they sure are happy to see each other.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.416
The Sun's particles high five the atoms,
giving their energy

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.296
to the Earth's neutral
oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.336
When the atoms in the atmosphere
are contacted by the particles,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.536
they get excited and emit photons.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.856
Photons are small bursts of energy
in the form of light.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.496
The colors that appear in the sky

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.663
depend on the wavelength
of the atom's photon.

00:03:19.687 --> 00:03:22.976
Excited oxygen atoms are responsible
for the green and red colors,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.200
whereas excited nitrogen atoms
produce blue and deep red hues.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.016
The collection of these interactions

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.326
is what creates the northern
and southern lights.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.576
The polar lights
are best seen on clear nights

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.336
in regions close to magnetic
north and south poles.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.576
Nighttime is ideal

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.816
because the Aurora
is much dimmer than sunlight

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.440
and cannot be seen in daytime.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.016
Remember to look up at the sky
and read up on the Sun's energy patterns,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.096
specifically sunspots and solar flares,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.760
as these will be good guides
for predicting the auroras.
