00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.920
 This large rectangle here is divided into four smaller rectangles. 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.238
 I want to express the face of the big rectangle 

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:10.933
 and I will do it in two ways. 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.500
 The first way is like a work of two two- 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.620
 and then I want to express it as a three-member. 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.313
 Let's think about it. 

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:22.664
 One way is to get the height 

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:25.717
 of this great rectangle from here to here. 

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:27.951
 We see that this distance is x. 

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:30.528
 Then from here to here is 2, 

00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:33.512
 so the whole height is here 

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:38.133
 will be x + 2. 

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:42.033
 The height is x + 2, and what is the width? 

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:46.908
 Going from there to there, is x. 

00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:50.446
 And then there is 3 there. 

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:53.521
 So the whole width is x + 3. 

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:55.239
 x + 3. 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.380
 Thus I expressed the face of the whole rectangle 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.126
 and it represents the work of two two members. 

00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:03.901
 But now let's say it as triple. 

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:06.559
 To do that, we can divide the whole face 

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:09.624
 of the faces of all these smaller rectangles. 

00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:13.223
 What is the face of this purple rectangle here? 

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:17.440
 Its height is x and its width is x, 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.500
 so his face will be x ^ 2. 

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:23.520
 Let me write it - it's x ^ 2. 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.235
 What is the face of this yellow rectangle? 

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:30.799
 Its height is x, the same as here, 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.316
 and its width is 3, 

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:38.843
 so his face will be x 3 or 3x. 

00:01:38.843 --> 00:01:41.258
 I have a face of 3h. 

00:01:41.258 --> 00:01:42.786
 So this face is 3x. 

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:47.156
 If we collect the face of this whole thing, it will be plus 3x. 

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:49.083
 Therefore, this expression here is the person 

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.241
 of this purple area plus the face of this yellow area. 

00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.156
 We can now move to this green area. 

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.083
 What will be the person here? 

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:58.893
 The height is 2, and the width is x, 

00:01:58.893 --> 00:02:01.878
 so we multiply the height in width, 

00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:03.235
 which is 2 x 

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:07.356
 and we just add it: plus 2x. 

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:10.757
 And finally this little gray box here. 

00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:13.578
 Its height is 2, we see this there, 

00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:18.340
 and its width is 3, we see it there. 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.920
 So there will be a face 6. 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.661
 2 at 3. 

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:24.465
 Therefore, plus 6. 

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:26.274
 And maybe you will say, "This is not a three- 

00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:28.455
 here are four members. " 

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:31.219
 But maybe you notice that we can get together 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.574
 these two members in the middle, 

00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:35.561
 3x plus 2x. 

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.520
 If I have 3x and add to them 2x, 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.518
 I will have 5x. 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.180
 So the whole thing is simplified to 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.420
 x 2 + 5x + 6. 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.978
 These are two different ways of expressing the person. 

00:02:54.978 --> 00:02:57.323
 Therefore they have to be equal and there is logic, 

00:02:57.323 --> 00:02:59.680
 because if you multiply these two members and simplify, 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.757
 you will get this three-member. 

00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:03.022
 We can do this very quickly. 

00:03:03.022 --> 00:03:04.464
 Multiply x in x ... 

00:03:04.464 --> 00:03:07.747
 Actually let me do it with the same colors. 

00:03:07.747 --> 00:03:13.907
 You multiply x by x and get x 2. 

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:20.565
 You multiply this by x 3 and you get 3x. 

00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:26.775
 You multiply 2 by x and get 2x. 

00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:33.591
 And then you multiply 2 by 3 and get 6. 

00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:36.330
 We can say that this face model 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.918
 creates a visual idea 

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:42.137
 what is the logic of multiplying the two members 

00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:43.760
 the way we do it. 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.252
 In other videos we talk about it as a 

00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:47.913
 applying the distribution property twice, 

00:03:47.913 --> 00:03:51.073
 but this gives a more visual idea 

00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:53.723
 for the logic of things.
