right now in the developing world people

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940
right now in the developing world people
 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.660
right now in the developing world people
are skipping sort of the desktop as the

handhelds one of the places where I'm
 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.649
handhelds one of the places where I'm
doing a lot of work right now is in the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659
doing a lot of work right now is in the
 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.410
doing a lot of work right now is in the
Democratic Republic of Congo which is

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420

sounds great but you know is that naive

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980
sounds great but you know is that naive

about literacy gaps and one of the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310
about literacy gaps and one of the
 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.790
about literacy gaps and one of the
things that I learned was that today at

out of every 100 people in the Congo are
 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.660
out of every 100 people in the Congo are
already mobile phone subscribers and one

of the things that's different in the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990
of the things that's different in the
 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.600

Congo that's different in the United

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610
Congo that's different in the United
 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.970
Congo that's different in the United
States is in the United States everybody

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980
States is in the United States everybody
 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.090
States is in the United States everybody
has their own phone but in the Congo its

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100
has their own phone but in the Congo its
 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.400

normal actually for three or four people

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410
normal actually for three or four people
 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.680
normal actually for three or four people
to share the same phone and so if you

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690
to share the same phone and so if you
 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.949
to share the same phone and so if you
just do the math all right today 14 out

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959
just do the math all right today 14 out
 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.720
just do the math all right today 14 out
of every 100 people or mobile phone

subscribers if you assume that there are

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070
subscribers if you assume that there are
 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.580
subscribers if you assume that there are
three users per phone what that means is

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590
three users per phone what that means is
 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.110
three users per phone what that means is
that today without the United States

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120
that today without the United States
 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.660
that today without the United States
doing a thing forty-two percent of the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670
doing a thing forty-two percent of the
 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.660
doing a thing forty-two percent of the
country are already on mobile phones so

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670
country are already on mobile phones so
 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.110
country are already on mobile phones so
in one of the poorest regions of the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120
in one of the poorest regions of the
 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.570
in one of the poorest regions of the
earth the Congo we already see that half

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580
earth the Congo we already see that half
 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.220
earth the Congo we already see that half
of the people are connecting to the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230
of the people are connecting to the
 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.130
of the people are connecting to the
network and so that for me is is great

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140
network and so that for me is is great
 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.979
network and so that for me is is great
affirmation that we should be pushing

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989
affirmation that we should be pushing
 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.070
affirmation that we should be pushing
these technologies into the developing

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080
these technologies into the developing
 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.470
these technologies into the developing
world and further we should be thinking

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480
world and further we should be thinking
 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.650
world and further we should be thinking
about how 21st century technology can

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660
about how 21st century technology can
 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.150
about how 21st century technology can
help solve some of our most intractable

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160
help solve some of our most intractable
 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.940
help solve some of our most intractable
development challenges and will there be

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950
development challenges and will there be
 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.810
development challenges and will there be
places where we go where people simply

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820
places where we go where people simply
 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.790
places where we go where people simply
aren't using cell phones where there's

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800
aren't using cell phones where there's
 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.539
aren't using cell phones where there's
no mobile coverage where the literacy

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549
no mobile coverage where the literacy
 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.610
no mobile coverage where the literacy
level is such that people just can't

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
level is such that people just can't
 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.890
level is such that people just can't
figure it out sure but I think that

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900
figure it out sure but I think that
 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.380
figure it out sure but I think that
instead of just waiting for the world to

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390
instead of just waiting for the world to
 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.810
instead of just waiting for the world to
catch up the United States can play a
