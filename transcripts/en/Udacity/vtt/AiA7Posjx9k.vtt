00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.151
So putting it all together, so maybe
you construct the initial eigenbasis as

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:06.860
your way of, of doing this,
this tracking.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.870
You pick some initial location,
remember, we had some prior location.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.670
&gt;From that location,
you generate possible new locations.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.670
You evaluate those possible
new locations, and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.570
then you select the most likely one.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.930
Remember we're not taking
the entire distribution,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.920
we're just taking the most likely one.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.780
And then, in the incremental part,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.060
we're going to update the eigenbasis
using that new detected location.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.650
And then we just go back up and
go over again.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.880
That's why it's called tracking.
