00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So now we have reached our first real world differential equation --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the second derivative of the position vector of the spacecraft,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is its acceleration vector,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
equals the gravitational constant times the mass of the earth

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
times a vector that points from the spacecraft to the earth

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
divided by the 3rd power of its length.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This boils down to the 3rd power of the distance between the spacecraft and earth.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now comes the component due to the moon--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
gravitational constant times the mass of the moon

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
times vector from the spacecraft to the moon

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
divided by the 3rd power of its length.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is a differential equation -- an equation that governs or is governed by rates of change.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The acceleration vector is the rate of change of a rate of change.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This actually is a system of differential equations.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's not a single equation.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We've got two components in here.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Each of these two components has to fulfill this equation.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The highest derivative that occurs is the second one,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which is why we call this differential equation a differential equation of order 2.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The highest derivative stands alone on one side and does not occur anywhere else.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is what we call explicit.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If the highest derivative was hidden somewhere,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we would first need to solve that equation, which is ugly.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
These two terms mean that this differential equation is nonlinear.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
A linear differential equation would only contain terms such as 42 times xs

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
or sin(t) times xs.
