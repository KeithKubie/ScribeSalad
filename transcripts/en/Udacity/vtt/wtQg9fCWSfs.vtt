00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.960
So the only place in the code that we need to change is in the get method for

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.185
lucky search. What it does currently is returns the result of lucky search for

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:13.692
every query. What we want to do is instead of that, check if the result is none

00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:18.710
and return something different when it is. So here's the code that does that.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.694
I'm going to use lucky search to get the result. Then if the result is none,

00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:27.674
I'll return a string that says, Try searchwithpeter.info. Otherwise, I'll return

00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:28.763
the normal result.
