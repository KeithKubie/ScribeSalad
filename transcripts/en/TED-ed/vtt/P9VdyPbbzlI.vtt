00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:08.920
When the next general election rolls around,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.881
who will be eligible to show up at the polls

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:13.271
and vote for the President of the United States?

00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:14.459
It's really pretty simple.

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.107
If you are at least 18 years old,

00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:17.319
a citizen of the U.S.,

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:18.645
and a resident of a state,

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:19.822
you can vote,

00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:21.732
assuming, that is, you are not a felon.

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:23.119
Seems about right.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.041
After all, the United States prides itself

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.548
on being a democracy,

00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:28.334
or a government in which the ultimate authority

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:30.322
lies with the citizens of the nation.

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.709
But it was not always this way.

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:35.133
In 1789, George Washington won

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.013
the electoral college with 100% of the vote,

00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:39.837
but whose vote was it?

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:41.168
Probably not yours.

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:44.630
Only 6% of the entire United States population

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.021
was allowed to vote at all.

00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:47.640
Voting was a right

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.631
that only white, male property owners

00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:51.511
were allowed to exercise.

00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:53.728
By the 1820s and 1830s,

00:00:53.728 --> 00:00:55.177
the American population was booming

00:00:55.177 --> 00:00:57.930
from the east coast into the western frontier.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.850
Frontier farmers were resilient,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.597
self-reliant,

00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:02.610
and mostly ineligible to vote

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.600
because they did not own land.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.491
As these new areas of the nation became states,

00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:08.572
they typically left out

00:01:08.572 --> 00:01:10.703
the property requirement for voting.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.133
Leaders such as Andrew Jackson,

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.293
the United State's first common man President,

00:01:14.293 --> 00:01:16.961
promoted what he called universal suffrage.

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:18.862
Of course, by universal suffrage,

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:22.300
Jackson really meant universal white, male suffrage.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.970
All he emphasized was getting rid

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.798
of the property requirement for voting,

00:01:25.798 --> 00:01:28.632
not expanding the vote beyond white men.

00:01:28.632 --> 00:01:31.861
By the 1850s, about 55% of the adult population

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.884
was eligible to vote in the U.S.,

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:35.357
much better than 6%,

00:01:35.357 --> 00:01:37.373
but far from everybody.

00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:39.280
Then, in 1861,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.955
the American Civil War began

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:42.789
largely over the issue of slavery

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.818
and states' rights in the United States.

00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:45.968
When it was all over,

00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:48.236
the U.S. ratified the 15th Amendment,

00:01:48.236 --> 00:01:50.217
which promised that a person's right to vote

00:01:50.217 --> 00:01:51.342
could not be denied

00:01:51.342 --> 00:01:52.429
based on race,

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:53.098
color,

00:01:53.098 --> 00:01:55.199
or previous condition as a slave.

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:56.501
This meant that black men,

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.017
newly affirmed as citizens of the U.S.,

00:01:59.017 --> 00:02:00.488
would now be allowed to vote.

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:03.154
Of course, laws are far from reality.

00:02:03.154 --> 00:02:05.489
Despite the promise of the 15th Amendment,

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.705
intimidation kept African-Americans

00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:10.068
from exercising their voting rights.

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:11.607
States passed laws that limited

00:02:11.607 --> 00:02:13.475
the rights of African-Americans to vote,

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:15.480
including things like literacy tests,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.527
which were rigged

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:18.193
so that not even literate African-Americans

00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:19.819
were allowed to pass,

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.156
and poll taxes.

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:23.153
So, despite the 15th Amendment,

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:26.325
by 1892, only about 6% of black men

00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:28.496
in Mississippi were registered to vote.

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:31.111
By 1960, it was only 1%.

00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:33.210
And, of course, women were still totally out

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.631
of the national voting picture.

00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:36.633
It wasn't until 1920

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.300
that the women's suffrage movement

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.168
won their 30-year battle,

00:02:40.168 --> 00:02:42.813
and the 19th Amendment finally gave women the vote,

00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:44.602
well, white women.

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:46.934
The restrictions on African-Americans,

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.656
including African-American women,

00:02:48.656 --> 00:02:49.478
remained.

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:50.692
After World War II,

00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:52.356
many Americans began to question

00:02:52.356 --> 00:02:54.113
the state of U.S. democracy.

00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:55.313
How could a nation that fought

00:02:55.313 --> 00:02:57.480
for freedom and human rights abroad

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.273
come home and deny suffrage based on race?

00:03:00.273 --> 00:03:01.773
The modern civil rights movement

00:03:01.773 --> 00:03:04.863
began in the 1940s with those questions in mind.

00:03:04.863 --> 00:03:06.051
After years of sacrifice,

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:06.775
bloodshed,

00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:07.575
and pain,

00:03:07.575 --> 00:03:08.612
the United States passed

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:11.194
the Voting Rights Act of 1965,

00:03:11.194 --> 00:03:12.828
finally eliminating restrictions

00:03:12.828 --> 00:03:14.255
such as literacy tests

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:15.695
and protecting the voting rights

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.666
promised under the 15th Amendment to the Constitution.

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:22.858
Now, any citizen over the age of 21 could vote.

00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:24.185
All seemed well

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:26.681
until the United States went to war.

00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.173
When the Vietnam War called up all men

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:31.318
age 18 and over for the draft,

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:32.985
many wondered whether it was fair

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:35.894
to send men who couldn't vote to war.

00:03:35.894 --> 00:03:39.317
In 1971, the 26th Amendment to the Constitution

00:03:39.317 --> 00:03:41.699
made all citizens 18 and older

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:42.866
eligible to vote,

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:44.986
the last major expansion of voting rights

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:46.499
in the United States.

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.450
Today, the pool of eligible voters in the U.S.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.366
is far broader and more inclusive

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.664
than ever before in U.S. history.

00:03:53.664 --> 00:03:55.749
But, of course, it's not perfect.

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.133
There are still active efforts

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:59.090
to suppress some groups from voting,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.290
and only about 60% of those who can vote do.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.951
Now that you know all the hard work

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:07.133
that went into securing the right to vote,

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:08.189
what do you think?

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.867
Do enough citizens have the right to vote now?

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:12.733
And among those who can vote,

00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:14.950
why don't more of them do it?
