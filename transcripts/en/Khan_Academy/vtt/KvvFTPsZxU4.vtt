00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.720
In the last video,
we saw that if we

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:12.540
were to take the sum from i
equals 0 to n of i squared,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.240
that this could be equal to--
and we did it in two videos.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.380
It was a little bit hairy,
but we powered through.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.680
This is equal to 1/3
n to the third power.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.970
Let me write it a little
cleaner than that.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.140
n to the third power plus
1/2 n squared plus 1/6 n.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.810
And that is absolutely
true, but you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.280
might have seen a
different formula

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.670
for this that doesn't
look like that.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.750
And so what I want to do is now
manipulate this a little bit

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.080
algebraically to come up
with another formula that's

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.750
typically seen for this sum.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.650
So the first thing
that we might realize

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.390
is, well, what happens
if we factor out a 1/6 n?

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.840
So this is going to
be equal to-- let's

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.750
factor out this right over here.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.989
So that would be equal to
1/6 n times-- so let's see.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.630
1/3 divided by 1/6, that's
the same thing as 1/3 times 6.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.864
So this right over here is going
to be equal to 2 n squared.

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:15.780
And you can verify it.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.750
1/6 times 2 is 2/6 or 1/3.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.200
n times n squared is
n to the third power.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.820
Now, 1/2 divided by
1/6 is the same thing

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.790
as 1/2 times 6, which is 3.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:36.260
So this term right over here
is going to be plus 3 times n.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.130
And then finally, you
have this term right

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.430
over here, which is just
going to be equal to 1.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.930
And now we're faced with
factoring this thing

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.470
right over here.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.080
Now, you could to do
this-- well, let's factor

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.640
by grouping this.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880
And remember, when you
factor by grouping,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.910
you want to
essentially break this

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.580
into two numbers where the
product of those two numbers

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.759
is equal to the
product of 2 times 1.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.840
And the obvious thing
is, well, 2 times 1 is 2.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.460
If I break this into 2 and 1,
if I break this 3 into 2 and 1,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.690
well, 2 times 1 is
definitely 2 times 1.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.880
So let me rewrite this.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.310
I'm just factoring by grouping
here, nothing super fancy.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:37.047
So if I rewrite this as 2 n
squared plus n plus 2n plus 1--

00:02:37.047 --> 00:02:38.880
so this is all the stuff
in this parentheses

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.320
right over here-- well,
this part right over here

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.582
we can factor out an n.

00:02:43.582 --> 00:02:46.040
So this is going to be equal
to-- let me just write the 1/6

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.310
n here so you know
what I'm doing.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.870
So if we factor out
an n right over here,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:01.180
we would have n times 2n plus 1.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.090
So that's what's in
green right over here.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.240
That's this part
right over here.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.740
And then what I have
here, I could write this

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.220
as plus 1 times 2n plus 1.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.230
Let me do it in that same
color, so 1 times 2n plus 1.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.010
And so now, you can
factor out a 2n plus 1.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.910
And this thing simplifies
to 1/6 n times 2n plus 1.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.740
I'm just factoring
out a 2n plus 1.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.980
And then if you factor a 2n plus
1 out of each of these terms,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.290
you're going to
just an n and a 1.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:03.490
So 1/6 times n times 2n
plus 1 times n plus 1.

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.990
And if this was a little bit
confusing what I did here,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.240
I encourage you to
review the videos

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.365
on factoring by grouping.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.880
And another way we
can rewrite this,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.310
we could write this whole
thing as being equal to--

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.101
and maybe I'll write
it in this green color

00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:23.210
that we started off with.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.780
This is the same
thing as-- and I'll

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.810
write it as n times
n plus 1 times 2n

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.880
plus 1, all of that over 6.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.780
So this expression is
equivalent to this expression,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.690
and it's equivalent
to this value

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.810
right over here, so
whichever one you

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.690
find to be a little bit
easier to think about.
