1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
He'd have to stay. Well that's what
I, when I was training for that,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,660
a MMA fight against the comedian.
I trained with Bisping, uh, twice.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,840
And I grappled with this being in
business, not even known for his Jujitsu.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,550
Of course he is. He, no, he's
got very good a brown belt.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,490
I know he's a guard. He's defensive
guards, one of the best in MMA.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,210
Very rarely do people pass his
guard when he's on the ground. He's,

7
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:24,080
he's excellent. But primarily he, you
know, he's known as a striker primarily,

8
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:28,230
primarily. Duh. I can't
explain to you. It was like,

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,060
I felt like a lion was just
toying with me. It was,

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,440
it was, it was a strange thing because
I'd never in my life, cause you obviously,

11
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,940
you know,
an MMA fighter can beat you up.

12
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:41,010
You don't like professional mixed
martial arts can beat you up.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,460
But I don't think people realize how
badly and how big of the gap it is.

14
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:50,160
It cause it's not, it's, but
they don't know Joe, you know,

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,410
people have no fucking
clue until you do it.

16
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:55,830
And I had no idea until
this last summer and I just,

17
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:59,160
and he was fucking around with me for
a second. Yeah. It was terrifying.

18
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:00,390
And I feel like less of a man.

19
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:03,120
I can't look at my son in the eyes the
same way that I used to be able to,

20
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:06,960
I don't fuck right. Like, oh,
come on, you'll be all right.
You know what it's like.

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,890
It's like,
um,

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,510
do you know how people see someone do
stand up and they think I can fucking do

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,610
that? Everyone. That's how we got
started. Because you're just talking.

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,490
You guys just talking. Yeah.
That's what fighting is like.

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,950
It's like you look at a guy
like Bisping and you know,

26
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:23,610
he's like a normal guy and he's
obviously very athletic and he's big and

27
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:26,520
everything like that, but he's,
he's not Shaquille O'Neal.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,230
He's not like get some seven
foot substance specimen.
He's regular size human.

29
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,020
So you're like, well, he's moving
like a regular human. I could do that.

30
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:38,040
But you have no idea. It is
noisy. You're beyond helpless.

31
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:42,470
You have no idea. Literally no idea.
He grabbed a hold of you. You are,

32
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,690
you're a dead person. Almost
anybody in the UFC, any, any person.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,440
The average person is, even if
you're training, it doesn't matter.

34
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,810
They can take you,
they'll do what they want to do with you.

35
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,330
There's intellectual levels,

36
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,790
like I always feel like that whenever
I talk to people that are really smart,

37
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,610
like I'm gonna have a Sean Carroll or
Neil degrasse Tyson or someone on the

38
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:04,020
podcast, he talked to him. He just like,
God damn, I'm fucking stupid. You know,

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,730
there's just,
there's levels to this,

40
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,250
this level to this understanding
of life that's like,

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,520
but that's with everything with standup,
an artwork with,

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,240
with someone choking the life
out of you this day, man.

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,080
I been doing Jujitsu since 1996 I'll
roll with certain people. I just,

44
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,120
it's a matter of when I'm
going to get strangled.

45
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,670
They don't even have to be bigger than me.
It'd be smaller than me.

46
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:25,890
It's when am I gonna tap?
When's it coming?

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,320
I had a friend of mine who's like a
really athletic dude who I get each,

48
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,430
he signed with friends, a friend of
a friend, but he trains out of a,

49
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,920
he's like a trainer out of a,
a Gracie school in Florida.

50
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,020
And he told me one time he, he got to
roll with hoists Gracie. And I said, no.

51
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,490
I was like, what was it like? Was it like,

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,370
was he like that much better than cause
guys a high level black belt? Like,

53
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,640
he was like, dude, he was like, we're
talking about levels. He was like,

54
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,910
he was toying with me like I had never
done it before. And that's how, uh,

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,860
that's how good. Um, those guys are.
