00:00:16.956 --> 00:00:20.141
Of all the spectacles mankind has viewed through a telescope,

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:22.923
there are few lovelier than a spiral galaxy.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:27.807
Majestic whirlpools of stars, they rotate in a stately and predictable dance.

00:00:27.807 --> 00:00:30.839
The fact that we see many billions of them in our telescopes

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.807
tells us they are both common and stable.

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:39.639
It is perhaps surprising that it is relatively easy to understand the inner workings of these cosmic pinwheels.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:44.074
By combining physical principles worked out by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 17th century,

00:00:44.074 --> 00:00:46.790
with the observed amount of mass in a galaxy,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.391
scientists can calculate the rates at which these galaxies rotate.

00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:57.074
Using these techniques, astronomers predict how fast stars at different distances from the center of the galaxy should move.

00:00:57.074 --> 00:00:59.923
Stars very close to the center move slowly.

00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:04.607
That's because there is very little mass between them and the center of the galaxy to pull them along.

00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:07.242
Stars a bit further away move faster,

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:11.141
because they are being pulled by all of the stars in between them and the center.

00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:14.991
As we get really far away, the stars are predicted to move slowly again.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.908
Their great distance reduces gravity to a gentle tug,

00:01:17.908 --> 00:01:20.223
so they move leisurely in their orbits.

00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:25.006
Knowing this, scientists looked at the galaxies and measured how fast stars were moving.

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:30.724
To their surprise, they found that while the stars closer to the center of the galaxy behaved as predicted,

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:34.423
those further away moved far too quickly.

00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:38.673
This observation was devastating to the tradtional theories of gravity and motion.

00:01:38.673 --> 00:01:41.506
If the stars were moving as fast as their measurement suggested,

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:43.974
galaxies should have torn themselves apart.

00:01:43.974 --> 00:01:49.290
It was a crisis, and astronomers and physicists scrambled to find a mistake in their calculation.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.540
Was Newton's theory of gravity wrong?

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.389
Was his theory of motion wrong?

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:57.772
Or was it possible that astronomers had incorrectly measured the galaxy's mass?

00:01:57.772 --> 00:02:01.956
All options were investigated, and all were ruled out. Except one.

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:08.806
Today, scientists believe that the answer lies in a previously unknown kind of matter, called dark matter.

00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:13.607
This dark matter can be envisioned as a cloud which surrounds most galaxies.

00:02:13.607 --> 00:02:17.090
This matter is very unusual. It is affected by gravity,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.890
but it is invisible to visible light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.856
The name "dark matter" originates in this form of matter's inability to emit or absorb light.

00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:31.374
Dark matter adds to the gravity of the galaxy

00:02:31.374 --> 00:02:35.707
and explains the orbital speed of stars far from the galactic center.

00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:38.257
Dark matter has not yet been directly observed,

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:41.140
but scientists believe that it is likely to be real,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.257
mostly because the other options have been ruled out.

00:02:44.257 --> 00:02:48.856
Using dozens of approaches, astronomers and physicists continue to search for direct evidence

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:52.857
that would prove that the dark matter hypothesis is true.

00:02:52.857 --> 00:02:59.541
This question is one of the most important physics research questions of the 21st century.
