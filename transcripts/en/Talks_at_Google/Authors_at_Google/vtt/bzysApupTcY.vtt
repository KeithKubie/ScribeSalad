&gt;&gt; CHERRY: All right. Hi, everyone. Thank
you for coming to another Google Authors@Google

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:13.950
event. I'm very excited to co-host this event
with Jessie and the team, and introduce all

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.350
of you to our featured author, Carole Meyers.
She's an award-winning travel writer and a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.280
native San Franciscan like a lot of you here.
Carole holds a B.A. degree in anthropology

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.750
from San Francisco State University and an
elementary teaching credential from Fresno

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:41.410
State College. She's the author of 19 books.
She is editor of 6 books, and the mother two

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.120
children--with whom she's been through the
road wars and in the travel trenches first

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.700
hand. And you can read a little bit about
that through her books. Her books include

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.510
"Weekend Adventures in San Francisco and Northern
California," which we'll talk about today.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.210
She's also written "Miles of Smiles: 101 Great
Card Games and Activities." She is the editor

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.280
of "Dream Sleeps: Castles and Palaces Hotels
of Europe," and she is a founding publisher

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.740
of Carousel Press. An active freelancer, her
articles have appeared in variety of publications

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.530
including "Parenting," "Family Fun," "Family
Circles," "Sunset," and numerous other magazines

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.060
as well as travel sections of many newspapers.
She has written a column for several publications

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.030
including "The San Jose Mercury News," "Expedia.com,"
and she's been a featured guest on the "Today's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.220
Show," "CNN," and "Bay Area Backroads." A
fun fact about Carole--I know how Googlers

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.750
love fun facts--is that in a different career
path, she was actually an extra on Mick Jagger's

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.960
"Vision of Paradise" video, and you can ask
her about that during Q&amp;A. Ms. Meyers is a

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.259
member of the Society of American Travel Writer
and resides in Berkeley, California. So, let's

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.930
all welcome Carole Meyers to Google. Thank
you.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:24.329
&gt;&gt; MEYERS: Thank you. That was very nice.
That was a very nice introduction. Thank you.

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.569
Okay. Well, we're going to talk about "Weekend
Adventures" today, and I'll just--I'm going

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.230
to give you just a little brief introduction
to how the book is arranged. Can you hear

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.542
me okay in the back there? Okay? All right,
one of the--one of the things that I've done

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:43.639
with this book that makes it a little different
than some books is that it is arranged so

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:49.029
that it's really easy to find things, and
especially like, for instance, say you're

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:54.900
on the road and you decide to change your
plans and you want to stop in, say you're

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.400
in San Mateo or something. And you want to
get off the road and go to lunch. You can

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.639
easily find it in the book, something in San
Mateo that--to give you a starting point.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:14.480
The book is arranged so that it fits in a
glove compartment, it's supposed to fit. And

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.620
it is arranged so it's coast up, coast north,
coast south, 101 north, 101 south, et cetera;

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.589
Gold Rush Country, Lake Tahoe. It's arranged
in sections like that. And there are introductory

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:32.809
maps that sort of positioned you where you
are. It's always good to have a backup street

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:38.459
map definitely wherever you're going. I forget
that basic fact sometimes and I--you know,

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:47.409
I regret it usually. So, always try to get
those maps with you before you leave. Okay,

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:54.389
so this is the book. And now, you know what,
Cherry? I think I need you just to show me

00:03:54.389 --> 00:04:00.419
which key here I'm going to use to go--to
move forward. Is it this one right here? That's

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:01.799
going to move me...
&gt;&gt; CHERRY: No.

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:02.799
&gt;&gt; MEYERS: This one.
&gt;&gt; CHERRY: There you go.

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.709
&gt;&gt; MEYERS: That's what I want. Okay. Thank
you. Okay, so we've already talked a bit about

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:16.470
my background. And at my website, and Jessie
will send you an email later with website

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.680
and blog addresses, but you can write them
down too, if you want to. But I do have--I

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.651
do have travel articles posted at my website.
And this is the caroletmeyers.com website.

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:35.949
I have about three or four websites, so I'll
to differentiate them for you. But if you're

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.889
just sort of wanting to browse and get some
ideas for some good places to go and things

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.770
to do, I do maintain a listing of travel articles
that I've written that I think that are particularly

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:53.330
informative at the website. And I also do
write fairly regularly right now for the "Chronicle:

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.669
Travel Section" for these five places that
they're doing each Sunday. And so, you might

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:07.180
see an article in there that you'll find of
use also. Okay, and also regarding the "Weekend

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.450
Adventure" structure of the book. It also--this
is something I want you know since you're

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.490
all going to have a copy of the book, you
want to know this, I include--I'm selective

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.240
about including special and a lot of historical
places in the book. So they--to get into my

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.660
book, they first have to be vetted by me.
I have been to almost every place. Occasionally,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.819
I will go on somebody's word that I trust
that it's worth putting in, but I like to

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:39.069
see something first-hand. And this book has
grown from the first edition to the ninth

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.830
edition. That's why it's gotten bigger because
I've visited more places. But they have to--they

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.759
have to be vetted by me first, and then they--I
also like them to be special in some way or

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:56.099
else why bother. Occasionally special is a
cheap sleep where you can actually get a bargain.

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.300
That's harder to get nowadays. It used to
be that I had a section called "Cheap Sleeps".

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.180
And I think the criteria was $50 or less for
two people for a night. Well, that, you know,

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.509
there's next to nothing anymore like that
except the hostels. And those are actually--anybody

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:21.530
can go to the hostels too, and they're a bargain.
Also, I have an annual events index in the

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.720
back that is really nice when you're just
kind of uninspired about what you want to

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.699
do or maybe you've got a--maybe you want to
take a vacation right now and you'd like to

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:36.710
center it around an annual event. It's according
to each month and you can go into the back

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.800
and you can look at the annual events and
see what's happening and then go to that section

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:52.029
and set up your trip. Okay. And annual events
are a fun thing to center your travel around.

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:58.249
I have four blogs, I have the Weekend Adventures
Update blog. All at blogspot, by the way,

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:05.830
which I thought you might appreciate that.
The Weekend Adventures Update is coordinated

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.439
with the book. I just started that blog when
this book was published. And what it does

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:17.159
is like when I visit a new restaurant or take
a new weekend trip or find out something has

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:23.610
changed significantly, I will put it into
the blog and coordinate it with the book so

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:30.259
that you can say, "Go to the blog and you
can look up," say, "Mendocino," and you can

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.310
just click there and see what I've written
about Mendocino, which currently is nothing.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.560
No updates to Mendocino. But you could do
that and check before you go just to see what's

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.340
happening. I also have the Travels With Carole
blogspot, which is the world. And I do travel

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.620
a lot to other places besides Northern California
so. And the one I really want to tell you

00:07:51.620 --> 00:08:00.389
about is this Webcam Traveler which is also
a website. And that is a website that has

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:08.080
a Google Map on it. And it uses the pins.
And every week, I add a new pin and it's all

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:15.900
about webcams that are--that are focused on
either a site, for instance, the Pyramids

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.689
or Time Square in New York, which is one of
my favorite ones, or an animal, like the snow

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:26.729
monkeys in Japan, which I also love and which
I think was the very first one that we posted.

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:31.729
And so--and then so it makes it really easy
to waste a minute or two just going to the

00:08:31.729 --> 00:08:34.820
website and click, click, click, click and
see what your favorite places and animals

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:41.110
are up to. And I Twitter too. All right, you
guys don't need to see this. I have some of

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.149
these blogs in here because I do talk to a
lot of people that don't even know what a

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:49.990
blog is. So we'll skip through this. You know
how they're set up. This is how the Webcam

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:58.089
Traveler website looks. These are the—well,
this is the other book that I wrote that was

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:04.070
already mentioned to you, and the two other
books that were mentioned that I've edited.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.050
"Camping Europe", I'm not sure if we mentioned
that one, but that's about taking camping

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.180
trips in Europe. It's a great book written
by another person who lives in Half Moon Bay

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.220
who just does a great job on finding every
little itty bitty bit of information you would

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:24.730
want to camp your way through Europe. You
can go to pretty much any of those websites

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:31.389
or blogs and find some way to sign up for
the free e-letter. And you can also, of course,

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:38.180
sign up for the blogs with FeedBurner, individually.
But I do send out an e-letter that goes out

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.650
to, maybe, I get two at about once a month
or so. And it will just sort of nudge you

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.630
to tell you that there's new stuff at this
blog and there's new stuff at that website.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:55.110
It's very short and sweet. Let's see. Everybody
is going to be getting a book today, so that's--we'll

00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:00.680
skip that one. And do please make comments
or ask questions as we go. Some of you may

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.390
have been to some of these places and have
something to add, that's good. And now, let's

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.720
just sit back and enjoy the ride, and I'm
going to give you some slides. We're going

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:16.380
to start with Clear Lake. How many of you
have been to Clear Lake? Okay. Clear Lake

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:22.200
is up Highway 101, a couple of hours north
of here, and it tends to--it tends to be a

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.620
place for the-—it's--Sacramento is the city
that feeds in to Clear Lake. A lot of people

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:32.060
from there tend to go to Clear Lake because
it's so close. But it's close for us too.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.190
And you could easily do it as a day trip.
And all of these trips, really, you can do

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.680
as a day trip. But all the information's there
for you to turn it into an overnight also,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.350
which is, of course, I think, more fun to
spend a little more time. One of the newsy

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:50.000
things up at Clear Lake is it used to be a
place that it was known for its orchards.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.990
And it grows—-well, they still grow pears
there and apples and--they're known for their

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:03.810
pears though. And, but they're slowly taking
those out and replacing them with grapes.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:10.110
And I was surprised to see, on my recent trip
there, yes, I visited here last year, about

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:17.170
this time, that they have several nice wineries
there now. I was surprised by that. And this

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:24.060
one in particular is like a destination winery.
And you can see that beautiful lavender. It's--the

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:30.279
lavender fields are in bloom now. This is
the time of year. It was stunning, and the

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:37.269
fragrance, and it just—-this winery is on
the lake. And I think that the fact was it's

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:42.381
the only winery on the lake in the country.
You can see the lake there, and you can see

00:11:42.381 --> 00:11:48.560
more of that lavender. And it's a great spot
to visit. But one of the things I really enjoyed

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:55.060
was the tour that they had which took you
around to see how they do their organic gardening

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.709
with their--with their vineyards. And a lot
of wineries are switching over to doing this

00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:05.470
type of growing grapes instead of using pesticides
and everything. But this winery had a very

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:11.449
unique thing to see and that was--they used
chickens to keep things going in there. They

00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:17.699
let the chickens out in the morning. And they
have them in this kind of like a wooden trailer,

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:21.630
like a gypsy trailer, like you've probably
seen, you know. We've seen pictures of that?

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:28.310
I went too far there. And they let them out
in the morning and they go--the chickens run

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.750
around and they eat and they poop and they
just have a grand day among the vineyards.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:38.610
And then at night, they go back into their
coop and they--it's on wheels, so they move

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:44.079
it during the night. And then in the morning,
the chickens are in a new place. And it's

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:50.959
amazing, the kind of wines they're producing
with that--that simple change. When you go

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:57.589
to these--a lot of these wineries now, they
have some really great tours. This is another

00:12:57.589 --> 00:13:02.649
change that I've noticed in the last four
or five years. The wineries have always had

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:06.660
tourists. And a long time ago, they used to
be basically free. You know, any winery you

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.779
went to, it would be free. And then they,
some of them started charging a bit for it,

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:17.200
sort of like the tasting. And now, there's
this other class of tours that are developing

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.009
in a lot of the wineries and they're a special
occasion kind of tours. Like, you can go and

00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:28.779
you can--they cost quite a bit. They can be
50 bucks and more sometimes. But they often

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:35.910
will include perhaps, conversation with the
winemaker, perhaps lunch will be included

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:42.709
or perhaps--who knows what. There's all kinds
of angles on it. This winery, the Langtry

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:49.329
Estate, is--I think in Middletown is the place
it's located which is the south end of the

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:55.079
lake. And on--you can actually continue on
that route to Calistoga. And we did this last

00:13:55.079 --> 00:14:00.500
year. We turned that Clear Lake visit into
finishing up in Calistoga in coming home.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:06.640
It was quite, a quite nice little road trip.
But the Langtry Estate did--has that kind

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.879
of tour where they take you up into the--into
their--into a specific vineyard and they pour

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:19.459
wine for you and they include lunch. And what
was unique here is that the wine that this

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:25.820
gentleman is pouring is made from the grapes
that are in that very vineyard that you're

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:31.199
sitting in having your lunch, which is just
kind of nice. It makes everything taste better

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:37.259
and it's just--it's a fun thing. And this
particular winery owns all the property around

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:43.519
it, as far as you can see. And where they
do this picnic is up on a hill there where

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:51.529
you can really see a beautiful view. So that's
an example of one of the tours. And of course,

00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:55.670
you can go to these wineries without taking
the tour and just do tasting. And some of

00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:01.740
the wineries will—-you know, some of them
that actually charge the taste. There are

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:08.459
a few wineries nowadays that don't charge.
I hope that stays that way for a while. But

00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:14.050
before you leave on a trip, where you know
you're going to go wine tasting, check out

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:20.100
the website of the winery and a lot of times
you'll find a coupon there for a free tasting,

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:26.540
or a two for one, or something. So, it's a
good thing to check out and take advantage

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.000
of. Also at the Clear Lake, an annual event
that they have, and I believe this one happens

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.230
in the spring, it's the Heron Festival, and
a lot of unusual birds are seen there at that

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:44.329
time. And one of the nice things about going
to an annual event is that they will often

00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:50.110
have special things that you can do during
that event that you can't do at any other

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:58.410
time. And that's like at Clear Lake, you're
taking this Pontoon Boat Tours, they—-that's

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.019
unique and very popular and it sells out fast.
So if there's something like this that interests

00:16:03.019 --> 00:16:09.439
you, you want to get on it and make sure you
get those tickets ahead of time and plan.

00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:14.100
Also this particular event has a Wildflower
Brunch which is a fundraiser and also very

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:22.820
popular. Clear Lake State Park, also up there.
Now, the state parks, let's hope they stay

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:29.529
open. But usually, you'll just have to pay
to park and sometimes you can get away with

00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:34.589
not even paying to park. You can park your
car outside the premises and walk in and usually

00:16:34.589 --> 00:16:40.720
there's no fee then. But sometimes definitely
the convenience is worth it. And the state

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:47.040
parks, I mean, almost all of them are worth
taking a visit to. This is one is just really

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:53.779
beautiful and right on the lake. Also, this
is something new at the Clear Lake. Clear

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:59.740
Lake has been—-it's kind of a step into
the past. It hasn't quite caught up with what's

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.950
going on in the rest of the--well, not in
the rest of the world, but let say in San

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:12.030
Francisco. It isn't into full-scale fancy
hotels and expensive everything, of which

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:18.560
a lot of the tourism areas are moving that
direction. There is no Ritz-Carlton here.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.830
And somebody said to me, I think it was on
this trip, that they hope that they were long

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:30.440
gone by the time Ritz-Carlton decides to move
in here. So what you do find is a lot of motels

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.470
that date from the '30s and '40s and way back,
a lot of little log cabin-type things. Some

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:43.050
of them very comfortable and pleasant, and
some of them, you know, really falling down.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:46.840
And in some of those places you can just sort
of waltz in at the last minute and get yourself

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:53.430
a room. This--usually there is room in that,
in Clear Lake. There's several casinos up

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:59.790
there now. But the Tallman Hotel, which is
up at the North Lake, yeah, somebody just

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:07.070
loved that hotel and renovated it. And it's
a beautiful old hotel that I believe dates

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:15.290
from the 1840s. I think it was around during
the Gold Rush. And high ceilings, beautiful

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:22.020
structure to it, and I think they have about
maybe eight rooms in the main hotel, and they're

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:27.660
all beautifully updated. And one of the things
I love the best about this place was they

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:36.030
have the--they have antique plumbing, and
that works. But what's great is its beautiful

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.900
antique plumbing. It's the kind, you know,
with tubes that go here and there, and all

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:45.650
kind--I mean, it's just a-—it's a piece
of art. And the town has a store there where

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:51.210
you can actually purchase the antique plumbing.
I guess they have a specialty shop. So if

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:56.680
you're remodeling, it's something you might
want to check out. And they also had--they

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:02.120
had brought in a San Francisco decorator and
spiffed it up. It's beautiful. The colors

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.040
of the fabrics and just the way it's done.
And I was thinking to myself at first when

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.890
I saw that, I thought, "Hmm, well, you know
now, may-—did they need to bring in a San

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:15.150
Francisco decorator." But then--then I was
thinking, "Well you know, I bet in the old

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.690
days, in the Gold Rush days, that's what they
did. They probably brought in a San Francisco

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:24.480
decorator to make this an attractive place
to people in those days too." But it's a little

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:32.300
unlike most of Clear Lake, it's just really
quite nice, very tasteful. And they have--they

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.920
have--any of the fabrics or the paint colors
or things like that that you fall in love

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.810
with, you can actually find out what they
are at the desk. They maintain a book that

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.620
tells you this. And I like--I like the color
of those chairs. So I was able to get that

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:51.420
paint color. And that's wonderful any of you
that are working on your houses or apartments,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.530
you know that that can be a real godsend to
be able to get the exact color you want. They

00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:01.030
also have next door a salon that's part of
the property. This is a fabulous place to

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:07.630
have a dinner outdoors or a lunch outdoors
in the summer. It's just absolutely beautiful.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.120
There's no people in this shot but you can
see how pretty the colors are and everything,

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:17.760
it's well-priced. A lot of people, local people
go there to celebrate special occasions. And

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.240
one other thing about this property worth
mentioning is that they also have another

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:29.670
set of rooms that are in a separate building
that was built new and they have like Japanese

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.920
soaking tubs. Each room has its own private
soaking tub outside on its own private little

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:41.750
patio, which is unusual out there in the open
air. So, you have your choice of several kinds

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:48.750
of room in this particular place. All right,
Coast South; now, a lot of the places I'm

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:56.250
mentioning today are pretty decent bargains
for what you're getting for price wise. The

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:01.810
book has--as I think I mentioned a range.
You know, there's the fancy resorts that you

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.410
do want to know about too. And then there's
a lot in between and then there's some of

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:11.440
those cheap sleeps as well. We have a cup
of cheap sleeps here. In Pacifica which is

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.170
so close. You know, you can get there in less
than an hour on a good day. And you could

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:21.670
easily make that a day trip too. But the best
western lighthouse in there is worth considering

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:26.620
spending the night, and I have found that
a lot of best westerns tend to be interesting

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:32.990
hotels. They're not cookie-cutter hotels.
They are all individual and often in good

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:39.640
locations, interesting locations. This one
is right on the ocean and its in the Rockaway

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:45.290
Beach area, which is tiny little turn to the
right as you're going down Highway 1, you

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:50.450
just turn off on Rockaway Beach and it's--you
know, that's it, two blocks and you're to

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.980
the beach. And there's nothing much there,
a few shops of coffee house and, you know,

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:03.850
and a couple of motels in this beautiful beach.
This is the room that's in that Lighthouse

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:11.780
Inn. And right on the ocean, you could, you
know, you can hear the waves pounding outside

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:21.280
your window. It's just amazing. And pretty
much any of the rooms in that particular lodging,

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:27.480
that's the case. They all--even the cheapest
ones, you can hear the ocean. You don't have

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:37.310
this same view in all of them but you have
a very good access to the sound of the waves.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:42.500
Okay. And right across the street, Sea Breeze
Motel. Now, this is an old motel. This is--I

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:49.610
think it was built in the 30's. And it's still
here. And its nothing--you know real special

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:56.080
design wise. It looks like when it was built.
But look at that view. And that's from all

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.540
the rooms. It's one of these little strip
motels, you know, that every room looks out

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:06.190
the same way. And they have a little restaurant
that's attached to it that you can have, you

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.050
know, lunch or dinner. I think they even serve
breakfast. And I wanted to mention to it that

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.750
Lighthouse Inn, the one that's across the
street from this, they have a fabulous little

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:22.361
Italian restaurant upstairs that is--has the
same view as that lodging. And it's really

00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:29.610
good. I was real--I even thought the food
was delicious there, a very romantic place.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:34.560
Okay. And then just a little further down,
Pacific Grove, which is the cousin to Monterey

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:42.600
and Carmel. Pacific Grove is a kind of--it's
quieter and it's less touristy than Carmel

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.340
or Monterey, but well-worth visiting. And
if you go at the right time of year, you're

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:53.180
going to see the ice plant in bloom. And I
think the right time is March. Again, these

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:59.240
details I do have in the book that my memory
requires me to say. I'd like to look it up

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.140
to be sure, but I think it's March. And it
can be more stunning than what you're seeing

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:10.360
in this picture, this is not the full bloom.
Now, they also have a little lighthouse there.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.790
And we have a lot of lighthouses in Northern
California, and they're all in the book. And

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:21.150
I love lighthouses. In this particular one,
I had never been inside until just last Christmas

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:27.030
when I was here in the area, and I happened
to hit the right time when it was open. And

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:31.360
it's just a tiny little place, but it has
a couple of rooms that you can go into and

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.800
see some furnishings and things like that
and just--it's kind of nice to go inside and

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:42.410
see what's there. Plus, it's just a beautiful
setting. And notice also, this lady is riding

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:48.730
a bike. It's a good town to ride a bike in
because they have wide roads, not heavy traffic.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.500
The bicyclist can get over to the side and
not worry that somebody is going to run him

00:24:52.500 --> 00:25:00.160
down. It's really a nice place to rent a bike
or bring your bike. Have any of you stated

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:07.430
Asilomar? It's a very popular place with retreats
and that kind of thing, a lot of family reunions

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:13.790
go on there. It's rented by groups a lot.
But when it--and it's on--it's a state park

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.720
now, the area around it. Maybe the whole thing
is a state park, I'm not positive about that.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:27.080
But when they don't rent or when they don't
have all the rooms full with a meeting or

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:34.240
whatever about a month out, they will start
renting the rooms to the general public. So,

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:42.140
you can--you know, if you're interested, they
have about--I think they have about 12 different

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.251
buildings, maybe more. And several of them
were designed by Julia Morgan who used to

00:25:46.251 --> 00:25:54.890
go--she was--she used to go to camp here way
back. And so, it's quite an array of buildings.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.330
Some of them have beautiful views. A lot of
them don't have views, but they have some

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:12.320
other aesthetic nice city. Now, I think this
was a Julia Morgan. Anyway, you can reserve

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:18.220
a lodging there. And then you can--they also
have a dining room, and the dining room is

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.810
like a cafeteria style, so they have a set
menu everyday with the few choices on main

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.840
entrees. I think they accommodate vegetarians.
And they have something else just incase,

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.920
you know, something doesn't work for somebody,
but you can call and find out what the menu

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:37.540
is that day. And anybody, whether you're staying
there or not, you can go there for a meal,

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.840
and they're very well-priced. And the reason
you might want to do that is because the dinning

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.890
room has a gorgeous view of the dunes. It's
set in the dunes in a beach beyond. And it's

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:52.020
kind of nice to go there and maybe have breakfast
and then set out for the day and take a walk

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:57.870
around there. And you can go--you can take
a walk with a ranger. They have Ranger-Led

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:05.340
Tours, and this ranger was particularly jolly
and nice. And you get to, you know, you'll

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.380
get to see a lot of the buildings that way,
so it's a good idea. And I don't have a picture

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:14.890
there of the terrain around there, but it's
beautiful. And they have boardwalks to go

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:19.021
right through the dunes and down to the beach,
and so, it's just kind of--it's a kind of

00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:25.140
place where you just would hangout and be
compressed. And then, if you go into town,

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.040
the have quite a few nice little restaurants,
it's not a real fancy town as I mentioned,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.290
but they have--this is my favorite one. It's
just a little café and it has a good food

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:39.220
and it's cute and they have a nice little
garden shop down underneath the main part

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:45.190
of that house. Also, this town is known for
its monarch butterflies, you've probably heard

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:49.670
about that, and they have an annual parade
everyday. I think this one is in October.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:55.740
And the little kids in the town will dress
up like butterflies and march down the street.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:01.500
And the word is that it's never been rained
on, which is kind of hard to believe that

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.540
they maintained that that's the truth, and
I have to take in what their word for it.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:10.870
They said, "It never been rained on." And
you can see the butterflies. They have a specific

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:17.550
grove that the butterflies like to come back
to. And--so you'll see a lot of them at the

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:22.610
right time a year there. But even at the wrong
time of year, usually there's a few strugglers

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:30.600
around. And in Pacific Grove, it is a crime
to molest a butterfly. You do not want to

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.200
bother those butterflies. You don't want to
try to get one on your finger or, you know,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:40.910
just leave them alone. I think its 500 bucks
now, it might be more. They want those butterflies

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:46.540
left alone and--so they--I've never seen anybody
get arrested but, you know, they have other

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:56.580
people will tell people, and then they leave
them alone. Okay, Coast North. Of course,

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:01.360
the Coast North, there's just endless places
to go, wonderful things to do all along the

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.920
coast. But this is the one that I really enjoyed
a few years ago, I visited this one in Mill

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.850
Valley, it's actually on the coast part of
Mill Valley, the Mountain Home Inn. A lot

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:17.000
of people wined up here before or after a
hike because they have a trail ahead across

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.400
the street from this place that a lot of people
take advantage of trailheads, I should say.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:30.590
And this is a shot of breakfast on their deck,
which is included with the stay there, but

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:35.910
you can also go--anybody can dine at this
hotel as well whether you're staying there

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:41.170
or not. And it's beautifully set, so that
there's trees, you know, just everywhere off

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:47.480
of your room deck to beautiful view. And the
Matt Davis Trail--there is a place--I don't

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.470
think it's a trailhead, I think that trail
starts down below somewhere, but you can catch

00:29:52.470 --> 00:30:00.071
the trail there and go on up to the West Point
Inn. And the West Point Inn is--was built

00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:05.640
a long time ago. It's sort of like a lodge
that you would find in a national park or

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.590
something. I mean a small--smaller than what
we would see at Yosemite or something. But

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:15.440
that type of thing, an old structure and--that
you can spend the night there. But to spend

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.641
the night there, you--it's complicated. You
need to check ahead and make sure that they

00:30:20.641 --> 00:30:26.770
are actually taking people that night. I don't
know if they take reservations, they might.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:32.070
It's inexpensive, but you have to bring your
own sleeping bag and, you know, all your--everything.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.790
And I think even your own food, you know.
But I think they have a place that you can

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.200
cook at. So this is something to look into
if you like to do that type of thing. It's

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:46.280
a very nice spot to consider. I had thought
that we would be able to get, like, a snack

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.630
when we got up to the West Point Inn because
I had never been before, this was my first

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:56.240
visit. And so, I was expecting, you know,
some refreshment, and we got there and it

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.830
was closed. And I found out that even on a
good day, you'd be lucky to get a glass of

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.460
lemonade. You know, they don't really--it's
not really a restaurant or anything, it's

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.950
just kind of they do a little thing. I think
it's for the benefit charity as far as the

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:15.460
drinks and snacks. So, check ahead of time
if you go there and don't have that happen

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:21.310
to you. Also, of course, you're close to Muir
Woods. And any of you that have not been to

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:26.360
Muir Woods, you want to visit that at some
point, it's a great place to take out-of-town

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.500
visitors who--especially, if they've never
seen a redwood tree because there is lots

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.970
of redwood trees there. They're not as big
as what you see up in Eureka, but they're

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:42.671
grand and out-of-towners are impressed. So,
keep that in mind next time you're in that

00:31:42.671 --> 00:31:48.600
situation, a wonderful place to go. Also,
keep in mind--I'm almost positive, they don't

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.440
allow picnicking. I think they have a little
café that you can get a little snack, and

00:31:53.440 --> 00:32:01.460
at least they did last time I check. And so,
bear that in mind. Also in this area--and

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:05.491
we've just missed it, but if any of you been
to the Audubon Canyon Ranch, you know what

00:32:05.491 --> 00:32:12.550
I'm talking about, it's--from mid-March to
mid-July, the Egrets and the Herons, they

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:18.000
come here and they nests and they lay their
eggs, they--you know, the baby start hatching.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.070
It is a rookery. And you--until you go there
and actually see it, you won't quite know

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:28.170
what a rookery can be like. But it's noisy
and there's feathers all over the place, and

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.220
it's just amazing to see, especially, when
those eggs are hatching, when the babies are

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:39.940
there. And they have--it's designed, it's
near Stinson beach. It's designed so that

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:45.110
you take a little hike. I mean, more like
a stroll, but a little bit of a hike, up above

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:50.510
where the trees are so that you're almost
eye-level with the nests. And you can look

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:56.111
out and just observe all the activity and
noise, its' fabulous. And this is a place

00:32:56.111 --> 00:33:02.950
you can bring a picnic along. And they also
have there, down below, a bird hide, which

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:09.350
is a structure that you can go into and the
birds can't tell you're there, you know, very

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:13.650
quiet. But the way they designed the building,
the birds really don't know you're there and

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:19.960
they can't see you. And so, you really get
to observe a lot of interesting birds outside.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.890
And they have a little museum and their barn
there too. But keep that in mind, I'm pretty

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.230
sure it's close. I don't think you can go
this weekend, but you might be able to check

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:33.430
on the Internet and see if they're open and
put it on your calendar for next year. Well

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:38.830
worth it. Wonderful drive just to go up Stinson
Beach in that area and do this and have dinner

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:46.100
somewhere and come home, great. And Osmosis,
which is nearby in Freestone, the town of

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:58.180
Freestone. This is a unique place. It's--they
do this cedar bath. And I put down what's

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:03.040
in it because it's kind of interesting. It's
an enzyme bath. It's a Japanese style bath.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:10.450
There's nowhere else in the US that has this.
And it's sort of like a dry-mud bath, that's

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:14.710
how I describe it. If you've had a mud bath
that's--with all this fiber and stuff that

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:20.649
is wet and it gets very hot. This is dry and
it gets very hot. And the way it works is

00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:31.159
they dig out a spot in the cedar fiber there
and you get in, and they cover you up and

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:37.779
these plant enzymes are decomposing. And they
produce heat when they're doing this. And

00:34:37.779 --> 00:34:42.619
it's just an amazing thing in about 20 minutes,
you went out of there and they have this--an

00:34:42.619 --> 00:34:48.560
attendant that will bring a nice wash--cold-wet
washcloth and put it on your forehead for

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.409
you, it feels really good, bring you something
to sip. And you stay in as long as you can

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:57.660
stand it, and then you get out, and then you
get washed off. And if you're smart, you will

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:02.819
have made a reservation for a massage, and
you can have that out in one of their pavilions

00:35:02.819 --> 00:35:07.880
that they have that are open air, or they
basically are kind of like a little playhouse,

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:14.019
it's what they look like. And the window is
open to the air. And when I did this, something

00:35:14.019 --> 00:35:18.900
fell on the tin roof in just about--I jumped--just
about jumped out of my skin, it was so loud,

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:24.039
and all it was, was some little twig off the
tree or something. But a very interesting

00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:29.650
wonderful massage that they do there too,
real unique. And Freestone also is known--it's

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:33.740
like a little tinny tiny town that's known
for a very good bakery. And I think I've heard

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:38.309
that they have a winery there now that I'd
like to check out. So--but that's about it.

00:35:38.309 --> 00:35:43.250
I don't think they even have any place to
stay, but I'm going to find out. Also, in

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:49.950
this area, if you like oysters, the Hog Island
Oyster Company is pretty famous. And you can

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:57.009
walk in there and just rent a bucket and get
a bunch of oysters there, and they will give

00:35:57.009 --> 00:36:01.880
you the--they will give you the knife and
everything that you need to open them up and

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.579
have a picnic on the spot. And if you bring
your other things along with you, you can

00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:12.309
have a very expensive picnic. I don't know
if they--I don't think they have all the accoutrements,

00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:20.579
just for the oysters, but very nice, right
on the beach. Do we have time to go further?

00:36:20.579 --> 00:36:23.600
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MEYERS: Okay. But you let me know when

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.530
you want me to stop. Maybe we can at least
finish Crescent City. Crescent City, way up

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:34.279
north by the Oregon border. A lot of people
skipped Crescent City, they never get up there.

00:36:34.279 --> 00:36:39.750
They get to Eureka and they might get a little
further, but they completely bypass Crescent

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:44.609
City. And I didn't put it into the book until
just this new at ninth edition because I hadn't

00:36:44.609 --> 00:36:49.960
had a chance to really, you know, look at
the town. And I've always like it, though.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.260
It's a great place to stay. It's very quiet.
It's another one of those places that hasn't

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:59.819
caught up yet. They don't have the fancy hotels
and things, just simple motels, good prices,

00:36:59.819 --> 00:37:04.890
and it's on the way to Oregon. You can stop
there for the night and then keep on going

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:09.900
on up into Oregon--on the Oregon Coast, which
is also beautiful, or you can turn around

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.359
and come back. But it's just a great little
city and nice to know about, and they have

00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:20.660
some unique things there. They have this lighthouse,
the Battery Point Lighthouse which--is another

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:26.480
cute little lighthouse. And you can only visit
it when the tide's out. When the tide's in,

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:32.960
it becomes an island. And you can't go up
there. And so they have tours, and I believe

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.250
everything is free in this. They have tours
on specific days when the tide is going to

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:41.330
be out. And what you do is you park your car
in a lot that they've got, and then you walk

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.690
across--it's almost like going to visit a
castle. And when we went, you know, we saw

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:50.079
a poor little stranded star fish and things
like that. They were waiting for that tide

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:54.920
to come back in. And you can go up there and
you could--if you bring along a picnic, this

00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:00.050
is another place you can picnic. And they
have a light keeper who actually lives in

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:04.480
this lighthouse, and that's a group of kids
from a school that we're visiting the same

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.529
day. And I thought, "Oh," you know, when we
were there and they came along, I thought

00:38:07.529 --> 00:38:12.270
this is going to be--this is going to be difficult.
It turns out those kids added so much fun

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.790
to the experience because they were--they
got so excited. They were so excited about

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:22.900
being there. So, I wound up having more fun
because they were there. But somehow, we all

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.670
squeezed in there and we went up to the top
too, that was interesting, on a ladder. And

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:32.430
this is the light keeper, and he was a jolly
guy and he was telling us the way he got his

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:39.349
job was that he was taking a tour, one day
he came to visit. And the light keeper before

00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:44.450
him was mentioning that he was quitting and,
you know, he was looking for a replacement,

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:49.019
and this guy started thinking, "Hmm, that
sounds good." And he wound up applying for

00:38:49.019 --> 00:38:54.059
the job and got it, and now, he lives there.
And this lighthouse, when you look--I mean,

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:59.500
this is a lived-in lighthouse, but they use--they
have a lot of old Victorian furnishings and

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:06.650
things like that that they--that it's furnished
with, so it has the feeling of a kind of an

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:11.299
old Victorian house. But they actually live
in the place which I think is interesting.

00:39:11.299 --> 00:39:15.269
I'm trying to think if I've seen that anywhere
else before, and I'm not sure I have. It's

00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:22.720
unusual to see them living in it. And also
up there, they have these Marine Mammal Center,

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:31.130
which we have over in Stinson, you know, Rodeo
Beach, that area. We have a grand one that's

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:37.259
just opened. I haven't seen it yet, but I
hear it's really, you know, nice. They just

00:39:37.259 --> 00:39:43.069
opened it a couple of months ago. This one
has been around for a while. And the Northcoast

00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:47.880
is depressed enough even before this economic
turn down that I don't think they're going

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:53.690
to get a new one anytime soon but it does
the job. And these little guys come in there,

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:59.519
you know, and they have facilities to help
them and get them rehabilitated and then release

00:39:59.519 --> 00:40:06.569
them again. You as a visitor are able to go
in and actually see them during the visiting

00:40:06.569 --> 00:40:10.660
hours. They have specific hours that are open.
But if you're there when they are not open,

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.410
you can see that this kind of fences that
they have, you can see through the fences.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:19.859
So you can actually see in here the animals
when nobody is there, when you can't get in.

00:40:19.859 --> 00:40:24.810
So, it's a pleasant place to go visit. Although,
I felt sorry for these guys, you know, that

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:31.930
they're stuck there and were injured or whatever,
but they're helping them. Also, up in that

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:36.690
area, you've got the Redwood National Park,
which just goes all the way, you know, south

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:43.450
of Eureka and north of Eureka up to Crescent
City, it's just a lot big stretched out park,

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:48.349
and there's all kinds of sections to it. And
one of the things that is worth seeking out

00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:55.160
to see when you're up there is the Roosevelt
Elk, which are--there's quite a herd of them

00:40:55.160 --> 00:41:01.569
up there. And you can pretty much see them
in certain places that they tend to gather.

00:41:01.569 --> 00:41:06.700
But when you're up there in that area, your
radio will bring in the transmission from

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:12.420
the park to tell you where they are and to
suggest where you might go to see them. So,

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:19.810
you can actually find out more about that
when you're on the site. And, also, I want

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:26.450
to mention in case you have not been up that
way, when you go up to Eureka, which is kind

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:31.890
of north of the Avenue of the Giants. The
Avenue of the Giants is the area where all

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:36.760
those huge redwoods are, you know, where--they're
just gigantic, and you see them on the side

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.630
of the road. So you want to make sure you
drive that Avenue of the Giants, you have

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:47.960
to get off of Highway 1, and--I think it's
around Phillips Village where you turn off,

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:53.069
and you just keep going on up. Just go till
it ends and then comeback to Highway 101.

00:41:53.069 --> 00:42:00.230
The Avenue of the Giants is the old Highway
101. Years ago, that was the Highway 101.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:04.150
Everybody going up that way had to go through
that. It's kind of interesting when you see

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:09.980
it now because you can't imagine how anybody
could drive at any kind of speed through there

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:15.900
and you couldn't. And--but now I have gone
there, I'd say, at least six times, you know,

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:22.740
in maybe the last 12 years or so. Every time
I've driven that--and it hasn't been in the

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:28.069
heat of summer, but it has been at other times--I
hardly ever run into anybody on that road.

00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:32.599
It's like there's nobody there, and I kind
of wonder what's going on. More people aren't

00:42:32.599 --> 00:42:38.240
driving along there, but it's very quite.
You can take lovely walks in the forest. And

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:44.319
there's all kinds of interesting things along
the way too, you know, like some stump that

00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:50.901
supposed to be the largest stump in the world,
that kind of stuff. Some of this I put on

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:55.180
my book and some of it I don't because it's
really hard to document it. But as you go

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.750
along, you'll see all this stuff, and it's
really interesting. And they have little coffee

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:03.990
shops and things like that. Again, this is
a place that's back in time--no Ritz-Carlton's

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:12.529
here--and a few little places, a few little
lodgings. It's fun, really good trip. Okay,

00:43:12.529 --> 00:43:17.749
back to Crescent Beach—-Crescent City, this
is the Crescent Beach Motel, and this is a

00:43:17.749 --> 00:43:23.890
great one to keep in mind when you're up there
because all of the rooms are--it's a strip

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:31.539
motel again--and all the rooms face the ocean
there. You're facing a beach, no road in front

00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:35.089
just the grass that you see on the little
bluff there and just down a little bit to

00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:40.240
the beach, it's pretty flat. And, it's not
a swimming beach, you want to be careful anywhere

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:45.849
in the North Coast, be careful about swimming
without—-you want to know that it's safe.

00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:51.700
And this one, I don't think they have many
safe places to swim in Crescent City. It's

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:58.700
also cold, you know, cold and foggy, which
we're used to. And they also have tsunamis

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:04.570
there. It's one of the few places where you're
going to stay in a hotel and have a tsunami

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:10.030
warning card, you know, "What to do incase
of a tsunami?" So--and they have--have them

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:15.490
there in the past so, it's a serious issue,
but usually, of course, there's some kind

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:19.839
of warning with that. So, if you know it's
stormy and stuff, you might want to think

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:24.550
about that. But then a lot of people like
to go up here for the storms. They're specifically

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:32.279
like to go up in the winter to watch the storms,
not a tsunami but a storm. Anyway, this is

00:44:32.279 --> 00:44:37.529
again an inexpensive motel. As I recall, they
included breakfast which was instant oatmeal

00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:41.609
or something like that. It was just, you know,
really next to nothing but enough to get you

00:44:41.609 --> 00:44:47.799
started and on the road without having to
go to a coffee shop--and they did have coffee.

00:44:47.799 --> 00:44:54.559
This is what the front looks like. Lots—-as
I said it's a stormy area, and so they have

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:59.439
a lot of debris that's left from that. Should
we do this?

00:44:59.439 --> 00:45:03.759
&gt;&gt; You can do it quickly, yes.
&gt;&gt; MEYERS: Quickly, okay. And then will stop

00:45:03.759 --> 00:45:08.400
with this. I think I'm going to show you one
winery and then will stop. Okay, we're going

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:14.359
to do this quick. You probably know about
a lot of them already anyway. Dim sum breakfast,

00:45:14.359 --> 00:45:18.950
anywhere—-they serve it at the New Asia.
I like it because it's such a huge room, and

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:24.210
I think that adds to the experience. By the
way, if you go to my website where my travel

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:31.880
articles are, all of this has a hot link to
these various places. Drive down Lombard Street

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.950
a must, and especially when you got visitors
in town and you probably know that you can

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:42.480
go along the top there and sort of sneak in
and go down as you merge in with the tourists

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:49.710
who have gone up Lombard the other way. If
you've never seen the interior of a Victorian,

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:55.430
this is the Haas-Lilienthal house. They do
tours. It's a mansion that was here before

00:45:55.430 --> 00:46:01.150
the earthquake and survived the earthquake
and fire and a fabulous place to visit. Another

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:07.720
great one to take out-of-towners to see, it's
off of Franklin Street. And virtual bowling

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:13.249
at the Metreon, I hope it's still there. The
Metreon has so many problems, you saw it recently.

00:46:13.249 --> 00:46:18.339
A lot of fun because you're doing that bowling
ball down the street of San Francisco and

00:46:18.339 --> 00:46:25.890
trying to avoid hitting the cable cars and
stuff, it's fun. We have a fabulous collection

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:32.470
of floating museums in San Francisco, these
old ships and boats and various things. And

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:40.450
then we have--the Pampanito is one of them.
And this submarine has a tour that is narrated

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:47.240
by a man who actually served on that submarine
during the war, and he tells the story with

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:55.190
it. It's very interesting. Japanese Tea Garden
always great, anytime of weather, any time

00:46:55.190 --> 00:47:00.640
of year, any kind of weather. I loved to have
tea there. I think that's part of the deal.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:06.329
But just walking through the garden, just
one of those wonderful things that make San

00:47:06.329 --> 00:47:12.190
Francisco so special, and getting more expensive
all the time unfortunately but still reasonable.

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:15.970
Driving across the Golden Gate Bridge again,
you know, the out-of-towners go nuts when

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:20.829
you do something like this with them. What
should try to do is take these whole lists,

00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:25.869
do everything, blow them away and send them
home, and they'll go come back next year and

00:47:25.869 --> 00:47:33.099
you can do it again. Slurping noodles at Mifune,
which is—-I like that little restaurant

00:47:33.099 --> 00:47:38.569
in Japan Center, I think because it's so reliable.
They have been around forever, and they make

00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:42.539
all kinds of noodles. They make, you know,
they put all kinds of toppings on them. There's

00:47:42.539 --> 00:47:48.859
other places too, but this one is good. And
they have something for kids called the bullet

00:47:48.859 --> 00:47:52.950
train, which I thought was kind of a nice
little addition to the menu. And you get to

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:59.239
slurp here because this is okay. In Japan,
they slurp their noodles. You can get free

00:47:59.239 --> 00:48:05.259
walking tours with city guides, which I believe
is part of the library, the San Francisco

00:48:05.259 --> 00:48:11.230
Library. They do tours--a walking tour is
all over the city, and they're all free. So

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.769
you can go to their website and see what's
coming up. I think they do almost every tour

00:48:14.769 --> 00:48:21.730
at least once a month and some more frequently,
and this just is kind of fun. If you're star

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:28.181
struck a little bit, you might see some celebrities
at the Tosca Café in North Beach. And this

00:48:28.181 --> 00:48:34.369
is apparently their famous drink, the brandy-laced
Ghirardelli hot chocolate. But, remember that

00:48:34.369 --> 00:48:39.430
the celebrities apparently hang out in the
backroom, so that's what you want to watch,

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:43.989
see what's going on there. I've only been
there once, I didn't see anybody. But I hear

00:48:43.989 --> 00:48:48.020
about it all the time, I just missed this
person or that person. Now, I'm going to tell

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:51.960
you about this and then I'm going to stop
because this is so special in the wine country.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:49:00.839
This is new. It's a castle winery, the Castello
di Amorosa, just opened within the last couple

00:49:00.839 --> 00:49:08.619
of years. It's an authentic castle, brand
new, built from the ground up, not brought

00:49:08.619 --> 00:49:13.411
over from Europe but made here with materials
that some of them were brought over from Europe.

00:49:13.411 --> 00:49:20.799
And this is Dario Sattui who is behind it.
You can go there and take a tour and see these

00:49:20.799 --> 00:49:25.160
fabulous rooms. They have a dungeon. They
have all the things that a castle should have,

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:32.079
a moat. And you can then go tasting in their
vault room down below, which is--it looks

00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:39.860
something like this, it's not there but that's
where they store the wines. Okay, there's

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:44.369
a sample of a pass that you can get at the
website. Now, I'm not sure how to go back

00:49:44.369 --> 00:49:50.369
to my first slide, so I'll stop there. But
do we have time for questions or...?

00:49:50.369 --> 00:49:55.009
&gt;&gt; You know, I think we're going to cut the
YouTube tape just to make sure we have that

00:49:55.009 --> 00:49:57.150
all wrapped up.
&gt;&gt; MEYERS: Okay.

00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:58.150
&gt;&gt; But we'll be taking questions afterwards.
Again, you all can get your books in. Thank

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:02.020
you for joining us and welcome again.
&gt;&gt; MEYERS: Okay, thank you for coming. I enjoyed

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.869
chatting with you. Get out there and have
a good trip.
