00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.480
Directors and actors make filmmaking look
easy, but often times the job is anything

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.480
but.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.520
It can take the team days – or even weeks
– to complete one short sequence that’s

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.700
only a fraction of a two-hour running time.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.580
Sometimes, viewers may not even realize how
much goes into getting a great film moment

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.580
right.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.340
Whether it’s camera tricks, improvisation
by the actors, or pulling some strings in

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.971
the real world to get that dream location,
Hollywood is always willing to go the extra

00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:30.830
mile to get what they want for a movie.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.360
Here’s our latest installment of How it
Was Shot: 10 Shocking Secretes Behind Your

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.000
Favorite Movie Scenes.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.610
X-Men: Days of Future Past

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.910
Quicksilver stole the show with a slow-motion
rescue attempt in the Pentagon during Days

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.290
of Future Past, so Bryan Singer knew he had
to step it up for the sequel.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.370
In X-Men: Apocalypse, the Quicksilver sequence
was far more extensive than the one before.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.760
The speedster has to save everyone in the
Mansion, and everything you can think of was

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.760
used.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.340
Singer used a sophisticated phantom camera
that films 3,000 frames per second, so something

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.610
that happens in the blink of an eye takes
15 seconds of screen time.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.640
The camera also moved at 90 miles per hour,
and obviously many stunts and special effects

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.680
were required.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.040
Fortunately for all, it was a highlight of
Apocalypse.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.040
Pulp Fiction

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.130
Quentin Tarantino’s gangster opus is full
of tense moments, but few can rival the adrenaline

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.819
shot Mia Wallace receives.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.390
Frantically trying to save his boss’s wife,
Vincent Vega successfully administers it and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.780
Mia is revived.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.420
When it came time to shoot it, Tarantino had
John Travolta pull the needle out of Uma Thurman

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.560
and reversed the footage in post during editing.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.139
If you watch the screen extra carefully during
this part, you’ll notice that a mark on

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.850
Thurman’s chest disappears after she gets
the shot, an obvious effect of the techniques

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.850
used.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.929
The untrained eye can’t tell the difference,
and this scene still leaves us on the edge

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.579
of our seats.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.859
Saving Private Ryan

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.250
Thought to be one of the greatest openings
in all of film, the D-Day recreation at the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.229
start of Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private
Ryan was 30 minutes of pure hell on-screen.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.630
World War II veterans said the director had
achieved maximum realism putting it together,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.450
which made it endure with audiences.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.100
Instead of storyboarding the huge sequence,
Spielberg let the action dictate his camera

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.060
shots, creating an unpredictable and uneasy
feel where anything could and would happen.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.060
It’s no wonder Spielberg won his second
Best Director Oscar for this film, as he set

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.460
the tone for one of the finest Hollywood epics
that’s become a classic.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.110
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.070
Star Wars fans spent all of Episode 7’s
marketing campaign wondering, “Where’s

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.070
Luke Skywalker?”

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.970
They had to wait until the final scene in
the movie to find out; Rey finds the Jedi

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.590
Master in isolation on the distant planet
Ahch-To.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.870
Ireland’s Skellig Michael Island was used
for the world, and it’s not the easiest

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.640
place to gain access to, in large part due
to the island’s status as a UNESCO World

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640
Heritage site.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.910
The Irish Film Board had to work countless
hours in order to arrange a limited shooting

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.910
window for the team.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.550
Rian Johnson did some filming there for Episode
8, but the production crew had to build a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.580
set on a back lot to get the rest of the scenes.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.580
The Departed

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.280
Martin Scorsese’s Oscar winning crime drama
is one of the director’s most nerve-wracking

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280
efforts.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.230
There are many scenes in the film in which
undercover cop Billy Costigan has to interact

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.670
with the vicious mob boss Frank Costello,
trying to keep the truth under wraps.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.400
In one moment, Costello is suspecting there’s
a rat in his crew and he questions Billy about

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400
it.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.090
Reading the script, Jack Nicholson didn’t
think the scene was tense enough and decided

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.420
to pull a real gun on Leonardo DiCaprio while
filming.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.150
Leo did a great job portraying a character
who is always on edge, but sometimes the reactions

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.420
were just natural.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.770
The Dark Knight Rises

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.450
Christopher Nolan is known for his grand scale,
and he didn’t leave anything on the table

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.170
during the conclusion for his Batman trilogy.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.980
A key set piece is set at the Gotham City
football stadium, which was filmed at Pittsburgh’s

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.980
Heinz Field.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.780
Explosive squibs were placed on the field
surface to simulate the collapse that’s

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.920
seen in the film.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.500
10,000 extras were also called upon, including
several Steelers players.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.680
Wide receiver Hines Ward is most prominently
featured retuning a kickoff for a touchdown.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.490
It helps that the film’s executive producer
Thomas Tull is a part owner of the team and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.800
could pull some strings.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.440
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.930
This heart-wrenching tale isn’t just a bittersweet
romance film; it’s also one of the most

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.130
visually impressive sci-fi works to date.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.190
With the small $20 million budget, the filmmakers
couldn’t rely too heavily on CGI and had

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.980
to do much of the production practically.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.410
That includes a sequence where Joel appears
as a child in the same scene as an adult Clementine.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.670
Director Michel Gondry used the same forced
perspective techniques Peter Jackson employed

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.980
on Lord of the Rings, where camera and actor
positioning can alter the size of the actors

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.690
so they look smaller than they really are.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.550
It’s a neat trick and definitely feels more
realistic than digitally shrinking Jim Carrey.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.550
Whiplash

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:32.320
Who knew a movie about drum lessons could
be as intense as a war drama?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.360
When your instructor is J.K. Simmons, learning
music can be rough, but Miles Teller was more

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.520
than up for the challenge.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.250
The actor has been playing the drums since
he was 15 and played for real during Whiplash.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.550
He has the blisters on his hands to prove
it.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.940
While a visual double was used, all of Andrew’s
drumming was performed by Teller to pre-recorded

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.940
tracks.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.710
His own drumming accounted for roughly 40
percent of the film’s soundtrack.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:59.850
He may not cut it for Simmons, but Teller
is certainly playing our tempo in this film.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.850
Back to the Future

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.430
Marty McFly gets to live out his dream when
he rocks the crowd with Johnny B. Goode before

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.660
going back to the future.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.690
As talented as Michael J. Fox is, he’s not
really doing the performance himself.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.160
Mark Campbell was the one who provided the
vocals, and while Fox can play guitar, he

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.900
merely finger synched to the chords.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.900
Guitarist Paul Hanson taught him the chords,
and then Fox emulated the movements while

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.900
filming.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.070
Tim May was the one who played the riff and
the rest is history.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.780
Credit to Robert Zemeckis for aligning all
those pieces properly, as this became the

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.840
moment of the film.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.410
Captain America: Civil War

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.750
The third “solo” Captain America film
featured the largest ensemble in a Marvel

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.740
movie to date, and directors Joe and Anthony
Russo made sure they delivered on the action

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.740
fans craved.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.540
No doubt, the centerpiece of the production
was the now-famous “splash page” sequence

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.480
where Team Cap squared off against Team Iron
Man at a German airport.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.189
The sequence was shot on Pinewood’s back
lot and on location at the Leipzig/Halle Airport.

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.340
It involved extensive visual effects, including
digital doubles of the actors and extensions

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.340
of the setting.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.360
They also used drones to get certain camera
angles and had to balance several schedules

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.490
of premier talent.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.270
All that hard word paid off in the end.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.560
Those are the behind-the-scenes secrets to
just some of Hollywood’s most memorable

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560
scenes.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560
Are there any we missed?

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.040
Which ones are your favorites?
