00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.060
Today I'm gonna show everyone a trick that can check your arithmetic.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.226
But I think this is something that everyone should know.

00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:10.300
I think every school kid should know this.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.219
I think every adult should know this,

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.860
and I don't think everyone does know it.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.900
It is called casting out nines.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.147
It's a method to check your arithmetic–

00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:21.560
it's what they used in the old days before calculators.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.400
And let's say we're doing something like

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.360
2039 plus

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.560
172 plus, whatever,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.400
1218 plus 3091.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.719
Let's say we're doing something like that. Let's add these up. I'm just gonna add it up in the traditional way,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.640
I'm not doing anything clever here. So you add up column by column, okay, I reckon it's

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.280
6520.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.099
But what if I've done it wrong? What if I've made a mistake?

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.680
So here's a check that you can do. So what we're going to do,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.079
we're going to reduce each of these numbers to a single digit, and the way we do that is we're going to add up

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.260
the digits in each number. So, 2 plus 3 is 5, plus 9 is 14.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.039
I want to reduce it to a single digit, so I'm just going to do it again, now.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.099
I'm going to take the 14, 1 plus 4. Hope you're happy with that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.360
I'm going to do that with each number. 1 plus 7 plus 2. I reckon that's 10.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.949
Let's reduce that down, so 1 plus 0 is a 1. This is what I get.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.139
So I get this 5 1 3 &amp; 4. Now I'm going to perform the same calculation

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.029
using these numbers. So I'm just adding them here. So let's add them together.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:41.009
So I add them together, okay, 5 plus 1, is a 6, plus a 3 is a 9 plus 4, is a 13.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.620
Actually, I'm gonna reduce that down, if you don't mind, to a single digit, 4.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.720
But now, if you do the same thing with your answer, ok,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.140
6520, add this up is a 13, which gives me a final digit there of 4. And these are

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.129
the same and they should be. Now, if they're not the same,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.220
that's how you know your calculation has gone wrong. So this is a way to check your

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.940
calculations without having to do the calculation

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.760
all over again.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.890
Now

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.660
that was a bit laborious the way I did it there.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.839
I can actually show you just a quick way to do it. Just pick a number,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.319
let's say 43. 4 plus 3 equals 7, so 7 would be the final answer.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.350
It's called a digital root. But now, I'm gonna add 9 to 43, gives me 52,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.979
Do the same thing with 52. It's gonna be 5 plus 2, that's also 7.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.200
And that's true. When you add 9

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.779
it doesn't change the digital root, so if you look at this original calculation

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.759
I did up here, I actually can get rid of nines, so this one at the start,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.200
2039,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.700
Well, this 9 has no effect. And I just get rid of it.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.759
I don't have to consider it. But in the same way, this 9 here which represents 90, has no effect,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.480
That's just like adding 9 over and over again. I can get rid of it. Or in fact,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.590
I can get rid of this 18.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.830
That's like adding 9 twice. That has no effect on the digital root. Same for this 7 and 2.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
Any combination that makes 9

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.799
can be got rid of, and then you see, it's much easier now. So what I've got now is a 5, a 1, a 3

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.669
and a 4. And it's very easy to do, and then you can perform the calculation again. Same thing with this lot here.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.860
Look, the 5 and the 4

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.670
cancel out. 1 and 3 left over makes a 4. Very easy to do this arithmetic. It also works for multiplication.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.339
Let's try a multiplication just to see. Let's do

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.509
503 times, I'll do something easy,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.350
I'm not trying to show off with how good I am at arithmetic. So, times 15.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.089
What I would do if I saw that is times it by 10 first of all,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.049
so

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:03.899
5030, times it by 5, which is 2515, and then add that up.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.510
So what have I got there?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.049
7545. I reckon that's the answer.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.060
But let's check. Let's do the digital roots of each value.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.530
So that's an 8.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.200
That's a 6, 1 plus 5, that makes a 6. And we're gonna multiply now.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.380
We do the same calculation using the digital roots, 8 times 6, 48.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.540
And 48 will eventually end up being a 3. And now let's check that this is also 3. If it's not,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.900
I've done it wrong.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.389
Let's see. Okay. 5 plus 4, okay, I can get rid of that with no care.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.650
7 plus 5 is a 12, add them together. Hooray!

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.400
I'm happy, that ends with a 3, as well. This is what people used to do before calculators.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.820
If you were a scientist or

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.420
if you were an accountant, and you needed to check your figures, very important to check your figures,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.620
this is the sort of test that you could do.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.140
So, if you're wrong,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.540
you'll be wrong by some multiple of 9.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.630
Because if you add 9, it doesn't change the digital root, so maybe you're 9 off, or 90 off.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.100
That's possible, true. But this is a check to see if you're right.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.620
Now, you might be thinking why does this work, and if you're thinking that, well done. You're thinking like a mathematician.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.460
Yeah, why does this work? That's a good question to ask.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.700
So,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.700
we saw before adding 9 didn't change the digital root. Adding 9 had no effect.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.849
It's kind of like, if it was Monday, and I add 7 days, it's Monday again.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.629
isn't it? Or, if it was Monday, and I add 17 days,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.560
well, you'd go through 14. That will get you back to Monday, then you would have 3 more days left,

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.629
that'll take you to Thursday.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:02.640
So it's kind of the same idea. Adding nines in this case have no effect, and then anything left is what you have

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.800
after a multiple of nine.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.780
What that means is any number

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.920
can be written as a multiple of nine plus their digital root. So you pick a number and

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.720
you can write it as

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.820
some multiple of nine

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.260
plus ‘a’ here is the digital root. Now, what happens when I add it to another number? If I add that

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.420
to another number, it can be written as

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.370
a multiple of 9

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.700
plus the digital root. Let's say it's b here. What happens when I do that? We're gonna end up with

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.259
a multiple of 9. It's actually 9 times n plus m

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:45.498
plus, these two will get added together, that'll be a plus b.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.479
So, adding these two numbers together has the effect of being a multiple of 9 plus the sum of their digital roots.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:59.959
And that's why this works. You do a calculations with the original numbers will transfer to the same

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.120
calculation with their digital roots. With multiplication, you'll see, we had those two numbers,

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.938
let's say 9 n plus a

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.639
multiplied by 9 m

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:13.669
plus b.

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:15.889
Then you're going to get

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.860
a multiple of 9, which is gonna be 9 times something not very pretty.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.540
So, multiplying two numbers has the effect of being a multiple of 9

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:34.099
plus the product of their digital roots. And of course multiple of nines can be ignored. They just disappear.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.749
... and these, this would be a 9, and

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:41.779
this would then be divided by

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:47.719
1 plus 5 is a 6, that doesn't equal 3, does it? That makes no sense.

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:54.559
We have much further to go in our race for space, so we're gonna leave Sputnik behind. For those who don't know, by the way,

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.839
Sputnik was the first satellite ever to orbit the Earth. It was launched by the Russians. We probably should have mentioned that.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.040
October the 4th 1957.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.280
This man knows.
