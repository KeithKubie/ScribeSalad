00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.670
I have these three star patches,
I guess you could call them,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.710
right over here.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.210
And so I could say, if I had
one group of three star patches,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.470
how many star patches do I have?

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.420
So I literally have one
group of three star patches.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.680
Well, that means that I
have three star patches.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.600
1, 2, 3.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.720
This is my one group of three.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.720
Now let's make it a little
bit more interesting.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.310
Let's say that I had two groups.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.050
Let's say that I had
two groups of three.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.390
So that's one group, and
then here's a second group.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.350
Here's two groups of three.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.270
So how many total star
patches do I have now?

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.650
Well, I have two
groups of three.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.990
Or another way of thinking
about it is this is 3 plus 3.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:54.700
This is equal to 3 plus
3, which is equal to 6.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.100
So we see 1 times 3--
one group of 3 is 3.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.460
Two groups of 3, which is
literally two 3's, is 6.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.450
Let's make it even
more interesting.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.015
Let's have three groups of 3.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.450
Now, what is this
going to be equal to?

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.150
Well, it's three groups of 3.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.770
So I could write this as
three groups, 3 times 3.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.620
And how many of these star
patches do I now have?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.140
Well, this is going
to be 3 plus 3 plus 3.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.530
It's going to be
3 plus 3 plus 3.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.630
Notice I have three 3's.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.370
I have two 3's.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.170
I have one 3.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.192
So this is 3 plus 3
plus 3 is equal to 9.

00:01:42.192 --> 00:01:43.150
And you can count them.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.410
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or
you could just count by 3's.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.980
3, 6, 9.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.860
And I think you see
where this is going.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.540
Let's keep incrementing it.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.830
Let's get four groups of 3.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.820
So let's think about
what 4 times 3 is.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.070
1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.590
This right over here
is four groups of 3.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.910
We could write this
down as 4 times

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:19.480
3, which is the same thing
as 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.810
Notice I have four 3's.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.420
One 3, two 3's,
three 3's, four 3's.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.080
One 3, two 3's,
three 3's, four 3's.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.610
So we get 3, 6, 9, 12.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.160
So what I encourage
you to do now,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.940
now that the video is almost
over, is to keep going.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.160
I want you to figure out what
5 times 3 is, and 6 times

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:01.090
3, and 7 times 3, and 8 times 3,
and 9 times 3, and 10 times 3.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.424
And I'll give you a little hint.

00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:04.381
You don't always have to
draw the star patches,

00:03:04.381 --> 00:03:05.640
but it's nice to visualize it.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.320
We saw 4 times 3 is
literally four 3's.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.780
Well, 5 times 3 is
going to be five 3's.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.390
So 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.920
Which is equal to
3, 6, 9, 12, 15.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.740
So I encourage you to think
about what all of these

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.990
are after this video is done.
