00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.709
- [Voiceover] Margo classified
her favorite paintings

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:06.320
hanging in a museum by both
size and dominant color.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.700
The results are in the table above.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.545
We have this table, so
we have dominant color.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.706
We have large size, small size.

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:14.540
We have a bunch of blanks here.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.682
I'm guessing we're going to
have to fill some of these out.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.847
Margo found that, okay
this is interesting,

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:22.700
Margo found that 1/4 of her favorite

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.068
large paintings were blue.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:28.101
How many of Margo's favorite paintings

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:30.745
have red as the dominant color?

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:32.119
So we want to figure out how many

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.097
of her favorite paintings,
whether it's large or small,

00:00:36.097 --> 00:00:37.800
have red as the dominant color.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.954
So we want to figure out the total number

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:42.252
that have red as the dominant color.

00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:44.020
And so to figure this out I
think we're going to have to

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.660
figure out some of these other blanks,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.127
and let's start with the information

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:48.830
that they actually gave us.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.687
Margo found that 1/4 of her
favorite large paintings,

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:56.332
so this is her large,

00:00:56.332 --> 00:00:58.812
her favorite large paintings.

00:00:58.812 --> 00:01:02.519
This right over here
is the total favorite.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.302
This is the total
favorite large paintings.

00:01:05.302 --> 00:01:09.228
One-fourth of this, one-fourth of her

00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:11.907
favorite large paintings are blue.

00:01:11.907 --> 00:01:15.321
So 1/4 of this gives us five.

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:17.596
So 1/4 of what is equal to five?

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:19.367
Or five times four is what?

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:21.010
Well, this needs to be 20.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.814
Five out of 20 is the same thing as 1/4,

00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:26.762
and if we know that, then
we can start to fill in

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:28.752
some of these other blanks.

00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:31.666
So if we have a total
of 20 large paintings

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:35.950
and five are blue, then 15 are going to

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.109
have to be red, because the red large ones

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.789
plus the blue large ones
is going to add up to 20.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.247
Now if you have 15 red large
and if you have four red small,

00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:49.325
the total number of red is 15 plus four

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:52.275
is 19.

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:55.998
So 19 of Margo's favorite
paintings have red

00:01:55.998 --> 00:01:58.804
as the dominant color, 19.
