[inaudible]

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.450
<v 1>let's talk about all the ways not to do ketosis.
Oh,</v>

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.830
we're gonna knock over all of them because there are certainly more ways to fuck

4
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:15.210
up ketosis than to do it properly.

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.660
So we're going to touch on some of the more common ways that people mess it up.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.730
Ketosis is a fasting physiology.

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.571
All right,

8
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:28.710
and if you are going to mimic that or get into a key topic state through diet,

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.920
there are a few points I would make.
First,

10
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:35.850
I'll say how to get into Ketosis or how I get into ketosis.

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.050
Typically these days,

12
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:42.051
how I get into Ketosis is I will for a day or to have one meal per day at night,

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.280
large salad,
plenty of cheese,

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.260
oil in some type of fatty meat and like beef,
steak,
something like that.

15
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.970
But one meal less than a thousand calories for sure.

16
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.060
It's going to be a relatively small salad,
one meal a day for one or two days.

17
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.230
And I made then and very typically fast,
right?

18
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.600
You want to do this with some supervision,
medical supervision,

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.960
don't do it without getting cleared with your doctor first,
fast for a day,

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.320
and then during that day I'm going to drink copious amounts of water with a

21
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:15.120
little bit of salt in it and I'm going to walk for at least three hours that
day.

22
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.370
I'll do that while making phone calls,
listening to podcasts,

23
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:21.540
doing whatever I need to do or want to do by that point,
end of the day.

24
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.790
And certainly the more you get into Ketosis,

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.840
the better your body will become equipped with mitochondrial machinery and so
on.

26
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:29.880
That allows you to get into ketosis more quickly,

27
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.400
assuming you do it for extended periods of time,
uh,
that at that point,

28
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.780
probably that night or the morning after sleeping a lot is also very helpful

29
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.980
because it can be pretty miserable being in the gray zone between normal diet

30
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.670
with carbohydrates and ketosis.
So I'll really try to get nine,

31
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:48.840
10 hours of sleep if I can.

32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.080
I will wake up and I'll most likely be around 1.2 millimolars in Bhb,

33
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.120
let's just call it ketones,
ketosis using a device called the precision Xtra,

34
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.190
x t r a by Abbott labs.

35
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.810
You want to use those instead of the piece sticks because the piece sticks can

36
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:09.750
be misleading.
When your body gets better at processing ketones,

37
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.010
it will appear that you're not in Ketosis when in fact you are so as much as you

38
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.910
might dislike it,
you use the finger pricks.

39
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.080
I had to do ketosis with high protein.

40
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.450
Low fat doesn't work.

41
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.990
You can look up something called rabbit starvation if you want to see how well

42
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.230
that works.
Doesn't work very well.
So you need to be consuming,

43
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.690
and of course there are exceptions to everything I'm going to say,

44
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:34.050
but to keep it simple,
70 to 80% of your calories from fat,

45
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.260
that is a lot of fat.
Okay,

46
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.510
so you need to consume the fat.
That is your primary macro nutrient.

47
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.710
Other mistakes,
eating too much food.
This is one of the most common.

48
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:48.030
So they're like,
I'm eating all the right foods.

49
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:50.510
I don't understand why it's so hard for me to get into ketosis.

50
00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:53.970
I'm only at 0.4 millimoles and I'm doing all the right things.

51
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.720
It's because you're eating too much protein.
All right?

52
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.740
Or are you eating too much in terms of vegetables,

53
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.900
but people will sit down and back.

54
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.820
I can eat anything I want lily to big rib eye and they're like,
oh my God,

55
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:04.870
I'm Attica.
Kurtosis.
Yes,

56
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.470
it's because you ate too much protein and then through a process called

57
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:09.670
Gluconeogenesis,

58
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.110
your liver is going to take that excess protein in effect and converted into

59
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.140
glucose.
All right,
so don't eat too much.

60
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.540
Portion sizing is really important.
This is what I realized years ago for myself.

61
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.370
Instead,
if I want to maintain a deep level of Ketosis,
small meals,

62
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.350
generally speaking,
small meals,
all right,

63
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.550
another mistake which leads to people failing after say a week cause they just

64
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:36.100
can't stomach the food after all that like,
ugh.
God,

65
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:40.900
I feel like a human cheese cloth is that you don't have to get all of your fat

66
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.490
in your primary meal.

67
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.270
And this was a tip from a scientist named Dominic D'agostino who I've

68
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:50.030
interviewed on the podcast.
You can check if you search Tim Ferriss Dominic.

69
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.630
Then he'll probably pop right up and what he will do instead of just putting oil

70
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:59.260
and she is on everything that you eat,
which gets really tiring after awhile.

71
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.840
He will have say a soup like a creamed spinach soup before his meal and then he

72
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:09.820
can have a meal that appears to be mostly protein and vegetables because he

73
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:14.821
already got this fat bomb in the form of a creamed spinach soup.

74
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.280
It's really about having them close together,

75
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.850
but they don't always have to be a entirely together.

76
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.240
Another mistake that some people make when they're trying to get into ketosis.

77
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.770
I mentioned walking,

78
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.550
doing a lot of walking and they will do intense exercise lifting,

79
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.880
things like that in an attempt to break down muscle glycogen,

80
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:37.270
which they will do very effectively and then they will flood their bloodstream

81
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.880
with glucose,
stopped doing kettlebell swings,

82
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.650
stop lifting weights and just walk and I bet you'll be at 0.7 tomorrow morning.

83
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.820
So those are a few guidelines for more effectively getting into into ketosis are

84
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:53.020
many ways to do it incorrectly.
Dominic D'agostino,
Peter Attia,

85
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.350
there are many,
many folks out there who have done a lot of research,

86
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:59.470
a lot of testing end used,
ketosis.

87
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.190
You used a ketogenic diet while exercising very intensely,

88
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.840
whether for power or for endurance.

89
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.760
So those are a few guidelines that have helped me and I hope that they help you.

90
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.170
And remember,
Tim Ferris is not a doctor,
does not play one on the Internet,

91
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.670
so get proper medical,
super efficient.
Ketosis is not for everyone.
