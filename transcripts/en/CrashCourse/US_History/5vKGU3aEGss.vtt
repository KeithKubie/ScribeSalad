00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Hi, I'm John Green.
This is Crash Course U.S. History.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.340
And today we're going to discuss the events that led to the events that led to the American revolution.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.340
So, we'll begin with the Seven Years War which, as Crash Course World History fans will remember, Winston Churchill referred to as as the "First World War".

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.580
The Americans called it "The French and Indian War", the Prussians called it "The Third Silesian War", Swedes called it the Pomeranian War.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.840
For today, we're just going to call it the Seven Years War on account of how it lasted for 9 years.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:32.640
[Theme Music]

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.180
So, here at Crash Course, we take a broad
view of history.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:44.440
And rather than talking about the minute details of wars, we try to focus on the important stuff: Causes, effects, any time Vladimir Putin might show up, and teacup kittens.

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.430
And as and far as causes go, the Seven Years
War was really like most wars, about economics.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.320
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Is this economics class?
Because I don’t remember signing up for it.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.520
Yeah, this is economics class, Me From the
Past.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.920
It's economics and religion and psychology and anthropology and astronomy and physics and ecology and literature.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.300
That’s the great thing about history.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.720
You can’t put the past into little boxes that you study for 50 minutes a day until the bell rings.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.899
You can’t separate what happened from what
people wanted and believed and valued.

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.059
Right, so, mercantilism was the key economic
theory of the British Empire in the 18th century.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.880
Because while Adam Smith and David Ricardo were talking up free trade and economic liberalism, by 1750 no one was really listening.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.040
Mercantilism was basically the idea that the government should regulate the economy in order to increase national power.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.840
This meant encouraging local production through tariffs and monopolies and also trying to ensure a favorable balance of trade.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.300
And colonies were an awesome way to create this favorable trade balance because they both produced raw materials and bought back finished goods made from those raw materials.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.240
But for it to work, you always need more and more land so you can have more raw materials and more colonists to buy finished goods.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.780
By the way, it’s important to understand the
centrality of slavery in this colonial economy.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.160
I mean, the most important colonial trade
goods were tobacco and sugar.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.110
And both of those crops relied heavily on
slave labor.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.690
And slaves themselves were a key trade good in the so-called triangular trade between Europe, Africa, and the colonies.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.080
As one historian put it:

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.780
“The growth and prosperity of the emerging society of free Colonial British America were achieved as a result of slave labor."

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.500
So, Britain’s greatest rival in the 18th
century was France.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.680
Like, on paper, the Spanish had a more significant
empire in North America.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.440
And they had certainly been there longer.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.820
But their empire was really sparsely populated.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.220
In fact, by 1800, Los Angeles, the most populous town in Spanish California, had a population of 300 and only 17 freeways.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.540
The French colonies were considerably more populous, but even so, by 1750, there were only about 65,000 French colonists, most of them in the St. Lawrence River Valley, thereabouts.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.340
I don’t know, maybe it was somewhere over
here.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.800
This isn’t a terribly detailed map, and
also, I’m not looking at it.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.980
But the French were moving into the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys and forming alliances with American Indians there to try to dominate the fur and deer-skin trades.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.530
And that proved problematic.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.350
So, wars usually have really complicated causes, and it’s very rare that we can refer to one thing as making them inevitable.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.440
Fortunately, the Seven Years War is the exception
to that rule.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.660
Stan, I think I just used the word "exception",
which means it’s time for a "Mongol-tage."

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.400
I guess they heard there was an exception
in town.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:17.680
So, in 1749, the Governor of Virginia award a huge land grant to something called the Ohio Company, which was basically a real estate development firm designed to benefit the Governor of Virginia's friends.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.440
The Native Americans and their French supporters thought this was bad form, because they thought they had rights to the land.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.580
So, the Ohio Company asked the French to recognize their land claims, and the French were, like, “Non.”

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.800
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:39.460
The actual fighting began when the British, or more precisely British colonists led by a 21-year-old militia colonel named George Washington – Yes, that George Washington – tried to eject the French from the forts they were constructing in Western Pennsylvania.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.630
The first attempt in 1754 was a disaster.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.520
Washington built and then abandoned the ironically named Fort Necessity with the loss of one-third of his men.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:59.760
It was followed by the equally unsuccessful attack on Fort Duquesne, now located in downtown Pittsburgh, where the French and Indians pounded the British, killing two-thirds of General Braddock’s forces, and also General Braddock.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:09.020
Things didn't go much better for the British for the next two years, although they did take control of part of Nova Scotia and kick out more than 11,000 French Acadians, many of whom died in what is called "The Expulsion."

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.940
Some of those who didn't ended up in Louisiana,
and became Cajuns.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.440
But anyway, the tide began to turn for the British in 1759 when they captured French Forts Duquesne – finally – Ticonderoga and Louisbourg.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.759
The biggest victory of all came in September, when the British trounced the French at the Plains of Abraham near Quebec.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.379
Montreal surrendered the next year.

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.880
The rest of the battles aren’t that important,
unless you were fighting in them.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.560
And I’m sure you can count on the French and Indian War aficionados to fill the gaps in in comments.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.220
But suffice it to say, the British were victorious in North America, the Caribbean, Europe, and as far away as India.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.900
The war continued officially for three more years
and ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1763.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.920
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.100
So, the most obvious result of the war was territorial changes, particularly in the green areas of not-America.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.080
And even though Britain won the war, they arguably
got the short end of the territorial stick.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.240
Under the terms of the Peace of Paris, Britain
got Canada from France and Florida from Spain.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.900
In return, France got Guadalupe and Martinique, Caribbean sugar islands that were much more valuable, at least monetarily, than Canada.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.860
Sorry, Canada, but if you want to be valuable,
grow some sugar.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.360
And not sugar beets, either, Canada.
Real sugar.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.940
And Spain got Cuba, with its awesome sugar trade, and the Philippines with its proximity to China, which were much more valuable than Florida.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.700
I mean, at the time Florida did not even have
Disney World; instead, it had yellow fever.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.780
But the real losers of the war were not the British or the Spanish or the French, but the Native Americans.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.600
The shuffling of territories meant the French were out of the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.240
And the American Indians were stuck with the
British who kind of sucked.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.680
And as the British moved west, Native Americans
felt compelled to fight back.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.140
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.919
The rules here are simple: if I'm wrong about the author of the Mystery Document, I will be shocked by electricity.

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.579
If I am right, I will be shocked by my knowledge
of 18th century primary sources.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.581
OK, here we go:

00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:59.661
"We humbly conceive that it is contrary to the maxims of good policy and extremely dangerous to our frontiers, to suffer any Indians, of what tribe soever,

00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:07.741
to live within the inhabited parts of this province while we are engaged in an Indian war, as experience has taught us that they are all perfidious,

00:06:07.741 --> 00:06:16.761
and their claim to freedom and independence puts it in their power to act as spies, to entertain and give intelligence to our enemies, and to furnish them with provisions and warlike stores.

00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:26.740
To this fatal intercourse between our for pretended friends and open enemies, we must ascribe the greatest of the ravages and murders that have been committed in the course of this and the last Indian war.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.660
We, therefore, pray that this grievance be
taken under consideration and remedied..."

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.520
Enough! Usually you either know it
or you don’t. And I don’t.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.160
The author is clearly not an Indian.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.100
The first-person plural makes me think the author is probably not an individual, which makes it harder.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.660
Certainly, we’re getting a taste of tension between colonists and Native Americans on the frontier.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.360
But who is writing about this tension, I have
absolutely no idea.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.060
Stan, you get to shock me.
Who is it?

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.740
[Buzzing Noise]
Are you serious?

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.700
I told you, it has to be an individual person!

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.360
Fine.
[Buzzing Noise] Gah!

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.919
So, after the end of the Seven Years War,
American Indians organized an armed revolt.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.800
In 1763, Indians, particularly from the Ottawa and the Delaware tribes, launched what has come to be known as Pontiac’s Rebellion.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.660
Now, of course, the rebellion ultimately failed to dislodge the British, but the Native Americans did manage to besiege Detroit and kill hundreds of settlers.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.539
And that convinced the British that if they wanted to avoid future conflicts, they should slow down the colonists' settlements in the territories.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:27.939
So, the British Parliament issued the Proclamation Line of 1763 which forbids settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains and reserved that territory for Indians.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:37.880
Now, that sounds like a sensible policy until you remember that the British colonists had just finished fighting a war in order to get the right to move into that very territory.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.540
So, the settlers duly ignored the Proclamation
Line and got down to settling.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.900
The other big outcome of the Seven Years War
was that it set up the American Revolution.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.919
I mean, you've just seen colonists ignoring
the British Parliament.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.760
We’ll talk more about that next week, but around the end of the Seven Years War, new ideas like republicanism were taking root in the colonies.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.839
Republicanism initially meant supporting a government without a king, but in the colonies it came to mean something broader.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.759
Now, they didn’t believe that everyone was
equal.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.199
Republicans believed that only property-owning
citizens possessed "virtue"

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:10.680
which was defined in the 18th century not as being, like, morally good but as a willingness to subordinate one’s personal interests to the public good.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.439
This type of republicanism harkened back to
a Roman ideal.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:15.509
Only, you know, without Caesar stabbing and
togas.

00:08:15.509 --> 00:08:16.870
Stan, I wish you wouldn’t.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.460
And a second type of political philosophy grew out of ideas that in the 18th Century were called "liberalism."

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:29.700
For classical liberals, the main task of government was to protect citizens’ natural rights, which were defined by John Locke as life, liberty, and property.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:37.640
For liberals like Locke, governments were the result of a social contract, whereby individuals would give up some of their liberty in exchange for a government protecting their natural rights.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.060
So, republicanism and liberalism were undermining
traditional political authority.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:48.140
And so was the "Great Awakening", in which Americans awakened from being very religious to being super religious.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:56.580
The Great Awakening took place in the early decades of the 18th century, and it was a revitalization of religious feeling, energized by revival meetings and the introduction of new denominations.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.920
In the early part of the 17th century, most of the English colonists were Anglicans, unless you count the Catholics running Maryland.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.800
But by the time of the Great Awakening, there were also Presbyterians and Baptists and Methodists, oh my!

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:16.900
Even the Old Line Congregationalist churches were challenged by so-called New Light ministers who placed less of an emphasis on predestination and more on an individual’s experience of salvation or being born again.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:26.100
So religion became much more emotional in the colonies, especially after the arrival of the Englishman George Whitefield who went on a preaching tour from 1739 to 1741.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.540
The main thrust of his sermons was that humans need only repent to avoid the horrors of damnation and be saved.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.400
And he believed that salvation was within
each individual.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.880
It’s worth noting that this rise in religious fervor was not confined to America or even to Christianity.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.380
Like, for instance, Wahhabism, the Islamic reform movement that's still closely associated with Saudi Arabia, began in the Middle East around the same time.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.220
So one of the keys in the American Revolution
was a breakdown in respect for authority.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:10:00.380
And this was fueled partly by economics, partly by political philosophies that undermined faith in governance from afar, and partly by religious revivals that criticized not only church hierarchies, but also other aspects of colonial society.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:09.100
I mean, if people were going so far as to criticize their religious leaders and established religious norms, is it any wonder that they would criticize the acts of a Parliament working an ocean away?

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.680
We’ll find out next week.
