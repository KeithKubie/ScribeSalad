00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.540
Young women and girls in my country, if I
flashback, you know—how I grew up is really

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.969
tough.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.420
The environment in which you are born, you
know, the parents you have is very important.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.520
That’s why for me I am very keen and really
advocate for education.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.160
Because what saved me is like, you know, my
parents they had little education but they

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.960
had something.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.440
I remember—the day of my birth—because
it’s a long story, I remember my father

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.750
and mother telling me how my father had to
ride the bicycle and my mother had to put

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.560
a lamp so that they can see the path because
at the time I was born in a hospital.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.771
They had to cross a forest, you know, which
had a lion.

00:00:56.771 --> 00:01:02.520
That lion had eaten animals so it was a real
danger.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.100
And my mother—you’re a woman and you’re
pregnant and you are seated on a bicycle.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:20.930
So eventually they made it to hospital and
the first person to come was my aunt, my father’s

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.670
sister.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.549
And her mission was to come and see the sex
of the baby.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.649
And when she opened and saw that I was a girl,
she just made an exclamation, and in my language

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:39.079
it’s like [speaking foreign language], meaning
“This is yet another girl.”

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.329
So for her that was really a disappointment
and she sent the message to the village that

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.349
my mother had given birth to another girl.

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:49.270
So girls are regarded as useless.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.880
It’s the boys who carry the traditions.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.740
It’s the boys who carry the family name.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.171
And being born in that environment and living
through that and like I said, you know, and

00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:06.530
you are being called a prostitute even as
you’re playing.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.119
And then I asked my mother, “What does this
word mean?

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.550
Because the men and the boys keep calling
me this word, And yet I have my real name.”

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.190
That’s when she told me what that meant,
and I made her a promise.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.190
I said “Mommy, I’m going to really work
so hard in life and embarrass these men by

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.470
success in life.”

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.610
So that was a driving force for me and lucky
for me they allowed the girls to have an education.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.140
We walked long distances, we went to school,
you know, it was five kilometers.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.940
I don’t know how much that is in miles.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.470
And you are teased, because that’s not your
space, where you’re going to school with

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.470
the boys.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.310
But, you know, you just go through that.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:57.040
And then along the way that’s when the Lord’s
Resistance Army also disrupted our lives in

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.780
the village, and they were targeting, again,
the girl-child.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.550
They didn’t want married women.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.700
They wanted virgins.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.370
They wanted girls to take for sexual exploitations.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.830
So again with my sisters we had to flee the
village.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.790
I remember running through those bushes and
forests and ending up in an internally-displaced

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.420
people’s camp.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.560
So it’s tough, you know, being a girl.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.620
The sexual exploitation, and if I didn’t
have the parents I have because when my father

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.010
making that decision from that camp to move
us far away to the city, having lost everything,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.210
he had his girls in his mind.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:46.510
And to really drum it into us that we are
not useless, we can amount to something, really

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.570
motivated me to get an education.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.680
So it’s tough.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.010
I know it can improve because I’ve seen
it improving.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.960
The more you educate your people, the more
you educate a girl, the more she stays longer

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.970
in school, the more you educate parents, the
more they’ll be mindful about education,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.210
and so many other things.
