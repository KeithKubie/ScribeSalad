00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.140
Find the slope of the line
that goes through the ordered

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.600
pairs 7, negative 1 and
negative 3, negative 1.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.900
Let me just do a
quick graph of these

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.830
just so we can visualize
what they look like.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.180
So let me draw a
quick graph over here.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.200
So our first point
is 7, negative 1.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.330
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.030
This is the x-axis.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.640
7, negative 1.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.300
So it's 7, negative 1
is right over there.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.800
7, negative 1.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.070
This, of course, is the y-axis.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.680
And then the next point
is negative 3, negative 1.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.710
So we go back 3 in the
horizontal direction.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.140
Negative 3 for the y-coordinate
is still negative 1.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.600
So the line that connects these
two points will look like this.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.830
It will look like that.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.370
Now, they're asking us to find
the slope of the line that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.661
goes through the ordered pairs.

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:01.890
Find the slope of this line.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.890
And just to give a little
bit of intuition here,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.980
slope is a measure of
a line's inclination.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.170
And the way that
it's defined-- slope

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:18.610
is defined as rise over run, or
change in y over change in x,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.630
or sometimes you'll see it
defined as the variable m.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.800
And then they'll
define change in y

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.640
as just being the
second y-coordinate

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.750
minus the first
y-coordinate and then

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.430
the change in x as the
second x-coordinate

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.980
minus the first x-coordinate.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.814
These are all different
variations in slope,

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:39.563
but hopefully you'll
appreciate that these

00:01:39.563 --> 00:01:40.800
are measuring inclination.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.530
If I rise a ton when
I run a little bit,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.800
if I move a little bit in the x
direction, and I rise a bunch,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.360
then I have a very steep line.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510
I have a very steep
upward-sloping line.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.190
If I don't change at
all when I run a bit,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.630
then I have a very low slope.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.380
And that's actually
what's happening here.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.910
I'm going from-- you
could either view

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.470
this as the starting
point or view

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.600
this as the starting point.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.350
But let's view this
as the starting point.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.450
So this negative 3, 1.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.340
If I go from negative 3,
negative 1 to 7, negative 1,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.820
I'm running a good bit.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.190
I'm going from negative 3.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.630
My x value is negative 3 here,
and it goes all the way to 7.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.250
So my change in x here is 10.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.890
To go from negative 3 to 7,
I changed my x value by 10.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.710
But what's my change in y?

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.490
Well, my y value
here is negative 1,

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.030
and my y value over here
is still negative 1.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.950
So my change in y is a 0.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.570
My change in y is going to be 0.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.910
My y value does not
change no matter

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.380
how much I change my x value.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.910
So the slope here
is going to be--

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.040
when we run 10,
what was our rise?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.840
How much did we change in y?

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.140
Well, we didn't rise at all.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.780
We didn't go up or down.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.220
So the slope here is 0.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.160
Or another way to think about
is this line has no inclination.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.620
It's a completely flat-- it's
a completely horizontal line.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.240
So this should make sense.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.230
This is a 0.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.570
The slope here is 0.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.090
And just to make
sure that this gels

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.380
with all of these other
formulas that you might know--

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.755
but I want to make
it very clear.

00:03:19.755 --> 00:03:21.860
These are all just
telling you rise over run

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.750
or change in y over change in
x, a way to measure inclination.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.370
But let's just
apply them just so,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.970
hopefully, it all
makes sense to you.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.010
So we could also say slope is
change in y over change in x.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.170
If we take this to be
our start and if we

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.520
take this to be our
end point, then we

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.176
would call this over here x1.

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:44.300
And then this is over here.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.550
This is y1.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.990
And then we would
call this x2 and we

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.310
would call this y2, if
this is our start point

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.860
and that is our end point.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.960
And so the slope here, the
change in y, y2 minus y1.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.880
So it's negative 1
minus negative 1,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.600
all of that over x2, negative
3, minus x1, minus 7.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.520
So the numerator, negative
1 minus negative 1,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.589
that's the same thing
as negative 1 plus 1.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.700
And our denominator
is negative 3 minus 7,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.200
which is negative 10.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.980
So once again, negative 1
plus 1 is 0 over negative 10.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.329
And this is still going to be 0.

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:31.370
And the only reason why
we got a negative 10 here

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.850
and a positive 10
there is because we

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.110
swapped the starting
and the ending point.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.820
In this example right over here,
we took this as the start point

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.870
and made this coordinate
over here as the end point.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.830
Over here, we
swapped them around.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.460
7, negative 1 was
our start point,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.880
and negative 3, negative
1 is our end point.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.170
So if we start over
here, our change in x

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.070
is going to be negative 10.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.170
But our change in y is
still going to be 0.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.370
So regardless of how you do it,
the slope of this line is 0.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.866
It's a horizontal line.
