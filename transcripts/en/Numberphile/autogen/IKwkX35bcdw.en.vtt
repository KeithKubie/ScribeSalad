00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.090
so I've previously mentioned that

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100
so I've previously mentioned that
 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.190
so I've previously mentioned that
there's a lot of maths in Futurama and

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200
there's a lot of maths in Futurama and
 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.840
there's a lot of maths in Futurama and
I'm gonna show you two more bits of

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850
I'm gonna show you two more bits of
 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.550
I'm gonna show you two more bits of
maths from Futurama there's an episode

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
maths from Futurama there's an episode
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.459
maths from Futurama there's an episode
called The DaVinci Code where the the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469
called The DaVinci Code where the the
 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.789
called The DaVinci Code where the the
Planet Express crew are investigating a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799
Planet Express crew are investigating a
 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.799
Planet Express crew are investigating a
mystery around the Last Supper they

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
mystery around the Last Supper they
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.870
mystery around the Last Supper they
think there may be a robot a sat around

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
think there may be a robot a sat around
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.820
think there may be a robot a sat around
a table as one of the Apostles and so

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
a table as one of the Apostles and so
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.220
a table as one of the Apostles and so
they go to a future Roma as they call it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
they go to a future Roma as they call it
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.070
they go to a future Roma as they call it
and they're in a crypt and they find

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080
and they're in a crypt and they find
 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.679
and they're in a crypt and they find
this tomb with this mysterious Roman

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
this tomb with this mysterious Roman
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.830
this tomb with this mysterious Roman
number on it was not a number and it's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
number on it was not a number and it's
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.990
number on it was not a number and it's
not a date either really it looks more

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
not a date either really it looks more
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.510
not a date either really it looks more
like a Roman mathematical equation look

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
like a Roman mathematical equation look
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580
like a Roman mathematical equation look
at these Roman numerals so to understand

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
at these Roman numerals so to understand
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.290
at these Roman numerals so to understand
what this is all about we need to look

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
what this is all about we need to look
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.270
what this is all about we need to look
at their sin numbers so I'm sure they're

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
at their sin numbers so I'm sure they're
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.650
at their sin numbers so I'm sure they're
same numbers have cropped up previously

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
same numbers have cropped up previously
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720
same numbers have cropped up previously
on numberphile but just to remind you a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
on numberphile but just to remind you a
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.680
on numberphile but just to remind you a
Mersenne number father Mersenne was a

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690
Mersenne number father Mersenne was a
 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.569
Mersenne number father Mersenne was a
parisian monk who would correspond with

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
parisian monk who would correspond with
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520
parisian monk who would correspond with
lots of other mathematicians and he came

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
lots of other mathematicians and he came
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.319
lots of other mathematicians and he came
up with this number which is of the form

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
up with this number which is of the form
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.069
up with this number which is of the form
2 to the power of P minus 1 where P is

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
2 to the power of P minus 1 where P is
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.740
2 to the power of P minus 1 where P is
prime and so let's put in some prime

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
prime and so let's put in some prime
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.149
prime and so let's put in some prime
numbers 2 to the power 2 minus 1 is 4

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
numbers 2 to the power 2 minus 1 is 4
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.120
numbers 2 to the power 2 minus 1 is 4
minus 1 is 3 let's put in another prime

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
minus 1 is 3 let's put in another prime
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310
minus 1 is 3 let's put in another prime
number to the power 3 minus 1 is 8 minus

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
number to the power 3 minus 1 is 8 minus
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.550
number to the power 3 minus 1 is 8 minus
1 is 7 2 to the power 4 were not

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
1 is 7 2 to the power 4 were not
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.899
1 is 7 2 to the power 4 were not
interested in because that's not a prime

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
interested in because that's not a prime
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.960
interested in because that's not a prime
but 5 minus 1 is 8 16 32 that would be

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
but 5 minus 1 is 8 16 32 that would be
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.109
but 5 minus 1 is 8 16 32 that would be
31 if we take away the 1 2 to fire 6

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
31 if we take away the 1 2 to fire 6
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.160
31 if we take away the 1 2 to fire 6
were not interested in seven is a prime

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170
were not interested in seven is a prime
 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.859
were not interested in seven is a prime
32 64 128 that's a hundred 27 next prime

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
32 64 128 that's a hundred 27 next prime
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109
32 64 128 that's a hundred 27 next prime
is 2 to the 11 now one thing you'll

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
is 2 to the 11 now one thing you'll
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.530
is 2 to the 11 now one thing you'll
notice about these two three xi minus 1

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
notice about these two three xi minus 1
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.740
notice about these two three xi minus 1
so that is 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750
so that is 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512
 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.889
so that is 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512
thousand 24 2048 minus 1 is 2047 so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
thousand 24 2048 minus 1 is 2047 so
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.679
thousand 24 2048 minus 1 is 2047 so
these are called mass n numbers ok and

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689
these are called mass n numbers ok and
 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.340
these are called mass n numbers ok and
we put in a prime here and bang at the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
we put in a prime here and bang at the
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.280
we put in a prime here and bang at the
other end we get a prime a prime a prime

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
other end we get a prime a prime a prime
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.589
other end we get a prime a prime a prime
and a prime

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
and a prime
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.990
and a prime
now this one okay this is a bit tricky

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
now this one okay this is a bit tricky
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430
now this one okay this is a bit tricky
actually this one it's hard to tell

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
actually this one it's hard to tell
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.830
actually this one it's hard to tell
whether on it's a prime but at first

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
whether on it's a prime but at first
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.479
whether on it's a prime but at first
sight this seems to be a pretty good way

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489
sight this seems to be a pretty good way
 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.979
sight this seems to be a pretty good way
of generating primed and actually is a

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989
of generating primed and actually is a
 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.960
of generating primed and actually is a
very good way of generating primes but

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
very good way of generating primes but
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.180
very good way of generating primes but
it's not foolproof and in fact the first

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190
it's not foolproof and in fact the first
 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.369
it's not foolproof and in fact the first
number the first mess said number that's

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379
number the first mess said number that's
 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.240
number the first mess said number that's
not a prime is this one here 2047

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250
not a prime is this one here 2047
 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.050
not a prime is this one here 2047
because 2047 equals let me have a look I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
because 2047 equals let me have a look I
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.339
because 2047 equals let me have a look I
mean it from memory it's 23 times 89

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349
mean it from memory it's 23 times 89
 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.910
mean it from memory it's 23 times 89
okay so this mayor said number is not on

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
okay so this mayor said number is not on
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.670
okay so this mayor said number is not on
there send Prime and this equation is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680
there send Prime and this equation is
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.440
there send Prime and this equation is
kind of embedded up here because if we

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
kind of embedded up here because if we
 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.750
kind of embedded up here because if we
translate from these Roman numerals what

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
translate from these Roman numerals what
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.619
translate from these Roman numerals what
we've got is 2 to the power 11 minus in

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629
we've got is 2 to the power 11 minus in
 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.440
we've got is 2 to the power 11 minus in
brackets 10 23 multiplied by 50 60 70 80

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
brackets 10 23 multiplied by 50 60 70 80
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.770
brackets 10 23 multiplied by 50 60 70 80
90 minus 1 is 89 ok and 2 pair 11 we

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
90 minus 1 is 89 ok and 2 pair 11 we
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.750
90 minus 1 is 89 ok and 2 pair 11 we
know is 2048 we know that this is 2047

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
know is 2048 we know that this is 2047
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.050
know is 2048 we know that this is 2047
so this minus this equals a 1 so what

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
so this minus this equals a 1 so what
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.819
so this minus this equals a 1 so what
we've got is is the kind of a mess n

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829
we've got is is the kind of a mess n
 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.159
we've got is is the kind of a mess n
number here which is not a mess M prime

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169
number here which is not a mess M prime
 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.509
number here which is not a mess M prime
which is why it's kind of a little bit

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519
which is why it's kind of a little bit
 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.080
which is why it's kind of a little bit

yeah this is not germane to the story in

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459
yeah this is not germane to the story in
 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.460
yeah this is not germane to the story in
any way so today this put like a note in

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470
any way so today this put like a note in
 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.930

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460
they do they they write it in detail
 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.630
they do they they write it in detail
that you know this is this is every

remember the very one the very very very

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410
remember the very one the very very very
 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.860

first episode of The Simpsons first kind

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870
first episode of The Simpsons first kind
 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.540
first episode of The Simpsons first kind
of real episode in Simpsons there was a

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550
of real episode in Simpsons there was a
 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.960
of real episode in Simpsons there was a
joke about calculus and they get it

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970
joke about calculus and they get it
 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.240
joke about calculus and they get it
wrong on the blackboard the maths is

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250
wrong on the blackboard the maths is
 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.980
wrong on the blackboard the maths is
actually not correct and I think that

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990
actually not correct and I think that
 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.750
actually not correct and I think that
was an example where they scribbled out

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760
was an example where they scribbled out
 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.000
was an example where they scribbled out
two math they sent it off to be animated

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010
two math they sent it off to be animated
 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.950
two math they sent it off to be animated
and whoever was doing the animation

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960
and whoever was doing the animation
 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.780
and whoever was doing the animation
didn't really appreciate how important

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790
didn't really appreciate how important
 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.250
didn't really appreciate how important
the mathematical detail was and there's

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260
the mathematical detail was and there's
 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.470
the mathematical detail was and there's
an error but I think ever since then

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480
an error but I think ever since then
 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.940
an error but I think ever since then
they've been very careful with what

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950
they've been very careful with what
 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.710
they've been very careful with what
their mathematical instructions are and

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720
their mathematical instructions are and
 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.940
their mathematical instructions are and
they're very very careful to check them

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950
they're very very careful to check them
 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.800
they're very very careful to check them
afterwards as well no doubt so yeah in

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810
afterwards as well no doubt so yeah in
 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.770
afterwards as well no doubt so yeah in
an episode called the honking where the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780
an episode called the honking where the
 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.280
an episode called the honking where the
Futurama crew go off to a spooky castle

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290
Futurama crew go off to a spooky castle
 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.070
Futurama crew go off to a spooky castle
for the reading of a will and it's all a

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080
for the reading of a will and it's all a
 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.890
for the reading of a will and it's all a
bit scary and they're walking through

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900
bit scary and they're walking through
 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.170
bit scary and they're walking through
this castle and then suddenly blood

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180
this castle and then suddenly blood
 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.080
this castle and then suddenly blood
appears on the wall zero one zero one

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090
appears on the wall zero one zero one
 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.180
appears on the wall zero one zero one
one zero zero one zero one okay so this

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190
one zero zero one zero one okay so this
 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.800
one zero zero one zero one okay so this
binary sequence in blood it's on the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810
binary sequence in blood it's on the
 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.350
binary sequence in blood it's on the
wall all a bit scary so let's find out

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360
wall all a bit scary so let's find out
 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.970
wall all a bit scary so let's find out
what this binary sequence is in deaths

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980
what this binary sequence is in deaths
 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.570
what this binary sequence is in deaths
and more we've got a 1 2 4 8 16 32 64

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580
and more we've got a 1 2 4 8 16 32 64
 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.520
and more we've got a 1 2 4 8 16 32 64
128 256 ok so if we add these up we've

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530
128 256 ok so if we add these up we've
 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:43.290
128 256 ok so if we add these up we've
got 537 101 357 okay that equals 357 357

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300
got 537 101 357 okay that equals 357 357
 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.120
got 537 101 357 okay that equals 357 357
is not a particularly interesting number

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130
is not a particularly interesting number
 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.800
is not a particularly interesting number
as far as I know it doesn't scream out

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810
as far as I know it doesn't scream out
 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.110
as far as I know it doesn't scream out
as being a perfect number or Mersenne

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120
as being a perfect number or Mersenne
 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.940
as being a perfect number or Mersenne
Prime or any of those interesting

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950
Prime or any of those interesting
 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.440
Prime or any of those interesting
numbers we come across sometimes but

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450
numbers we come across sometimes but
 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.740
numbers we come across sometimes but
then bender the robot turns around and

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750
then bender the robot turns around and
 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.020
then bender the robot turns around and
he sees the number reflected in a mirror

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030
he sees the number reflected in a mirror
 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.840
he sees the number reflected in a mirror
and so the binary digits are switched

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850
and so the binary digits are switched
 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.410
and so the binary digits are switched
around

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420
around
 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.550
around
so let's have a look at this binary

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560
so let's have a look at this binary
 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.950
so let's have a look at this binary
sequence now if we reverse the digits we

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960
sequence now if we reverse the digits we
 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.390
sequence now if we reverse the digits we
now have a 1 Oh

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400
now have a 1 Oh
 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.620
now have a 1 Oh
100 1 101 oh ok so we can now translate

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630
100 1 101 oh ok so we can now translate
 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.620
100 1 101 oh ok so we can now translate
that binary sequence back into decimal

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630
that binary sequence back into decimal
 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.820
that binary sequence back into decimal
we've got a 2 no fours we've got 8 16 32

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830
we've got a 2 no fours we've got 8 16 32
