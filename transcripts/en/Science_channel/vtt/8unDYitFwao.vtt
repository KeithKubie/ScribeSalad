Narrator:
ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI,

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:07.701
FOR JON AND JOEY'S
INSANE FLAME GAME.

00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:10.334
OH, UH, DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.

00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:16.434
HOW DO YOU TAKE A CLASSIC GAME
LIKE JENGA TO THE NEXT LEVEL?

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:19.033
FIRST, YOU MAKE IT
EIGHT TIMES BIGGER.

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.734
AND THEN YOU SET IT ON FIRE.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:22.834
HEY!

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:26.067
HOW ARE THEY NOT
BURNING THEIR HANDS?

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:30.934
Narrator:
GOOD QUESTION, HOT SHOT.

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.901
SCIENTISTS, OVER TO YOU.

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:35.200
THIS IS ALL THANKS
TO AN AMAZING GEL.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.367
THIS GEL IS
A SPECIAL FIRE RETARDANT

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:40.000
MADE FROM A SUPER ABSORBENT
CROSS-LINKED POLYMER.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.434
Linsell:
THIS IS AN INTERLINKING NETWORK
OF LONG-CHAIN MOLECULES

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:45.634
WITH SIDE CHAINS
THAT ARE STICKING OUT.

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:48.067
Kundu: WHEN THIS MATERIAL
IS EXPOSED TO WATER,

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:51.167
THE SMALL SIDE CHAINS
BECOME NEGATIVELY CHARGED.

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:52.634
THIS MEANS THAT
THEY REPEL EACH OTHER

00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:56.234
AND UNFURL TO CREATE
A MUCH LARGER NETWORK.

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:57.501
THE NEGATIVE SIDE CHAINS

00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:00.400
ALSO ATTRACT THE HYDROGEN
IN WATER MOLECULES,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.334
WHICH IS SLIGHTLY POSITIVE.

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:04.133
THIS MEANS THAT LOADS OF WATER

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.567
IS TRAPPED INSIDE THE POLYMER
NETWORK STRUCTURE.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.934
ONCE THE POLYMER HAS SOAKED UP
SEVERAL HUNDRED TIMES

00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:11.434
ITS OWN WEIGHT IN WATER,

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:14.234
IT FORMS THE GEL THAT WE SEE
COVERING JON AND JOEY'S HANDS.

00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:16.767
Kundu: WATER HAS A VERY HIGH
SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY,

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:18.767
WHICH MEANS IT TAKES
A LOT OF ENERGY

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:21.367
TO EVAPORATE IT
FROM A LIQUID INTO A GAS.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.067
AND THIS MEANS IT'S
A REALLY GOOD CHOICE

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:24.701
FOR PROTECTING THEIR HANDS.

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:26.834
Narrator: JON, JOEY,
YOU'RE THE FIRST GUYS

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.767
TO NAIL FLAMING JENGA.

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:30.901
AND WE HOPE YOU'RE THE LAST.

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.267
I THINK IT SHOULD
GO WITHOUT SAYING,

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:34.801
BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT --
DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.
