00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.130
Let's talk about
geometric sequences,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.990
which is a class of sequences
where we start at some number,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.030
then each successive number
is the previous number

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.830
multiplied by the same thing.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.120
So what am I talking about?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.160
Well let's multiply a times r.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.450
And then I'm going to get ar.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.290
Let's multiply it times,
but to get the third term,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.946
let's multiply the
second term times r.

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:32.320
And then what am
I going to have?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.810
I'm going to have-- it's a
different shade of yellow-- I'm

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.050
going to have ar squared.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.450
Multiply by r
again, you're going

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.670
to get ar to the third
power, and you just

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.110
keep on going like that.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.620
And this is, the way
I've denoted this,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.380
this is an infinite
geometric sequence.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.190
We just keep going on
and on and on and on.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.000
And the different
ways we can denote it,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.430
we can denote it explicitly.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.920
We could say that our
sequence is a sub n starting

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.630
with the first term going all
the way to infinity, with a sub

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.710
n equaling-- well,
we see an a here

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.359
for any term-- is
going to be a times r.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.150
And just to be clear,
this right over here,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.125
a is the same thing as a times r
to the zeroth power, r to the 0

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.090
is just 1.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.550
This second term is
ar to the first power.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.770
The third term is ar
to the third power.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.790
It looks like the
nth term is going

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.010
to be ar to the n minus 1 power.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.030
So ar to the n minus 1.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.200
And you could verify it.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.180
If you want the second term, you
say a times r to the 2 minus 1,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.000
a times r to the first power.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.580
It works out.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.130
This is defining it explicitly.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.930
We could also define
it recursively.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.540
We could say a sub n from
n equals 1 to infinity,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.190
with a sub 1 being equal to a.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.480
That's the base case.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.220
a sub 1 is equal to a,
ar to the 0 is just a.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.989
Or we could say for n equals
1, and then we could say a--

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.530
and I don't even
have to really write

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.155
that because we're
making it very clear

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:10.070
that a sub 1 is equal to a--
and then we could say a sub n is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.680
equal to the previous term, a
sub n minus 1, times r, for n

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.086
is greater than or equal to 2.

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:19.710
So this is saying,
look, our first term

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.775
is going to be a, that right
over there is a, ar to the 0

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:26.110
is just a, and then each
successive term is going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.860
to be the previous
term times r, which

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.980
is exactly what
we did over there.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.700
So let's look at some
geometric sequences.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.930
So I could have a geometric
sequence like this.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:44.630
I could have a sub n, n is
equal to 1 to infinity with,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.350
let's say, a sub n is
equal to, let's say

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.350
our first term is, I don't know,
let's say it is equal to 20.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.260
And then r, the
number that we're

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.930
multiplying to get
each successive term,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.800
let's say it's equal to 1/2.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.632
1/2 to the n minus 1.

00:03:03.632 --> 00:03:05.590
So what would this sequence
actually look like?

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.673
Well let's think about it.

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:08.030
The first term is 20.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.200
If you say, if n
is 1, this is going

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.760
to be 1/2 to the 0-th power.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.100
So it's going to be 1 times 20.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.640
So the first term is 20,
and then each time we're

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.130
multiplying by what?

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.550
Well here each time
we're multiplying by 1/2.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.930
So this could be 20 times
1/2 is 10, 10 times 1/2 is 5,

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.933
5 times 1/2 is
2.5-- actually let

00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:33.370
me just write that as a
fraction, is 5/2, 5/2 times 1/2

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.170
is 5/4, and you can just
keep going on and on and on.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.079
This is a geometric sequence.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.620
Now let me give you
another sequence,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.670
and tell me if it is geometric.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.660
So let's say we start at 1,
so then I'm going to go to 2,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.410
and then I'm going to
go to 6, and then I'm

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.630
going to go to--
let me see what I

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.690
want to do-- I want to go to 24.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.470
And then I could go to 120,
and I go on and on and on.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.566
Is this a geometric sequence?

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:10.190
Well let's think
about what's going on.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.550
To go from 1 to 2,
I multiplied by 2.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.000
To go from 2 to 6,
I multiplied by 3.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.620
To go from 6 to 24,
I multiplied by 4.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.080
So I'm always multiplying
not by the same amount.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.530
You have to multiply by
the same amount in order

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.000
for it to be a
geometric sequence.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.270
Here I'm multiplying it
by a different amount.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.160
So this sequence that I just
constructed has the form,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.320
I have my first term,
and then my second term

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.580
is going to be 2 times my first
term, and then my third one

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.300
is going to be 3 times my second
term, so 3 times 2 times a.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.260
My fourth one is 4 times the
third term, so 4 times 3 times

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.120
2 times a.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.620
And we go on and on and on.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.470
So this sequence, which is
not a geometric sequence,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.170
we can still define
it explicitly.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.570
We could say that
its set or it's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:19.140
the sequence a sub n from n
equals 1 to infinity with a sub

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.040
n being equal to, let's see
the fourth one is essentially

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.080
4 factorial times a.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.760
Well, actually, if we
look at this particular,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.120
these particular
numbers our a is 1.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.650
So this is actually, let
me write this, this is 1,

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.820
this is 2 times 1, this
is 3 times 2 times 1,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.140
this is 4 times 3
times 2 times 1.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:49.370
And so a sub n is just
equal to n factorial.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.930
This right over here, which
is not a geometric sequence,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.370
describes exactly this
sequence right over here.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.277
Just to get some
practice with-- Here

00:05:59.277 --> 00:06:01.110
we've defined it
explicitly, but we can also

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.900
define it recursively.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.950
We could also say-- do it
in white-- we could also

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.970
say that a sub n takes
us from n equals 1

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.280
to infinity, with a sub 1, or
maybe at a sub 1 is equal to 1.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.780
That's our first term.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.220
And then each
successive term is going

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.310
to be equal to the
previous term times n.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.510
So the second term is equal
to the previous term times 2.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.860
The nth term is going to be
the previous turn times n

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.770
So this is another valid
way of defining it.
