00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.505
Now let's go back to the phases within a cycle.

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:04.930
because I want to show you how they relate to traditional

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.196
activities of software development. Because this is the first time that

00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:12.066
we talk about inception, elaboration, construction and transition. So we will

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.859
know what they mean, in terms of the traditional software

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.380
development. So I'm going to first discuss these relations and then

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.198
I'm going to talk about each individual phase in further detail.

00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:25.570
So I'm going to start by representing the four RUP phases here

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.810
with possible internal iterations. I1, E1 and E2, C1,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.490
C2, and so on. And just as a reference, this

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.670
is the way in which time will progress. So we

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.890
will start with inception and we will finish with transition.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.710
So what I'm want to do now is to show the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.930
actual, traditional, software development activities here on the left. And

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.970
I also want to show you, using this diagram, how these

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.610
activities are actually performed in each of the RUP phases.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.540
So, let's see what this representation means. Basically, what

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.410
I'm showing here, is that requirements engineering actually starts in

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.480
the inception phase. So, you can see the height

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.090
of this bar as the amount of effort devoted to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.890
this activity in this specific phase. So you can

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.950
see that requirements engineering starts in inception phase, is mostly

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.210
performed in the elaboration phase, and then it continues,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.820
although to a lesser extent, throughout all phases up until

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.570
the end of the transition. But the bulk is really

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.940
performed here in the elaboration phase. Similarly, if we consider analysis

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.450
and design, we can see that analysis and design are

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.510
mainly performed in the elaboration phase. But a considerable amount of

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.900
it also continues in the construction phase, and then it

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.514
kind of phases out. So there's very little of that done

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:37.300
in the transition phase. Looking now at implementation, you can see

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.190
that the implementation happens mostly in the construction phase, which is,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.460
unsurprisingly, the phase that is mostly concerned with actual code development,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.620
as we will see in a minute. Testing, on the other

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.990
hand, is performed throughout most phases, with, peaks in some specific

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.260
point, for example, at the end of some iterations, like here

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.880
and here. To conclude, we have the business modeling activity that

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.160
happens mainly in the inception and a little bit in the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.100
elaboration phase and the deployment activity which happens a little bit

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.420
throughout, but the bulk of it is really in the transition

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.699
phase, which is actually the phase that has to do

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.070
with deployment and then maintenance. So I hope this kind

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.970
of high level view gives you a better understanding of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.940
what is the mapping between these new phases and, the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.760
typical software development activities that we are more familiar with.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.360
So to further this understanding, later in the lesson, I'm

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.220
also going to talk about these specific phases individually. First, however,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.610
I want to spend a little more time discussing what happens

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.200
inside each one of these iterations, just to make sure

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.410
that we are all understand what an iteration is exactly.
