00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.540
&gt;&gt; Alright, so now we have a way to, to look at our modified version using a

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.580
file on our local machine, but it would

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.130
be really nice if we could you know, share

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.290
this with our friends without passing them all

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.985
of the files that we modified and having them

00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:16.325
loaded up on their computer. So what we did

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:19.600
was we made this shareable version hosted on GitHub.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and GitHub does this automatically, it's

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.560
pretty cool, it's this feature called gh-pages. And we,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.850
Sara and I just went through the whole process of making that happen and it

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.070
was actually a little frustrating, not for any

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.510
good reason, mostly because we were impatient. So

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.030
there is a link in the instructor comments

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.400
of this video that will give you great

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.720
documentation for how to make your own page.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.870
The only advice I think we would give.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.590
&gt;&gt; Be patient.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.490
&gt;&gt; Yes. There's a part where it says it may take

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.686
ten minutes. It really means that, so don't, don't think anything's

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:54.299
going wrong if your page isn't loading as fast as you think.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:55.373
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:55.373 --> 00:00:57.770
&gt;&gt; But, once you have your, your page up, you should go to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.275
the forum, share your link and I'm really excited to see what everyone makes.

00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:02.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
