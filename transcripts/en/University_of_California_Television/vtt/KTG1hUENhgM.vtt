(light, intriguing music)

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.990
- Welcome to a Conversation
With History; I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.240
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.410
Our guest today is Jan Assmann,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.440
who served as Professor of Egyptology

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.240
at Heidelberg University
from 1976 until 2003.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.910
In 2005, he was named
Honorary Professor of Cultural

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.500
and Religious Studies at
the University of Constance,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.270
where he continues today.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.190
His most recent book is
From Akhenaten To Moses:

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.830
Ancient Egypt and Religious Change.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.830
He is the 2015 Foerster
Lecturer at Berkeley.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.260
Professor Assmann, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.260
- Thank you.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.260
- Well, by chance, I
was born in Langelsheim,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.810
which is a very small city
in the middle of Germany,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.940
but by chance, and I was raised in Lubeck.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.940
So I spent my youth, during
the war, in Nazi Germany,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.690
and in a medieval city,
Lubeck, at the Baltic Sea,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.450
a city of incredible beauty.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.890
This is a really outstanding city,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.640
or was, because it has been destroyed,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.473
the first German city that was
destroyed in the World War,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.370
in reaction to the destruction
of Coventry by the Germans,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.733
so Lubeck had to pay for
the destruction of Coventry.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.780
But the churches have been rebuilt,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.560
and part of the old town,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.750
and this was the place where I grew up,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.420
where I was raised, and
Lubeck was impressive

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.633
and also formative for me as a child,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.700
first because of its atmosphere,
this medieval atmosphere,

00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:47.163
an atmosphere which Thomas
Mann, in his novels,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.743
Buddenbrooks, catch so beautifully,

00:02:53.852 --> 00:02:55.843
and second, for its music.

00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:02.040
Lubeck was and still is a city of music.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.870
Church music.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.550
These churches had wonderful organs

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.213
dating from the 15th, 16th, 17th century,

00:03:14.562 --> 00:03:18.360
and a group of musicians
that, at that time already,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.670
played on original instruments,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.423
instruments from 17th, 18th century,

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.689
and in a tradition that has
only become mainstream in Europe

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.250
after 1970, '80, with Nikolaus
Harnoncourt and others;

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.643
at that time, they were really pioneers.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.140
So, my mother, who sang
in the church choir

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.550
of the (speaking in foreign language),

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.030
had close friends in
this circle of musicians

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.170
and took me to all their concerts

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.200
at the age of three,
four, five, (chuckles)

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.640
and for the first two or three years,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.023
of course, I had no sense of this music,

00:04:12.023 --> 00:04:17.000
I was utterly bored, sitting
through two or three hours

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
of Baroque music, but then,
after perhaps two years,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.730
all of a sudden, this
was like a revelation,

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.160
the beauty of this music.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.160
- It sounds like you were
born to do classical studies,

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.130
to be comfortable in exploring
history and tradition.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.540
- Well, (chuckles) I wouldn't say this.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.773
My parents were architects,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.013
far away from academic scholarship.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.667
My father served as an
architect in the war.

00:04:55.667 --> 00:05:00.200
I must say, since I
grew up in Nazi Germany,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.480
I think it's important
to know about, also,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.350
the entanglement of the family,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.000
so I'm happy enough to be able to say

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.180
that my parents were strongly opposed

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.873
against the Nazi government.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.260
I stayed with my mother
because my father was away

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.120
in Finland, and my mother
lived in constant fear

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.993
of being denounced for her,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.153
well, (chuckles) dissidence.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.960
So, these first seven years of my life,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.620
this atmosphere of fear and
anxiety, persecution, also,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.253
I think left deep traces.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.160
So, I was raised in a family,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.570
well, of course, of architects.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.240
My mother gave up her
study of architecture

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.720
when she met my father,
which was the usual fate

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.293
of women at that time.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.460
Also, my family was not
only interested in art

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.653
and especially architecture, but also,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.873
they were a typical
specimen of what, in German,

00:06:39.957 --> 00:06:42.824
is called (speaking in foreign language).

00:06:42.824 --> 00:06:44.730
Bildung, which is a German word,

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.683
that cannot be translated,
erudition or not.

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:54.320
Bildung is a very special
German phenomenon,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.320
and it means being acquainted with a canon

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.340
of classical writers,
Goethe, Schiller, and so,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.020
also Shakespeare and Cervantes.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.200
So, I grew up among these books,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.030
in the library of my parents,

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.260
during a time where there
were no children books.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.260
This was in the war, so
I had to entertain myself

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.780
with Schiller and Goethe. (chuckles)

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.060
- How old were you during the war?

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.350
- Well, I am born in
'38, so during the war,

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.073
I was two to seven.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.070
When the war was over, finally, in '45,

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:41.070
I was still seven years old,
but I have a very clear memory

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.030
of the enormous, how do you call it,

00:07:48.943 --> 00:07:50.960
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.620
when it were not the
Russians but the British

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.070
who came to Lubeck; Lubeck
is just at the border.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.430
This was a competition from East and West:

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.180
who will be first?

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.350
My mother, of course, lived

00:08:07.774 --> 00:08:12.690
in the fear of having to
face the Russian occupation,

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.370
but happily enough, it were
the Scots who moved into Lubeck

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.387
with their (speaking in foreign language),

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:21.963
their...

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.160
- Bagpipes.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.993
Yeah.

00:08:24.993 --> 00:08:25.826
- Bagpipes, yeah.

00:08:25.826 --> 00:08:26.730
Wonderful.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.093
This was such a relief,
that were the British.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.480
Yeah, I was seven years old

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.020
and Lubeck was heavily destroyed,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.540
and the ruins were our playground.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.840
Our main occupation was
to dig in the ruins,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.870
so this was my first encounter
with archeology, (chuckles)

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.510
to dig in the ruins for precious things:

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.413
tiles from the bathrooms, glazed tiles,

00:08:59.413 --> 00:09:04.413
or whatever children will
find and treasure as precious.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.470
- So, how did you make, as
you grew, you were in school,

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.020
how did you move toward
the study of Ancient Egypt?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.620
- Yeah (chuckles), well,
I didn't hear anything

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.913
about Ancient Egypt in school,
and I was not interested,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.910
so much, in ancient history.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.010
What interested me then was only music,

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:38.010
and I occupied myself in writing music,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:44.220
and I even went so far
to write an whole opera,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.947
which I started studying
with my fellow pupils,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.873
but was a huge thing, this opera.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.000
It took one year, to
compose it and to study it,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.680
and this year, then, it came too close

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.047
to our (speaking in foreign language),

00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:09.490
our final exam of high school in Germany,

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.860
so the director of our school
forbade any more exercises

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.373
of this sort.
- No more opera.

00:10:15.373 --> 00:10:17.010
- No more opera.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.280
So I gave up composing, also because

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.403
with growing, let's say, knowledge,

00:10:27.598 --> 00:10:31.530
I became also aware of a
certain lack of talent.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.253
So, when I came to the university,

00:10:37.024 --> 00:10:39.980
I started with archeology.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.513
When I was 16, 17,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.220
my parents were friends
of an art historian

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.550
who was, during the Nazi time,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:04.550
director of the Kunsthalle,
the art museum in Mannheim,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.540
and was fired by the Nazis
because he acquired too much

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.460
of paintings which they deemed

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.577
to be (speaking in foreign language),

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:19.240
modern paintings: French, Impressionist,

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.940
but also, of course, Cubism
and all this modern art.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.430
So he was fired by the Nazis
and lived in Heidelberg

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.563
as an honorary professor.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.640
He was a great friend of my parents,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.230
and he took a certain care of me,

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.450
and initiated me into his world,

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.420
which was through a
tradition of Aby Warburg.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.900
Aby Warburg, this art
historian who invented

00:11:51.847 --> 00:11:54.797
this special form of (speaking
in foreign language).

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.030
German, (speaking in foreign language),

00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:01.890
is totally different
from what, in America,

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.750
is called cultural studies.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.660
It has nothing to do with culture
as a system of difference,

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.710
but it has to do with context,

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:16.710
studying a given object in
all its cultural contexts:

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:23.130
synchronically, who gave the
order, what was the function,

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.623
and so on, but also diachronically.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.530
This perhaps laid the foundation

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:34.330
of what I later became
to call cultural memory.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.293
This is also a Warburgian concept.

00:12:38.361 --> 00:12:41.493
So, our friend, Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub,

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.720
was a representative of
this school of thought

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.030
to study art in all its cultural contexts,

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.780
not as an isolated phenomenon

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.873
but as an expression of culture.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.947
So, this friend,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.330
who acted as a kind of mentor for me,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.173
recommended classical archeology.

00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:15.381
So, I started with classical
archeology, but soon,

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.723
since I had these ideas of context,

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.690
the impression I should study
not only Greek history and art

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:31.690
but everything that was around
on the Mediterranean scene,

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.180
so I came across a introductory
course on hieroglyphs

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.720
and got hooked immediately.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.240
This was a kind of seduction,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.090
such a fascinating script, hieroglyphs.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.860
- Given your background, the
notion of digging, (chuckles)

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.810
in the beginning, digging in these ruins,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:03.560
but then also coming to
understand the complexity

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.430
of a whole political, cultural
system in ancient times,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.670
it seems to be a path that you followed

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.010
that came naturally, in a
way, with a lot of hard work.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.210
- Yeah, I didn't follow it consciously,

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.499
but in retrospect--
- You fell into it.

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:20.600
(both men laugh)

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.620
Yeah.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.820
I like to ask my guests
what skills and temperament

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.310
you think go with the
kind of studies you do,

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.850
how would you advise students.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.790
How should they prepare for doing the work

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.930
of studying classical Egypt,
and what sort of temperament

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.510
do they need to have?

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.350
- I'm not a typical Egyptologist.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:52.350
The typical Egyptologist
starts at the age of 10 or 12,

00:14:52.442 --> 00:14:57.442
reading introductions to
hieroglyphs under his desk,

00:15:01.741 --> 00:15:05.190
being fascinated by a
kind of cryptography,

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.160
these hieroglyphs, and so on,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.920
and then turning to Arabic, the Orient,

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.033
this kind of Orientalism;
this is a typical way,

00:15:17.036 --> 00:15:22.036
and I'm untypical in having
come to Egypt via Greece,

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.323
the classical tradition, and also,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.360
being raised in a family
of, in a way, artists,

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:39.790
architecture and so on, without
any scholarly background.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:45.210
So, what I had to learn,
but perhaps I didn't have it

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.400
to learn, perhaps it was already in me,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.630
because also in my family,
I was a kind of stranger

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.593
with my music and other interests;

00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:00.990
what is important is a
certain love for scholarship,

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.310
this kind of rather exotic knowledge,

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.030
and without a certain
passion for this kind

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.890
of exotic knowledge, it's
useless to study Egyptology.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:12.923
It's not,

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.530
it's not just a profession,

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.760
but really, it's both, a
hobby and a profession,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.610
and you never get rid
of it; by day and night,

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:30.083
you are living in this exotic world.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.280
This is also the fascination of it.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.280
It's not our own tradition,
but another tradition.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.170
So, first I would recommend is

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:47.660
learn as many languages as possible

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.320
relating to this ancient world,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.840
and to be as fascinated by this kind

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.313
of activity as possible.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.140
Also, I think,

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:08.140
one must have a certain interest and

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.403
liking of writing.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.360
This kind of study really
is a constant effort

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.540
at translating:
translating Egyptian texts,

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.171
translating Egyptian culture,

00:17:35.171 --> 00:17:40.171
or more generally expressed,
translating a foreign culture

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.923
into understandable language.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.770
This explains why I've
written so many books,

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.403
but this is important.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.760
This constant effort at
articulating, in your own language

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.660
and the language of
your fellow countrymen,

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.603
what you are finding.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.500
- Talk a little about the
intellectual community

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.283
of Egyptologists; in other
words, how do they learn,

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.410
in other words, when
do breakthroughs come,

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.710
is it based on archeological finds

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:31.584
or the work of other scholars
in the field, and then,

00:18:31.584 --> 00:18:36.150
in addition, it sounds like
you cross many disciplines,

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.840
so that makes you unique in a sense

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.700
because of this broader
interest in biblical studies,

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.530
cultural studies, and so on.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:46.832
- Yeah.

00:18:46.832 --> 00:18:48.840
The special thing about Egyptology

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.513
is that it is not divided
in archeology and philology,

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.790
whereas Greek studies, and even now, also,

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:02.350
Mesopotamia, Assyriology, is divided

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:07.350
in an archeological
field and a philological.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.890
These two fields do not go together,

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.520
they are separate chairs in universities,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.933
whereas in Egyptology, this wouldn't work.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.223
There are inscriptions on every object,

00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:29.540
and this, I find rewarding,
that script and language

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:34.060
go together with art and
architecture and so on.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:39.060
So, the decisive discoveries
or breakthroughs or so,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:45.550
in my life, were due both to excavation,

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.250
finding new texts; at
heart I'm a philologist,

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.180
so I live by texts, by
language, and so on,

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.100
but these texts have to be discovered,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.323
they have to be excavated.

00:20:03.253 --> 00:20:08.253
So, most of the, for me,
really decisive inscriptions

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:16.050
and texts and so, I
discovered in Egyptian tombs,

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.990
tomb inscriptions and so on.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.800
But on the other hand, of course, also,

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.800
the encounters with important
teachers and colleagues.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.540
I was fortunate enough
to spend a year in Paris

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.390
with a teacher, Georges Posener,

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.660
who was really a great philologist,

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.570
and discoverer and decipherer of texts,

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.563
and living with these texts,

00:20:52.077 --> 00:20:56.957
and really a passionate
philologist and Egyptologist.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.810
I think it's at Paris where I turned

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.360
into a real Egyptologist, only at Paris

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.283
at the age of 22, late enough.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.520
So, this combination

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:25.010
of excavation, discovery,
on the spot, on location,

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.240
in situ, the text, on the one hand,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.880
normal philological work in the library,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.150
with texts of all sorts

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.790
on the other hand; this
combination was very fascinating

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.550
and helped me a lot.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.170
The real breakthroughs, well,
this encounter with Posener,

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:50.113
but also, later,

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.960
I traveled to Uppsala

00:21:54.478 --> 00:21:59.478
to spend two weeks with a
colleague, Torgny Save-Soderbergh,

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.240
who had built up, in Uppsala, an archive

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.250
of Theban tombs.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:11.140
Thebes, more than Luxor, the west side,

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:16.140
is a site where five
different cemeteries exist,

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:23.010
starting, as far as date is concerned,

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.840
starting in the third millennium BCE

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.990
and continued until Roman period.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.063
Hundreds and hundreds of tombs.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.250
Save-Soderbergh collected everything

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.483
pertaining to this necropolis:

00:22:43.379 --> 00:22:47.447
hand-copies of inscriptions
and photographs and slides,

00:22:48.802 --> 00:22:52.090
and I spent two weeks in this archive,

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.740
and in this archive, I had begun working

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.440
on a dissertation on Egyptian hymns.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.830
Hymns, in this archive,
I discovered hundreds,

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.960
hundreds of unpublished inscriptions,

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.240
and I'm still...

00:23:12.515 --> 00:23:15.060
When I, this morning, will give a lecture

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.200
on the evolution of religious
thought in Ancient Egypt,

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.200
I'm still living on this
discovery in Uppsala.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.430
This was a real breakthrough.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:31.430
Then, at that time, one
had very little opportunity

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.920
to go to Egypt as a student.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.290
This was very expensive...

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.760
Impossible.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.220
So, I had to wait for my doctoral exam

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:49.220
and until I got a travel fellowship.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.270
I then went to Egypt,
went into all these tombs,

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.260
which was, at that period, still possible;

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.660
now it's not, they are closed,

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.700
you have to apply for
the permission to enter

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.970
and this is very complicated,
but at that time,

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.100
I was given a bunch of keys

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.630
and was left alone,
(Harry laughs)

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:13.450
could go in all these tombs,
and made copies of hundreds

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.103
of these hymns.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.373
And then I started my own excavation.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.260
- Talk a little bit about
this moment of discovery.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.520
The picture of an archeologist
or an Egyptologist

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.940
going into an ancient tomb
appears again and again

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.670
in the movies as part of an adventure.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:41.130
Talk about your emotions
in terms of doing that,

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:45.523
and then some moment of
creative discovery, basically.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.019
Is it like it's shown in the movies?

00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:53.093
(both chuckle)

00:24:53.093 --> 00:24:55.480
- Well, there are small
tombs, there are big tombs,

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.803
and these big tombs, it's really
a maze of rooms, corridors,

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.893
staircases and so on, all
covered with inscriptions.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:14.820
What I did first was just sit
with a lamp of petrol, oil,

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.853
and copy these inscriptions,

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.053
and everyday I was able
to enter another tomb

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.813
to find other inscriptions.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.550
This was really
breathtaking, but also hard,

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.110
also hard work, because it's
very hot in these tombs,

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.463
and most of them are full of bats.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.510
This is not,

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.050
well, there is a certain...

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:54.200
It smells bad, these bats,
but they are also frightening,

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.255
if there's a little space and
they fly around and so on,

00:25:58.255 --> 00:26:03.255
so it demands a certain
(chuckles) amount of heroism

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.933
to do this work.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.220
It's a combination of
fascination and exhaustion.

00:26:18.888 --> 00:26:20.260
- Exhaustion?

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.760
- Exhaustion, yes, yes, you are exhausted

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.810
after a day spent in these tombs.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.400
It's a very special experience,
to enter these tombs

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.650
and to find these things.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.753
Then, when we started excavation,

00:26:33.753 --> 00:26:36.960
this is another kind of experience.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.650
The normal excavation work
can be extremely boring.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:45.650
You spend hours and hours
and hours on the site

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.940
and nothing happens.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.660
The usual stuff, which comes to light

00:26:54.015 --> 00:26:57.247
and which has to be drawn
and photographed and copied,

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.030
but all this is routine work and can be...

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:07.188
You start at six o'clock in the morning,

00:27:07.188 --> 00:27:10.230
and this goes until two
o'clock in the afternoon,

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.760
hours and hours, and
then, all of a sudden,

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.220
something really sensational appears,

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:21.220
that's once in 10 years or so. (chuckles)

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.310
This is perhaps too pessimistic.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.970
Let's say once in two years.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:33.970
- So, it sounds like a mixture
of courage and patience,

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.390
but also you're coming
there with a background

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:44.390
that allows you to see the
significance of something new.

00:27:44.514 --> 00:27:45.979
- [Jan] Yes, yes.

00:27:45.979 --> 00:27:49.520
- If you didn't have
that previous hard work

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.343
before you get to the, yes.

00:27:52.343 --> 00:27:53.176
- Yeah.

00:27:53.176 --> 00:27:55.130
I did this excavation...

00:27:57.643 --> 00:28:00.490
I told you, I started with a
dissertation on Egyptian hymns,

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:05.490
I made a collection of
these Egyptian hymns,

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.600
this means texts of
adoration to a certain deity,

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.447
and these texts display

00:28:15.747 --> 00:28:18.393
the theology of this deity.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:24.320
What I very soon discovered was

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:29.290
that there was a kind of development,

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:34.290
that these texts were not
only repeating the same motifs

00:28:35.469 --> 00:28:38.920
all over, but there was
a very clear development

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.923
leading first to this monotheistic
revolution by Akhenaten,

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.367
which was a radicalization
of a certain movement

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.313
that went before and continued after it,

00:29:01.697 --> 00:29:06.697
and then led to a type of theology

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.643
which, this was my thesis,

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.860
survived in Greek texts
and was handed down

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.093
to the Renaissance and the 18th century.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.860
There was a kind of continuity

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.380
by the medium of Greek

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.273
philosophers, travelers, intellectuals,

00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:44.694
and also, of course, Egyptian
priests who learned Greek

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.410
and tried to translate their theology

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:53.410
into Greek language, and
Greek philosophy, also.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.090
They have, also, this certain
mixture of neo-Platonism

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.133
and Egyptian theology in these texts.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.120
This was what fascinated me,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.120
and I think I have discovered
this development of thought,

00:30:14.463 --> 00:30:17.913
and I discovered it in
these tomb inscriptions.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.190
The great advantage of
tomb inscriptions is

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.430
that the texts are dated,

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:30.430
and located, and also, socially located,

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.983
so the texts are different
if they appear in the tomb

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:43.030
of a high priest, or officer
in the administration,

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.920
a high-ranking officer
or a low-ranking officer,

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.880
so this makes

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.323
discernible differences:

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:02.540
differences in time, in space,

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.690
and also in social structure.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:10.120
- It sounds like this
hearkens back to your mentor,

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.120
who taught you cultural
studies in the German sense,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:20.830
that in Egyptology, you have the artifacts

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:26.970
that lets you contextualize
what you're finding.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:31.340
One of the themes in
this collection of essays

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.340
is the evolution of ideas in religion,

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.730
especially in Egypt.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.390
Talk a little about that,

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.010
because you make an important distinction

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:49.010
between how in a theology,
you get an evolution of ideas,

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:54.070
a gradual change, and this
leads to your discussion

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.880
of a period in which there was monotheism

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.870
in the Egyptian religion.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:05.153
- I don't believe in a general evolution

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:12.070
in religion, evolution from
polytheism to monotheism,

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.970
I don't believe in this general concept,

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.040
but I believe in an evolution of ideas,

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.440
which has certain
presuppositions, requirements.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.540
So, in order to have
an evolution of ideas,

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.170
there must be a discourse,
and a discourse requires

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:38.840
that the statements are
preserved in writing

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.690
and accessible to later generations

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.800
that can build on these earlier statements

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.800
and develop the ideas, and also
reject them, react to them.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:57.513
These are the conditions,
also: writing, accessibility,

00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:03.270
and also, a kind of professionalization.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.260
All these conditions were
given in Egypt at that time.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:15.260
There was professional class
of literate people, priests

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:26.018
and scribes, at the administration,

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.163
these high- and middle-ranking officials,

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.380
a class of literate professionals,

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:39.070
who were keenly interested
in ideas about the divine,

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:44.070
and who not only had hymns
inscribed in their tombs,

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.083
but obviously,

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.770
who took an individual
part in the composition

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:57.483
of these hymns, because these
hymns were fairly individual.

00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:05.380
So, we have all the conditions
for a discourse to develop,

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:10.380
and I think this explains
this evolution of ideas

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.957
between 1500 and 1100 BCE.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.930
It does not continue, and
also, what went before

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:27.497
was very repetitive, but
during these 400 years,

00:34:27.497 --> 00:34:31.793
there was a real development.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.140
This development or evolution of ideas

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:41.550
reacted to certain historical experiences,

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:44.300
and I think the most
decisive experience was

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:50.230
the breakdown of their
traditional image of the world,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.393
Egypt coextensive with creation,

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:01.950
the ordered world surrounded by chaos.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.623
This was the traditional image.

00:35:10.357 --> 00:35:13.030
In the middle of the second millennium,

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:18.030
Egypt was ruled by foreign invaders,

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.117
the so-called Hyksos, who brought to Egypt

00:35:26.117 --> 00:35:28.533
new techniques of warfare,

00:35:31.992 --> 00:35:36.690
and were subsequently expelled
by a kind of liberation war.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:45.950
Then, Egypt, by expelling these Hyksos,

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.900
inherited their kingdom,

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.863
so, their Asiatic, Middle-Eastern realm.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:00.000
So, Egypt expanded, to
the south, to the north,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
became an empire, and came into
contact with other empires:

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.370
the Hittites, the Babylonians,

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:12.370
Mitanni, which was then Assyria,

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.720
and entered in, also, in
diplomatic relationships,

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.290
correspondences, and so on.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:24.920
So, they learned that the
ordered world did not end

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.503
with the Egyptian borders,

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.593
and this led to a kind
of universalist thinking.

00:36:40.128 --> 00:36:43.740
So, the idea that the
Creator was responsible

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.243
not only for Egypt but
also for these countries,

00:36:52.897 --> 00:36:56.647
which meant, also, that
the sun, the sun god,

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.450
became more and more important,

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.290
because the sun was the visible symbol

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:06.303
of universal activity, rulership.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:12.420
So, the traditional polytheistic image

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.610
became more and more

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:24.580
challenged, and the
position of the sun god

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.060
became more and more
important, until Akhenaten

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.663
introduced a radicalization of this image,

00:37:43.671 --> 00:37:48.640
abolished all the other gods
in favor of the sun god,

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.850
which, for him, was not
the traditional sun god;

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:54.053
the traditional sun god was,

00:37:55.296 --> 00:37:57.160
(chuckles) well, not only the sun,

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.090
the sun was the visible symbol

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:04.450
of a deity that was hidden behind,

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:09.450
but for Akhenaten, it was
the sun and only the sun.

00:38:09.616 --> 00:38:12.700
- This was a ruler of
Egypt, in about 13...

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:17.230
- 1350s, I think, '60s,
'50s, '40s, and so on.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.370
So, this was a monotheism,

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:25.370
but perhaps, rather, a
monism, because the sun

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.323
was just the sun; it was
not a personal deity.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:36.730
For the king, it was, so there
was a personal relationship

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.730
between the sun, the
father, the king, the sun,

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.100
but not for human beings,
they were on the same plane

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.480
as the animals, the plants, and so on,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.210
living by the light, and also by the time.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:57.210
The sun not only emits light,
but also time, by its motion.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.120
This was the idea of Akhenaten,

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.120
that the whole reality can be explained

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.090
as the activity of the sun,

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:15.090
so the other gods are unnecessary,
they are just fictions.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.060
- In your work, you make a
comparison and a distinction

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.713
between Akhenaten and Moses.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.280
In other words, there are
some striking similarities,

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.120
but striking differences.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.080
- There's one similarity, which is

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.910
the abolition of other gods,

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.330
and I think this is a very bold step,

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.633
to negate the existence of gods.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.800
Akhenaten was the first
one to take this step,

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.900
to just negate the
existence of other gods,

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:01.600
with whom Egyptians had lived
for more than 2,000 years.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.200
This was a very bold step.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.200
Then, we meet the same
negation of the existence

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.760
of other gods, the exclusion
of the worship of other gods.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.410
We meet, of course, in the Bible.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.140
This is the

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:24.460
one point of similarity,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.600
but there are other
points of huge difference

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.837
that exclude the possibility
of any historical influence.

00:40:33.376 --> 00:40:34.390
There is none.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:38.390
There is no causal
influence of Akhenaten...

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.700
- [Harry] On Moses.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.990
- On Moses, not at all.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:47.680
Because the Moses project
is just the opposite.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.203
It's not about cosmology, about the sun.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.560
Moses's question, and Moses, of course,

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.890
is a symbolic figure, is
not a historical figure,

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:03.890
so Moses's question is not
how reality comes about

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:09.180
and what energies are active in the world,

00:41:10.758 --> 00:41:14.823
but his question was the covenant,

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.063
this covenant between a god and a people,

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:26.750
a god acting not as a cosmic energy

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.720
but in history, as a ruler, as a partner,

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.443
a partner in a political
treaty and alliance.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.040
So, totally different idea,

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.040
that God is our ally, our ruler.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:53.660
It is about the genesis
of a people, of a nation,

00:41:56.410 --> 00:42:00.468
the Israelite nation,
and not about the world.

00:42:00.468 --> 00:42:03.010
This is not God the Creator,
this is the Book of Genesis,

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:07.490
this is not Yahweh, this is Elohim,

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:11.080
but the idea of Yahweh
as a leader of a people

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:15.183
whom he liberates from Egyptian slavery,

00:42:19.598 --> 00:42:23.200
so this is a political
idea, a social idea,

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.190
an idea of social identity,
and nothing of this

00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:33.986
has anything to do with Amarna,
with Akhenaten, and so on.

00:42:33.986 --> 00:42:38.150
Akhenaten's is a cosmology,
and here, this is more

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:44.863
religion in the sense we
understand this word: a covenant.

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:58.590
But still, there is this element

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:03.590
of iconoclasm, and one could
go further and say theoclasm,

00:43:07.935 --> 00:43:10.613
of the destruction a divine world.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.130
In later times, thousands years later,

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:24.130
in retrospect, in memory, Moses
and Akhenaten came together,

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:25.920
in Egyptian memory.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.920
There was a kind of distorted
memory of Akhenaten.

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:36.290
Akhenaten, of course, after his death,

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.090
fell victim to a damnatio memoriae,

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:44.090
all the traces of his existence
were destroyed, erased,

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.510
his name erased from the king lists,

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:52.080
so there was no memory of
the existence of Akhenaten,

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.100
but of course, there was
the traumatic experience

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.740
of his destruction of religion.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.740
A vague memory of this
trauma stayed on in Egyptian,

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:09.870
and reappeared in Greek
texts of a much later period,

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.113
and in one of these Greek texts,

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.260
Akhenaten and Moses come together,

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.870
because this text by Manetho,
it doesn't speak of Akhenaten

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.920
because this name was
erased from the king lists,

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.713
but it's quite evident
that this certain Osarsiph

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:36.130
of whom this text speaks
is no other than Akhenaten.

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:38.483
His deeds correspond exactly

00:44:41.216 --> 00:44:44.760
and the time correspond
exactly to the Amarna period,

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.183
and this text says that after having

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.520
given laws to his followers,
he assumed the name of Moses.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:03.093
So, in the Late Period,
the traumatic memory

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.980
of this monotheistic episode in Egypt

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.730
was brought into relation
with what they then learned

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.213
about the biblical monotheism.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:24.180
- Which raises an important
area which you've worked on,

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.780
which is this whole
idea of the canonization

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.010
of a religious text

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:38.940
as key to the survival
of a religion over time.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.370
There's almost an evolution of ideas,

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:47.370
where a text is written,
writing is very important,

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:52.850
that text is made holy, but
to the side is a body of work

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:58.930
that examines that holy text, an exegesis,

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:03.930
and what you're suggesting is
this development of religion

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:13.010
is key to remembrance, to cultural memory,

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.400
which is key to the resilience
and survival of a religion.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.740
- Yes, yes.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.740
Yeah, this is a process which
did not take place in Egypt,

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.800
but in Israel.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.350
In Egypt also, as fast
as Alexander is concerned

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:33.830
and the Greek tradition,
but which also took place

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:38.523
in India and China, and
very much at the same time.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.243
This means that a certain body of text,

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.693
was canonized, so, declared,

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.370
well, unchangeable,

00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:01.370
and that every further
change must take the form

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:06.603
of commentary, and I
think the introduction

00:47:10.222 --> 00:47:12.103
of commentary, this is the decisive step.

00:47:15.882 --> 00:47:17.700
Not only, of course,
there were texts around

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.420
for thousands of years, but the step

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:26.420
of canonizing these texts, of prohibiting

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:31.430
any further alteration
so the words must stay,

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:40.120
and then that every other,
let's say, development

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.670
must take the form of
commentary, this decisive step

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:52.470
occurred twice, in the Eastern
Mediterranean and in India,

00:47:55.270 --> 00:48:00.270
at the fourth, third, second century BCE.

00:48:00.809 --> 00:48:02.700
The rise of commentary.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.533
We see that

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:10.307
this corpus of biblical
text became canonized--

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.620
- For example, in Judaism, the Torah.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.453
- Yeah.

00:48:15.453 --> 00:48:16.286
Yes.

00:48:16.286 --> 00:48:17.920
The Torah--

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.940
- But then a Talmud and
Midrash, which comments on.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.360
- These are the comments
which, until then,

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.510
the comments were written into the text.

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:34.510
So, the biblical texts
show the traces of growth

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:40.700
over centuries, with glosses inserted

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:45.690
and also the combination
of different sources,

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:50.080
documents, and so on, and
all this has come to an end

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.793
at the third, second century BCE,

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.360
so the text was fixed

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.933
and this gave rise to commentaries.

00:49:02.889 --> 00:49:04.983
The same in Alexandria,

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:11.400
in obvious relations, because
Alexandria was also the place

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:14.910
of a strong Jewish community,

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.193
so they knew in Alexandria

00:49:16.193 --> 00:49:19.630
what was going on in Palestine,

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:24.100
and in Alexandria, the
Library of Alexandria,

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:29.100
where all literature of the
ancient world was collected,

00:49:29.519 --> 00:49:34.460
in order to master

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:39.460
this huge mass of books,
the people in charge

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:45.340
introduced a distinction
between the books to be treated

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:49.640
and the books to be excluded.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:54.640
So, collected but in an
archive, but not treated.

00:49:55.994 --> 00:49:58.310
(speaking in foreign language),
the books to be treated,

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.383
and treatment means commentary.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.863
So, in Alexandria,

00:50:05.701 --> 00:50:10.701
there was created the canon
of classical Greek literature,

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.283
and very much at the same time,

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:21.573
in India, the Pali canon
of the Buddhist writings.

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.300
Buddhism then went to
China and then gave rise

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.200
to huge, huge bodies of commentary:

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.910
Buddhist commentary, Taoist commentary,

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:33.077
Confucianist commentaries.

00:50:36.259 --> 00:50:39.770
I think it was these commentaries

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:43.000
that brought about a change

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.320
of mentality and thought, which, later,

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.253
Karl Jaspers called the Axial Age.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:00.550
Karl Jaspers was not
interested in the media

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:04.033
of transmission, but only in the ideas.

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:10.392
But it was not a question of ideas,

00:51:10.392 --> 00:51:12.000
it was really a question of media,

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000
of writing and canonization
and exegesis and so on,

00:51:17.686 --> 00:51:22.686
that brought about a
new form of continuity

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:27.840
that later times were able
to relate to the past.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.220
A new form of relating to the past;

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:36.220
also, to a past given a
new kind of normativity,

00:51:38.167 --> 00:51:43.167
that the past was believed to
be the classical foundation

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.160
of every changing present,

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.160
so that the philosopher
Whitehead could call

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.030
all Western philosophy
as just a collection

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.000
of footnotes to Plato.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.863
So, this relation to the classics,

00:52:10.804 --> 00:52:14.033
and as a relation to the past, as an

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:18.893
opening of the future,

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:25.680
we can go further because
we see what went before.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.430
These ideas of intellectual progress

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:33.310
and of modernity and so on requires

00:52:38.963 --> 00:52:40.463
access to the past

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:45.780
in order to go on in the same direction.

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.690
So, in a way, writing is crucial,

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:54.690
the canonization of writing and
the exegesis of the writing,

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:57.563
so in a way,

00:53:01.802 --> 00:53:06.802
your work as an Egyptologist
is informed by your knowledge

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:12.040
and work as a student
of comparative religion,

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:16.450
because Egypt shows
you what didn't happen,

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:19.560
but in the case of the
Jews, which you focus on

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:24.560
in your essay, the story of
Exodus, the story of Moses,

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:28.150
even the ritual play of the Seder,

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:31.260
which celebrates Exodus,
in addition to the book,

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.910
in that way, you come to understand

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:38.963
what allows a religion to
survive to modern times.

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:46.370
- This transition, from what
I call ritual continuity,

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.550
which was the case of Egypt,

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:53.550
Egypt was a civilization
of incredible stability,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000
starting in 3,000 Before Christ

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:07.090
and ending somewhere 300
AD in the Roman Empire,

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.253
and this stability was based on rituals,

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:21.733
rituals that implied great bodies of text.

00:54:25.173 --> 00:54:28.050
There were no ritual actions
that were not accompanied

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:32.490
by recitation, so these
Egyptian rituals were

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:39.490
also a very verbal activity, recitation.

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:42.403
But,

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:50.130
the backbone of continuity
was ritual action,

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:53.130
and this was due to, I think,

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.443
all these ancient civilizations,

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.000
all these relations to religions

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.643
of the ancient world, except Israel.

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:13.270
Israel, that was forced
by the Babylonian exile

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:16.700
to live on without temple, without ritual,

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.773
without state and kingdom and so on,

00:55:20.765 --> 00:55:24.890
and who went into the Babylonian exile

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:28.473
with, already, the emergent
canon of the Torah.

00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:33.280
Then, due to Babylonian exile,

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:37.390
they elaborated this emergent canon

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:42.390
and by doing so, invented an
alternative type of continuity:

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.910
textual, text-based.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:51.370
So, the recitation, the
reading, the exegesis of text

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:56.500
as a substitute for ritual continuity,

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.007
and when they came back to Jerusalem

00:55:59.007 --> 00:56:01.193
and rebuilt the temple,

00:56:07.536 --> 00:56:11.477
the Torah became the kernel
of the emergent Bible

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:17.940
with the three parts of Torah
and prophets and writings,

00:56:21.555 --> 00:56:26.555
and eventually exegesis, but this started

00:56:29.042 --> 00:56:30.590
in the Babylonian exile, and was forced

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:35.070
by exterior historical
circumstances, by catastrophe,

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:39.583
by destruction of every
other basis of continuity,

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:44.310
and then became, of course,
the model for Christianity,

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:47.940
and Islam, and other religions.

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.910
- Regrettably, our time is up,

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:53.940
but you really have helped
us in this discussion

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:58.420
and conversation to
understand what we can learn

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.430
from a religion in the ancient past

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:04.782
that is no longer living, but also,

00:57:04.782 --> 00:57:09.320
how the adaptation over
time of other religions

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.710
allowed them to survive in the present,

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:15.363
so it's really about comparative religion,

00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:20.410
as a sideline, so to speak, in your work.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:21.402
- Yeah.

00:57:21.402 --> 00:57:24.299
(chuckles) Well, of course,

00:57:24.299 --> 00:57:29.299
being a Christian and having, of course,

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.940
been grown up with biblical
texts, not so much in my family

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.193
but the school and so on,

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:42.690
I studied Egyptian texts with
a kind of implicit comparison,

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:50.380
and found, during, say, the first 20 years

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:55.380
of my Egyptological activity,
I was struck by the parallels.

00:57:58.409 --> 00:58:00.230
In Egypt, the same kinds of texts,

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.463
so many parallels to the Bible.

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:07.950
Only afterwards I became aware

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:10.810
of the categorical differences

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:14.550
and of the revolutionary
newness of the biblical texts,

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:18.793
so this was, again, comparison,
but in a different key.

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:24.630
First, the similarities,
and then, the differences.

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:27.630
- Well, on that note, I want to thank you,

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:31.100
Professor Assmann, for taking
the time to be with us,

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:36.100
and this really fascinating
discussion of your work.

00:58:36.451 --> 00:58:37.284
Thank you.

00:58:37.284 --> 00:58:38.117
- Thank you.

00:58:38.117 --> 00:58:39.520
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.472
for this Conversation With History.

00:58:42.472 --> 00:58:45.972
(light, intriguing music)
