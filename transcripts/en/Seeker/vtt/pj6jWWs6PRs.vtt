00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.021
Every once in a while babies are born with
some organs on the outside instead of the

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:05.021
inside…

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:06.580
It’s sounds crazy but it’s TRUE and..

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.400
It’s happening more NOW than ever before.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.800
Hey guys, what’s up- I’m Sapna here for
D-news.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.290
About 1 out of every 2-thousand babies is
born with a deformity where their intestines

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.220
are outside their body.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.540
This condition is called gastro-skee-sis ((gastroschisis)).

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.210
That’s from the greek word for belly-cleft.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.279
Believe or not, many of these babies survive,
because soon after they’re born, surgeons

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.060
often perform a corrective procedure to place
the intestines back into the body.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.530
But, that’s not always easy.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.610
See, these organs are outside the skin and
are exposed to the elements, so they’re

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.710
usually inflamed and swollen!

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.210
And also, these infants have only developed
tiny bellies since they’re organs weren’t

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.210
inside.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.040
-- That means the surgery is often done in
stages, one to ensure that they can get everything

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.219
back in and two to give the baby the best
possible chance for recovery.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.890
Gastro-skee-sis occurs because some babies
are born with a hole right next to their belly

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.890
button.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.310
And to understand why THAT happens, we have
to look at what is going on in the womb when

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.150
an embryo first develops an abdominal wall.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.600
At about 3 and a half weeks… an embryo’s
digestive tract starts to form.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.810
At 6 weeks, it starts to lengthen.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.710
And by 10 weeks, the digestive tract and all
the major organs are encapsulated by the abdominal

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.360
cavity before the layers of the abdominal
wall seal everything off.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.470
And THAT LAST PART is the stage when things
can go wrong…

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.920
There are a bunch of different theories about
exactly HOW things go wrong - but the majority

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.299
of scientists believe it's something called
the “vascular disruption theory.”

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.950
Essentially, it’s the idea that gastro-skee-sis
occurs because there’s not enough blood

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.900
flow to the abdominal layers.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.299
The lack of blood supplying the abdominal
tissues as they form leaves a weak spot that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.820
can end up rupturing.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.560
This creates a hole right next to the fetus’s
umbilical cord.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.730
And if that hole is BIG enough, the liver,
spleen and other organs CAN end up on the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.439
exterior of the baby’s body also.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.600
When all these organs end up on the outside,
it’s called an omphalocele and that occurs

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.170
in about 1 out of every 4000 births.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.739
It’s also possible for the bladder- and
EVEN the heart - to end up on the outside

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.660
but that is much more rare.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.420
What CAUSES these birth defects isn’t fully
understood yet...but we do have some clues.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.220
Researchers think it could be genetic, and
they found it happens more often in YOUNG

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.940
mothers, women with poor nutrition, and women
who smoke, do drugs or consume alcohol.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.780
And there's even research showing links to
aspirin intake and exposure to certain chemicals.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.739
More research is obviously needed.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.700
And the research can’t come soon enough.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.450
A recent report from the c-d-c says the number
of babies born with gastroschisis - where

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.530
the intestines are outside - has been going
up around the world since the 1980’s.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.700
According to the CDC...this is an urgent wakeup
call..

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.700
We NEED more answers!

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.160
If we know more about what causes it then
we can figure out how to stop it.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.020
Have you ever wondered why some organs come
in pairs but others don’t?
