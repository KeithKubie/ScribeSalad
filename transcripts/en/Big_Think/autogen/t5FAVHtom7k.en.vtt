and my reaction at the time was the
 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.909
and my reaction at the time was the
reaction that I had been taught by my

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919

so on that's when that's when the truth

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840
so on that's when that's when the truth
 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.029
so on that's when that's when the truth
began to come out and and of course what

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039
began to come out and and of course what
 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.189
began to come out and and of course what
I discovered on my own was that you know

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199
I discovered on my own was that you know
 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.649
I discovered on my own was that you know
that I'd had cancer but then I found out

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659
that I'd had cancer but then I found out
 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:15.240
that I'd had cancer but then I found out
later that it was my dad who had given

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250
later that it was my dad who had given
 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.529
later that it was my dad who had given
it to me as in his in his practice as a

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539
it to me as in his in his practice as a
 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.559
it to me as in his in his practice as a
radiologist and and that was just the

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569
radiologist and and that was just the
 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:23.909
radiologist and and that was just the
sort of the tip of the iceberg in terms

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919
sort of the tip of the iceberg in terms
 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.430
sort of the tip of the iceberg in terms
of mixed metaphors family skeletons you

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440
of mixed metaphors family skeletons you
 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.740
of mixed metaphors family skeletons you
know that was the least of the ones that

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.300
know that was the least of the ones that
came tumbling out of the closet one

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310
came tumbling out of the closet one
 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.689
came tumbling out of the closet one
after another at that point so I think

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699
after another at that point so I think
 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.089
after another at that point so I think
this is something that kids really

00:26:54.359 --> 00:26:54.369
knowledge of anatomy and structure
 

00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:56.909
knowledge of anatomy and structure
underneath them but that just in a few

00:26:56.909 --> 00:26:56.919
underneath them but that just in a few
 

00:26:56.919 --> 00:26:59.690
underneath them but that just in a few
lines just dashed off the whole scene

00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700
lines just dashed off the whole scene
 

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.539
lines just dashed off the whole scene
the whole expression of the body there

00:27:02.539 --> 00:27:02.549
the whole expression of the body there
 

00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:09.389
the whole expression of the body there
and then you know that plus studying

00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399
and then you know that plus studying
 

00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:13.129
and then you know that plus studying
Anatomy when I got into college

00:27:13.129 --> 00:27:13.139
 
 

00:27:13.139 --> 00:27:15.899
 
things like anatomy and drawing and

00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:15.909
things like anatomy and drawing and
 

00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:17.729
things like anatomy and drawing and
design and color had pretty much been

00:27:17.729 --> 00:27:17.739
design and color had pretty much been
 

00:27:17.739 --> 00:27:20.070
design and color had pretty much been
dropped kicked out of the curriculum in

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080
dropped kicked out of the curriculum in
 

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.999
dropped kicked out of the curriculum in
the 70s when I was studying art in favor

00:27:23.999 --> 00:27:24.009
the 70s when I was studying art in favor
 

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:27.690
the 70s when I was studying art in favor
of abstraction and minimalism and you

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:27.700
of abstraction and minimalism and you
 

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.249
of abstraction and minimalism and you
know people had basically thrown up

00:27:29.249 --> 00:27:29.259
know people had basically thrown up
 

00:27:29.259 --> 00:27:31.049
know people had basically thrown up
their hands with storytelling in art in

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:31.059
their hands with storytelling in art in
 

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:32.969
their hands with storytelling in art in
those days and said heart is pointless

00:27:32.969 --> 00:27:32.979
those days and said heart is pointless
 

00:27:32.979 --> 00:27:35.639
those days and said heart is pointless
so let's just make it a skin of paint on

00:27:35.639 --> 00:27:35.649
so let's just make it a skin of paint on
 

00:27:35.649 --> 00:27:37.320
so let's just make it a skin of paint on
the canvas and do that in a pretty way

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:37.330
the canvas and do that in a pretty way
 

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.109
the canvas and do that in a pretty way
and here I wanted to learn to draw the

00:27:40.109 --> 00:27:40.119
and here I wanted to learn to draw the
 

00:27:40.119 --> 00:27:42.479
and here I wanted to learn to draw the
figure from any angle in any position

00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:42.489
figure from any angle in any position
 

00:27:42.489 --> 00:27:49.379
figure from any angle in any position
from memory and so I I I studied that

00:27:49.379 --> 00:27:49.389
from memory and so I I I studied that
 

00:27:49.389 --> 00:27:52.019
from memory and so I I I studied that
and thank God found a few teachers that

00:27:52.019 --> 00:27:52.029
and thank God found a few teachers that
 

00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:53.879
and thank God found a few teachers that
were still interested in teaching it

00:27:53.879 --> 00:27:53.889
were still interested in teaching it
 

00:27:53.889 --> 00:27:57.509
were still interested in teaching it
both at Wayne State in Detroit where I

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519
both at Wayne State in Detroit where I
 

00:27:57.519 --> 00:27:59.609
both at Wayne State in Detroit where I
did my undergraduate work and at Yale in

00:27:59.609 --> 00:27:59.619
did my undergraduate work and at Yale in
 

00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:02.520
did my undergraduate work and at Yale in
the grad school there

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:02.530
 
 

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:05.470
 
but then later on as a teacher I

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480
but then later on as a teacher I
 

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.260
but then later on as a teacher I
continued I taught Anatomy I chose to

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:08.270
continued I taught Anatomy I chose to
 

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.390
continued I taught Anatomy I chose to
teach anatomy which nobody wanted to

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:10.400
teach anatomy which nobody wanted to
 

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.810
teach anatomy which nobody wanted to
study but I I wanted to teach it because

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:12.820
study but I I wanted to teach it because
 

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.820
study but I I wanted to teach it because
AI was enthusiastic about it and I knew

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:15.830
AI was enthusiastic about it and I knew
 

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.500
AI was enthusiastic about it and I knew
that I could make some kids interested

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:17.510
that I could make some kids interested
 

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.680
that I could make some kids interested
in it and I did but B I wanted to learn

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:20.690
in it and I did but B I wanted to learn
 

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.110
in it and I did but B I wanted to learn
more about it and you know so I was

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120
more about it and you know so I was
 

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.790
more about it and you know so I was
always a couple steps ahead in my class

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:24.800
always a couple steps ahead in my class
 

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:33.200
always a couple steps ahead in my class
and it was good it was worthwhile

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.210
 
 

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:43.040
 
oh I do keep up at night I um I try not

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.050
oh I do keep up at night I um I try not
 

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.990
oh I do keep up at night I um I try not
to let my mind go go to two extremes in

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000
to let my mind go go to two extremes in
 

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.320
to let my mind go go to two extremes in
the middle of the night because it'd be

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:51.330
the middle of the night because it'd be
 

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.730
the middle of the night because it'd be
better to turn all that stuff into

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.740
better to turn all that stuff into
 

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.560
better to turn all that stuff into
dreams it'd be better if I was sleeping

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:54.570
dreams it'd be better if I was sleeping
 

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:58.340
dreams it'd be better if I was sleeping
because dreams become good metaphors for

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:58.350
because dreams become good metaphors for
 

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.200
because dreams become good metaphors for
