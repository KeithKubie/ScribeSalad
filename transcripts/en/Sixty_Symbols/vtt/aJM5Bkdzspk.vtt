00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
The Force

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.640
is what gives a Jedi his power.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.460
It's an energy field created by all living things.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.660
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.980
It binds the galaxy together.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.520
So, that's a fairly deep quote, isn't it? Fairly deep quote.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.080
And so, I got contacted by a journalist for The Guardian.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.500
They were doing an article on The Force

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.460
and they wanted to know, from a physicist,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700
well, what were your thoughts on The Force?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.700
The Force, of course, is taken

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.700
-- and George Lucas himself has admitted this --

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.420
that it was informed by, sort of,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.500
concepts of Eastern mysticism

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.700
and tying together the world, the universe,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.740
in terms of

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.980
almost like a spiritual force that binds us,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.320
binds us all together.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.120
But it also obeys your commands.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.120
Now, I have a lot of problems,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.120
when it comes to quantum mechanics, for example,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.120
where quantum mechanics is abused

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.120
in terms of 'quantum woo'

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.120
and the idea that quantum mechanics

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.220
tells us

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.400
that everything is bound together, and that, um,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.740
you know, Brady's electrons and my electrons

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.540
are all part of one holistic, integrated whole.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.900
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.300
I've seen a lot of strange stuff;

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.820
but I've never seen anything

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.480
to make me believe there's one

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.120
all-powerful force controlling everything.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.000
In this universe, that doesn't happen

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.440
for reasons I've discussed at length in other videos.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.440
But let's think about what --

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.080
you know, what --

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.440
What could be the origin of The Force in Star Wars?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.020
Is there a universe where it might be possible?

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.380
Let's say my starting point is existing physics,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.880
and let's think about how we would

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.700
have to modify that existing physics

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.000
to, um, to have something like The Force in the universe around us.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120
What's remarkable in this universe

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.740
and with current existing physics

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.260
is that quantum mechanics,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.680
at one level,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
quantum physics *does* tell us

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.680
that Brady's and my electrons

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.000
are coupled together.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.700
Binds the galaxy together.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700
It *does* tell us that my electrons

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700
are coupled with the building over there;

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.440
are coupled with small, blue, furry creatures on Alpha Centauri;

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.260
are coupled with

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.420
the universe at whole.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.920
Quantum mechanics does tell us that.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.920
And in fact, we can't really think,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.260
in some ways

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.120
-- in terms of the theoretical context --

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.880
we can't think of an individual electron;

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.340
we've got to think of them all coupled together.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.340
Its energy surrounds us

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.340
and binds us.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.660
That's called 'entanglement' and, that's,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.700
and that sounds very much like The Force.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.300
But why doesn't it work in this universe?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300
Well, the reason it doesn't work in [this] universe is

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.840
that coupling is so *incredibly* tiny;

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.840
incredibly tiny. You may as well say,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.640
if I do this [exhales a puff of breath],

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.900
that I've affected the orbit of Mars.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.720
That's sort of what it's like saying.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.160
There is an effect,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.080
but that effect is not only *tiny*;

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.460
it's utterly, completely,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.120
totally, fundamentally

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.360
negligible. It doesn't affect anything

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.920
in the world around us.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.760
[Brady, off camera:] You're almost making the case there, though.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.700
You're saying, "For you and me, we can't do it; but maybe a Jedi,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.480
[Brady continues] "who is more sensitive or can amplify these things"

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.300
But what would have to happen --

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.480
So, it's interesting because, um, there are people

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.640
like Deepak Chopra; there are people

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.540
in *this* universe, in this world

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.820
who claim that this coupling happens.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.540
But the coupling doesn't happen.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.740
Quantum mechanics, if --

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.380
[Brady, off camera:] But *you* just said the coupling happens.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.480
No! The coupling happens *theoretically*

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.640
and you have to set the *theory* up

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.700
so that that, um, coupling is within the theory.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.600
But there's a big difference between

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.800
a theory

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.920
and something that happens practically,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.740
or something that's measurable.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.740
As I say, the theory tells us there's

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.800
a coupling; but that coupling is at the level of --

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.800
It's just so far off the scale,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.800
not only could we not measure it;

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.460
we couldn't even begin to hope to measure it

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.460
with *whatever* technology,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.540
because it's *completely* overridden by any other effect.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.240
It's, as I say, it's like me [exhales a puff of breath] doing that,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.720
and expecting that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.240
not only have I affected the orbit of Mars,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.920
but I've affected the orbit of planets around

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.140
Alpha Centauri, or whatever.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.960
So it's a very theoretical concept,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.200
and the problem is --

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.540
[Brady:] But you never ____ theoretical; weak.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.680
[Brady, off camera:] It does exist; you *did* affect Mars just then; just not very much.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.540
Exactly! But, you know, so,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.880
in terms of the context of, um,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.880
what it means for our everyday lives --

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.420
Can we control it?

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.980
Does it make a difference?

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.760
So --

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.760
What would need to happen

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.760
to have something like The Force in this universe,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.060
in terms of coupling us all together?

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.240
Well, that f[orce] -- somehow would have to amplify

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.940
that entanglement.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.460
We'd have to somehow, you know, in terms of,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.140
um,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.440
me being able to connect with Brady

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.180
from my electrons, to entangle with Brady's,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.120
so I could influence his thoughts, for example.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.780
How would I influence his thoughts?

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.780
Well, I'd have to change the biochemistry?

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.780
And what's the biochemistry about?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.020
It's about electrons?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.140
So, somehow my electrons would have to couple --

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.440
they'd have to become strongly quantum mechanically entangled with Brady's electrons.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.440
How would we do that?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.580
I don't know.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.440
[Brady, off camera:] But I thought you said our electrons *are* entangled already.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.180
Our elec --

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.840
[Brady, off camera:] And we're close to each other.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.140
But that, but that level of entanglement

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.500
is so absolutely minuscule.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.800
[Brady:] Isn't entanglement like pregnant? You can't be weakly pregnant.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.180
Absolutely you can be.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.480
[Brady:] You're entangled, or you're not entangled.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.480
No! No, no, no, no. There's a whole range of different entan --

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.480
So, electrons in the same atom

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.480
can have a strong degree of entanglement;

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.140
electrons in different objects

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.380
can have a very, very weak degree of entanglement;

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.640
electrons on either side of the universe --

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.920
that entanglement is so *incredibly* small --

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.360
the coupling is so incredibly small

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.620
that it's just --

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.620
I cannot begin to describe just how incr --

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.460
[stammers]

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.460
incredibly and totally

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.460
minuscule and negligible it is.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.840
[Brady, off camera:] Well Professor, if there are degrees of entanglement --

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.240
[Brady:] What's the SI unit for entanglement?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.900
So an, well, [stammers]

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.520
You'd have to think of -- the best way of thinking about it

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.120
is in terms of --

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.120
if you've got, ah --

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.620
No, it's a very very good question, Brady.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.620
Best way of thinking about it is in terms of:

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.620
What are the energies?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.620
Right? So, if you've got, ah,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.940
a system at one particular energy --

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.600
you've got an object at one particular energy; you've got an object over here at another particular energy.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.600
So, is the energy of this object

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.600
affected by this object, and vice-versa?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.180
That's the best way of thinking about it.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.800
So, if you bring two atoms together,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.800
and what happens is that the electrons will start to interact --

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.340
they'll overlap -- and at some point, you no longer think of it as

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.860
individual atoms; they become a molecule.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.400
Alright? So that's a fairly strongly,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.280
in terms of the electrons, that's a fairly strongly entangled system.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.280
But if you break that out,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.280
you don't need to go very, very far at all

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.280
where this atom

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.900
just does not feel the influence of this atom at all.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.500
And that's over the course of just a few atomic diameters. The bond breaks.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.680
So, they're not entangled; they're not communicating with each other.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.900
Move this to even a *fraction* of a millimeter,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.080
and this atom really does not care

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.140
about the presence of this atom,

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.660
in terms of the energies of the electrons in this atom.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.660
Move it to the other side of the universe,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.660
and that, as I said, that effect is just

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.660
completely and utterly washed out

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.660
by us *breathing*, for one thing;

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.660
by the vibrations, the thermal vibrations

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.660
of the atoms in the table.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.660
So the quantum mechanics that happens down here

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.340
at the atomic level

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.620
just doesn't scale up.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.760
[Brady, off camera:] It's almost like you're saying,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.900
[Brady:] Sure, it's there, but us -- but it's weak and us mortals would never see or measure it.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.900
Absolutely. So therefore --
[Brady, off camera:] No, I'm saying,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.900
[Brady:] It would take a special kind of person

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.900
[Brady:] to see it, or control or measure it;

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.900
[Brady:] and that special person is a Jedi.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.900
Maybe. Maybe if -- But they have to,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.720
they have to be able to control that entanglement,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720
and amplify that effect.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.320
[Brady, off camera:] That's why they're so special. They -- 
[Professor:] Yeah, and it's a question of

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.320
how, I guess, with um --

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.640
I know this divides the community

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.640
and I don't want to have hordes of rampaging Star Wars fans chasing after me --

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.020
But maybe this midi-chlorian idea?

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.340
Maybe that somehow amplifies the entanglements?

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.340
It's an interesting idea. But,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.340
the interesting thing here is that

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.100
within, as I say, within

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.720
quantum mechanics in this universe,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.060
technically -- but I *really* want to stress that --

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.060
Technically, um,

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.700
you have to couple everything together --

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.800
you can't just assume: One electron here. You have to consider

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.560
*all* the electrons in the universe.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.780
So, it's interesting. The Force is what gives the Jedi his power.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.080
It's an energy field.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.320
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.320
Now, already a physicist goes,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.360
"Hang on!" Because a force

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.780
and an energy

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.160
are *very* different things.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.140
[Female voice:] Many Bothans died to bring us this information.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.280
[Brady, off camera:] I think you're being a bit --

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.660
[Brady:] This is semantics, though, isn't it?

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.780
[Brady:] The reason I think this is semantics --

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.120
[Brady:] 'The Force' with a capital 'F' doesn't have to be a force
[Professor:] True, true. That's true.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.120
That's true. There is -- I am being, in terms of the pedantry, I guess,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.520
it can just be thought of as,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.120
as you say, The Force with a capital F

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.740
rather than a force.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.740
But that distinction between force,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.740
as a physicist sees it, and energy, is important.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.740
But this is the good -- this is the really --

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.380
That's a bit of a pedantic one. That is a bit of a pedantic one.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.600
But it's interesting --

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.880
It says, "It surrounds us and penetrates us."

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.100
Basically, that's what forces,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.100
force fields, or fields, do in the universe.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.280
In quantum field theory,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.000
we think about the,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.800
the field associated with an electron

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.620
or the field associated with a particle.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.620
Which permeates all of space!

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.620
Or even the electron -- you're used to thinking

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.620
about the -- or hearing about the Higgs boson

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.620
and how that field permeates the universe;

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.780
but that's true of *every* field.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.200
It does permeate the entire universe.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.820
Those, um, what makes a difference

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.020
is that if you make a change here,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.360
over here, it can only respond at the speed of light;

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.360
but that field in that sense

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.700
does permeate the entire universe.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.700
So some of this,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.700
you know, "It surrounds us and penetrates us."

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.920
There are fields around us -- force fields --

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.320
that indeed surround us and penetrate us.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.320
So in that sense, you know, there is some

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.800
interesting aspects of The Force which connect with us.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.280
Nothing more will I teach you today.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.040
Clear your mind of questions.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.740
Hmmmm.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.940
[Brady, off camera:] What does a universe look like where

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.680
[Brady:] certain people can do it?

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.940
[Brady:] And does that universe behave differently? Could --

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.640
That universe would have to be --

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.440
Great, huge questions; and

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.640
I'm very much thinking on my feet here.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.640
I haven't given this a huge amount of thought.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.640
So, please feel free to shoot me down completely

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.640
in the comments.
[Brady:] They will.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.060
[Professor, laughing:] They will indeed.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.380
But, um --

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.580
The interesting [thing] about that is,

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.500
if you are gonna chance a degree of entanglement,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.720
it's not just *you* we have to worry about,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.660
or the Jedi;

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.520
it's the environment itself.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.520
Because, everything around us

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.200
in this universe

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.520
scatters those waves. Scatters those electron waves.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.320
And, then you'd have to be able to

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.860
somehow locally

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.700
control.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.700
What -- so, if the -- my, um --

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.080
[if] my wave function is connecting with Brady's wave function,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.080
it's not just: I have to connect with Brady;

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.720
It's that I have to get rid of the influence of this table,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.420
which might scatter that wave.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.680
So, the universe would have to behave very differently.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.860
The energies would have to be different

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.640
in terms of, um,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.900
the -- at the moment,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.900
the atoms vibrating in this table

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.900
are scattering those waves;

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.900
which means that you don't have these

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.080
long-range entanglements.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.340
You'd have to control *all* the physics.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.360
You'd even have to probably think about

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.720
changing fundamental -- no, you *would*, definitely! --

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.420
changing fundamental constants,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.440
which means that it wouldn't just be

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.640
you, Brady, that'd be affected,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.480
or me, as a Jedi knight, that'd be affected.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.340
The whole universe, the physics would have to be

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.780
very, very different.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.720
And then it might look like a very different place indeed.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.720
[Brady, off camera:] There's a long history

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.700
[Brady continues:] of humans not understanding what was around us,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.120
[Brady continues:] gradually understanding what was around us,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.080
[Brady continues:] and then being able to harness that to incredible effect,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.160
[Brady continues:] good and bad.
[Professor:] Yeah.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.760
[Brady, off screen:] Atomic bombs are a brilliant example.
[Professor:] Yes.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.360
[Brady, off screen:] Who's to say that,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.600
[Brady continues:] in a galaxy far, far away,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.220
[Brady continues:] they haven't found a way to harness and use entanglement to their advantage,

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.820
[Brady continues:] and you just haven't thought of it yet,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.620
[Brady continues:] because you're a silly human?
[Professor:] That is --

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.440
My problem with that is,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.040
is not, as I said, it's not just a question of

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.080
not being able to design the technology.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.700
It's just that the energy scales associated with this --

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.580
____ me, I would love to believe there's a universe out there with The Force.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.180
That would be absolutely, absolutely fantastic,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.020
that somewhere, you know, there is a universe like the Star Wars universe.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.040
Wookies. I'd love to meet a wookie.
[Wookie sound]

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.240
[Brady:] If Luke Skywalker walked into the room right now,

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.240
[Brady continues:] and used The Force in front of you --

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.100
[Brady continues:] he was controlling minds; he was moving things around --

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.680
[Brady continues:] Are you saying that quantum entanglement

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.680
[Brady continues:] would be your first line of inquiry

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.680
[Brady continues:] to figure out how he was doing it?

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.420
And there's no visible

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.680
sort of amplifier for his --

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.740
you know, waves associated from --
[Brady, off camera:] He just says, I'm a Jedi.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.860
[Brady continues:] I'm a Jedi. I can just do this stuff.
[Professor:] Yes.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.820
I think I'd probably start

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.620
thinking about entanglement.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.160
Um, the other interesting thing, as well, of course, is the,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.060
um, the cognitive abilities,

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.780
or the pre-cognitive abilities --

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.780
The ability to see into the future.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.860
[Yoda:] Through The Force, things you will see,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.100
other places, the future, the past.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.520
Well, it's interesting then, because in this universe,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.080
we, you know, there are parallel worlds --

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.500
The whole, sort of, elaborate many worlds theory,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.100
um, which again,

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.180
some physicists have a lot of time for,

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.180
other physicists don't have huge amount of time for.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.980
But imagine a universe where

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.180
somehow, you could communicate with those other worlds,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.800
which we can't, at the moment.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.360
Could you tap into those other worlds?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.160
Could you tap into other possibilities?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.220
Because the idea is, in many types of 'many worlds' theories,

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.700
that every possibility happens.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.060
Could you actually couple into those?

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.460
Could you somehow see into

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.880
the particular universe you need to see into those particular possibility?

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.140
[Obi-Wan Kenobi:] Use The Force, Luke.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.560
[Professor:] That's, again, a very much fundamental quantum,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.620
quantum effect. But let me stress, this is all science fiction.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.860
... or the remaining Type II calculation,

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.480
because it's really not worth trying to do this calculation

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.560
terribly carefully.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.120
But, basically, it fires for

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.460
a couple of seconds.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.460
So it's, you know, which is accurate enough

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.580
for these purposes.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.620
We need to do the maths now,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.640
if you want to actually figure out

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.900
what the energy is.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.900
So, if I have...
