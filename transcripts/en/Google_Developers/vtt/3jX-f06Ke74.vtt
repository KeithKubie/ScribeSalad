TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.750
for "The Developer Show."

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.041
Now this is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:07.045
news from Google.

00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:09.780
G Suite Developer
Hub is now available.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.880
It provides a single
view of your projects,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.830
helping you create new
automation scripts,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.310
view shared projects, and
check on service statuses.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.230
For more details
and screenshots,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.420
head on over to the post.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.050
Node.js 10 is now available
in beta on App Engine

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.380
standard environment, and
it's now the default version

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.880
on the flexible environment.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.130
For more about
Node.js on App Engine,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.880
take a look at the post.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.170
We recently open sourced a new
technique for natural language

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.770
processing pre-training
called Bidirectional Encoder

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.740
Representations from
Transformers, or BERT.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.460
With it, you can train your
own state-of-the-art question

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.970
answering system in about 30
minutes on a single Cloud TPU

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.000
or in a few hours
on a single GPU.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.640
As usual, the post
goes into some depth

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.090
and has a link to the paper.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.250
We recently introduced AdaNet,
a lightweight TensorFlow-based

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.040
framework for automatically
learning high-quality models

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.380
with minimal expert
intervention.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.320
AdaNet builds on our recent
reinforcement learning

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.230
and evolutionary-based
AutoML efforts

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.490
to be fast and flexible while
providing learning guarantees.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.280
Definitions, details,
and a link to the GitHub

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.840
are all on the post.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.840
The annual conference
on Empirical Methods

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.980
and Natural Language Processing
was held last week in Brussels.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.010
Google had a strong presence,
with several of our researchers

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
presenting on a diverse
set of topics, including

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.150
natural language identification,
segmentation, semantic parsing,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.070
and question answering.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.710
For links to these papers
and the new data sets

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.130
we shared, head on over to the
post, linked in the description

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.220

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:54.919

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.001
SPEAKER 2: We're rolling.

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:58.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
I should go now?

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.093
SPEAKER 2: Wait.

00:01:59.093 --> 00:01:59.180
Hold on.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.820
SPEAKER 1: A few [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How about now?

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.070
SPEAKER 2: No.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.584
Hold-- OK, go.

00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:04.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now is good?

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.990
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.280
Wait.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.880
Now.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.365
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.
