00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.950
Testes originally form in the abdomen near
the stomach and kidneys.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.250
The nerves and blood vessels remain attached
in that region, even after the balls drop.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.820
So when a guy gets kicked in the balls or
otherwise has his nuts squished, the pain

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.590
involved travels up from each testicle into
the abdominal cavity, via the spermatic plexus,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.790
which is the primary nerve of each testicle,
and then to the spine.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.360
In addition to the pain in the stomach area,
many men also experience severe nausea.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.410
This is thought to be caused by a huge rush
of sympathetic nervous system discharge.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.540
So the bodyâ€™s tolerance level for that rush
determines whether that person will be someone

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:15.950
susceptible to actually vomiting when 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:27.259
kicked 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.849
in 
the nuts.
