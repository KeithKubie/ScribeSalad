Sound

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Nitrogen Propelled Rocket Launcher (N.P.R.L.)
 
-explosion- Grant: Holy mother!

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.000
Shonduras: Holy Moly!

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.280
Grant: Where is it?

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.380
Hey, what's up guys, today I'm hanging out with Shonduras.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.060
And some liquid nitrogen, no big deal.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.680
See, a lot of you know that I replenished my recent supply of liquid nitrogen and this stuff... has a shelf life.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.700
So while we've got it, we're putting it to good use and revisiting the nitrogen

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.980
rocket project.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.920
But with a twist! we've got an idea:

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.520
Rocket launcher!

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.480
What do you think, can we make it work?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.560
We've never done this before,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.100
we really have no idea how it's going to go.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.120
It's gonna be amazing is what its gonna be.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700
What's the danger level of all this stuff?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.460
I feel like there's a lot of peer pressure in this video that's gonna go down.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.440
Grant: If it touches your skin just freak out like it's a spider and you'll be okay.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.440
Grant: Yeah, right in the middle of the road. That's awesome. (Perfect!) That's not conspicuous at all.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.100
Pick up that big tank and that stuff is extremely expensive, so don't spill any.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.120
Shawn: We just just have 2 problems

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.920
Problem number 1: I'm s- I'm scared of liquid nitrogen.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.700
Problem number 2: I don't have big muscles to lift this thing.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.740
Grant: Well, give it your best shot... (Shawn: Okay... Here we go) -nobody's judging.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.580
Shawn: Oh boy! (Grant: Oh dude )

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.140
Grant: There's money

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.660
*Chuckle*

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.540
Grant: Oh wow you see it like bubbling and spitting right out the top

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.280
Shon: That's insane.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.200
Alright.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.000
Grant: Is this your first time with liquid nitrogen?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.200
Shawn: Oh! No, I do this like everyday all day.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.100
Grant: Alright, so we got our water bottle.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.800
Grant: You can see it is about half-full of just regular tap water,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.060
at room temperature
a little bit of liquid nitrogen.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.900
Grant: And we dont have a whole lot of time to play with here so,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.300
lets get you going on this before that water freezes up.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.300
Oh shoot!

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.460
Grant: Alright just grab that bottle and flip it right upside down.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.480
Upside down?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.180
Grant: Yaa

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.680
Shawn: Woah!

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020
Wooh hahaha!

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.500
Shawn: What did you just do to me?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.740
Dude, rocket launcher! This is so doable now!

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.400
Grant: You see it?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.900
Grant: You see where its going?  (Shon: Yes)

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.660
Next trip, Home Depot we're gonna pick up some materials and see if we can makeshift a rocket launcher out of this thing.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.060
I mean that was kinda cool but imagine a rocket like *ksuskuswusu*

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.800
*explosion sound* (dog starts barking)

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.980
Grant: There's our rocket bodies right there.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.060
Grant: These 500 ml have really
durable plastic so they work great.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.180
Shawn: We got to get green, it's like army rocket launcher green. (Grant: I'm diggin' that) Army missiles?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.860
Grant: Let's get it.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.980
Alright, so we just got back from Home Depot.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.119
We've got all our materials, and all we're using for this rocket launcher is

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.439
a 4-inch piece of PVC pipe.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.220
Grant: We've also
got these 4-inch couplings.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.440
These are ABS and they are black so we don't need to
paint them, they look cool as is.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.700
These are going to go on either end of
the rocket launcher

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.220
And then Shon's idea...was to use this for a handle which
is actually pretty cool.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.820
This is a half-inch connector T and,
we're going to just basically slice that off,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.200
bend the plastic and meld it to the
bottom so that we've got a built in handle

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.560
*music playing*

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.580
Now it's gonna take a little bit of time for this to warm up

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.190
because we don't want it to catch on fire and burn

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.880
so this could take a while, this could take a couple of minutes but

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.760
the key is to be gentle and keep it moving.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.770
Shon: It's worth it. The turtle wins the race.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.500
sssss...(melting face sound fx)    ...just joking.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.550
Grant: Look how rubbery that is (Shon: Yeah)

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.000
Okay so you just kind of hold that down
or why don't you find a cloth or something.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.940
Just want to hold this thing against that pipe and get the sides as flat as possible.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.700
The more surface area we can make contact with, the better the thing is gonna stick.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.500
This is rocket science, (Grant: Haha) this is rocket launcher science.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.440
Alright, there we go

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.670
Shon: It's smooth 
Grant: Cool! (Shon: Shiny) I think we're in business

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.980
*saw turns on*

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.740
Alright we got our little handle
formed here, it fits pretty nicely.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.970
We just got to figure out what feels right for
balance

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.720
I'm holding on to the of the back here by the
coupling

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.740
'cause that's where the rocket's going to enter.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.920
Right about there feels pretty awesome, so go ahead and mark that. (Shon: Looks good.)

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.180
Grant: Now it's time to glue it up. For that we're gonna need some ABS to PVC cement like this stuff

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.840
And check this out...

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.980
Shon: The green goo works best

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.980
....the green

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.780
(delicious) Totally run and goopy

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.980
Grant: ....kind of looks like slime.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.680
You gotta work it a little bit

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.840
While that's setting let's to work on
making our rockets next.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.120
Now, when it comes to making your rocket bodies, that's the kind of bottle you want to get:

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.200
Something as a 500 ml soda bottle cause
it's pressure rated and that will be able to

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.810
contain the liquid nitrogen as it's expanding
rapidly.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.250
The thing about these soda bottles is
they're really flat on the bottom and so

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.270
they're not aerodynamically stable.
 When they fly up into the air they

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.150
tumble and fall all over the place. So, what we need
to do is come up with some kind of a nose cone.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.220
Shon: Cut this off, take the bottom,
part of this...well, the whole the top part of this bottle

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.030
put the bottom part here, and now
we've got aerodynamic-ammunition.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.940
*bottle sounds*

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.040
Shon: I think that'll do.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.540
How funny-looking is that?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.040
Like which end do I drink from?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.500
Shon: It's a teamwork bottle.
Grant: *laughs*

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.840
Now the reason we got the 4" PVC tube
is because these bottles, when you put

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.610
them inside, you can see it leaves a little bit
of a gap around the edges and that's

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.500
where we're going to build our fins.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.020
We've worked out some kind of little fin template here

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.480
that almost matches the bulge there.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.900
Um, it doesn't have to be perfect because we're gonna use hot glue to fill in the gaps

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.700
and that should match together pretty well.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.000
*music*

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.520
We're also going to need to add a couple
of nubs in here to balance the top end when it sits in the rocket's well

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.500
Shon: Now we're going to paint the rocket launchers

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.800
because they need to look awesome.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:55.020
*spray paint sound*

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.910
Grant: Funny story this is the actual spray
paint I used when I built my rocket

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.470
rifle four years ago which was one of my
first videos.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.480
Kind of sentimental

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.060
Shon: What you're gonna wanna do here is with gentle hands go like that.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.320
Gentle hands though, you wanna keep those hands gentle...

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.130
Is this what you're gonna want to do?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.780
Grant: Now we just gotta go set this down for a few minutes and let it dry.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.700
Shon: *katcchh*   " I will destroy you"!

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.180
Grant: So I think I roughed in
all the cardboard (laughs)

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.040
Shon: Where was I when you made this? *laughs*
Grant: -and I might
have to trim these fins up a little bit

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.410
I think that's going to be our rocket
right there I'm just going to give it a

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.300
hit of black spray paint to make a
little bit

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.590
Shon: -definitely do that... yes.....a hundred percent, and
maybe a little bit of green

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.120
camouflage bullets they won't see it coming

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.660
Grant: Our rockets pretty much done , painted
black with some spray paint and the cool

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.590
thing about using a bottle top is that you can
still unscrew and there's a cavity in

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.450
here where you can add some weight

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.290
I'm just gonna put a little bit of sand in there
and that's going to shift the center of

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.900
gravity forward make the single more
aerodynamic

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.080
so check it out guys our project is done
we've got some pretty cool-looking

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.560
equipment we're ready to launch rockets
Shon: liquid nitrogen missiles to be exact

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.940
so if you want to see how that turned out
go check out the Shonduras channel

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.360
we're going to be there getting ready to
rock-et
Shon: Rocket la... wait did you just say rocket

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.560
hahahaha!
(Grant: Let's Go)

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.720
Okay guys we just got back from filming in
the park and I cannot wait to show you

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.990
the footage that we got which you're
going to see on this guy's video we

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.500
Shon: It exploded and the missile went up and away in the ground and made a hole like this big

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.040
and should I tell them all that?

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.420
Grant: yeah go check it out (Shon :  just watch it was good now) if you're wondering who Shonduras is

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.460
I met him at CVX Live he's a really cool guy

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.370
Shon: No big deal gonna be a mess. Grant: Tell these guys in about five seconds what you do

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.550
Shon: five seconds... fun.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.600
Grant:   .... it's fun

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.190
so, if you like daily vlogs...and watching
like, random adventures, he's always

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.040
getting an in..... Shawn: Lot's of skateboarding,
snowboarding, shredding, falling...

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.360
getting hurt awesomeness! ... Good stuff...

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.820
Grant: Alright, so go check him out and
thanks for joining us for this adventure

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.960
We're gonna see you guys in the  next video with
some other random project. I'll talk to you then.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.180
Shawn: Hahaha, thats good!

00:06:51.180 --> 00:07:09.960
(music)
