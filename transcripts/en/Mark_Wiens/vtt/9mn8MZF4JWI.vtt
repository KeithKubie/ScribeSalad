00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.010
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day,

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.400
it's Mark Wiens, I'm in Pakistan,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.610
and today we're flying
from Islamabad to Skardu

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.240
which is in Gilgit-Baltistan.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.973
Today is going to begin our
Himalayan adventure part

00:00:10.973 --> 00:00:11.969
of this Pakistan trip.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.480
We're gonna learn about the culture,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.712
we're gonna see some just like
shockingly beautiful scenery,

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:20.420
and also enjoy some delicious local food.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.550
We're on our way, we should
catch our flight pretty soon.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.040
And even the flight is
known to be incredible

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.190
because we're gonna fly
through the mountains.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.299
Okay our flight leaves pretty soon.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:30.882
(upbeat music)

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:38.980
It's gonna be about a 45-minute flight,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.830
we're on our way.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.564
It's amazing, we took off from Islamabad.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:45.797
It's just now 8:30 a.m.,

00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:46.780
you could just see the landscape getting

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.160
more and more rugged.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.426
We're now starting to see
lots of snow capped peaks.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.009
(gentle music)

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.540
We just caught a glimpse of Nanga Parbat.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.041
It's spectacular ,but then all of a sudden

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:01.882
it's just completely clouds now.

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:03.790
No more visibility, but
I think we're starting

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.581
to go down towards Skardu.

00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:08.164
(upbeat music)

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:16.930
Okay, we made it to Skardu.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.432
Oh, it's not too cold.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:19.610
I think they said it's 16 degrees,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.720
but welcome to Skardu.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.930
We're just in like an
amphitheater of mountains here.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.609
- The pilot was driving like
rally driver in the end.

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.780
We had to maneuver it
so many times to land.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.370
This was one crazy flight, man.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.685
- It's gorgeous.

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:35.510
- All it was Skardu boys.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.343
Himalayan Boys.

00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:38.081
- Yesterday we were the Fishoary Boys.

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:39.259
- Now we are the Himalayan Boys.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.092
(laughs)

00:01:40.092 --> 00:01:42.080
- The plan today is that we're gonna go

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.530
from here into Skardu town,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.150
we're gonna walk around for a little bit,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.300
and then we're gonna drive to Shigar

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.540
where we're gonna actually
stay where the hotel is.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.373
We're gonna check in there,

00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:51.599
we're gonna have lunch,

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.500
and then after that we'll be
having more of a local meal

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.916
in the afternoon, evening.

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:55.870
(squealingt)

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.383
Oh, you have a TV.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.110
(laughs)

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.710
Oh nice!

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.153
Cool.

00:02:02.153 --> 00:02:05.174
(upbeat music)

00:02:05.174 --> 00:02:06.513
Really cool.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.923
Ali, next, we need to try this.

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:12.090
- [Man] Okay, okay.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.620
- Nice to meet you.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.710
We have been led out of the vehicle

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.270
right in front of a man
who's making chapli kebabs,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.430
which are the minced patty shaped kebabs.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.900
And I think the aroma is just too strong.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.590
I cannot resist.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.940
We gotta try to get a hold
of one of these patties.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.240
You want one Joel?
- Yes.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.990
- [Mark] You want one also?

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:38.927
Ali, you want a chapli? (laughs)

00:02:38.927 --> 00:02:41.218
- [Ali] You found chapli here?

00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:42.275
- You found chapli.

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:43.400
- You found a chapli here, eh.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.670
- [Mark] We smelled them, we had to.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.463
- [Joel] These are almost
like porforas, man.

00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:51.360
(moaning)

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.020
That's not like a fatty version.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.220
It's like tastes very healthy almost.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.760
Almost like the texture of potato or like,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.680
I think there must be lots
of vegetables in there.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.075
Or lots of onions, definitely
lots and lots of onions.

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:03.530
The coriander seed.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.670
It's like a hash brown.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.503
Oh, you got the bread, nice.

00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:09.240
- It's so warm and so crispy.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.450
- Back in this little hut here is where

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.170
they're making the tandoori roti.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.730
Okay, let's go try some tandoori roti

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.140
with the chapli though.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.805
Oh, chicken pita.

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:18.593
Okay, now to try with the chutney.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.810
- That is so unbelievably good.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.080
To me, they're almost like a cross between

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.957
a chapli and a kapora

00:03:25.957 --> 00:03:28.100
because it tastes like a
heavy vegetable content,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.096
heavy onion content.

00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:32.679
(upbeat music)

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.370
What is this one?

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.843
- [Vendor] This was vegetable.

00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:41.192
- [Mark] Saag?

00:03:41.192 --> 00:03:42.298
- [Vendor] Saag.

00:03:42.298 --> 00:03:44.873
(chuckles)

00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:46.780
This was meant to just be a quick snack

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.300
because we wanted to
try the, oh it's ready.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.500
Meant to be a quick snack of the kebabs,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.170
but this place is so cool and it's so good

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.347
that he also has some curries.

00:03:56.347 --> 00:03:58.340
We've got some saag and some mutton curry,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.420
which he mixed actually,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.776
and then just heated over the stove.

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:02.963
This was irresistible.

00:04:03.856 --> 00:04:06.439
(upbeat music)

00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:10.970
(moaning)

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.440
Oh that meat is so tender, then wrapped up

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.700
in its own curry juices,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.010
but then also he added the saag,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.790
so it has just like
silky, veggie taste to it.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.943
And hearty and warming and so tasty.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.474
Wow.

00:04:28.474 --> 00:04:30.070
(chuckles)

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.080
How is it Ali?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.913
- It's really good.

00:04:31.913 --> 00:04:33.361
I was surprised.

00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:36.421
- I think we just ordered
one more loti eight times.

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:38.610
One more, one more.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.760
- Shukria.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.030
We spent a little too long there,

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.140
we got a little carried away.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.590
But that was just so worth it.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.070
We gotta move on and we are going,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.919
heading towards hotel now.

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.504
(upbeat music)
Landscapes, yeah.

00:04:51.504 --> 00:04:53.990
What's amazing here is that it's dry,

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.340
and so its a desert,
and there's sand dunes.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.156
But then you've got these moonscapes

00:04:58.156 --> 00:04:59.930
and just the rugged mountains.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.207
It is, it's spectacular.

00:05:02.207 --> 00:05:04.790
(upbeat music)

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.233
We're in the desert,

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.232
just sand with the mountains surrounding.

00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:22.660
(laughs) This is a moonscape.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.524
A gorgeous moonscape.

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:27.107
(upbeat music)

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:41.196
We are now moving on,
proceeding on to Shigar Fort.

00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:42.260
(sighs)

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.082
And it's like getting
colder by the second.

00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:46.665
(upbeat music)

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.960
That was a stunning ride,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.470
but this is a fort that was
built in the 17th century.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.053
Now it's been converted
and restored into a hotel.

00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:12.666
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:13.560
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.500
- My name is Kareem, I am the
manager for the Fort, sir.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.780
- Oh great.
- Welcome to Shigar.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.810
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.290
- The fresh apricot juice was the service.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.190
- [Mark] Oh nice.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.766
Traditional apricot juice?
- Yeah.

00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:24.770
- (sighs) Oh that's wonderful.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.894
Almost like vanilla, carmely flavor to it.

00:06:27.894 --> 00:06:30.477
(upbeat music)

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.770
Very cool, now down to a courtyard here,

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.660
views of the mountains.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.493
Come back here.

00:06:42.493 --> 00:06:45.160
This is the main bedroom.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.839
- This is the room, ah.
- It's so cozy.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.700
- This is our little room Hector.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.103
- Thank you babe.
- It's so cozy and warm.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.400
- Oh wow.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.460
- Shukria.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.330
- This doorway is so cool, but this is,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.370
I'll give you a quick tour.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.370
This is the front entrance room.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.693
There's a bed in here,

00:07:00.693 --> 00:07:03.460
this is the main door here,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.960
bathroom is over on this side.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.840
Step under this little wooden door...

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.803
Oh cool, a very modern bathroom.

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:14.330
What is this little thing?

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.270
Micah passed out on the road.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.863
He missed out on all
of the beautiful views.

00:07:18.863 --> 00:07:21.446
(upbeat music)

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.000
This is a Queen Apple tree,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.172
which I've never heard of or seen before.

00:07:33.172 --> 00:07:34.763
There's some fruits on top.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.690
Oh thank you.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.523
Great!

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:39.352
(laughs)

00:07:39.352 --> 00:07:40.313
Thank you very much.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:42.720
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.800
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.123
I don't think I've ever
had a queen apple before.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.483
Oh.

00:07:57.362 --> 00:07:59.056
(chuckles)

00:07:59.056 --> 00:07:59.940
Oh that is chalky.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.693
Wow, and sour, kinda salty.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.033
Whew!

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.380
Yeah, I don't think Micah will.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.880
I don't know about this,
it's really chalky buddy.

00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:14.733
(laughs) Micah, how is it?

00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:18.679
- It smells like an apple.

00:08:18.679 --> 00:08:20.240
(laughs)

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.969
That's intense, wow!

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:24.216
(laughs)

00:08:24.216 --> 00:08:25.424
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:25.424 --> 00:08:26.830
- [Mark] Try a Queen Apple.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.113
It's good, but really chalky and like,

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:31.653
almost too hard to bite.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.680
(laughs)

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.290
Okay, and after that apple experience,

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.250
they said lunch, they just
called us over for lunch.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.350
Lunch is ready.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.530
We're underneath the
grapevines, next to the river.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.150
This is spectacular.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.580
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.413
This is a mutton broth.

00:08:47.413 --> 00:08:49.352
And then there's supposed
to be pieces of chapati,

00:08:49.352 --> 00:08:51.220
which have been like sliced up in here.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.340
Oh and pieces of mutton.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.940
So that might be, like it
almost looks like noodles.

00:08:58.627 --> 00:08:59.663
Mm.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.420
Oh that's really nice.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.100
Yeah they're not noodles
because they taste

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.083
like saturated bread strands like chapati.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.600
Okay next I'm gonna eat this dumpling

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.770
which is called mumto here, I think.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.940
Mumto, it looks very
similar to like a momo,

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.179
which is found across this region as well.

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:22.390
I think that's a winner.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.211
(moaning)

00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:26.044
Kind of like doughy.

00:09:26.044 --> 00:09:28.303
This one is stuffed with
minced chicken, I believe.

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:33.970
(moaning)

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.370
It's like a crispy and
stuffed with minced chicken,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.230
there's some spices in
there, a little bit of chili.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.870
The main dishes have all arrived

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.370
and we have some very unique dishes,

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.100
some things I've never tried before.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.880
And they really make use of apricots here.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.500
And so we've got a mutton dish,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.020
which is liked a stewed
mutton with local yogurt,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.550
fresh yogurt as well as,

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.650
you can really smell
the aroma of apricots.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.770
And you said they're, they make this dish

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.950
with local apricot oil.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.260
So from the seeds, or
the nuts of the apricot.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.190
Yeah, you can even smell
that fruity apricot aroma

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.307
and just that thick sauce,
and look at that oil.

00:10:12.718 --> 00:10:14.885
(moaning)

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.880
There's not even a
denial that it's apricot.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.991
You just immediately get this
apricot, creamy sensation

00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:25.040
and then just like curdled yogurt.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.030
And then we've got another dish,

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.270
it looks like kind of layers of dough

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.987
with vegetable just wrapped up in it.

00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:33.637
And they also said this is
made with walnuts as well.

00:10:35.557 --> 00:10:37.724
(moaning)

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.120
That taste like the noodles
that were in the soup.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.200
You taste the cumin in there
and then the local spinach.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.978
Okay, this one is the
chicken and nut based sauce,

00:10:47.978 --> 00:10:49.910
probably some walnuts in there.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.170
I'm not sure what else.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.498
And possibly, I don't know
actually, let's taste it.

00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:58.081
(upbeat music)

00:10:59.937 --> 00:11:00.770
(moaning)

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.371
Again, that sauce is really rich.

00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:06.350
And I almost taste, kind
of a sweet spice in there.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.953
Anise, maybe anise in there too.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.250
They kind of look similar,
the mutton and the chicken.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.490
Totally different taste though.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.800
The mutton has that fruity apricot flavor.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.947
The chicken has that very nutty,

00:11:17.947 --> 00:11:20.080
anise, walnut taste to it.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.040
We got a dessert, a little
mixed fruit platter.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.011
And it's a dry apricot, it looks like,

00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:26.463
almost like a dried
pudding, a dry apricot.

00:11:27.384 --> 00:11:29.967
(upbeat music)

00:11:31.436 --> 00:11:32.269
(moaning)

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:34.310
Apricot pudding with
nuts chopped up in it.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.290
- [Woman] Micah wait.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.000
- I think that is like
a almond whipped cream.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.583
(upbeat music)

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.050
My first time to ever taste apricot oil.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.807
I think I've never tasted a
dish made with apricot oil.

00:11:46.807 --> 00:11:48.580
Absolutely stunning.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.200
That might be the next
big thing, apricot oil.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.890
We are off to just walk around the Fort,

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.840
and we're gonna get a
guided tour of the Fort

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.500
and the whole compound.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.143
- And cutways for dark palaces.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.333
So this rock is approximately 50 feet

00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:03.020
throughout the foundation.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.430
- The original Fort was built in 1634

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.319
and one of the icons of the Fort

00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:10.680
it was built on this big rock here.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.410
So you can see it, the
foundation is this rock.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.970
And then it goes up from here.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.300
Here's one of the main entrances.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.410
Walls of the fort are built
from mud, wood and stone.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.110
- This is the religious
patrons of Buddhism.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.940
- Oo, ah.
- Just like Chinese snakes.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.020
If an enemy wild, so it is very hard.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.134
- It is all original from 400 years ago.

00:12:31.134 --> 00:12:34.830
And this is one of the coolest pots ever.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.550
This is carved from a single stone,

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.660
that's a pot to keep water in.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.260
The fort was built by
Hassan Khan ad Amacha.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.790
Their family had
originally come from Tibet

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.870
many, many years ago,
many generations ago.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.100
But he was the King of Shigar

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.825
and he's the one who built,
who constructed the fort.

00:12:51.825 --> 00:12:55.090
(upbeat music)

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.300
For dinner tonight, we
have a special opportunity

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.940
Ali arranged for us to
be with a local family

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.140
and have a local dinner.

00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:05.750
It's cozy in here.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.993
It smells amazing, it smells amazing.

00:13:08.863 --> 00:13:10.393
- Wonderful.
- Hello, hello.

00:13:11.534 --> 00:13:13.080
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, hello.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.440
Good thank you.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.463
Apricot pickle.

00:13:18.773 --> 00:13:20.320
(women laughing)

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.130
They've already shown us the,

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.110
there's an apricot pickle
which is down there,

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.680
and then there's gonna be some macaroni,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.460
there's some frying peppers,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.880
the aromas coming out of
this kitchen are incredible.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.730
Remove our shoes?

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.030
Oh they have some sandals.

00:13:35.145 --> 00:13:37.426
(speaks in foreign language)

00:13:37.426 --> 00:13:39.120
- Local magi.
- Local magi.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.560
- Okay, it's name is Bali.
- Bali?

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.393
- [Woman] Yes.

00:13:44.461 --> 00:13:46.322
- [Mark] Oh hold on, come on.

00:13:46.322 --> 00:13:47.588
- [Woman] It's name is krapul.

00:13:47.588 --> 00:13:48.451
- [Mark] Krapul.

00:13:48.451 --> 00:13:49.527
- [Woman] We mix the--

00:13:49.527 --> 00:13:52.224
- 'Cause this outer kitchen is incredible!

00:13:52.224 --> 00:13:56.240
They have this whole oven
structure to hold the fire,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.890
but they have a couple of blazing fires.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.550
Another one of the main dishes
that we're going to eat.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.460
That's actually, it's
gonna be cooked with that

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.173
apricot walnut sauce pickle.

00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:17.959
(speaks in foreign language)

00:14:19.744 --> 00:14:22.580
It looks kind of like a pasta,
but like in huge chunks.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.950
And then she put in that walnut piece,

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.260
that pickle, and then stirred that around.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.720
And then they've heated
up some apricot oil,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.630
and then she poured it out on top of that,

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.395
and then stirred that around.

00:14:35.395 --> 00:14:37.978
(upbeat music)

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.084
They were not joking about 14 dishes.

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:46.860
Whoa!

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.460
This one looks incredible too!

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.660
Gotta start with the
Bali which is the soup.

00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:57.860
(moaning)

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.280
And you've got like this dough,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.729
kinda doughy noodles in there.

00:15:00.729 --> 00:15:05.729
- It's got flour in it, and the
main ingredients are walnut.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.673
- [Mark] Walnuts.

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:08.030
- We have grind the walnut.
- It's the walnut

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.900
pickle in there.
- Yes, yes.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.240
- This is the one that
we saw here prepare,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.790
and then it is covered in
this walnut paste pickle.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:17.950
(moaning)

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.200
Oh that's incredible.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.228
No that was a big bite, yeah.

00:15:21.228 --> 00:15:22.600
So like thick and hearty.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.300
The noodles, they're not really noodles,

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.003
they're like boiled dough kind of.

00:15:29.669 --> 00:15:31.830
That walnut sauce, whoa!

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.070
- [Man] Try to make it like a spoon.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.260
- Oh nice.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.340
- [Man] Like that thing you
have in that freestand oil?

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.340
- [Man] Yes, as much as you
want, you know, and then eat it.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.523
- Buckwheat right?

00:15:42.523 --> 00:15:46.953
And then in the middle
is a bowl of apricot oil.

00:15:49.036 --> 00:15:49.869
(moaning)

00:15:49.869 --> 00:15:54.493
Nutty oil with like a
thick like starchy dough.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.403
It's kind of oily.

00:15:57.403 --> 00:16:00.253
There's apricot oil and
then natural sugars.

00:16:02.278 --> 00:16:04.590
Whoa, yeah!

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.270
It's sweet, it's almost
like a sweet pancake,

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.103
but like gooey.

00:16:08.103 --> 00:16:09.341
- Yeah.
- Meat on it's own?

00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:12.443
- Yeah, and then--
(speaks in foreign language)

00:16:12.443 --> 00:16:13.276
- Is it boiled?

00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:16.990
It's just boiled, but it's fresh goat

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.350
that they've butchered here themselves,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.990
and you just slice up
a chunk for yourself,

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.849
a little drumstick section.

00:16:24.849 --> 00:16:26.520
Oh yeah, look at that.

00:16:28.149 --> 00:16:30.099
Would you like a slice?

00:16:30.099 --> 00:16:32.710
(upbeat music)

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:33.543
So good.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.393
So natural!

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.750
Soft, that's just award winning.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.287
Oh next dish.
- Wheat.

00:16:44.287 --> 00:16:46.000
- Like a buckwheat type of pancake

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.410
with that same chutney.

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:50.676
(moaning)

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.290
That chutney is amazing.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.396
Those nuts.

00:16:53.396 --> 00:16:57.640
(speaks in foreign language)

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.920
Onto the curry course,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.360
we've got a mutton curry,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.780
and then also the chicken korma

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.080
all to be eaten with rice.

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:09.880
Oh, I think I lost a
chunk out of my mouth.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.360
Not a lot of dry spices in there.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.070
It's more of a stew taste.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.720
All right, try the chicken korma.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.813
Oh that's wonderful as well.

00:17:19.813 --> 00:17:22.440
You really taste the
sourness of that yogurt.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.550
All of these dishes are home cooked.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.440
They've been making some
of them all day long.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.773
This is incredibly special.

00:17:27.773 --> 00:17:30.380
This is an unbelievable meal.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.062
This is a true
representation of Baltistan.

00:17:34.062 --> 00:17:37.479
The culture, the food, the hospitality.

00:17:37.479 --> 00:17:40.090
This is absolutely incredible.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:40.923
And believe it or not,

00:17:40.923 --> 00:17:43.840
macaroni also happens to be
a very popular thing to eat

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.100
in this region in Baltistan.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.023
This is the soup that the
fresh goat was boiled in.

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:54.539
(moaning)

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:56.910
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.743
Shukria.

00:17:59.419 --> 00:18:00.665
Yeah they do.

00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:03.248
(upbeat music)

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.550
You can really taste the cinnamon.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.400
This one is a little bit
sweet, but then green tea.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.720
It's so fragrant,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.820
but you really taste the cinnamon in this.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.270
One more consumable is the salty tea,

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.340
like a butter tea,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.360
And yeah, this entire
region consumes butter tea

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.773
especially when it's cold.

00:18:24.302 --> 00:18:25.570
(moaning)

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.403
Yeah.

00:18:26.403 --> 00:18:27.670
That's nicely salted.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.980
You can taste the butter in there.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.813
I like it.

00:18:30.813 --> 00:18:33.690
It just brings back great
memories of being in the mountains

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.170
in this region of the world.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.790
Added in some powdered wheat

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.793
and apricot oil and gave it a stir.

00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:44.443
That apricot oil

00:18:44.443 --> 00:18:46.503
and again it has that, a bit
of an almondy taste to it.

00:18:46.503 --> 00:18:48.883
That apricot oil just makes it.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.730
Shukria, thank you very much.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:56.563
Shukria.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.200
Okay, now it's pretty cold outside.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.175
But we just made it back.

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:06.610
That was a spectacular dinner

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.330
and to be able to sit
down with the family.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.003
Everything was prepared special for us,

00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:14.394
we were the honored guests.

00:19:14.394 --> 00:19:17.200
They just showed us so much hospitality,

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.900
the food was incredible,
the local flavors,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.778
the local Balti food, that
was an incredible experience

00:19:23.778 --> 00:19:26.410
to learn about Baltistan.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.690
The food, the culture, the people.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.760
I want to say a huge
thank you to the family

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.310
for inviting us to their home.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.320
Huge thank you to Ali from

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.110

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.140
