BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.510
interesting developer community.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.340
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.860
has asked this question.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.727
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:13.727 --> 00:00:15.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is,
primarily, a question and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.910
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.160
would like to ask questions.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.460
TODD KERPELMAN: And we're
live, I think.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.370
Our monitor is broken
so I don't know.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.870
WOLFF DOBSON: Unless we're on
a YouTube stream, at which

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.070
point we're not live at all.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.140
TODD KERPELMAN: So I'm
Todd Kerpelman.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.900
I'm here with Colt McAnlis,
Wolff Dobson, John McCutchan.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.930
We're here actually talking
about what happened to Google

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.190
Games chat number one.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.670
COLT MCANLIS: Last week.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.400
TODD KERPELMAN: Which--

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.500
WOLFF DOBSON: Where did it go?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.880
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.460
TODD KERPELMAN: Unfortunately--

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.770
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Where was it?

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.410
TODD KERPELMAN: --it took
YouTube an awfully long time

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.210
to process.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.640
So I think it just went
up yesterday.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.480
And the ending got cut off,
which was the best part, those

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.390
of you who didn't see it.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.480
It was totally the best part.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.210
COLT MCANLIS: And There was--

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.400
if you were following the ticket
YouTube actually said

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.110
the problem was there was too
much awesome in it and--

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.970
WOLFF DOBSON: They couldn't
compress awesome well enough.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.480
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah,
we don't have--

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.420
WOLFF DOBSON: To fit inside
the bit rate.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.600
COLT MCANLIS: At Google.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.850
WOLFF DOBSON: Do we know
anybody at YouTube?

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020
TODD KERPELMAN: I guess we'll
find out after this.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.400
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.358
TODD KERPELMAN: When we
get angry emails.

00:01:13.358 --> 00:01:15.380
COLT MCANLIS: We'll get an
email here in a minute.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.150
TODD KERPELMAN: Actually it's
too bad because we were-- that

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.740
was when we were just getting
into the interesting

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.140
discussions and we can--
we'll bring that back--

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.025
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah,
I think we should.

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:23.360
TODD KERPELMAN: --for the
beginning of this talk of,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480
basically, how do you prevent,
particularly, in a JavaScript

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.320
kind of game, how do you prevent
clients from cheating?

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.120
How do you prevent someone from,
basically, putting in a

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.780
little break point in Chrome and
changing things around and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.940
sort of screwing around
with your game code?

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.340
And I think where we netted out
that last time was, you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.330
really can't.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.020
That's--

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.690
WOLFF DOBSON: Well it doesn't
on what you think is

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.550
compromisable and
what you don't.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.210
Ultimately, any client
is compromisable.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.400
If it's sitting on somebody's
desk they're going to be able

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.030
to change it.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.680
There are famous examples of in
Halo where they were using

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.930
bridges to run the ethernet
packets through.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.370
And then they were intercepting
packets and

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.540
changing them or reading them.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.080
They were--

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.640
they eventually--

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.440
I think they had to run
around and find delay.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.840
And then accuse people-- it's
like, oh you have too much

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.320
delay and lag, you must be using
one of these lag cheat

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.920
fixer things.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.780
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So
this was done on

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.630
the server side though?

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.360
WOLFF DOBSON: Well no.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.830
So people, because the
old Halo had ran--

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.830
the servers were on
people's boxes.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.870
Like they had--

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh, P2P.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.030
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.430
So in the P2P people put bridges
and their PC would

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.115
actually catch incoming packets
and change the and

00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:34.140
send them back out again.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.560
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's ingenius.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.260
WOLFF DOBSON: You're
looking terrifying.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.770
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh my gosh.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.640
WOLFF DOBSON: You're
looking terrified.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.310
TODD KERPELMAN: That's--

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.910
WOLFF DOBSON: They
can do that.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.060
TODD KERPELMAN: The amount
of effort that is put in.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.610
WOLFF DOBSON: Hey.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.010
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah?

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.490
WOLFF DOBSON: Do you want
to win at Halo?

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.180
I want to win at Halo.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.640
TODD KERPELMAN: Apparently
not that badly.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.030
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's a
competitive sport.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.190
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.210
Well it sort of is.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.520
I mean--

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.200
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I don't know.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.690
WOLFF DOBSON: If 13-year-olds
shouting at you over the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.950
internet, you want
to beat them.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.790
TODD KERPELMAN: But I think
even if there's no kind of

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.930
mess around with network
packets, you have the issue of

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.310
guys like Colt making auto
players for games that play

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.030
them perfectly.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.480
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.710
That got cut off of
the last chat.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.510
TODD KERPELMAN: That
did get cut off.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.610
COLT MCANLIS: I guess I
should fill you in.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.850
So at the end of last chat they
were talking about what

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.910
are we playing right now.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.440
I had to admit that I've been
become slightly addicted to

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.640
Triple Town a while ago.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.280
TODD KERPELMAN: Which
is an awesome game.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.870
COLT MCANLIS: Fantastic game.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.270
And I kind of realized that
there was algorithmic

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.600
properties of it.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.360
A little bit towards the
middle of my addiction.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.670
And decided to actually write
a algorithm that would play

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.420
the game for me.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.760
Right?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.890
Because there's a basic pattern
of match three, get an

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.010
upgrade, match three,
get an upgrade.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.450
And so I found this algorithmic
pattern and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.130
actually wrote an AI that would
actually play the thing

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.320
for me, and actually find
the proper places to put

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.315
everything to maximize
the number of castles

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:45.330
on my four by four.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.683
WOLFF DOBSON: Because, you know,
if you have fun, you

00:03:46.683 --> 00:03:48.170
need to optimize it out.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.010
That's what I'm saying.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.590
COLT MCANLIS: To me it was an
algorithmic challenge, right.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.190
I mean once you kind of get to
the point you've got the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.320
algorithm together then I
actually stopped caring,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.882
because I was like I solved this
and then one day I woke

00:03:57.882 --> 00:03:59.360
up in the morning and I was
like, wait a minute.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.050
It works on a 16 by 16.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.810
But what if it was like a
million by a million?

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.210
And so then I actually had to
re-engineer the algorithm to

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.260
run everything in JavaScript
to try to find how many

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.635
castles I could put in a million
by a million and then

00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:10.230
have that data.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.820
WOLFF DOBSON: Did you use
Google Compute Engine?

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.350
COLT MCANLIS: I didn't.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.950
WOLFF DOBSON: Its
700,000 cores.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.510
COLT MCANLIS: I should have.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.810
I really should have.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.820
That's next, actually.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.589
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.990
Use all of Google's
infrastructure to be one giant

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.120
Triple Town.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.380
TODD KERPELMAN: That,
that would be cool.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.500
COLT MCANLIS: I hate
those bears.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.490
TODD KERPELMAN: The
bears are--

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.910
WOLFF DOBSON: We have bears
lose on the internet.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.660
TODD KERPELMAN: They--

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.550
yeah, the bears are
frustrating.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.510
WOLFF DOBSON: I love
the bears.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.140
They're so cute.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.000
TODD KERPELMAN: Really?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.790
TODD KERPELMAN: The
ninja bears.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.180
You just can't plane for them
and I have no defense against

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.690
them beyond--

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.230
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh,
they're so cute.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.120
TODD KERPELMAN: --saving the
bots for the times that the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.930
bears, the ninja bears
do come up.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Coming
back to cheating.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.230
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm sorry.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think the
message here is that, like

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.300
there's always been cheating if
you go back to the earliest

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.750
video game consoles, there's
been mechanisms to cheat and

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.620
inflate your score.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.150
So social pressures and server
checks can go a long way.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.400
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.490
I think that's really you're
only-- especially in

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.450
situations like Colt where you
can't really detect between a

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.400
player who just happens to be
really good and an algorithm.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.820
At some point you're going to
know if you say, hey, anyone

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.600
that gets higher than this
score is going to be a

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.080
cheater, you will probably get
some of those cheaters, but

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.060
you're also going to get one or
two legitimate players who

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.300
are probably your biggest fans
who have probably put money in

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.790
your game, and all of
sudden you've banned

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.940
them for being cheaters.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.355
And all the cheaters are going
to do is when you say, hey, a

00:05:31.355 --> 00:05:33.290
million points or more you must
be cheater, they're going

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.560
to set their games to
play to 900,999.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.710
And you're going to kind of keep
going back and forth in

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.340
this sort of arms race
that never ends.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.340
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.820
And I think one of things we
mentioned last time, which

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.680
probably didn't make it into
the broadcast, was

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.035
one, if you look at--

00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:52.760
oh, shoot.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.770
Space Camp.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.380
If you look at Space Camp
and whenever which--

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.660
this is what we said last time,
oh my gosh, Space Camp.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.410
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So good.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.730
COLT MCANLIS: Go buy
Space Camp now.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.610
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Play
Space Camp.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.120
COLT MCANLIS: We'll wait.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.030
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.190
Hit pause, go download Space
Camp, come back.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.020
One of the things that Space
Camp that's really neat is

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.310
that they have a graph that you
get at the end of each one

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.470
of your plays that gives you a
histogram on where you are in

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.810
relationship to other people
who have done that level.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.100
And what it does is it gives
you a chance to--

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.030
it gives you, sorry we
just got ourselves a

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.630
bit slightly delayed.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.590
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's weird.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.360
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm like,
weird looking at me.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.390
It's

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.640
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Great.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.020
WOLFF DOBSON: There we go.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.870
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
very delayed.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.460
WOLFF DOBSON: So it gives
you this histogram.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.530
And the histogram
allows you to--

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.720
OK, we probably--

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.620
can we--

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.630
TODD KERPELMAN: It's a
little distracting.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.980
COLT MCANLIS: Look
at the camera.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.700
You're supposed to look
at the camera.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.080
WOLFF DOBSON: I know.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.500
I'm looking at the camera.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.000
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh,
I'm drinking.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.290
Wait.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.270
No I'm not.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.920
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's move on.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.150
WOLFF DOBSON: Sorry.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.630
There's a histogram and the
histogram tells you are you

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.710
doing well relative
to other people.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.460
So it's not a high score
list where cheaters

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.030
are going to win.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.480
All it really tells you is,
I'm doing pretty well or I

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.180
should go back and do this again
to see if it's better.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.980
And I think that is absolutely
cool beyond the fact that

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.990
Space Camp is really cool.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.460
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.070
It really changes the high
score table from being an

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.270
absolute measurement to being
a relative measurement.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.090
Which cheaters can still skew.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.660
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.160
But that's going to
happen anyway.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.312
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:07:19.312 --> 00:07:19.980
TODD KERPELMAN: And
I'm all about the

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.770
social leader boards.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.690
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.960
TODD KERPELMAN: A global leader
board, it's going to be

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.350
full of cheaters and it's just
going to frustrate anyone that

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.810
looks at it.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.300
But a social leader board if
you've got one guy, life Colt,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.680
that's at the top who--

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.130
COLT MCANLIS: I like
how we keep

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.250
calling it the Colt situation.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.440
Like this guy over here.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.050
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The cheater.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.450
COLT MCANLIS: The cheater.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.750
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.096
The cheater.

00:07:37.096 --> 00:07:37.790
COLT MCANLIS: It was
an algorithm.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.580
I'm a programmer.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.250
I program.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.002
That's what I do.

00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:42.120
TODD KERPELMAN: And I might
remove you from my gamers

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.240
circles or something.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No, but global
leader boards are incredibly

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.300
frustrating.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.350
Especially for me who maybe
is not the best

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.570
at some games but--

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Maybe you need to
join one of those StarCraft

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.800
teams that can click more than
2,000 times per second.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.830
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: When I look at
the high score table and I see

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:06.880
that I am 250,000 down the
list it's discouraging.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.640
WOLFF DOBSON: There is some
argument that this is part of

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.560
what killed arcades
that you went to.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.400
There were a lot of things
that were pushing on the

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.750
arcades in the '80s
and '90s that--

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.640
where people want to
play and gather--

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.080
but part of it is that they
network the high score lists.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.130
And all a sudden like three guys
in Seattle were the only

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.210
people who were getting on the
high score list anywhere.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.860
And everybody else was
like, why am I even

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.820
playing this game?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.450
But when it was-- you'd go down
there and you'd see seven

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.120
people you didn't really know,
but they were all the people

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.010
who played Street Fighter at
lunch on Thursdays and then

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.280
you had somebody to play with.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.450
And there was a local ranking
that you could beat.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.530
But as soon as there
was this other--

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.760
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I guess I missed
the networking of high

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.179
score tables.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.940
You couldn't just unplug the
box and plug it back in?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.420
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.120
COLT MCANLIS: See.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.480
He's cheater too.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.070
Not just me.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.650
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm just
leveling the playing field.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.670
COLT MCANLIS: It's all
the NaCl guys.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.780
WOLFF DOBSON: The social
people just want

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.785
us all to get along.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.460
COLT MCANLIS: The NaCl guys
are just aggressive.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.100
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.590
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.770
TODD KERPELMAN: So, anyway,
let's move on.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.670
Let's--

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.500
so I think that kind of pretty
much caught up where

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.190
we were last time.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.940
We talked a little bit about
what games we were playing,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.310
but we can talk about
that later.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.080
We never really talked too much
about game related apps

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.970
and hang outs.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.650
One most interesting I think
has been Tabletop Forge.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:19.930
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.930
TODD KERPELMAN: Which is, I
guess, not so much a game

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.570
itself as a--

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.470
WOLFF DOBSON: As a platform
for playing games on.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.760
Yeah.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.650
It's really neat.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.710
They have a wonderful story
that goes with it too.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:31.760
Where they--

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.260
they were two guys who were in
different places who working

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.220
together, who were working
separately, on apps that would

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.130
sort of support playing Dungeons
and Dragons and other

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.170
RPGs in Hangouts.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.430
And then they sort of realized
on the internet, oh, hey,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.590
we're working on the same thing,
we should join forces.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.260
So they joined forces and people
really twigged to it.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.960
And then they ran
a Kickstarter.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.360
And they were like, hey, if
you guys gave us a little

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.000
money we could really
make this good.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.150
And the Kickstarter went big
and then eventually got on

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.390
Penny Arcade, which just
exploded after that.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.050
And they're out there.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.200
If you look for Tabletop Forge
on Google+ they've got their

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.230
own page, you can download
the app.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.100
I think they're still running
a new kick starter for even

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.710
more features.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.770
And you get cool custom tiles
and stuff if you--

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.770
but that I think is
really exciting.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:25.010
And I think it's a neat way to
use Hangouts because, as we're

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.770
talking about cheating,
cheating in

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.800
RPGs is sort of silly.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.330
To be like, I have a plus--

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:31.900
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm 120!

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.950
WOLFF DOBSON: --175 sword.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.570
But within Hangouts you have
social pressure to sort of

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.360
keep it reasonable.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.610
The people you're playing with,
your friends, are going

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.210
to hold you in into playing
in a legitimate way.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.920
I think that's neat too.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.180
I'm really excited about it.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.360
I have friends that I role
play with, but incredibly

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.100
rarely, because we're not
co-located very well.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.500
COLT MCANLIS: Are you the
lightning bolt guy?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.390
WOLFF DOBSON: Lightning bolt.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.860
Fruit.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.410
No.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.640
No, I'm just, I'm a
reluctant paladin.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.630
I've been chosen by the gods
and I really don't want the

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.500
responsibility.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.900
It's not unlike my real life.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.500
So, yeah, that's what's
going on there.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.810
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.300
WOLFF DOBSON: Hopefully there's
going to be all kinds

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:18.730
of new stuff.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.560
We have 8 Ball Pool and a few
other things that are playable

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.120
now that you should check out.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.230
COLT MCANLIS: So you brought up
an interesting point there,

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.410
and I want to get the panel's
view on this.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.320
There's actually been a pretty
healthy trend lately for both

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.070
professional and amateur game
developers coming out on

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.380
Kickstarter and asking for--

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.300
putting up a game plan, putting
a business decision,

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.340
actually asking for money
to move forward with.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.100
This has got a lot
of attention.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.330
More attention than some
people ever estimated.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.280
In fact, Gabe Newell came out
a while ago, before this

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.580
phenomenon, came out and
actually mentioned that he

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.020
believes one of the future ways
to do game development

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.780
may be consumer funded.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.970
So the question for you guys is,
how big of an ecosystem do

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:58.620
you see this?

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.880
How long do you see
the tail on this?

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.240
Do you actually see
this happening?

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.100
I haven't really seen any
of the games come out.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.260
I haven't seen, besides the guys
over at Double Fine, I

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.010
haven't really seen a lot of
established game developers

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.410
coming out and using
this medium.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.710
What are guys' thoughts
on this?

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.780
WOLFF DOBSON: Well I think one
of the big pieces of news was

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.970
Penny Arcade, not to bring them
up again, but they just

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.640
had a Kickstarter saying hey,
let's work on the stuff that

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.210
we want to work on and get rid
of ads off the front page.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.160
And they didn't quite make it.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.750
They got enough money, they
said, I think yesterday, they

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.900
got enough money to remove the
top ad from their thing.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.800
And then they're still probably
going to do the

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.110
project they were kickstarting
even though they didn't quite

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.490
reach their goal to do it.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.110
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The Lookouts.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.470
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.940
The Daughters of the Forest
I think [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.130
COLT MCANLIS: Which is cool.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:42.880
WOLFF DOBSON: Which is cool.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.100
COLT MCANLIS: That's
super-cool.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.130
WOLFF DOBSON: But, yeah, that's
been an interesting

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.170
phenomenon.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.810
There's the Leisure Suit Larry
guys who are rebooting Leisure

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.160
Suit Larry using Kickstarter.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.670
COLT MCANLIS: So, but I
mean, do you think--

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.550
so here's a problem right.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.960
You get a lot of developers and
you can come in and the

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.200
way, my understanding of the
way Kickstarter works is,

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.050
effectively, this money is sort
of pledged to you ahead

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.250
of time and then you're
kind of given this--

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.090
I'm not sure what the
restrictions are versus the

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.620
lending company to you as an
individual and where the money

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.740
goes, but effectively there's
not a lot of checks and

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.530
balances involved as
far as product

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.370
management is concerned.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.516
To assure the product actually
reaches the public.

00:13:19.516 --> 00:13:21.210
That you're actually
going to do it.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.510
You don't get a-- it's not like
having a VC-funded system

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.050
where you get some dude sitting
in you cubicle--

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.930
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.560
As consumers we don't end
up on their board.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.460
I think is what you're saying.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:31.930
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.560
We really have no ability to
hold them liable for our

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.950
potential investment.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:37.220
Right?

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.440
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Personally I've
been very skeptical of

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.610
most Kickstarter projects.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.570
There's been a few that
I've been tempted by.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.250
I'm like, oh, if this actually
came out I would

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.090
buy it in an instant.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.800
And I've always just decided,
well, when it does come out, I

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.540
will buy it.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.300
And avoid the risk.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Well
when I was--

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.080
I just had back surgery recently
and when I was on the

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.460
painkillers I went
to Kickstarter

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.710
and did some damage.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.460
COLT MCANLIS: I'm sorry buddy,
that sounds like a new

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.580
advertising campaign
for [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.230
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.885
COLT MCANLIS: On painkillers?

00:14:07.885 --> 00:14:09.785
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:11.330
WOLFF DOBSON: Painkillers
and Kickstarter.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.120
Perfect together.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.421
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Post-surgery?

00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:13.892
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:14:13.892 --> 00:14:15.142
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Check us out.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.950
TODD KERPELMAN: I guess I--

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.500
COLT MCANLIS: I think you just
closed the thread on this one.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.640
What's your thoughts
on Kickstarter?

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.455
Well, take some quaaludes.

00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:25.950
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.780
On industrial painkillers,
horse

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.520
tranquilizer, it works great.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.860
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There has been a
few projects that seems very

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:39.110
tempting to me, but I've read
some pretty rough postmortems

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.420
of people who've got Kickstarter
money and promised

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.830
too many gifts and freebies to
the donators and ended up,

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.840
after collecting a few hundred
thousand dollars, ended up

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.450
with $20,000 to actually
build the game with.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.170
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.210
I've actually heard that, and
some of the products that I've

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.030
supported have, they've
sort of admitted that.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.020
I think we went a little
crazy with the gifts.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.490
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.310
Yeah.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.880
And lawyer fees and taxes.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.010
There's a lot of things that
people aren't factoring in,

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:11.600
and so maybe it's the developers
responsibility to

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.690
kind of educate them as to what
percentage of Kickstarter

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.190
money are they actually
going to end up with.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:21.000
COLT MCANLIS: And I think, to
be very modern about this

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.480
stuff, I think that's where a
lot of criticism comes for the

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.670
new OUYA console is OK, fine.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.120
So you've made x amount
of money.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.770
Cut that in half and that's
actually what you're going to

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.570
walk away with in
terms of taxes.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.355
Right?

00:15:33.355 --> 00:15:35.770
And then how many of that
is going to produce

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.640
in number of units.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.435
There's manufacturing
costs, there's

00:15:39.435 --> 00:15:39.970
all these other things.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.067
WOLFF DOBSON: Well,
FCC licensing, all

00:15:41.067 --> 00:15:41.550
that kind of stuff.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.200
COLT MCANLIS: Exactly.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.890
There's a massive amount of
money overhead that's not

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:45.630
being accounted for.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.590
So now Double Fine I think did
a great job with this too.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.990
Is they've already come out
and said, hey, Kickstarter

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.410
wasn't our only funding.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.260
They kind of used that as their
springboard to then go

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.580
get funding from other people.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.220
And, now, if OUYA is going that
route, I think that's

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.920
very valuable.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.120
But it's a perfect example of
hey, we're only going to have

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.700
enough money to make 1,000
units the first batch.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.010
Right?

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.530
And then trying to talk to game
developers about hey,

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.760
let's get you on 1,000 units and
get that out to the people

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.340
so you can make money.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.790
That's a really difficult
discussion.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.210
TODD KERPELMAN: It does help
solve some of the traction

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.040
problem, right.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.510
Of like--

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.100
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.390
TODD KERPELMAN: --no one wants
to give you money until you've

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.670
demonstrated traction.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.040
And you can't really demonstrate
traction until

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.000
you've spent a bunch of time
building product, which you

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.582
can't do because you have no
money because no one will give

00:16:31.582 --> 00:16:32.570
it to you because you
don't have traction.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.610
So I think Kickstarter can
be really useful for

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.740
demonstrating there's at least
100,000 people out there who

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.180
have been willing to give me
$10 to get an early preview

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.580
copy of this game.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.550
So clearly there's some sort
of market for this.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.520
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Maybe if we
took the name of the site

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.390
literally as a kick starter.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.380
Maybe it's doing its
job right there.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.540
Right?

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.140
Giving projects some legs, so
that they can go out and get a

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.430
significant amount of money.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.470
TODD KERPELMAN: But not the site
that you should go to to

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.480
fully fund your project.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:00.735
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:17:00.735 --> 00:17:01.090
TODD KERPELMAN: It could be.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.290
COLT MCANLIS: So really the four
of us need to make a post

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.520
Kickstarter site where, once
you've got your Kickstarter

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.560
money, you come to us and we'll
give you VC capital and

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.450
then you can go the
rest of the way.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.480
And then that'll get the angry
guys sitting in your cubicle

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.710
ensuring that you'll
hit your milestone.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The 1,000
console, sorry

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.170
1,000 units, right?

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.530
That's not enough.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.150
The number that I've always
heard is six million.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.270
Six million is enough to get
video game publishers

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.155
interested in producing content
for your platform.

00:17:30.155 --> 00:17:32.640
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, so you're
talking about the buy-in.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.470
I thought, six million
copies of the game?

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.400
Holy moly!

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:35.930
That would be awesome.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.206
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No.

00:17:36.206 --> 00:17:40.380
Six million pieces of hardware
before it becomes relevant to

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.360
large publishers--

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.700
TODD KERPELMAN: I mean, I think
if we're talking about

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.060
the OUYA specifically, or--

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.760
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.320
TODD KERPELMAN: I thought
it was oooya.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.290
I mean, you know--

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.480
WOLFF DOBSON: It's all vowels.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.840
TODD KERPELMAN: That, my
impression of it is that, you

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.040
don't have to essentially build
a new game from scratch.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.470
There are some modifications
you make to a game that's

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.660
available on Android.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.290
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Sure.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:00.700
Yeah.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.190
TODD KERPELMAN: And you--

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.390
to take advantage of the new
interface and the actual--

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.840
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Controller.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.090
TODD KERPELMAN: --controller
and all that.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.745
It's not like, oh, OK, now I'm
building for a PlayStation 3.

00:18:11.745 --> 00:18:12.110
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.510
Yeah.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.120
Well, and PlayStation 3 has
pretty heavy technical debt

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.880
that you have to go into.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.850
TODD KERPELMAN: The other
thing I will say about

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.540
Kickstarter is that I think
it's interesting that--

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.770
and maybe it's just because this
is all the news I read--

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.920
but I think it's interesting
that most the projects that

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.700
seemed to have been successful,
or at least gotten

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.290
the most funding, or have taken
off have all been games

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.720
related, for the most part.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.480
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I think one
of the other ones that's

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.180
been pretty successful
is hardware.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.055
There's the Watch guys and OUYA
and things like this.

00:18:42.055 --> 00:18:44.060
TODD KERPELMAN: The
gaming VR device.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:44.480
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.730
TODD KERPELMAN: That
think looks cool.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.110
WOLFF DOBSON: It
does look cool.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.100
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah
it does look cool.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.170
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm like him.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:49.940
As soon as they have one.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.330
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.240
I'll jump on it as soon
as it's for sale.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.490
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.510
I can tell a story where
I there was--

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.800
I think there's one other
emotional moment where

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.120
Kickstarter can be good.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.940
And that's where you as a fan
are putting your money down to

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.890
say like, I really want this.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.932
I think that's like Double Fine
saying, I want point and

00:19:13.932 --> 00:19:16.260
click adventures again,
or whatever, however

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.020
they phrased it.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.580
Or an album.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.000
I'm $10 into this album.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.290
I did a Kickstarter
for MC Frontalot.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.780
I was like, I want--

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.430
I have been listening to your
music for free for so long, if

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.590
there's some way I can give you
$5, $10, $15 I'm there.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.920
And I put my money down and I
got my early access to videos.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920
I felt like a good fan.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.770
And it was really fun.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.760
I was really tempted
to do the--

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.340
one of the rewards was you can
spend thousands of dollars and

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.890
he'll show up in your
living room and rap.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.510
Which I thought that would have
been pretty awesome too.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.275
COLT MCANLIS: Was this on the
painkillers or off the

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:48.670
painkillers?

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.830
WOLFF DOBSON: This is well
before the painkillers.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.030
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.080
OK.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.550
I got to make sure I understand
where the

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.000
conversation is going to.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.160
WOLFF DOBSON: No, no.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.550
MC Frontalot is great.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.480
And actually I don't know if
you guys remember-- this is

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.460
going to date me a little bit--
there's a game called

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.520
Fool's Errand.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.010
Anybody remember that?

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.640
It was on the old puzzle game
that came out on the Mac.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.720
It was on the Mac Plus.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.480
I played it when I was
in high school.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.940
It was incredibly,
incredibly old.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.920
It was brilliant.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.190
It was all these little puzzles
stuck together and you

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.910
sort of assembled into
some big meta puzzle

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:20.320
that you had to solve.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.530
And we spent hours playing
this game.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.626
And of course we pirated it
because we were high school

00:20:23.626 --> 00:20:25.930
and college students--

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.480
and--

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.930
TODD KERPELMAN: Which
we do not endorse.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:28.820
WOLFF DOBSON: Well,
here's the thing.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.810
So I felt really guilty about
it because I had so much--

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:31.390
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Here comes
the endorsement.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.460
WOLFF DOBSON: I had so
much fun with it.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.490
I had so much with the game and
Cliff Johnson, who's the

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.310
guy who I searched for him with
Google at one point, and

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.480
I came across this site.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.620
And it turns out he's actually
making a sequel called A Fool

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.610
and His Money.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.620
And there's all these auction
games built into it, as well

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.680
as all his regular puzzles.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.710
And he was soliciting
pre-sales.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.840
This was before Kickstarter.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.550
This was five years ago.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.960
Soliciting pre-sales.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.580
And he was like, it's
going to be whatever

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.830
it is, $29 or whatever.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.500
And I was like, sign me up.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.020
I owe you this money from so
long ago, with interest.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.670
This is great.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.430
I put my money down.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.580
I realize there's some irony
in a game called The

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.860
Fool and His Money.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.880
This is the game that I put
down money in advance on.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.850
I have not seen that game yet.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.070
But I don't care.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.580
Because as a fan I felt
like I was supporting.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.905
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The
guy is amazing.

00:21:23.905 --> 00:21:24.960
WOLFF DOBSON: It's brilliant.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.990
COLT MCANLIS: He
just went meta.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.962
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:21:26.962 --> 00:21:27.450
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.420
Yeah, exactly.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.130
It's some kind of
performance art.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.840
He sends this email about once
every six months saying,

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.800
really soon now.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.240
Really, really soon now.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.595
I'm still looking
forward to it.

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:39.172
COLT MCANLIS: A guy in Nigeria
sends me those emails.

00:21:39.172 --> 00:21:40.020
About once a month.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.350
WOLFF DOBSON: Have you
finally gotten your

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.220
transfer of a $150,000?

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:43.420
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No,
but it's soon.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.030
WOLFF DOBSON: Directly
into your account.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.510
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's really,
really soon.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.920
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.220
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.330
COLT MCANLIS: The government's
sanctioning it.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.520
That's the problem.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.120
We got some time left for
questions, right?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:51.950
TODD KERPELMAN: We do.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.140
And I think, depending on how
long we want to run--

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.970
we never actually determined if
this is a half hour or 45

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:58.510
minute show.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.310
COLT MCANLIS: Should we ask
that guy over there?

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.365
TODD KERPELMAN: We
left it vague--

00:22:00.365 --> 00:22:00.840
COLT MCANLIS: Let's
keep going.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.515
TODD KERPELMAN: --so
that we can.

00:22:01.515 --> 00:22:03.280
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I think
we need to keep going.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.710
I want to talk about games
we've been playing.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:05.210
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.210
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.570
WOLFF DOBSON: I want
to talk about--

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.200
I just want on vacation with
my Nexus 7, and I--

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:11.645
COLT MCANLIS: To Alaska.

00:22:11.645 --> 00:22:12.090
WOLFF DOBSON: To Alaska.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.720
COLT MCANLIS: To Alaska.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh,
that's right.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.290
WOLFF DOBSON: That--

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.660
there was some unfortunate
moose comment.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.820
I did in fact see a moose.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.440
I saw a moose.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.930
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: WiFi hotspot?

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.220
WOLFF DOBSON: It was
not a WiFi hotspot.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.320
I was in the middle of Denali
where there was not even a

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.890
call signal.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:25.940
And, in fact, I had trouble.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.010
There's some kind of wacky
WiFi in Alaska.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.240
But once--

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.200
it turned out the coffee shops
and, weirdly, the little tiny

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.820
hole in the wall places in
Denali, awesome WiFi.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.080
I brought my Nexus 7 and I
basically, I didn't bring my

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.900
laptop or anything else,
it was like my entire

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.930
entertainment device,
was my Nexus 7.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.280
And I wanted to talk about one
of the games that my daughter

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.540
and I just went nuts over.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.480
It was Super Stickman Golf.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.790
I don't know if you guys
have seen that.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.600
It's by Noodlecake Studios.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.150
It is just a wonderful
take on 2-D golf.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.190
It's all platforms and
you're bouncing the

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.280
ball up off the platforms.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:02.710
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.140
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh, cool.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.490
WOLFF DOBSON: Really clever.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.950
They switch to a free model and
they have a micro payments

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.350
where you can buy power
ups in the thing.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.940
It's a little weird because, I
love this game and you should

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.680
all play it, but at the same
time, like a fan, I want to

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.170
put my money down, but I don't
really want to buy power ups.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.110
I just want it to be fair.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.800
So, there's an interesting
emotional thing.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.020
So I'm going to buy some power
ups when I get to the point

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.490
which I need them.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.280
But it is an interesting
case where I was just

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.660
like, I'm a big fan.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.010
Here, $5, $10 whatever
you want.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.580
But instead I'm going to micro
payment my way to--

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.220
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So is that
game available on--

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.710
WOLFF DOBSON: It's available
on Android.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.470
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All
Android devices?

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.770
WOLFF DOBSON: I believe it's
all Android devices.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.100
I'll look right now.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.610
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's great.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:44.090
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.800
It's really great.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.206
I would-- ooh, I haven't
plus one'd yet.

00:23:47.206 --> 00:23:48.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Going to have
to get it for my phone.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:48.510
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.400
I would definitely
recommend it.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.080
And it's wonderful
on a tablet.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.074
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Great.

00:23:52.074 --> 00:23:53.900
COLT MCANLIS: Especially
the Nexus 7.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.160
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh yeah.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.650
WOLFF DOBSON: Especially
your Nexus 7.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.010
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The Nexus 7.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.955
TODD KERPELMAN: John, what
are you playing?

00:24:01.955 --> 00:24:02.890
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Let's see.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.560
Lately I've been playing Super
Mario 3D Land actually.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.245
On my 3DS.

00:24:06.245 --> 00:24:06.570
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm enjoying
that quite a bit.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.730
And, I know this is going to
be unpopular, but Scramble

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.790
with Friends.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.680
WOLFF DOBSON: Scramble
with Friends?

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.370
I'm still playing Draw
with Friends.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.860
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.340
WOLFF DOBSON: Or,
Draw Something.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:17.960
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Draw
Something.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.330
WOLFF DOBSON: Draw Something.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.250
TODD KERPELMAN: Draw
Something?

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.910
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Scramble with
Friends I can't stop playing.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.310
I'm too competitive.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.590
I have some really
good competition.

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.540
WOLFF DOBSON: Did you write an
algorithm using Google Compute

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.130
Engine to cheat?

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You know how
many times I've been tempted

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.620
to just, to go ahead
and do that?

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:32.986
COLT MCANLIS: See.

00:24:32.986 --> 00:24:33.600
See.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.120
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm like, OK,
I can just pause this,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.920
transcribe the board onto the
computer and solve it.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.320
And just dominate.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.790
But I want it to be fair.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.260
TODD KERPELMAN: Because are you
actually playing with real

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:44.770
life friends?

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.230
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.556
Yes.

00:24:46.556 --> 00:24:47.300
WOLFF DOBSON: You're not
playing with robots.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Playing with my
cousin and old friends from

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.780
high school.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.500
I don't want to--

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.000
TODD KERPELMAN: You don't
want to cheat.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.610
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.690
Exactly.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:52.850
COLT MCANLIS: Wait.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.350
You don't want to cheat?

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.980
Playing with your old friends
from high school?

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.160
WOLFF DOBSON: I think that's
exactly the moment

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:57.390
which you do cheat.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:57.970
COLT MCANLIS: That's
the exact people.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:58.198
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

00:24:58.198 --> 00:24:58.274
No.

00:24:58.274 --> 00:24:58.350
No.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.740
COLT MCANLIS: You do cheat all
the way up until the high

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.122
school convention.

00:25:00.122 --> 00:25:00.886
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm sorry old
friends from high school.

00:25:00.886 --> 00:25:01.720
COLT MCANLIS: Or the reunion.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.060
Right?

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.270
Then you have something to talk
about at the convention.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I just
kill at Scramble.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.170
Perfect games.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.300
I don't know how I do it.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.860
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, and also
speaking of puzzle games.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.070
I also played 100 Floors.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.970
That sort of--

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.650
COLT MCANLIS: How is that?

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.940
WOLFF DOBSON: It's got some
ridiculous number of downloads

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.570
on the Play store.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:24.380
What are they at?

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.880
They're like 10 million
or something.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.155
Crazy.

00:25:26.155 --> 00:25:27.540
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: How does
the game work?

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.940
WOLFF DOBSON: It is sort of
an escape classic 2005

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.440
escape the room game.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.680
Where you just kind of have an
interface and you kind of

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.080
click around until you
figure it out.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.700
Sometimes--

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.460
and it's just, again, it's
like Fool's Errand.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.250
It's this collection of puzzles
and you don't really

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.500
know-- each time you look at,
what am I going to do?

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.720
Is it motion sensors?

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.730
Am I clicking on things?

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.480
Is there a code?

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.020
And they're--

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.430
it does lie a little.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.440
There are only 90 floors
right now.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.130
But it was very disappointing
when I got to 90 and it said,

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.610
more coming soon.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.700
Nooo!

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.660
COLT MCANLIS: That's
how they get you.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.440
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: 90 floors just
didn't have the same ring.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.270
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.230
WOLFF DOBSON: But it's great.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.733
TODD KERPELMAN: It's
100 [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:03.733 --> 00:26:04.460
Never mind.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.130
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.110
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Speaking of--

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.180
WOLFF DOBSON: If
you have only.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.320
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: --old
puzzle games.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.810
Well, kind of new
puzzle games.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.932
I don't know if anyone
played Zack &amp; Wiki?

00:26:12.932 --> 00:26:13.374
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:26:13.374 --> 00:26:14.260
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: For the Wii?

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:14.530
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:15.440
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Man,
that game was good.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.050
WOLFF DOBSON: That was fun.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:16.980
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I wish that--

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.120
we need to start a Kickstarter
to get

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.010
Capcom to make a sequel.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.920
COLT MCANLIS: I'll put up
the post-Kickstarter--

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All right.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.340
COLT MCANLIS: --website
for that.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:26.850
WOLFF DOBSON: You're there.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:27.210
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.375
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I wonder
if Kickstarter will

00:26:28.375 --> 00:26:29.020
allow you to do that.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.245
To take someone else's
intellectual property and make

00:26:31.245 --> 00:26:34.210
a Kickstarter to create a
sequel for that game.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.490
Probably not.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.040
WOLFF DOBSON: Wasn't there a
thing where there was the

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.420
Flash game that was all the
classic Nintendo and SNES

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.050
characters, and then it got
popular enough that they were

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.210
like, oh, we should actually
release this as a

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.390
downloadable game.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.220
At which point all the
intellectual property stuff

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:50.790
was a problem.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.580
So they now have characters who
are a lot like, but not

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.730
quite, [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:56.370
for these things.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.690
So, yeah, you can do that.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.870
You could have like
Mack and Ricky.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:01.920
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Mack
and Ricky.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.720
WOLFF DOBSON: Something
like that.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.650
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:05.805
WOLFF DOBSON: All right, Colt,
what are you playing?

00:27:05.805 --> 00:27:06.280
TODD KERPELMAN: What
are you playing?

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.730
COLT MCANLIS: I'm actually, with
the hype for the new Team

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:13.900
Fortress 2, Man vs. Machine, I'm
actually getting back into

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.570
Team Fortress 2.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.310
I used to do a lot of
competitive first person

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.120
shooter gaming back in my
day when I was younger.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.490
And I'm actually getting back
into Team Fortress 2.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.540
I thought it was a really--

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.540
I love TF2.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.090
I love the way they came
out with a style.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:24.860
They changed it.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.045
They put a lot of atmosphere,
a lot of character into it.

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:29.260
It was a huge departure
from the other FPSs

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.890
we've seen at the time.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.490
We're starting-- there was
kind of that period where

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.250
everything, every first person
shooter came out with that

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.650
gray tint to it.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.730
They came out with bright, vivid
colors, great emotion.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:42.360
I thought it was fantastic.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.740
It's really fun to get
back into it now that

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.230
it's free to play.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.420
It's really cool.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.040
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I keep almost
getting back into it.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:50.810
I'm just--

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:51.910
I should install this.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:52.760
It's so much fun.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.310
COLT MCANLIS: It is.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.120
It really is.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.960
And, plus, there's Valve is
adding the robots so we don't

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.080
have to write our own now.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.160
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There you go.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.430
Yeah.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.260
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, and
you need a hat.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.784
COLT MCANLIS: The sandwich.

00:28:04.784 --> 00:28:05.990
The sandwich.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.070
WOLFF DOBSON: I always think
that game is just an absolute

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.300
triumph of character design.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.980
Among all of the things, I think
they said they wanted to

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.445
look like a Winslow
Homer painting.

00:28:14.445 --> 00:28:14.870
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.210
WOLFF DOBSON: And it
really-- it's--

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.780
I went to downtown San Jose
while they were having and

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.700
Fanime, which is the big
anime convention.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.260
And they were also having
graduation for San Jose State,

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.470
which meant that it was a really
weird group of people

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.940
all mixing together.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.870
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Lot
of cosplay.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:31.450
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:31.900
There's the thing.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.010
There was all these people
dressed as cosplay, and all

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.060
these other people dressed in
their Sunday best all walking

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.070
through each other and giving
each other these-- what are

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.490
you doing here?

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.615
And it was interesting that
when I was walking through

00:28:43.615 --> 00:28:46.045
there there was tons of Team
Fortress despite the fact that

00:28:46.045 --> 00:28:47.120
that's not even anime at all.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.020
It's just those characters
are so iconic that they

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.207
wanted to do it.

00:28:52.207 --> 00:28:53.141
COLT MCANLIS: What
about you Todd?

00:28:53.141 --> 00:28:53.610
What do you play?

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.080
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's see.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.970
Haven't had a lot of time
to play games the

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.615
last week or so.

00:28:57.615 --> 00:28:57.990
COLT MCANLIS: Oh,
that's right.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.560
You have the new--

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.960
TODD KERPELMAN: Got
the new baby.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.840
COLT MCANLIS: You've cloned.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.000
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.880
I don't remember--

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.320
WOLFF DOBSON: It's like
a video game.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.090
And there are a lot
of micro payments.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:07.620
That's what I'm saying.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.730
COLT MCANLIS: For the
next 20 years.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.470
TODD KERPELMAN: And there's
a lot of crying.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:12.650
COLT MCANLIS: It's like an
old school NES game.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:12.950
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.510
COLT MCANLIS: Extremely
difficult and lots of crying.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:14.990
TODD KERPELMAN: Yep.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.860
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.020
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.270
Got to be careful you
don't mess up.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.330
I did--

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:26.080
in between all of that, I did,
finally, I defeated Diablo my

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.380
first run through on--

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:27.910
COLT MCANLIS: Diablo 3.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:28.870
TODD KERPELMAN: --Diablo 3.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.630
WOLFF DOBSON: You finally
beat Diablo 1.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.780
Congratulations.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.210
TODD KERPELMAN: No.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.840
Diablo 3.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Where
did you find DOS?

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.665
COLT MCANLIS: There's a
Kickstarter project for it

00:29:37.665 --> 00:29:38.880
apparently.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.410
TODD KERPELMAN: Want to go back
and kind of replay it

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.020
with either a different
character, or the next

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.870
difficulty level, but at the
same time, given my limited

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.830
time for gaming at the moment I
said, I should try something

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.620
completely different.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.410
And so I have actually have
now installed Skyrim.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.030
And I think I played--

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.160
actually I played about two
hours of trying to decide

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.620
which mods I want to install
and 1/2 an hour of actually

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.310
game playing.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.470
WOLFF DOBSON: And at
least 15 minutes of

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.020
tweaking the settings.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.160
A little shinier, no a
little less shiny.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.640
A little more, little less.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.150
TODD KERPELMAN: The mods totally
appeal to my geeky

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:13.090
side of oh, I could get better
looking eyebrows on people.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.750
But then there's five different
versions of the

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.480
eyebrow variation mod
and I start to--

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.960
WOLFF DOBSON: See, I'm having
flashbacks to playing Mass

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.580
Effect where each Mass Effect
game I had to start four times

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.150
because I kept revising how I
wanted my character to look.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.670
In Mass Effect 3 I got
way into it and I was

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:29.860
like, I love this.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.000
I had my tough thing.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.180
And then I realized suddenly
that she looked weirdly like

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.470
Michael Jackson.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.090
I was like, ahhh!

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.500
I had to stop and restart
the game again.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.040
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Can you
moonwalk in that game?

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.410
WOLFF DOBSON: That character
would have been able to--

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.380
TODD KERPELMAN: Only if they
were in animation.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.910
WOLFF DOBSON: There's a perk
in there that you can buy.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.470
TODD KERPELMAN: I always kind
of felt like game developers

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.110
all need to get together and
work on a common standard for

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:59.210
facial construction.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:02.625
Every game, Saints Row,
and Mass Effect, and

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:03.820
Skyrim, and all these.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.030
There's--

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.740
WOLFF DOBSON: Tiger
Woods Golf.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:04.836
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:31:04.836 --> 00:31:07.850
There's 80 different sliders
how you can get

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:08.710
your character look.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.660
And depending on how I'm feeling
I either try and make

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.130
them look as close to me as
possible, or as close to some

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.260
famous person or something.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.580
WOLFF DOBSON: I was just going
to say, it depends on what's

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.810
going to happen to them.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.510
Whether I make them look
like Todd or want them

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:22.430
to look like me.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.470
Oh, sorry.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The most
grotesque character you

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.920
possibly can.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.090
WOLFF DOBSON: That's what
The Sims is for.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Move all the
sliders to the right.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:32.920
TODD KERPELMAN: But then it
would be great if I could keep

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.170
that character designed from
one game to the next.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:40.450
So I don't have to recreate me
our Jason Statham or whatever.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:42.100
And Tiger Woods.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.790
WOLFF DOBSON: Jason Statham.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.440
TODD KERPELMAN: That
would be awesome.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:43.910
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Tiger,
let's go.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.000
WOLFF DOBSON: Or in my case,
weirdly, Michael Jackson.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.310
How did I do that?

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.560
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Every game.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:51.050
WOLFF DOBSON: All right.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.470
Well, is that what we
have time for today?

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.290
TODD KERPELMAN: Actually we do
have time for questions now.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:55.950
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh my gosh.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.460
We didn't even answer
our questions.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.060
TODD KERPELMAN: I know.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:58.150
All right.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.450
So we've got a few questions.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.220
And the first one is,
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:03.350
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh my gosh.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.230
Look at all these questions.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.980
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
we do have

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.850
quite a number of questions.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.390
COLT MCANLIS: Oh wow.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.830
TODD KERPELMAN: And, in fact,
maybe I should reload and make

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.000
sure that--

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.910
COLT MCANLIS: There's no
new question on top.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.230
TODD KERPELMAN: --there's
not a question.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.670
Because--

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:14.850
11 questions.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:15.160
That's--

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.570
WOLFF DOBSON: You actually
have to click that.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:17.420
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.390
That's 10 more than I think
we had last time.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.190
WOLFF DOBSON: It's almost
like somebody knew

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.200
we were doing this.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.560
TODD KERPELMAN: Can we talk
a little bit about cross

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.200
platform convergence between
Chrome Web Store an Android

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.720
via a unifying login experience
for players

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.940
actually creating unified
app ID across platforms.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.830
I don't know if there's
a whole lot we

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.440
can really talk about.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.320
Let me see.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.700
I guess part of it really
depends on do we see, at some

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.430
point, games in the browser,
games on your tablet.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.490
Are they going to be the same?

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.300
I know this was sort of an issue
with a lot of the social

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.110
game developers.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:56.880
Is they had these very popular
social games, tried to,

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.130
essentially, take them as is on
to mobile devices and found

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.690
that they just weren't
nearly as successful.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.210
And it was these companies that
basically created games

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:08.500
from scratch on mobile devices
that were actually--

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.570
very similar kind of Sim
building games that ended up

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.370
being successful.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:17.970
Just because, even though the
games are similar, the play

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.900
patterns and styles and the
amount of time you dedicate to

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.750
playing a game on your phone,
versus playing a game on a

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.080
tablet, versus playing a game
on a browser, is all just

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.570
slightly different enough that
it's really hard to have the

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:31.100
same game experience across
multiple devices.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:31.510
Even though--

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.960
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, and also,
there are lots of little tiny

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.240
things when you're doing
development across platform.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.380
Like start-up time.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.760
A mobile game, given the
compressed time people are

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.790
going to be playing it, they're
not going to be like,

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.320
I'm going to click this, go
read, read it, and then come

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.650
back and it'll be loaded.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.360
So just doing the straight
ports that way

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.140
sometimes can be--

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.840
just doesn't work.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.190
Loading time, screen usage, real
estate, all that stuff.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:00.030
Yeah.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:00.610
TODD KERPELMAN: That
said, yeah.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.720
I think unifying login,
that would be nice.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.660
WOLFF DOBSON: That
would be cool.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.510
You should all use OAuth2.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.370
TODD KERPELMAN: That
would totally help.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:12.860
And did I hear that the
standard has been--

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.570
WOLFF DOBSON: They're looking
for an RFC now.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.949
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:15.290
COLT MCANLIS: Oh wow.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.929
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:16.480
COLT MCANLIS: Very cool.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:16.940
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Cool.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.050
TODD KERPELMAN: That-- so what
that actually means is that

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.849
it's going to be considered more
official than I guess it

00:34:21.849 --> 00:34:22.880
has been in the past.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.380
WOLFF DOBSON: The way it is
now, which is sort of

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.670
official, it'll now be
sort of official.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.870
COLT MCANLIS: Well I thought the
word Auth in OAuth meant

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.090
authoritative.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:30.719
Is that--

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.400
is that not right?

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:31.989
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.170
Not exactly.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.655
It did in version 10, but
not inversion 16 or 21.

00:34:38.655 --> 00:34:39.030
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, you
got to update your--

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.429
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:39.869
Exactly.

00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:41.630
COLT MCANLIS: --client
side handling.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.150
TODD KERPELMAN: This
is a good question.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.050
I love the idea of
Native Client.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.880
WOLFF DOBSON: Native Client?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.600
What's that?

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.139
TODD KERPELMAN: Have you
considered creating a special

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.325
section in the Chrome Web Store
to just show apps that

00:34:50.325 --> 00:34:52.590
use Native Client to more
widely promote it's use?

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.550
COLT MCANLIS: Interesting.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.790
First off, thank you
for the love.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.780
Native Client's fantastic
technology.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.670
We all love it here and embrace
it quite heartily.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.880
We haven't specifically called
out Native Client in the

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.110
Chrome Web Store, simply because
we don't really feel

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.520
that there's-- so Chrome Web
Store is a consumer driven

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.130
place, right.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.590
And so most people coming to
Chrome Web Store are looking

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.080
for a genre or a character
type or

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.810
something along those lines.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:20.665
They're not really looking for--
hey, show me the best

00:35:20.665 --> 00:35:22.890
HTML 5 game.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.640
WOLFF DOBSON: We go into the
store looking for that.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.070
COLT MCANLIS: Right.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.510
Right.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:27.930
And, quite frankly, that
does occur but we

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.000
are quite the minority.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.400
If you are looking for a great
collection of Native Client

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.220
titles, though, you can actually
go to the Native

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:33.930
Client website.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.310
We actually have a list of all
of them that we're aware of.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.180
Gonacl.com.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.930
That's G-O-N-A-C-L.com.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.350
And if you look on the sidebar
there's actually a little

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.060
community section down there
that has a list of

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.290
applications in the
Chrome Web Store.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.490
And they're great games.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.100
You should go check them out.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:48.390
And--

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.650
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm
doing right now.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.460
My goodness.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.250
There is one.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:53.020
COLT MCANLIS: Can we screen
cap from his machine?

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.380
WOLFF DOBSON: I'll just kind of
turn around and pull it up.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.440
COLT MCANLIS: Definitely
check those out.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.420
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's see.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.950
I'm actually going to skip
down to-- someone had a--

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.360
speaking of cheating, can you
discuss the role of future

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.850
cheat-proof games such that
every move is in the open and

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:12.510
subject to review by everyone,
like Tic-Tac-Toe or chess.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.730
COLT MCANLIS: Wow.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:17.070
So I have an opinion on this.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:17.517
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

00:36:17.517 --> 00:36:19.130
COLT MCANLIS: Shockingly.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.790
WOLFF DOBSON: Not like normal.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:20.510
COLT MCANLIS: Not like normal.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.760
Right?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.640
Where I keep to myself.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.050
I not too sure about that.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.350
You're effectively crowd
sourcing games.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.190
This will only work for a
certain type of things, right?

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.130
In addition to that, it's going
to slow down game play

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.010
significantly.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:38.520
There was a big hubbub when the
NFL and the Major League

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.110
Baseball added instant
replay review and

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:41.520
those sorts of things.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.820
Everyone's big criticism is it's
going to slow the game

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:44.780
down anymore.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:44.890
Right?

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.180
And they added all these
other features.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.590
You can only do so many,
they cost you

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.180
timeouts and other stuff.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.090
But still it's--

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.030
in video games it's a little
bit different, right?

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.940
It's a digital medium.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.060
There's millions of people
playing concurrent

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.860
games all the time.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.990
Maybe if you had some way where
I play a move and then I

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:02.250
check someone else's move?

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.130
I don't know.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:03.920
It doesn't seem worth
the risk.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.380
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.020
I--

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And also, how
does that stop cheating?

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.660
If I'm playing chess with
someone couldn't I have a

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.330
chess simulation running
alongside?

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.605
WOLFF DOBSON: It's a different
kind of cheating then what I

00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:16.850
think Alan is talking about
here, which is much more I

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:20.180
make a move and then if
everybody accepts that was a

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.940
true we can keep going.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.400
I think it's more, it would be
more implemented negatively,

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.080
which is, that looks
like it's a lie.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.540
And--

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.680
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
too good of a move.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.160
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, no, it's
more like in chess.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.960
Like, hey, your queen
just teleported.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.750
This-- if you ever Pirateer
the board game, it was

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.900
actually in the rules
that cheating was

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.850
part of this game.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:40.580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Because
you're pirates.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.190
WOLFF DOBSON: Knocking the drink
over and then moving all

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:43.440
the pieces around.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.130
Yeah, and there's also the sense
of being able to roll

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.590
back games and look
for cheats later.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.200
And verify that they're
actually true.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.130
So in real time you
leave it alone.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:58.930
But then when you post hoc, if
somebody challenges it, you

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:00.950
can review them.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.440
And automated review and
things like that.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.160
It's a little bit like
the way the--

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.830
when you go in and get
a document notarized.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.410
It doesn't make it any safer
to notarize it but it means

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.040
that when you go backwards and
somebody challenges something

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.900
the notarization says
this document was

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.490
true at this time.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.330
So, yeah, definitely something
like that would be

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.970
interesting.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:28.890
It's also a way people identify
cheaters or griefers.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.740
Just being able to say I enjoyed
playing with this

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.820
person, I did not enjoy playing
with this person.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.600
And then if somebody gets
too many of these--

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.130
that can be gamed pretty
heavily though.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.840
COLT MCANLIS: We're going to
be gamed the other way too.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.417
If you make a move and I have
to validate that was and

00:38:41.417 --> 00:38:43.400
actual move, and I don't like
your move because it's about

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.100
to pwn me, I can grief you and
say, no it's not a good move.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.170
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
too good of a move.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.890
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:50.240
You're too awesome
at this game--

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.170
WOLFF DOBSON: Remind me not
to play chess with you.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.700
COLT MCANLIS: And I
no longer like it.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.480
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You just
check-mated me.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.060
That can't be legitimate.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.370
COLT MCANLIS: Possible.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.210
TODD KERPELMAN: I guess the
issue, for me, is there's a

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:01.480
lot of games that are
interesting based on the fact

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.805
that there is secret
information.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.370
While Tic-Tac-Toe and chess and
checkers and those sorts

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:15.510
of games there are no secrets,
you'd be cutting off a lot of

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.090
interesting games in the
process, just by--

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:19.670
WOLFF DOBSON: I think that's
one of the joys of computer

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.820
media and gaming is assuming
that your database can handle

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.730
that much writing.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:29.840
Being able to do all of your
moves on the server is great.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.360
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's see.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.760
We've got two minutes left.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.740
Here's a short question.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.600
When will the NaCl VS plug-in
be available?

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:37.920
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.820
We are excited about this.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.400
We're starting to see the first
couple check-ins come

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.460
through the tree.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.730
Exciting times are ahead.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.540
We're working out a couple bugs
right now, getting the

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.830
documentation set up.

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.320
We're expecting to
see it soon.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.560
The developer preview should
come out and the Pepper stable

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.130
version, SDK, we're hoping
to land within

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.810
another couple weeks.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.480
TODD KERPELMAN: VS here
being Visual Studio.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:56.970
COLT MCANLIS: Visual Studio.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.650
TODD KERPELMAN: Clarify for--
people wouldn't think it was

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.680
versus or something.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.460
WOLFF DOBSON: I just want to
say that I went to the NaCl

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.210
Gallery and I was horrified to
discover one of the games was

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:06.920
called Wolf Toss.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.980
COLT MCANLIS: That's actually
a really good game.

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.290
WOLFF DOBSON: I bet it
is but, I mean, dude.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.973
TODD KERPELMAN: It's
not about you.

00:40:09.973 --> 00:40:11.290
It's not always about you.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:12.420
WOLFF DOBSON: It is about me.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.440
COLT MCANLIS: I think we should
add a hack to it to put

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.990
your face on the wolf.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.100
WOLFF DOBSON: Ahhh!

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.050
COLT MCANLIS: We'll
email the authors.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.060
Guys over at [INAUDIBLE], if
you're watching, put his face

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:20.620
on the wolf.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.330
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:23.580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Toss
that wolf.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.330
TODD KERPELMAN: And let's see.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:28.880
We'll end on this
one question.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.650
Why are games getting easier
and easier year after year?

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:32.920
Why are developers not
creating games

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.170
like Baldur's Gate?

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.560
Even Witcher was not as hard
as games some years ago.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.190
Do you remember Contra?

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.180
WOLFF DOBSON: Contra.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.430
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: They still
make Contra games.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:45.370
Contra 4 just came out
two years ago.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.130
Demon's Souls and Dark Souls--

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.325
TODD KERPELMAN: I was going to
say, those were the games you

00:40:48.325 --> 00:40:49.560
were playing last time.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I
love those games

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:51.560
because they're so difficult.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.020
So they're still out there,
but you they're not

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:54.780
mainstream.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.110
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.920
I was going to say, the main
answer to that is the

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.770
expansion of the audience.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:08.070
When you get away from people
like me who sit alone in their

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.500
basement playing video games and
trying to figure out how

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.250
to build a--

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.230
you're at a very technical and
very numerically savvy

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.530
audience who is going to be min
maxing their heart out at

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.040
things like Baldur's Gate.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.580
For when you want have
broad appeal games

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.960
like Mass Effect where--

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.150
in fact they had a neat, when
you play Mass Effect it

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.630
actually gives you an option
in the beginning.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:30.510
Do you want to play this like
a first person shooter?

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:33.040
Do you want to play this
only for the story?

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.390
Or do you want to play
some balance of RPG?

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:36.810
Because they're like, look,
there are all these different

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:38.560
audiences who want to experience
this content.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.530
We're trying to mold it in a way
that makes it so that you

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.195
can enjoy it no matter
what you're doing.

00:41:43.195 --> 00:41:45.960
COLT MCANLIS: Now, is the ending
different for each?

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.190
I might have to send
some more emails.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.300
WOLFF DOBSON: You know what we
need to talk about is the

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.700
ending to Mass Effect.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.000
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I can
really share the--

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.650
who asked that question?

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.530
I want to address
them by handle.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.770
TODD KERPELMAN: I
gotta look up.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:58.205
WOLFF DOBSON: You.

00:41:58.205 --> 00:41:58.640
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.140
WOLFF DOBSON: You.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.680
You are just not playing
the right games.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.560
No.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.740
TODD KERPELMAN: T-O-M-A-S-Z.
Tomasz.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Tomasz.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:09.510
Tomas Z. I can share your
frustration because I love

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.230
brutally difficult games.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.880
But they're still out there.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.400
A new Contra game is coming out
because I pay attention to

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.010
Contra games, because I want
to just cry and slam the

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:21.170
system down on the floor.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.810
WOLFF DOBSON: And this is why
they made wireless controllers

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:23.912
so you can throw them.

00:42:23.912 --> 00:42:25.310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:26.150
WOLFF DOBSON: It doesn't
pull your entire--

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.690
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And, I mean,
right now you could--

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:32.730
I have collectively spend
about 250 hours playing

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.170
Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:36.440
Go and check it out.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.570
WOLFF DOBSON: The other thing
is that, famously, Nintendo

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:42.110
early on made their games
brutally hard because they

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:42.820
weren't long enough.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.700
And that pipeline
was too short.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.870
The pipeline wasn't
full enough.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.780
They weren't going to be able to
release games fast enough.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:54.670
The manufacturing process for
cartridges was too difficult.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:56.630
And so having--

00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:00.170
making your games take longer
was just part of the thing.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.270
TODD KERPELMAN: Part
of the padding.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.470
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.450
I went back and started playing
the original Colossal

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:07.620
Cave Adventure game and
it was crazy hard.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.070
Even though I remembered
all the puzzles.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.750
I was sort of like, I
don't know how I--

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:11.270
COLT MCANLIS: No, no.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:12.470
You want to cry?

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:13.855
And we can close on this
if we need to.

00:43:13.855 --> 00:43:14.110
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.195
COLT MCANLIS: Go back and play
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

00:43:16.195 --> 00:43:16.970
for the NES.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:17.400
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.170
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Which one?

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.370
COLT MCANLIS: The first one.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.330
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I've
beaten that.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:20.750
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.860
Yeah, once.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I had
that game as a kid

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.085
and I mastered it.

00:43:26.085 --> 00:43:26.790
WOLFF DOBSON: Next time we do
this we're going to bring this

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:27.865
in and you're going
to play it.

00:43:27.865 --> 00:43:28.120
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'll play it.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:28.500
Oh, it's been years.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:28.910
COLT MCANLIS: I'll try it.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:29.640
I bought it on the Wii.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:29.900
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's brutal.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.580
COLT MCANLIS: It's brutal.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:30.940
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.130
It hates you.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:32.810
COLT MCANLIS: Three weeks.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:33.440
I didn't turn the Wii off--

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.000
WOLFF DOBSON: It absolutely
hates you.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.670
COLT MCANLIS: --because I
was used to doing that.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:35.570
Right.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:36.460
Couldn't do it.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.410
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That stage where
you're going through the

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.040
water under the dam and you have
diffuse all the bombs and

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.360
the clock is ticking.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:43.890
WOLFF DOBSON: It is--

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.120
COLT MCANLIS: The worst thing
is that if you don't bring

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.080
Donatello to the Mouser battle
you're just done.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.110
It's the whole level.

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.730
All you're doing is trying to
get rid of Raphael because he

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:51.430
doesn't matter to you.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.410
Just bring Donatello
to the Mouser.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:54.440
This is insane.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.130
Hardest game ever.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.190
WOLFF DOBSON: But the--

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Another really
difficult game that's new is

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.210
Super Meat Boy.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.630
That game is brutal.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:01.510
WOLFF DOBSON: Although
here's the thing with

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:02.220
Super Meat Boy though.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.870
Super Meat Boy is incredibly
difficult.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:05.900
But Super Meat Boy
is also fair.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:06.310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.180
WOLFF DOBSON: In the sense that,
when you play it, you

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.280
can get better at it.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.960
And your deaths are quick.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.990
And the reward for death is
that you get another cool

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.560
little animation.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.930
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's often
what people praise Demon's

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:17.240
Souls and Dark Souls for.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.930
Its brutal but it's fair.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.280
When you die you're not like,
oh this game cheated me.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.090
It's like no, I made
a mistake.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:24.520
WOLFF DOBSON: I shouldn't
have done that.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:24.720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.770
WOLFF DOBSON: That's why a lot
of people like playing NetHack

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:32.440
without copying saves.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.820
Because they're good enough at
that game, if they die it was

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.050
because they were clumsy.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:37.630
Its an execution thing.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.240
But going back to the idea that
the pipeline was so empty

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.710
in the '90s, the pipeline is
really full now for games.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:48.185
So if your game is too hard
you're either going for core

00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:49.890
audience, and I think something
like Demon's Souls

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:53.400
is a perfect example of
a core audience game.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.600
Who is looking for
that kind of--

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.890
they're the same people who
throw themselves out of

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:57.900
airplanes, right?

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.092
I mean,--

00:44:59.092 --> 00:44:59.490
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.360
WOLFF DOBSON: They're looking
for that challenge.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.680
You do wing suits and fly
down sides of mountains.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.170
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Squirrel
suits.

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:07.120
WOLFF DOBSON: Just that
somebody's looking--

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.530
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: While playing
Demon's Souls.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:10.070
WOLFF DOBSON: --for something
challenging.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:14.452
While in with a broad market and
a lot of people playing,

00:45:14.452 --> 00:45:17.980
and a lot of kids playing, you
just don't want to keep

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.870
punching your audience
in the eye.

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:21.790
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I don't know if
this made the last episode,

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:23.880
but we were talking
about the stats of

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.180
game completion rates.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:29.000
And it's very low, like 30% of
the audience makes it to the

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.320
end of the game.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.220
So by, there's an incentive
there, I think, for game

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.120
developers to make the game
easier and easier to be

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.420
successful in and complete so
that people feel like they've

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.440
got their money's worth and they
are also very proud of

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.490
themselves because, hey,
I beat this game.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:45.816
Even though they've
made it so simple.

00:45:45.816 --> 00:45:46.660
WOLFF DOBSON: Too easy.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.415
TODD KERPELMAN: As someone that
has less time to play

00:45:49.415 --> 00:45:51.980
games, I appreciate the fact
that I can make it through a

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.350
lot of the content without
having to replay the same

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:55.490
level multiple times.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:56.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think--

00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.120
I forget which games on the Wii
did this, but they had a--

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.420
I think there was a Mario game
for the Wii where if you died

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.710
eight times they would actually
allow the computer to

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:06.745
play the stage for you.

00:46:06.745 --> 00:46:07.420
WOLFF DOBSON: Show you how.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.460
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And then once
you made it past the part you

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.000
couldn't make it passed before
you just press a button and

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.550
you're back playing the game.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:14.280
WOLFF DOBSON: They also had a
really neat thing when you're

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.300
playing with friends.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.770
If somebody dying all the time
they can just bubble up and

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:19.890
just follow you.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:20.100
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:20.170
OK.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.830
WOLFF DOBSON: So only one person
has to be good at the

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.370
incredibly difficult
time jumps.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:26.370
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So more
mechanisms to make it easier.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:27.910
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, more
mechanisms to make it so

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:28.680
people can stay together.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:28.990
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.300
Yeah.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.440
WOLFF DOBSON: I think
that's cool.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.360
I'm with Todd.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.070
I like easy games.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:34.890
TODD KERPELMAN: I didn't
say I like easy.

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:36.884
I just like being able to make
it through without having to--

00:46:36.884 --> 00:46:37.356
WOLFF DOBSON: I like
being challenged.

00:46:37.356 --> 00:46:38.500
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.580
WOLFF DOBSON: I like
doing nothing.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.700
COLT MCANLIS: I like games
I have to program

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.470
algorithms to beat.

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.850
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:44.800
Well, we are, I think, a
little over time now.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.750
So we're going to wrap up.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:50.330
But we'll be back in a couple
weeks and we'll hopefully come

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:51.400
up with some other interesting
questions.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.430
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Now tell your
friends about this show.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.786
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:46:53.786 --> 00:46:54.500
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.360
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.320
I actually, I really like the
fact that we had a lot more

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.100
questions this time.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:59.600
So tell your friends.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.310
Have them all ask any sorts
of gaming question.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.350
WOLFF DOBSON: Keep sending in
those cards and letters.

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:04.460
TODD KERPELMAN: Fewer
Android questions.

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.780
Were generally not
the Android guys.

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.500
They have their own show.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.280
We don't talk to them.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.270
WOLFF DOBSON: You can ask
us Android questions.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:11.190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: If there are
certain games you want us to

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.655
review or talk about feel free
to throw up some questions.

00:47:13.655 --> 00:47:13.950
WOLFF DOBSON: Sure.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.060
And if you have games that you
think we should be playing,

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.640
either because they're
too hard or they're

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.705
too easy, you should--

00:47:18.705 --> 00:47:19.300
COLT MCANLIS: Then
send them to us.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:19.720
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.290
Send them to us.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:20.840
We'd love to see them.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.350
COLT MCANLIS: For free.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:22.400
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.650
We got to go.
