00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:01.744
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can find the limit

00:00:01.744 --> 00:00:03.261
as x approaches negative 1

00:00:03.261 --> 00:00:04.642
of x plus 1

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:08.748
over the square root of x plus 5 minus 2.

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:10.444
So, our first reaction might just be,

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:12.163
okay, well let's just
use our limit properties

00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:12.996
a little bit,

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.466
this is going to be the
same thing as the limit

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:19.133
as x approaches negative 1 of x plus 1

00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:21.184
over,

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.279
over the limit,

00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:27.316
the limit

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:29.808
as x approaches negative 1

00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:32.975
of square root of x plus 5 minus 2.

00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:36.782
And then we could say, all right,

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:38.334
this thing up here,

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:39.819
x plus 1, if this is,

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:42.786
if we think about the
graph y equals x plus 1,

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:44.967
it's continuous everywhere, especially at

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:47.685
x equals negative 1, and
so to evaluate this limit,

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:49.646
we just have to evaluate
this expression at

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:51.005
x equals negative 1,

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.877
so this numerator's just going
to evaluate to negative 1

00:00:54.877 --> 00:00:55.710
plus 1.

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:58.316
And then our denominator,

00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:01.578
square root of x plus 5 minus
2 isn't continuous everywhere

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:04.698
but it is continuous
at x equals negative 1

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:06.065
and so we can do the same thing.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.679
We can just substitute negative 1 for x,

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.765
so this is going to be the
square root of negative 1

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.015
plus 5 minus 2.

00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:16.397
Now, what does this evaluate to?

00:01:16.397 --> 00:01:19.062
Well, in the numerator we get a zero,

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:21.715
and in the denominator,
negative 1 plus 5 is 4,

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.873
take the principle root is 2, minus 2,

00:01:23.873 --> 00:01:25.552
we get zero again,

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:26.704
so we get,

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:27.621
we got zero

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:30.038
over zero.

00:01:30.972 --> 00:01:33.317
Now, when you see that, you
might be tempted to give up.

00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:35.906
You say, oh, look, there's
a zero in the denominator,

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:37.480
maybe this limit doesn't exist,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.017
maybe I'm done here, what do I do?

00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:43.079
And if this was non-zero
up here in the numerator,

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.854
if you're taking a non-zero
value and dividing it by zero,

00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:46.904
that is undefined

00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:48.783
and your limit would not exist.

00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:51.056
But when you have zero over zero,

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:52.482
this is indeterminate form,

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:55.897
it doesn't mean necessarily
that your limit does not exist,

00:01:55.897 --> 00:01:57.906
and as we'll see in this
video and many future ones,

00:01:57.906 --> 00:02:01.837
there are tools at our
disposal to address this,

00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:03.772
and we will look at one of them.

00:02:03.772 --> 00:02:05.495
Now, the tool that we're going to look at

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:08.483
is is there another way of
rewriting this expression

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:11.256
so we can evaluate its limit

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:14.080
without getting the zero over zero?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.014
Well, let's just rewrite,

00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:18.979
let's just take this and give it,

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.226
so let's take this thing right over here,

00:02:21.226 --> 00:02:23.536
and let's say this is g of x,

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:25.364
so essentially what we're
trying to do is find the limit

00:02:25.364 --> 00:02:26.197
of g of x

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:28.183
as x approaches negative 1,

00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:31.994
so we can write g of x is equal to

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:34.505
x plus 1 and the only reason
I'm defining it as g of x

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:37.250
is just to be able to think of
it more clearly as a function

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.698
and manipulate the function

00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:40.118
and then think about similar functions,

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.201
over x plus 5 minus 2,

00:02:44.438 --> 00:02:47.734
or x plus 1 over the square
root of x plus 5 minus 2.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.762
Now, the technique we're
going to use is when you get

00:02:49.762 --> 00:02:51.602
this indeterminate form and
if you have a square root

00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:53.526
in either the numerator
or the denominator,

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:55.986
it might help to get
rid of that square root

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:58.787
and this is often called
rationalizing the expression.

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:00.989
In this case, you have a
square root in the denominator,

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.562
so it would be rationalizing

00:03:02.562 --> 00:03:04.643
the denominator,

00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:06.823
and so, this would be,

00:03:06.823 --> 00:03:07.848
the way we would do it

00:03:07.848 --> 00:03:09.822
is we would be leveraging
our knowledge of difference

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:10.695
of squares.

00:03:10.695 --> 00:03:11.593
We know,

00:03:11.593 --> 00:03:13.838
we know that a plus b

00:03:13.838 --> 00:03:15.903
times a minus b

00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:18.200
is equal to a squared minus b squared,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.937
you learned that in algebra

00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:21.447
a little while ago,

00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:25.061
or if we had the square root of a plus b

00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:27.641
and we were to multiply that
times the square root of a

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.505
minus b, well that would be
the square root of a squared

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:31.844
which is just going to be a,

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.740
minus b squared,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.689
so we can just leverage these ideas

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.772
to get rid of this radical down here.

00:03:38.772 --> 00:03:40.344
The way we're going to do it

00:03:40.344 --> 00:03:42.377
is we're going to multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:44.495
by the square root of x plus 5

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:45.662
plus 2, right?

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.098
We have the minus 2

00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:50.058
so we multiply it times the plus 2,

00:03:50.058 --> 00:03:51.921
so let's do that.

00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:53.380
So we have

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.130
square root of x plus 5 plus 2

00:03:57.932 --> 00:03:59.924
and we're going to multiply
the numerator times

00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:01.694
the same thing, 'cause we
don't want to change the value

00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:02.548
of the expression.

00:04:02.548 --> 00:04:03.824
This is 1.

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:06.458
So, if we take the expression
divided by the same expression

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:07.721
it's going to be 1,

00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:08.788
so this is,

00:04:08.788 --> 00:04:11.260
so square root of x plus 5 plus 2

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.850
and so this is going to be equal to,

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.183
this is going to be equal to x plus 1

00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:19.234
times the square root,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.408
times the square root of x plus 5

00:04:23.408 --> 00:04:24.241
plus 2

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:27.760
and then the denominator is going to be,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.985
well, it's going to be x,

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:30.416
the square root of x plus 5 squared

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:32.999
which would be just x plus 5

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.322
and then minus 2 squared,

00:04:37.322 --> 00:04:38.826
minus 4,

00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:43.403
and so this down here
simplifies to x plus 5 minus 4

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:44.980
is just x plus 1

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.313
so this is just,

00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:49.474
this is just x plus 1

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.703
and it probably jumps out at
you that both the numerator

00:04:52.703 --> 00:04:54.951
and the denominator
have an x plus 1 in it,

00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:57.000
so maybe we can simplify,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.594
so we can simplify by just say,

00:04:58.594 --> 00:05:02.704
well, g of x is equal to
the square root of x plus 5

00:05:02.704 --> 00:05:03.537
plus 2.

00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:06.687
Now, some of you might be
feeling a little off here,

00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:07.780
and you would be correct.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.735
Your spider senses would be,

00:05:09.735 --> 00:05:10.568
is this,

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:13.564
is this definitely the same thing

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:16.299
as what we originally had
before we cancelled out

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:17.700
the x plus 1s?

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.346
And the answer is the way I just wrote it

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:21.624
is not the exact same thing.

00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:24.674
It is the exact same
thing everywhere except at

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:26.481
x equals negative 1.

00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:28.367
This thing right over here is defined

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:30.038
at x equals negative 1.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.940
This thing right over here is not defined

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.503
at x equals negative 1,

00:05:33.503 --> 00:05:35.050
and g of x was not,

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.944
was not,

00:05:35.944 --> 00:05:37.126
so g of x right over here,

00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:41.239
you don't get a good result
when you try x equals negative 1

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:43.869
and so in order for this
to truly be the same thing

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:44.886
as g of x,

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.905
the same function, we have to say

00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:49.655
for x not equal to negative 1.

00:05:51.522 --> 00:05:54.682
Now, this is a simplified
version of g of x.

00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:55.679
It is the same thing.

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:57.012
For any input x,

00:05:58.167 --> 00:06:01.136
that g of x is defined, this
is going to give you the same

00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:03.942
output, and this is the
exact same domain now,

00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:05.504
now that we've put this constraint in,

00:06:05.504 --> 00:06:06.337
as g of x.

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:11.007
Now you might say, okay,
well how does this help us?

00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:14.451
Because we want to find the
limit as x approaches negative 1

00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.043
and even here, I had to put
this little constraint here

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.814
that x cannot be equal to negative 1.

00:06:18.814 --> 00:06:21.610
How do we think about this limit?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.043
Well, lucky for us,

00:06:23.043 --> 00:06:24.393
we know,

00:06:24.393 --> 00:06:26.262
lucky for us we know

00:06:26.262 --> 00:06:29.580
that if we just take
another function, f of x,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.747
if we say f of x is equal to
the square root of x plus 5

00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:35.548
plus 2,

00:06:36.443 --> 00:06:40.610
well then we know that f
of x is equal to g of x

00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:42.836
for all

00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:46.446
x not equal to negative 1

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:49.649
because f of x does not
have that constraint.

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.915
And we know if this is true of two,

00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:54.444
if this is true of two functions,

00:06:54.444 --> 00:06:57.037
then the limit as x approaches,

00:06:57.037 --> 00:06:59.088
the limit, let me write this down,

00:06:59.088 --> 00:07:00.622
since we know this,

00:07:00.622 --> 00:07:01.937
because of this,

00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:03.770
we know that the limit

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:05.492
of f of x

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.732
as x approaches negative
1 is going to be equal

00:07:09.732 --> 00:07:11.565
to the limit of g of x

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:15.263
as x approaches negative 1,

00:07:15.263 --> 00:07:17.343
and this of course is what
we want to figure out,

00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:19.145
what was the beginning of the problem,

00:07:19.145 --> 00:07:21.269
but we can now use f of x here,

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:23.095
because only at x equals negative 1

00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:25.223
that they are not the same,

00:07:25.223 --> 00:07:27.011
and if you were to graph g of x

00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.091
it just has a,

00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:29.885
it has a point discontinuity,

00:07:29.885 --> 00:07:31.141
or removable discont--

00:07:31.141 --> 00:07:32.786
or, I should say, yeah,

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.780
a point discontinuity right over here

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.947
at x equals negative 1,

00:07:38.848 --> 00:07:41.438
and so what is the limit?

00:07:41.438 --> 00:07:43.317
And we are in the home stretch now.

00:07:43.317 --> 00:07:45.102
What is the limit

00:07:45.102 --> 00:07:46.201
of f of x?

00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:49.941
Well, we could say the limit
of the square root of x plus 5

00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:50.774
plus 2

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:54.749
as x approaches negative 1,

00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:58.676
well, this expression is continuous.

00:07:58.676 --> 00:08:01.658
Or, this function is continuous
at x equals negative 1

00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:03.938
so we can just evaluate
it at x equals negative 1,

00:08:03.938 --> 00:08:07.277
so this is going to be the
square root of negative 1

00:08:07.277 --> 00:08:08.444
plus 5 plus 2,

00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:12.059
so this is 4 square root,

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:14.083
principle root of 4 is 2,

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:16.000
2 plus 2 is equal to 4.

00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:20.504
So since the limit of f of
x as x approaches negative 1

00:08:20.504 --> 00:08:22.324
is 4, the limit of g of x

00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:26.120
as x approaches negative 1 is also 4,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.508
and if this little,

00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:28.428
this little,

00:08:28.428 --> 00:08:32.858
I guess you could say leap
that I just made over here

00:08:32.858 --> 00:08:33.828
doesn't make sense to you,

00:08:33.828 --> 00:08:34.728
think about it,

00:08:34.728 --> 00:08:36.257
think about it visually.

00:08:36.257 --> 00:08:38.487
Think about it visually.

00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:39.570
So if this is

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:41.712
my y-axis

00:08:43.248 --> 00:08:45.081
and this is my x-axis,

00:08:46.869 --> 00:08:50.102
g of x looked something like this.

00:08:50.102 --> 00:08:50.935
G of x,

00:08:52.412 --> 00:08:54.663
g of x, let me draw it,

00:08:54.663 --> 00:08:56.913
g of x looked something,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.747
something like

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:01.760
this,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.978
and it had a gap at negative 1,

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:06.982
so it had a gap right over there,

00:09:06.982 --> 00:09:08.858
while f of x,

00:09:08.858 --> 00:09:10.778
f of x would have the same graph

00:09:10.778 --> 00:09:12.421
except it wouldn't have,

00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.067
it wouldn't have the gap,

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:15.578
and so if you're trying to find the limit,

00:09:15.578 --> 00:09:17.010
it seems completely reasonable,

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.225
well let's just use f
of x and evaluate what

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:22.797
f of x would be to kind of fill that gap

00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:25.288
at x equals negative 1,

00:09:25.288 --> 00:09:27.711
so hopefully this graphical
version helps a little bit

00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:30.461
or if it confuses you, ignore it.
