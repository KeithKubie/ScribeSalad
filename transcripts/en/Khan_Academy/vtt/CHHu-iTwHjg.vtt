00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.546
- [Voiceover] We're going
to explore Gibbs Free Energy

00:00:02.546 --> 00:00:03.347
a little bit in this video.

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:05.669
And, in particular, its
usefulness in determining

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.826
whether a reaction is going
to be spontaneous or not,

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:12.449
which is super useful in
chemistry and biology.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.047
And, it was defined by
Josiah Willard Gibbs.

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:18.717
And, what we see here, we
see this famous formula

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.668
which is going to help
us predict spontaneity.

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:24.301
And, it says that the
change in Gibbs Free Energy

00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:28.480
is equal to the change, and
this 'H' here is enthalpy.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.848
So, this is a change in enthalpy

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:32.751
which you could view as heat content,

00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.748
especially because this formula applies

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:37.406
if we're dealing with constant
pressure and temperature.

00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:39.555
So, that's a change in enthaply

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:44.036
minus temperature times change in entropy,

00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:45.928
change in entropy.

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:48.063
So, 'S' is entropy and it seems

00:00:48.063 --> 00:00:52.370
like this bizarre formula that's
hard to really understand.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.226
But, as we'll see, it makes
a lot of intuitive sense.

00:00:55.226 --> 00:00:58.373
Now, Gibbs Free, Gibbs,
Josiah Willard Gibbs,

00:00:58.373 --> 00:01:00.044
he defined this to think about, well,

00:01:00.044 --> 00:01:02.681
how much enthalpy is going to be useful

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:03.853
for actually doing work?

00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:06.223
How much is free to do useful things?

00:01:06.223 --> 00:01:07.744
But, in this video, we're
gonna think about it

00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:11.331
in the context of how we can
use change in Gibbs Free Energy

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.724
to predict whether a reaction is going

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:15.627
to spontaneously happen,

00:01:15.627 --> 00:01:17.230
whether it's going to be spontaneous.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.355
And, to get straight to the punch line,

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.755
if Delta G is less than zero,

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:26.889
our reaction is going to be spontaneous.

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:29.791
It's going to be spontaneous.

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.277
It's going to happen,

00:01:31.277 --> 00:01:32.753
assuming that things are able to interact

00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:33.947
in the right way.

00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:37.314
It's going to be spontaneous.

00:01:37.314 --> 00:01:40.890
Now, let's think a little bit
about why that makes sense.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.432
If this expression over here is negative,

00:01:43.432 --> 00:01:46.288
our reaction is going to be spontaneous.

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:48.470
So, let's think about all
of the different scenarios.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.991
So, in this scenario over here,

00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:54.565
if our change in enthalpy
is less than zero,

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:56.365
and our entropy increases,

00:01:56.365 --> 00:01:58.187
our enthalpy decreases.

00:01:58.187 --> 00:01:59.685
So, this means we're going to release,

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:01.774
we're going to release energy here.

00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:03.353
We're gonna release enthalpy.

00:02:03.353 --> 00:02:04.909
And, you could think about this as,

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.231
so let's see, we're gonna release energy.

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.193
So, release.

00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:10.284
I'll just draw it.

00:02:10.284 --> 00:02:12.385
This is a release of enthalpy over here.

00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:15.043
I end up with less enthalpy
than I started with.

00:02:15.043 --> 00:02:16.506
But, entropy increases.

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:18.352
Disorder increases the number of states

00:02:18.352 --> 00:02:20.546
that my system can take on increases.

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.330
Well, this makes a lot of sense.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.082
This makes a lot of sense

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:24.602
that this is going to
happen spontaneously,

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.679
regardless of what the temperature is.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.457
I have these two molecules.

00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:31.057
They are about to bump into each other.

00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:32.593
And, when they get close to each other,

00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:34.660
their electrons may be, say hey,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.413
"Wait, there's a better configuration here

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:38.213
"where we can go into lower energy states,

00:02:38.213 --> 00:02:39.653
"where we can release energy

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:40.814
"and in doing so,

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:44.214
"these different
constituents can part ways."

00:02:44.214 --> 00:02:45.956
And so, you actually
have more constituents.

00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:46.815
They've parted ways.

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:47.779
You've had energy released.

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:48.917
Entropy increases.

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:51.215
And, makes a lot of sense
that this is a natural thing

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:53.514
that would actually occur.

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:55.695
This over here, this is spontaneous.

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:59.493
Delta G is, not just Delta,

00:02:59.493 --> 00:03:02.314
Delta G is less than zero.

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:03.532
So, this one over here,

00:03:03.532 --> 00:03:05.216
I'm gonna make all the spontaneous ones,

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:08.873
I'm gonna square them
off in this green color.

00:03:08.873 --> 00:03:11.450
Now, what about this one down here?

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.629
This one down here, Delta
H is greater than zero.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.656
So, your enthalpy for this
reaction needs to increase,

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:22.316
and your entropy is going to decrease.

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:25.171
So, that's, you know, you
can imagine these two atoms,

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.214
or maybe these molecules
that get close to each other,

00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:28.955
but their electrons say, "Hey, no, no."

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:30.035
In order for us to bond,

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:31.870
we would have to get to
a higher energy state.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.831
We would require some energy,

00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:36.270
and the disorder is going to go down.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.652
This isn't going to happen.

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:39.767
And so, of course, and
this is a combination,

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:41.946
if Delta H is greater than zero,

00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:43.246
and if this is less than zero,

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.545
than this entire term
is gonna be positive.

00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:47.727
And so, Delta G is going
to be greater than zero.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:51.269
So, here, Delta G is going
to be greater than zero.

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.951
And, hopefully, it makes
some intuitive sense

00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:55.505
that this is not going to be spontaneous.

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:59.708
So, this one, this one does not happen.

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:02.389
Now, over here, we have some permutations

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.270
of Delta H's and Delta S's,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.033
and whether they're spontaneous
depends on the temperature.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.972
So, over here, if we are dealing,

00:04:08.972 --> 00:04:12.048
our Delta H is less than zero.

00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:15.229
So, we're going to have
a release of energy here,

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.191
but our entropy decreases.

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:18.387
What's gonna happen?

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:19.849
Well, if the temperature is low,

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.461
these things will be able to
gently get close to each other,

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:25.364
and their electrons are
going to be able to interact.

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:27.047
Maybe they get to a lower energy state,

00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:29.067
and they can release energy.

00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:31.041
They're releasing energy,

00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:33.247
and the electrons will
spontaneously do this.

00:04:33.247 --> 00:04:34.906
But, the entropy has gone down.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:36.230
But, this can actually happen,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.531
because the temperature,

00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:40.107
the temperature here is low.

00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:40.943
And, some of you might be saying,

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:42.023
"Wait, doesn't that violate

00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:43.927
"The Second Law of Thermodynamics?"

00:04:43.927 --> 00:04:45.424
And, you have to remember,

00:04:45.424 --> 00:04:48.326
the entropy, if you're just
thinking about this part

00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:50.520
of the system, yes that goes down.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.167
But, you have heat being released.

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:56.487
And, that heat is going to
make, is going to add entropy

00:04:56.487 --> 00:04:58.507
to the rest of the system.

00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:02.222
So, still, The Second Law
of Thermodynamics holds

00:05:02.222 --> 00:05:04.990
that the entropy of the
universe is going to increase,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.081
because of this released heat.

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:08.404
But, if you just look at
the constituents here,

00:05:08.404 --> 00:05:09.983
the entropy went down.

00:05:09.983 --> 00:05:13.465
So, this is going to be,
this right over here is going

00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:15.462
to be spontaneous as well.

00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:17.703
And, we're always wanting
to back to the formula.

00:05:17.703 --> 00:05:21.847
If this is negative and this is negative,

00:05:21.847 --> 00:05:24.402
well, this is going to be a positive term.

00:05:24.402 --> 00:05:25.783
But, if 'T' low enough,

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:27.583
this term isn't going to matter.

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:29.781
'T' is, you confuse it as the
weighing factor on entropy.

00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:32.969
So, if 'T' is low, the entropy
doesn't matter as much.

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.861
Then, enthalpy really takes over.

00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:36.800
So, in this situation, Delta G,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.059
we're assuming 'T' is low enough

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.478
to make Delta G negative.

00:05:41.478 --> 00:05:43.800
And, this is going to be spontaneous.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.378
Now, if you took that same scenario,

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:47.073
but you had a high temperature,

00:05:47.073 --> 00:05:49.207
well now, you have these
same two molecules.

00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:50.553
Let's say that these are the molecules,

00:05:50.553 --> 00:05:53.966
maybe this is, this one's the
purple one right over here.

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:55.615
You have the same two molecules here.

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:58.366
Hey, they could get to a more kind of a,

00:05:58.366 --> 00:05:59.991
they could release energy.

00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:02.685
But over here, you're saying,

00:06:02.685 --> 00:06:04.190
"Well, look, they could."

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.010
The change in enthalpy is negative.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.250
But, they're buzzing past each other

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.015
so fast that they're
not gonna have a chance.

00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:12.054
Their electrons aren't gonna have a chance

00:06:12.054 --> 00:06:13.773
to actually interact in the right way

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.896
for the reaction to actually go on.

00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:18.568
And so, this is a situation
where it won't be spontaneous,

00:06:18.568 --> 00:06:20.601
because they're just gonna
buzz past each other.

00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:23.444
They're not gonna have a
chance to interact properly.

00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:25.825
And so, you can imagine if 'T' is high,

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:28.483
if 'T' is high, this term's
going to matter a lot.

00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:31.442
And, so the fact that entropy is negative

00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:33.870
is gonna make this whole thing positive.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.506
And, this is gonna be more positive

00:06:35.506 --> 00:06:37.085
than this is going to be negative.

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:39.082
So, this is a situation where our Delta G

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:41.230
is greater than zero.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.785
So, once again, not spontaneous.

00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:44.608
And, everything I'm doing
is just to get an intuition

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:47.858
for why this formula for
Gibbs Free Energy makes sense.

00:06:47.858 --> 00:06:49.727
And, remember, this is true
under constant pressure

00:06:49.727 --> 00:06:50.680
and temperature.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.723
But, those are reasonable assumptions

00:06:52.723 --> 00:06:53.988
if we're dealing with, you know,

00:06:53.988 --> 00:06:55.241
things in a test tube,

00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:58.736
or if we're dealing with a
lot of biological systems.

00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:00.058
Now, let's go over here.

00:07:00.058 --> 00:07:03.519
So, our enthalpy,

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:05.679
our change in enthalpy is positive.

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:10.489
And, our entropy would
increase if these react,

00:07:10.489 --> 00:07:12.400
but our temperature is low.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.059
So, if these reacted,
maybe they would bust apart

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:16.080
and do something,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.707
they would do something like this.

00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:20.039
But, they're not going to do that,

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.606
because when these things
bump into each other,

00:07:22.606 --> 00:07:24.718
they're like, "Hey, you know
all of our electrons are nice.

00:07:24.718 --> 00:07:27.317
"There are nice little
stable configurations here.

00:07:27.317 --> 00:07:28.815
"I don't see any reason to react."

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:29.674
Even though, if we did react,

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:31.208
we were able to increase the entropy.

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:33.145
Hey, no reason to react here.

00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:35.525
And, if you look at these
different variables,

00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:39.439
if this is positive,
even if this is positive,

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.507
if 'T' is low, this isn't going to be able

00:07:41.507 --> 00:07:42.860
to overwhelm that.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.273
And so, you have a Delta G
that is greater than zero,

00:07:46.273 --> 00:07:47.909
not spontaneous.

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:49.976
If you took the same scenario,

00:07:49.976 --> 00:07:52.471
and you said, "Okay, let's
up the temperature here.

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.300
"Let's up the average kinetic energy."

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.463
None of these things are going to be able

00:07:55.463 --> 00:07:57.564
to slam into each other.

00:07:57.564 --> 00:08:00.478
And, even though, even
though the electrons

00:08:00.478 --> 00:08:02.579
would essentially require some energy

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:05.029
to get, to really form these bonds,

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:08.024
this can happen because you have all

00:08:08.024 --> 00:08:09.823
of this disorder being created.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.298
You have these more states.

00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:12.957
And, it's less likely to go the other way,

00:08:12.957 --> 00:08:14.397
because, well, what are the odds

00:08:14.397 --> 00:08:16.046
of these things just getting together

00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:17.566
in the exact right configuration

00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:21.362
to get back into these, this
lower number of molecules.

00:08:21.362 --> 00:08:23.197
And, once again, you look
at these variables here.

00:08:23.197 --> 00:08:25.797
Even if Delta H is greater than zero,

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.376
even if this is positive,

00:08:27.376 --> 00:08:29.024
if Delta S is greater than zero

00:08:29.024 --> 00:08:30.220
and 'T' is high,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.962
this thing is going to become,

00:08:31.962 --> 00:08:33.621
especially with the negative sign here,

00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:35.897
this is going to overwhelm the enthalpy,

00:08:35.897 --> 00:08:37.371
and the change in enthalpy,

00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:39.275
and make the whole expression negative.

00:08:39.275 --> 00:08:43.199
So, over here, Delta G is
going to be less than zero.

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:46.345
And, this is going to be spontaneous.

00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:47.854
Hopefully, this gives you some intuition

00:08:47.854 --> 00:08:50.455
for the formula for Gibbs Free Energy.

00:08:50.455 --> 00:08:52.521
And, once again, you have to caveat it.

00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:55.980
It's under, it assumes constant
pressure and temperature.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.302
But, it is useful for thinking

00:08:58.302 --> 00:09:00.055
about whether a reaction is spontaneous.

00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:03.213
And, as you look at biological
or chemical systems,

00:09:03.213 --> 00:09:05.558
you'll see that Delta
G's for the reactions.

00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:07.706
And so, you'll say, "Oh,
it's a negative Delta G?

00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:09.180
"That's going to be a
spontaneous reaction.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.736
"It's a zero Delta G.

00:09:10.736 --> 00:09:12.117
"That's gonna be an equilibrium."

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:14.190
Or, you could say, "That's
a positive Delta G.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.310
"That's not going to be spontaneous."
