And finally, the most commonly used assessment of personality is giving people

00:00:04.128 --> 00:00:07.638
questionnaires that have a bunch of statements that people have to agree with

00:00:07.638 --> 00:00:13.656
or disagree with to some degree. Questionnaires cover a wide range of

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:17.707
personality traits. And different statements might read something like, I enjoy

00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:23.205
going to parties. Or, I feel sad and lonely much of the time. This technique is

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:26.780
popular among researchers, who want to asses personality traits in hundreds,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.940
even thousands of people.
