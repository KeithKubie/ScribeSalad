ANNOUNCER:<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
 the 45th and final</i>

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:06.172
<i>President of the United States.</i>

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:08.174
(cheering and applause)

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:10.043
-(camera shutters clicking)
-Yeah.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.012
(reporters clamoring)

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:16.115
Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.117
What an incredible turnout.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.319
First, let me just say,

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:23.322
when you look
at the tragic events in Houston

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.992
and you look into the faces
of these people

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.794
who have lost everything,

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.929
I think we can all agree:

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:33.599
this has been my best week yet!

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:35.334
I mean, look at me--

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:38.071
I get to talk in a truck!

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.473
Sir, we can see
that's not a real truck.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.809
Yeah, that's right, dummy.
It's a fire truck.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.877
And I got my raincoat
and my hat.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.012
Isn't it cool?

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.015
I look like I'm helping!

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.951
How can you congratulate
yourself at a time like this?

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.487
I'm not congratulating myself.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.089
We're not gonna do that

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.257
until this is all over
and cleaned up

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.861
in two, three days max.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:03.863
I want to ask you
about North Korea.

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:07.133
You tweeted that "talking
is not the answer." So what is?

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.936
I don't know the answer,
but I do know the question.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.139
And that question is,
"What is the answer?"

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:15.274
-What? Are you kidding?
-What does that mean?

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.477
Exactly. Next question.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.813
Okay. Do you support your
party's idea to cut $1 billion

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:23.216
from disaster funds
to pay for your border wall?

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.820
Of course! The wall would've
prevented this entire thing.

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:29.755
I mean,
where did Harvey come from?

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.757
The Gulf of where?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.426
<i> Where?</i>

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.560
Mexico.

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:36.562
You said it, not me!

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.898
It's an illegal storm.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.033
They're sending
their worst winds,

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.635
their hardest rains.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.971
They're some bad storm-bres.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.174
-That makes no sense!
-This is not real!

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:49.842
You can't be mean to me!

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.777
I'm wearing my raincoat.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.980
I'm a storm-time president.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:57.116
I'm steering the ship,
I'm leading the truck.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.453
And that's why tonight's theme
is leadertruck.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.788
I mean, leadership.

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.590
Toot, toot! Honk, honk!

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:07.227
I'm the president!
Can you relief it? Let's roll!
