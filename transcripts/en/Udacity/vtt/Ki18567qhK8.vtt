00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
With the Central Limit Theorem, things become really easy.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Take a coin flip. There is a true probability p for the coin.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now we know that we sampled the coin N times and compute from it

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
our empirical mean using the formula you well know.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That it's well true that it could easily happen that p doesn't end from µ

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and that's because flipping the coin number of times is a stress and estimate of a true probability p.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now whole likely our estimates, so suppose this is a true p and I gave you three possible µ.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This one, this one, and one out here, and I put a little check marks underneath.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Check the box that is the most likely µ you might observed,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
if p is a true probability using our statistical estimator.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And of course, it's near this one.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If it the most likely one will repeat itself and the further out you are,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the less likely is to have a sample that it gets you this far out.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And now, we'll be using the Central Limit Theorem.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.000
For large N, say N large N=30, we know that the distribution of µ you might observe is Gaussian.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
For any value here, let's call this one a. The chances that we observed in µ that's smaller than a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is the same as the surface area and then the Gaussian over here.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
There's a trick you haven't seen but the probability is driving any µ

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is at least in the limit given by the height of this Gaussian.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So for any value a, we can compute a probability that µ becomes smaller than a.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And by symmetry, for any value of b, it's is equally away from p as a as on the left side of p,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
they can do exactly the same thing.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now, where does the 1.96 come from? and here's the trick, 1.96 marks the 95% confidence interval.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So we plug in the observed μ instead of the p which we don't know

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
under the Central Limit Theorem, we get the same Gaussian

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and then we compute the x which μ-x or μ+x give us these decision boundaries

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
such as the total area in these two tails over here is exactly 0.05. That's the same as 5%.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In fact, you placed half of this on the left side and half of it on the right side.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
When that's the case, the confidence interval itself carries 95% of all possible values for p,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
so the chances that p lies outside the green confidence interval is 5%,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
hence, we call it a 95% confidence interval.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Let me ask you a quiz. Suppose you go from 95% to 90%,

00:03:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
does this make x smaller, larger, or will there be no change. Which one is it?
