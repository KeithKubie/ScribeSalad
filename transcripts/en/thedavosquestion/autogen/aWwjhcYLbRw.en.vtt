Fatih: Hello YouTube, this is Fatih Alev from
Denmark, chairman of Muslims in Dialogue.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.400
I am hopeful with regards to President Obama's
election in the US.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.100
After eight years of very [pause] problematic
policies of the US administration towards

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.859
the middle east and also many other areas,
there are some hopes.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:42.170
We don't affront anything else than hoping
that Obama's [pause] promises, or what he

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.760
has put forward as strategy in Middle East
and other areas could bear fruit.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.660
And we also â€“ I also personally hope that
it will influence other world leaders to follow

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.350
the path of Obama so that we can have a better
world.
