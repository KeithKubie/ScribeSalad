JAN MIKSOVSKY: OK.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.250
Hi.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.380
My name's Jan Miksovsky.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.530
And for the next
10 minutes, I want

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.113
to give you a quick preview of
a new part of the web component

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:10.790
ecosystem.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.590
As you look at a new
technology like this,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.620
I think it's helpful to look
beyond the technological

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.970
accomplishment, and
consider the question,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.910
how will this change
what people can create?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.700
And I think any time you have a
space where people make things

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.250
and you introduce the
idea of components,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.940
you fundamentally
change what people

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.770
can create at a
really deep level.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.900
And you're bringing a huge
number of new building blocks

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.300
within people's
reach that they can

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.045
use-- it'll amplify what
they can already do,

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.170
so that they can create
something new they couldn't

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.990
have made before.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.190
In the case of web
components, I think

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.600
it's quite interesting that
because the material of web

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
components is HTML, the
change that it'll bring

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.590
will not just be
deep, but quite broad.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.340
Far beyond the audience
of traditional developers,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.940
the benefits of
web components will

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.960
extend to anyone
who can use HTML.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.890
And there are a lot
of those people.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.502
So think about
all the people you

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:15.450
know who are designers,
marketers, writers,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.010
small business
owners, individuals

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.980
that have at any
point touched HTML.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.610
There are a lot of those people.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.530
The fact they
don't even always--

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.070
aren't using
traditional dev tools.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.290
Many times they're
editing a site

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.650
in the context of a hosted
environment, so Squarespace

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.350
or Drupal or Wordpress.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.500
And as long as the site
gives them the ability

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.960
to edit bits of HTML inside
that hosted environment,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.310
they can create things.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.470
And because web
components are just HTML,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.030
it means the technology
has the potential

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.620
to amplify what those
HTML-level authors can create.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.610
All that's necessary
is that the ecosystem

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.500
expand to include them.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.180
And so a few months ago,
a friend of mine and I

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.410
founded Component
Kitchen, because we

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.765
wanted to help bring that about.

00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:09.139
We think that this
is going to be

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.980
fascinating,
transformative technology.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.610
And we wanted to help bring
web components to a mainstream

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.050
audience so that we can
help them understand what

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.810
the technology can
do for them, and then

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.070
help them find great
web components that'll

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.950
let them make their
own work shine.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.510
So tonight, we wanted to
give the first public preview

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690
of our service.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.230
So I'm going to start by
showing the basic thing

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.290
that we're starting with, which
is a catalog of components.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.870
There will be other
catalogs, other registries.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.450
Our take that we're
going after is

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.020
we'd like to make this available
to a mainstream audience,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.700
so that starts by taking the
ideas that have been proven out

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.800
in well-designed app
stores and online stores

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.470
and applying them
to this domain.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.986
So for starters,
we want to make it

00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:57.360
as visually engaging as possible
so people can understand

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.960
what they're looking at.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.620
And we want to bring in the
now-traditional community

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.200
aspects of stores, like
ratings and reviews

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.140
and recommendations, along
with tools like tutorials

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.800
to help them understand
what this can do for them

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.380
and also help them find the
components they're looking for,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.200
things that will solve the
problems that they have.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.560
We're going to walk through
just three quick examples.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.010
So I'll start with a
really basic component.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.750
This one happens to
put an interactive map

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.380
onto your website with
a little bit of HTML.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.984
And the author of
this component didn't

00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:33.150
have to do anything special.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.942
They make the source
available on GitHub.

00:03:35.942 --> 00:03:37.400
And they register
it with a service

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.410
called bower that makes it
discoverable by our site.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.190
We can go to that
source repository

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.470
and extract data about
this component, metadata

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.640
on the left, things like
a read-me on the right.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.470
So these are just basic details.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.007
And by pulling information
on all the components

00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:56.340
that have been made available,
and pulling that together

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.990
in a site, we can
advocate for the consumer

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.650
of these components,
because we can allow them

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.339
to quickly compare components
and assess the value of those

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:10.630
so that they can quickly find
the particular one that's

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.830
going to solve their need.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.450
Now a read-me file
tends to be something

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.910
that's written for a more
technical audience, people who

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.951
want to understand the
construction of something.

00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:21.490
But here, this
audience is primarily

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.380
interested in using components.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.980
And they want to use them
at the level of HTML markup.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.330
That's what they understand.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.520
So let's look at
another example.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.330
This is actually a component
that Eric showed earlier.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.190
This is the geolocation
component he mentioned.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.300
And what he's done in the
source for his component

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.220
is he's annotated the
source code with comments

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.550
that follow a
particular convention.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.610
And what that lets
him do is then

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.980
those comments describe what
attributes that component

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.140
supports, in language that's
meaningful to a wider audience.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.360
So for example, someone coming
to this can see, OK, I get it.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.215
There are going to be new custom
attributes on this component

00:05:06.215 --> 00:05:07.590
that other components
don't have.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.840
These are unique to this
geolocation one, including

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.465
things like the
latitude and longitude,

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:14.880
so they can make
sense at their level

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.430
for what these
components can do.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.980
For the third and
last example, I'd

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.950
like you to consider--
imagine for a moment

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.000
that you're not someone who's
intimately familiar with web

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
development, but instead someone
who works at the level of HTML.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.350
Maybe you work in a small
team or an organization that

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.290
doesn't have dedicated
development staff.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.120
And occasionally, you
have as part of your job,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.990
maybe it's not your
primary responsibility,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.000
but occasionally you need
to go and edit some HTML.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.730
And let's imagine you're
adding a form to your website.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.960
And you want to collect
some data from the user.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.080
And in this particular
example, let's imagine

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.230
that you're going to have a
text area into which your end

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.660
users can type in some text.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.350
Maybe when you create
this form, you'll

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.930
be surprised or
disappointed by the fact

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.900
that the standard
HTML text area doesn't

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.070
grow in size as your
users type into it.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.370
This is surprising or
disappointing to you,

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.250
because when you go to a
polished, large-scale site

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.360
like Facebook and you
type in a status area,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.040
you see that box automatically
growing as your typing.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.610
You thought that that
was part of the web.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.290
Silly you.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.070
So you'd like to have-- you
wish that you could give

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.800
your own users, the users of
your site, that same ability.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.830
So until now, that was
probably beyond your abilities

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.550
as an HTML author.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.640
In order to solve that problem,
you need to know JavaScript

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.736
and you need to know how the DOM
works at a certain level, what

00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:46.860
events you need to wire up.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.536
It's fairly complex.

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:49.910
The good news with
web components

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.440
is that somebody can wrap
up a solution like that

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.170
and create a thing you can use.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.380
It's not a recipe
like you might find

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.880
on a site like Stack
Overflow, where

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.671
you have to follow a
bunch of instructions.

00:06:59.671 --> 00:07:04.010
It's a thing you can search
for and then get a result for.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.140
So this is an example
of a component

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.920
that might fit the bill.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.790
This particular page is one
we're using as a proving ground

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.760
to test out some
ideas that we'd like

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.410
to enable for all
components in this catalog.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.850
There's two interesting
things going on here.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.130
The first is the
centerpiece of the page

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.126
is a live demonstration
of that component,

00:07:24.126 --> 00:07:25.750
because that's really
going to-- that's

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.120
what's going to sell
you on using it.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.950
So here as an HTML author
exploring the site I can see,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.432
yeah, this is the kind
of thing that I want.

00:07:34.432 --> 00:07:36.950
I want that.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.530
And then right below
it, you can see the fact

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.120
that-- you can see
the HTML fragment that

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.110
created that demo.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.530
They're live, so
you can edit one

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.160
and see how it affects
the demonstration.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.540
And as an HTML author, this
is quite reassuring to you.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.650
There's nothing--
aside from the fact

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.100
that there's this
new tag you've never

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.691
seen before, the syntax
is familiar to you.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.190
The idea that you
can set attributes

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.050
on it and type stuff inside the
tags, that's all stuff you get.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.250
So all you need to
focus your attention

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.380
on are, one of the
attributes here

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.050
that are unique
to the component?

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.620
Again, we can
extract information

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.800
about those attributes from the
source code of the component

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.700
and create here on the
right a little editor

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.160
that lets you
experiment with them.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.200
So perhaps in this example
you want your users

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.750
to feel comfortable
typing in a bit of text.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.500
And so you decide that
what you want to do

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.080
is give them a larger
initial size to this box.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.340
It's always going to be
at least five lines tall.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.659
As you edit this
custom attribute,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.530
you see it updates the
attribute in the markup example

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.280
down below.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.340
So you get, OK, this
is how I'm going

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.714
to accomplish this in HTML.

00:08:50.714 --> 00:08:52.130
And it updates the
demo so you can

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.360
see how that's going to
affect the final presentation,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.150
the experience your
users will have.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.650
OK.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.110
So now you've found
the auto-sizing text

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.290
area of your dreams.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.250
And you want to add
this to your site.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:12.100
So today, if you're not a web
developer, the tools of web

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.450
development, things like
GitHub or npm, these tools

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.850
that web developers get,
those are unfamiliar to you.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.660
So telling you to go
use those tools is not

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.610
going to be very meaningful.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.240
So now we get to the second
part that we'd like to enable.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.020
And that's to take advantage
of a core web component

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.060
feature, which is HTML imports.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.160
We can host on the
Component Kitchen site

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.720
a copy of a component
that you can

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.550
reference in HTML from any site.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.660
So as the author
trying this out,

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.360
you can click Copy to Clipboard
and then go into whatever tool

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.390
you use to edit HTML.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.550
It can be anything.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.880
I'm going to just use the
simplest one I can find,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.540
so there's HTML on the left and
then the output on the right.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.840
And you come to an
editor like this

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.910
and then paste in the code.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:13.220
And here we see a live version
of that running on your site.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.760
So on the left,
what's happened is

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.650
we've got the little bit of
HTML which you customized

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.980
on the site to get it to
look the way you wanted.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.550
Above that it's also
grabbed a script tag

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.740
that loads that platform.js
library the Polymer guys talked

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.690
about, as well as an HTML
import that references

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.824
a hosted version of this
component hosted at our site,

00:10:34.824 --> 00:10:36.240
so that you can
use this anywhere.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.650
All you needed was HTML.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.550
So I want you to think for
a moment about if you're

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.200
someone who deals with HTML
in a site like Squarespace

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.120
or Wordpress, things like that,
think about how transformative

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.620
this will be for
what you can create.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.120
Here's something
you wanted to be

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.910
able to do that until
yesterday was something

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.040
that was too difficult.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.510
And now it's something, it's
just a matter of cut and paste.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.060
So you can see that this skill
you have, just the ability

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.500
to feel comfortable
looking at HTML

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:18.240
and editing it, that skill
you have has suddenly become

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.070
amplified to be so much
more valuable and powerful.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.560
It's the existing
skill you have.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.120
And suddenly now you're
able to create new stuff.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.890
If you think about
whatever it is

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.650
you do in your day
job, your organization,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.580
your company There may be some
service or some interaction

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.530
that you would like other
people to offer on their site.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.430
I think a web component
will be a great way for you

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.890
to deliver that.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.160
And at Component Kitchen,
what we want to do

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.640
is help you find
that audience, help

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.980
people find your component,
understand what it can do,

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.540
and then use it.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.910
So that's almost all
the time I've got.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.037
I did want to point
out-- I'd encourage

00:12:06.037 --> 00:12:07.120
you to check out the site.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.000
It's component.kitchen.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.020
Yay for new top-level domains.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.595
And there's a link to
an RSS feed we offer.

00:12:16.595 --> 00:12:18.220
We've already found
this pretty useful.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.950
It tracks all new components
that are published.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.890
So if you wanted to see
what people are doing,

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.600
this is a good way
to find out about it.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.190
And then finally,
I'd encourage you,

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.370
if you've got your phone handy,
your laptop, go to Twitter.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.260
Follow us on @ComponentK.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.670
We'd love to hear
what you think.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.780
Thank you.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.145
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:37.145 --> 00:12:39.651
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, Jan.

00:12:39.651 --> 00:12:40.150
All right.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.610
Thanks.
