00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.360
It's...
[Interrupting] I think you should...

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.580
Go on, try again.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.180
It's time for...
[Interrupting] It's time for you and me to go and....

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
We all know that it’s not always easy trying
to do two things at the same time,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.700
but often we actually do it without even noticing.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.840
Why is it sometimes easy and sometimes hard?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.119
In this activity, you and your children will
investigate

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:46.000
why some types of multitasking are much harder
than others.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.969
Have you ever tried to do two things at the
same time?

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:50.969
No!

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.859
Stand on one leg, then turn this round like
that.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:06.460
Then you have to try and draw a 6 in the air.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.550
Why is that so hard?

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.940
Rotating your foot in one direction and trying
to rotate your arm

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.300
in the opposite direction is hard

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.530
because you are using the same part of your
brain to guide both limbs.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.859
We say that these two tasks “interfere”
with each other.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.750
So I've got some other tasks here that we
can also try and do at the same time.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.649
You’ll need six tasks all together.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.200
We used turning your arm clockwise, turning
your foot anti-clockwise,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.030
reading, listening to someone talk, counting,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.510
and listening to someone else count,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.790
but you and your children could try coming
up with your own.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.179
You'll see that each one is identified as
being a 'body', 'words' or 'numbers' task.

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.439
Highlight these as you go through, to get
your child thinking

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.340
about whether the task's identity might have
an effect.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.469
Pick one from the top.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.469
Moving your arm.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.390
And pick one from the side.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.560
Reading! OK, what I'd like you to do is read
a page of your book,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.930
whilst turning your hand round like that.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.400
Aaah that's easy!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.870
Go on then, show me, I bet it's not!

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.800
[Reading] Tilly and her friends...

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.250
Reading and moving your arm use different
parts of your brain,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.380
so there is less interference which makes
the tasks easy to do at the same time.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.530
Let's mark on here whether it's easy or difficult.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.180
So you said it was
Easy!

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.890
So we put a big tick here...

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.810
Record your results in a table.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.640
This is a good way to start observing the
results of your experiments,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.890
and will also help you figure out whether
there is a pattern

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.130
to which type of activities are difficult
to do at the same time.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.330
Listening to me speaking and reading at the
same time.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.040
It's...
[Interrupting] I think you should...

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.310
Play around with the various combinations
and ask lots of questions as you go.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.940
Is that hard or is that easy?

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.940
Hard!

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.620
You should find that tasks of the same type,
which are using the same areas of the brain,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.420
will cause more confusion,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.670
while tasks that use different areas of the
brain are easier to perform at the same time.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.200
You move your hands all the time and you move
your feet all the time,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.710
why is it so hard to do at the same time?

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.650
I couldn't move them the different ways!

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.270
Do you think one reason they were so difficult
is that they were so similar?

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.270
You can also overcome this interference with
practice.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.450
You’ll probably find patting your head and
rubbing your stomach hard at first,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.620
but with practice it becomes easier and easier
as your brain learns

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:54.440
to treat that particular combination as one
single activity, rather than two.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.440
We've had loads of fun today.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.920
