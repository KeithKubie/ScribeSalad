00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.170
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience?
Nope.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.710
Do you take hormones or anything or no.
No,
but I could,
I could transition,

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:09.990
but then I've got this,
I've got these boy genetics going on in me.

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:13.080
I really think it's jeans.
I think they're going to find out how it works,

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.430
but I can't prove that at the moment.
But if I transition over,

6
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:21.540
then I'll just be on the other side of this kind of fence that we give
ourselves.

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.340
And I've decided,
okay,
I'm gender fluid.

8
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:25.770
I'm just going to have like a superhero boy mode and girl mode.

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.070
Like the human torch can go flame on the flame off.
So I'm going,

10
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.150
when do you do decide?
Some days today I'm boy mode.
I can,

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590
but I tend to,
uh,
I do sort of block periods now,

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.700
but what I campaign,
I mean girl mode,
but I'm doing films,
dramatic films.

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.230
I've been boy mode.
Um,
and I suppose a transgender character to think about it.

14
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.330
Not Ready now,
but it's easy for me to be in girl mode because then if I can,

15
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.730
if I can deal with that.
And you know,

16
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:57.720
some people stare at you and I have a confidence now I carry myself with a

17
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.390
certain confidence.
They go,
oh,
he seems to be quite confident.

18
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:03.600
So I'm just relax about that and I can,
I can actually,

19
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.360
I can control other people's that embarrassment because if they don't know what

20
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:10.010
to do,
I'd say,
hi,
how are you?
Can I have a cup of tea?
Oh yeah.
Well we sell to,

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.550
oh no,
that's why you're here.
I don't know.
Okay.

22
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.990
So I can just relax people by just chatting to them.
Um,

23
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.140
and then boy meds quite easy for me to do cause I just,

24
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.740
I just right to just be yourself.
I scrub up quite well.
And boy,

25
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.780
do you have you but you've given thought to transitioning.
Yup.
Yeah.

26
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.760
Yeah.
Um,
but uh,
you know,
the part of me wants to be,
um,

27
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.850
Steve McQueen and greatest skate and part of me wants to be Elizabeth Taylor in

28
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.480
looking like a home in a cat and he was afraid of Virginia Woolf there cat on a

29
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:44.490
hot tin roof,
more like,
which I just saw on the plane yesterday.

30
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.740
So these are the two books like go over to another guy.

31
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.500
Well I kind of both of them and as a kid I thought you know,

32
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.360
kind look more like Clinton,
uh,
at the,

33
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.060
the Steve McQueen because I kind of fascinated with Steve McQueen and they,

34
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.560
well he went through to get to where he was and he was so driven.

35
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.260
I don't actually know about this Steve McQueen story because you know that he

36
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:06.261
was in a film with Paul Newman and he was like 93rd on the list of credits

37
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:10.110
somewhere.
Someone up there likes me.
If you watch it,
you can see him.

38
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:14.550
There's a knife fight between pulling him and Steve Mcqueen and he's like a

39
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.910
heavy,
you know,
young thug hit kind of heavy guy,

40
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.850
but he's just a small player.

41
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.770
And then the second phone he's in with them is tiring and fair now where they

42
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:30.771
are equal billing and I think Paul Newman is first and Steve McQueen is higher.

43
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.040
If you look at,
if you look at the names on the poster,

44
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.340
Paul Newman comes in from the left,
so he's named his first.

45
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.090
Steve McQueen is on the right bar higher than full,
uneven.

46
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.180
That's how they got that equal billing without,
you know,

47
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.090
how do you put equal billing if you're going to stop for the light reading from

48
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:52.620
the left,
right.
But,
uh,
and if you remember the film,
they come at it as two,

49
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.540
two guys,
you say?
Yeah.
That both decent guy there.
Yeah.
These are both heroes.
