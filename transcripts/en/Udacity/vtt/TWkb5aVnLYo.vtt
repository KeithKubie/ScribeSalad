00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.200
When thinking about
creating a community,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.086
I want you to think about why someone
would want to join your community.

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:10.980
One of the reasons people join
communities is because they enjoy it.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.150
If people are internally motivated,
you'll see more long term,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.450
sustainable relationships made.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.910
There's also the goal of creating
a community that has a good balance

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.830
between people enjoying or
having fun in your community, but

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.520
also getting use out of it.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.890
Let's hear from Amir and

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.980
Telly on other tips on how to
engage with your community.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.998
&gt;&gt; So, a community is a group of people,
who share the same mission or

00:00:35.998 --> 00:00:40.480
passion and have the same goal,
want to achieve the same goal.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.030
A community could be anything from,
a physical community.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.664
People come and meet and talk about
something all the way to an online

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:50.679
community, and
we see a lot of these happening lately.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.805
So, first of all you need to understand
what is the need, what is the mission?

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:58.140
A community is a part,
is a group of the mission, so

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
if you have a mission that needs
a community, that needs the scale.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.580
Then that's a good hint,
that you need a community.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.090
It's also really, a way for
you to achieve something.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.289
So think about,
what do I want to achieve?

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:16.310
And if I can use other people's passion,
to get what I want to achieve.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.080
Just know that it needs to
be a joint passion, right?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.350
You need to work with them
towards a joined goal.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.200
So, first of all,
you need to be very engaged with them.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.870
They're volunteers.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.040
They're passionate about what your
trying to solve, but you always need to

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.230
engage, be transparent, tell them
we found this bug, we're fixing it.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.560
Make them feel that they
are part of the process.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.470
In order to build a value for
your community,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.830
you need to come up with three things,
which I think are very important for

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.910
every member of the community.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.470
Growth, fun, and belonging.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.292
So, if you analyze what
are the aspects of your community that

00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:59.849
contribute to the members growth,
fun, and belonging.

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.363
These are the three things that will
create the value for your members and

00:02:04.363 --> 00:02:05.400
maintain them.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
Not every start up needs
an online community.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.530
Many startups are just about
a user interaction, right?

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.890
Mint is an amazing app, but
it doesn't need a community.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.400
It has interaction,
which is simple and intuitive, and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.960
does not require community.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.370
There are other startups,

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.050
lately that really rely on
a community to be successful.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.490
Sometimes they rely on two
communities to be successful, and

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.700
it's really important, and
it provides you with a scale,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.670
that you don't have if you
don't have this community.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.075
So a lot of the startups need social
interaction, a lot of the market places.

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:47.450
These are types of start ups
that really need a community.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.830
When you want to seed interaction,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.390
when you have interaction imbedded into
the app that requires a lot of people.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.210
So good examples for companies
that need community are Uber for

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.030
example, a community of drivers.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.140
A Messenger would be a good example.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.878
Google, of course we have a big
community of world developer community.

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:14.080
A place where you have a marketplace
would be a good example.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.600
So a good way to get people to join
a community is have a good goal.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.800
If the goal would be I
want to make money for

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.640
myself, that's probably not a goal where
you can get a lot of people to join you.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.160
Right?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.714
But getting people educated all
over the world is an amazing goal.

00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:31.442
And you can really get people inspired.

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:35.060
And very engaged with this type of goal.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.097
A community of one person or
two people is probably boring, and

00:03:38.097 --> 00:03:39.601
it's not really a community.

00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:42.970
You need to have critical mass
in order to start a community.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.724
There's a process called seeding,
where you have a call to action, or

00:03:47.724 --> 00:03:51.776
you hack into other communities
to seed your own community.

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:52.790
So think of it.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.300
There's many ways to create to
do the seeding of the community.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.630
One of the things would be to go to
another community, and say hey guys,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.630
we're opening a new community,
why don't you join us?

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.130
Another way is to go through,
social channels.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.789
And talk about your passion,
about the mission and

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.094
get people excited about them.

00:04:12.094 --> 00:04:16.959
I've seen startups that just have a
coffee, and talked about certain topic.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.130
Before they even started a community,
they just say hey guys if

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.820
your interested in this topic,
come to mission.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.272
A street in San Francisco.

00:04:26.272 --> 00:04:28.570
Have some coffee with us and
we'll talk about this.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.151
Once you get people excited and engaged,
you can create a online community or

00:04:32.151 --> 00:04:33.760
an offline community out of that.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.970
The way to grow a community
from a small community or

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.960
a big community, is to think about
the value for the members, right?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.810
How can, creating a bigger community
will add more value to the members?

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.080
Some people call it the K factor,
the virality.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.301
You need to think about what
incentives are there, for

00:04:56.301 --> 00:05:00.166
people inside the community to
add more people to the community.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:02.803
Right?
What is the incentive, what's in it for

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.452
them, to grow the community.

00:05:04.452 --> 00:05:07.176
Some communities don't
feel like growing, right?

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:11.828
Some communities say hey I want to keep
my community size small because I know

00:05:11.828 --> 00:05:12.927
everybody here.

00:05:12.927 --> 00:05:14.691
And that could be amazing, right?

00:05:14.691 --> 00:05:16.977
A lot of our,
Google developer communities,

00:05:16.977 --> 00:05:18.742
are small because of that, right?

00:05:18.742 --> 00:05:22.945
They don't want ten thousand
people in which they don't know.

00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:26.359
But if you want to grow and
if you want to scale, you'll need to

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:30.376
build incentives, to get people
excited about growing the community.

00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:33.980
Okay, I think the key things with
running a good community is treating

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.150
your community well.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.040
Being communicative transparent, having
a joint mission that is passionate for

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.140
you, and passionate for the community.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.120
Keep fostering a community.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.760
Make sure that you maintain the
community, that people don't drop off.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.498
A big mistakes that I see startups do,
is they create a community but

00:05:54.498 --> 00:05:56.970
they don't invest in the community.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.170
So I think investing in
the community is very important.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.810
Take the fun very seriously.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.010
Take the growth very seriously.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.880
Take the belonging very seriously.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.010
And always think of how
do I invest in these, and

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.880
how do I maintain my community.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.860
A community is something
very precious and

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.390
if you don't invest in it, it will die.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.340
And getting in the community
the second time,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.970
is like getting someone to fall
in love with you the second time.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.520
Itâ€™s really hard.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.910
So, investment and continue and
maintain your community.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.770
So, when I joined develop
relations on Google,

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.880
I was tasked to create a Google
developer communities.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.880
These are communities of developers
that meets on a monthly or

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.280
quarterly basis to
talk about technology.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.484
So the first thing I did was,
to source community leaders.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:45.666
So I came, and I tried to find good
speakers, where people are passionate

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:49.730
about communities and just say,
hey, I'm starting this community.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.310
The mission is to empower people through
technology, you want to join me?

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.430
Most of them said no.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.620
Some of them said yes.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.360
Those are those who wanted to
actually work with me, and

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.250
to create this community.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.100
Join me, and we just had coffee, and

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.190
we talked about how do
we create the community?

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.640
So they started creating
their own community, but

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.350
the key was to maintain them, right?

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.780
To keep them passionate.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.670
So every month I just went to the best
restaurant I could find in the area,

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.760
gathered them together and
just talked about cool stuff.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.760
So I created a meta community,
of my community leaders.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.172
They felt that they're empowered.

00:07:27.172 --> 00:07:30.669
They felt that they're amongst people
that are very passionate about

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:33.046
these things, and
they feel that they belong.

00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:36.279
So I actually managed to get
them excited about building

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:38.380
communities for me.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.872
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so community management.

00:07:40.872 --> 00:07:47.960
I think, first and foremost it's about,
really understanding your users, and

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.030
what they need, and how to connect them
in ways that are meaningful to them.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.540
So for us,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.700
a lot of it was understanding that we
need the moderator in every community.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.690
So, we went and did that.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.626
Or understanding that we needed
very specific guidelines,

00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:07.481
because this is a community, it's about
sharing and people get confused about

00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:11.125
what is sharing, what isn't sharing,
what kind of things can you share?

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:13.400
And we kind of learned that
from our community and

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.630
from our users as they
were doing these things.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.598
Sometimes we thought, oh, this is okay,
but then we got [INAUDIBLE] from

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.750
the community saying,
that actually offended me.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.705
So you kind of learn it over time,
and you define the guidelines.

00:08:23.705 --> 00:08:27.105
And we realize that it's very necessary
to have community guidelines,

00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:29.063
that kind of explaining exactly why and.

00:08:29.063 --> 00:08:34.049
Once you have those, people will
respect that and abide by that.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.058
So if they do something that's kind of
wrong and you kind of tell him,

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:40.380
oh it's on the guidelines, so they're
okay, and they're not offended by it.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.979
The role of a moderator is just
making sure that everybody sticks by

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:47.965
the guidelines, so if they try to
pull something that's irrelevant, or

00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:50.561
not family friendly,
or not sharing related.

00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:54.801
They will just, you know, moderate that
content out, and explain to the user

00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:58.490
that, because it's a lot of times
it's not intentional, right?

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.760
The user was just genuinely

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.730
thinking that they could
use this platform for this.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.180
So they just want to
see this explanation,

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.970
and be referred to the guidelines.
