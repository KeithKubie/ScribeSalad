that this doesn't seem normal to me you
 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.210
that this doesn't seem normal to me you
know and that's enough and they'll tell

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220
know and that's enough and they'll tell
 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.559

not lots people lots of people have kept

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519
not lots people lots of people have kept
 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.430
not lots people lots of people have kept
these problems and that's the biggest

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440
these problems and that's the biggest
 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.759
these problems and that's the biggest
problem is is that we attached shame to

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769
problem is is that we attached shame to
 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.590
problem is is that we attached shame to
it you know and that's it's hard to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600
it you know and that's it's hard to
 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.020
it you know and that's it's hard to
admit that and there's nothing to be

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030
admit that and there's nothing to be
 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.690
admit that and there's nothing to be
ashamed about no it's not your fault

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700
ashamed about no it's not your fault
 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.460
ashamed about no it's not your fault
your fault and that's the worst part of

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470
your fault and that's the worst part of
 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.809
your fault and that's the worst part of
it if people think it's their fault or

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819
it if people think it's their fault or
 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.750
it if people think it's their fault or
that you can just snap out of it you can

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760
that you can just snap out of it you can
 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.339
that you can just snap out of it you can
in nine you can't do it on your own

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349
in nine you can't do it on your own
 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.170
in nine you can't do it on your own
sometimes you need friends and you need

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
sometimes you need friends and you need
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.990
sometimes you need friends and you need
treatment and that's that I think that's

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000
treatment and that's that I think that's
 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.849
treatment and that's that I think that's
the biggest myth is that you can just

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859
the biggest myth is that you can just
 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.860
the biggest myth is that you can just
stab yourself out of it or that you're a

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870
stab yourself out of it or that you're a
 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.270
stab yourself out of it or that you're a
coward something like that

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280
coward something like that
 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.000
coward something like that

but but yeah but certainly the idea the

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050
but but yeah but certainly the idea the
 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.530
but but yeah but certainly the idea the
same direct yeah that these two things

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540
same direct yeah that these two things
 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.450
same direct yeah that these two things
that usually go together are not going

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460
that usually go together are not going
 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.800
that usually go together are not going
together and you think they would always

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810
together and you think they would always
 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.570
together and you think they would always
go hand-in-hand but they don't know but

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580
go hand-in-hand but they don't know but
 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.160
go hand-in-hand but they don't know but
yeah in that case I think you were just

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170
yeah in that case I think you were just
 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.860
yeah in that case I think you were just
