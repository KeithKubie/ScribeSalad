Vsauce! Kevin here. Hardtack is a type of
cheap, long-lasting biscuit used for sustenance

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:11.510
on long military campaigns and voyages at
sea. &nbsp;It's made of just flour, water and

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.000
salt and is baked 2-3 times to remove all
moisture and can last for years. It's so hard

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.570
that soldiers during the American Civil War
would break it up with the butts of their

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.360
rifles and then add water or coffee just to
be able to eat it.&nbsp;The Minnesota Historical

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.059
Society has a 150 year old piece of hardtack
that they believe is still edible to this

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.059
day!

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.859
Pemmican consists of lean dried meat crushed
into a powder and mixed with hot rendered

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.909
fat. Invented by Native Americans, it can
last for years and it's traditionally made

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.989
like this: Game meat like Buffalo or Elk is
cut into thin slices and dried, then pounded

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.809
into powder and mixed with melted fat at a
ratio of one to one. And it was used to survive

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.679
long journeys where food was scarce

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.109
Jerky made out of beef or turkey can last
one to two years depending on moisture level

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.820
and how it's cured. Jerky is meat trimmed
of fat which would spoil quickly and then

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.950
dried and salted to inhibit the growth of
bacteria.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.650
MRE or Meal, Ready To Eat is a self-contained
field ration used by the military that depending

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.800
on storage conditions can last anywhere from
a month to five years. &nbsp;Its contents can

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.500
vary for example MRE 2013 Menu 9 includes
Beef Stew, Peanut Butter, Jelly, Wheat Snack

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.890
Bread, Nuts And Raisins Mix, Pretzels, Cocoa,
Hot Sauce, An Accessory Packet, Spoon and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.500
Flameless Ration Heater. And the packaging
is designed to withstand parachute drops of

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.430
1,250 ft (380 m) and non-parachute drops of
98 ft (30 m).

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.130
Thrive is a company specializing in emergency
preparedness offering an entire pantry of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.280
long term stored foods. &nbsp;Including freeze
dried beef dices that last up to 25 years

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.490
in a sealed can or freeze dried ice cream
sandwiches that last up to two years after

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.020
opening. They also have front-loading food
rotation shelves and emergency kits filled

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.939
with things like rope, dust masks, waterproof
matches, can opener and more.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:16.780
Honey can never spoil. And it's because it
contains very little water, is extremely acidic

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.030
and contains hydrogen peroxide.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:55.620
Here are some more foods that last a very
long time.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.349
Despite a popular myth claiming they have
an indefinite shelf life Twinkies do in fact

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.749
spoil. And it happens after about 25 days
- which is a long time in the world of baked

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:11.599
goods and it's because they lack dairy products
but much shorter than their purported immortality.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.060
One of the only commercially sold food items
that has an absolute expiration date is infant

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.029
formula because the nutrients deteriorate
and it's actually one of the only food products

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.230
the federal government regulates regarding
dating.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.329
Dates on food refer to either "use by" dates
- the date which the manufacturer decides

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.629
the product will be at its best or "sell by"
dates - the date which stores use as a guideline

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.389
for how long they can display perishable items
like meat or milk, both of which are not set

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.019
dates for which the food will go bad and in
most cases the food will stay edible much

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.220
longer, especially with proper storage. Your
best bet for knowing when food has gone bad

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.819
is by smelling and examining it before consuming.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.510
And while a healthy human can survive roughly
eight weeks without any food - the shelf life

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.269
on humans without drinking water is only about
3 to 5 days. &nbsp;So keep in mind that all the

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.359
corn starch, vinegar and maple syrup in the
world won't help you survive if you don't

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:15.649
have drinking water - and always thanks for
watching.
