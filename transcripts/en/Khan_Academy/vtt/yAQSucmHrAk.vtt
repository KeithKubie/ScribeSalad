00:00:00.574 --> 00:00:02.490
The first realization
that there were actually

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.470
distinct layers of the earth
came from this guy right

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.029
over here, Andrija Mohorovicic.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.800
And I apologize ahead
of time to any Croatians

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.660
for butchering any
of the pronunciation.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.420
And he was a meteorologist
and a seismologist.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.130
And he was the
first one to notice,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.040
in 1909, when there
was an earthquake.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.760
There was an
earthquake in Croatia,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.120
a little bit
southeast of Zagreb.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.600
So the earthquake was
roughly over here.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.089
And lucky for him and
lucky for us, before that

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:33.630
earthquake there
was actually a bunch

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.700
of seismographic stations
already in the area.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.765
And all these
seismographic stations are

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:41.200
are, essentially,
instruments were installed

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.310
so that if there
was any essentially

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.170
seismic waves
passing, they would

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.880
be able to measure it
when the waves got there.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.600
And what was
interesting about this,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.170
Andrija realized that if
the entire earth was just

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.470
kind of a uniform materials--
let's draw that scenario--

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.920
it would get denser
as you go down.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.490
And so you would have
kind of this refraction,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.710
this continuous refraction, or
these curved pats, happening.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.630
But he realized that, let's
say we had an earthquake

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.390
right over here, so this
is the uniform case.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.760
Uniform.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.050
Uniform layer, only one layer,
although it does get denser.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.710
Then the closer you
are to the earthquake--

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.360
so waves would get
there first, then waves

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.310
would get over there, then
waves would you get over there--

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.329
and these are the body waves.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.870
These are the ones
that are traveling

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.630
through the earth's crust.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.840
But in general, the further you
are away from the earthquake,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.580
or the time it takes for
the waves to get to a point,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.640
is going to be proportional
to the distance

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.830
that point is away
from the earthquake.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.300
So you would expect to
see something like this.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.440
So if you were to plot
on the horizontal axis,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.490
if you were to plot distance,
and on the vertical axis

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.030
you were to plot time, you
should see something like this.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.780
You should see a straight line.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.140
And that's just
because it's traveling

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.396
roughly the same velocity
along any of these arcs.

00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:09.979
It's maybe getting a little bit
faster as it's getting deeper.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.520
But roughly the same
velocity as it's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.780
traveling along these arcs.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.200
And the distance
of these arcs are

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.850
proportional to the
distance along the surface,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.340
along the distance
of the surface.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.764
So essentially, the time is,
they're all traveling roughly

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:22.680
at the same velocity,
and their just traveling

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.800
different distances,
so the time it takes

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.720
is just going to be
proportional to the distance.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.000
But he noticed
something interesting.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.080
When he actually measured when
the waves from that earthquake

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.640
reached different
seismographic stations,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.230
he saw something interesting.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.800
So this is in the
theoretical, if we

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.260
had a kind of this
uniform one-layered earth.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.020
But he saw something
interesting.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.650
So once again, this
is the distance,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.550
and this right
over here is time.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.930
And at 200 kilometers,
at 200 kilometers away

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.980
from the earthquake--
so until 200 kilometers,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.650
he saw exactly what you would
expect from a uniform earth.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.270
It was just the time took was
proportional to the distance.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.010
But at 200 kilometers, he
saw something interesting.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.190
All of a sudden, the waves
were reaching there faster.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.030
The slope of this line changed.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.670
It took less time for
each incremental distance.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.377
So for some reason,
the waves that we're

00:03:17.377 --> 00:03:19.460
going at these farther
stations, the stations that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.184
were more than 200
kilometers away, somehow

00:03:23.184 --> 00:03:24.100
they were accelerated.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.830
Somehow they were
able to move faster.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.120
And he's the one that
realized that this

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.180
was because the waves
that were getting

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.130
to these further stations must
have traveled through a more

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.070
dense layer of the earth.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.850
So let's just think about it.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.660
So if we have a
more dense layer,

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.110
it will fit this
information right over here.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.190
So if we have a layer
like this, which we now

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.640
know to be the crust, and then
you have a denser layer, which

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.760
we now know to be the mantle,
then what you would have is--

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.750
so you have your earthquake
right over here, closer

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.860
by, while you're still
within the crust,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.520
it would be proportional.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.200
It would be proportional.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.970
And then let's say
that this is exactly,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.450
this right here is
200 kilometers away.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.360
But then if you go any further,
the waves would have to travel.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.800
They would travel, so
they would go like this.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.050
And then they would get
refracted even harder.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.560
So they would get refracted.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.709
So they would be a little
bit curved ahead of time.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.750
But then they're going to
a much denser material.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.955
Or it's not gradually dense,
it's actually kind of a all

00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:27.913
of a sudden a considerably
more dense material,

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:30.480
so it will get
refracted even more.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.072
And then it'll go over here.

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:33.530
And since it was
able to travel all

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.113
of this distance in
a denser material,

00:04:35.113 --> 00:04:37.790
it would have traveled
faster along this path.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.670
And so it would get
to this distance

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.010
on the surface that's more
than 200 kilometers away,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.630
it would get there faster.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.840
And so he said that there
must be a denser layer

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.710
that those waves are
traveling through,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.420
which we now know
to be the mantle.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.710
And the boundary
between what we now

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.870
know to be the crust
and this denser layer,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.230
which we now to be the mantle,
is actually named after him.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.370
It's called the
Mohorovicic discontinuity.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.320
And sometimes this is
called the Moho for short.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.410
So that boundary between
the crust and the mantle

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.460
is now named for him.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.020
But this was a huge discovery,
because not only was he

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.855
able to tell us,
based on the data--

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:25.195
based on, kind of, indirect
data, just based on earthquakes

00:05:25.195 --> 00:05:27.320
happening, and measuring
when the earthquakes reach

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.444
different points of the
earth-- that there probably

00:05:29.444 --> 00:05:30.590
is a denser layer.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.740
And if you do the math,
under continental crust

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.571
that denser layer is
about 35 kilometers down.

00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:38.570
He was able to tell us
that there is that layer.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.210
But even more
importantly, he was

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.390
able to give the clue that
just using information

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.780
from earthquakes,
we could essentially

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.890
figure out the actual
composition of the earth.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.660
Because no one has
ever dug that deep.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.990
No one has ever dug into
the mantle, much less

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.592
the outer core or
the inner core.

00:05:53.592 --> 00:05:55.050
In the next few
videos, we're going

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.425
to kind of take this insight,
that we can use information

00:05:57.425 --> 00:05:59.010
from earthquakes,
to actually think

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.860
about how we know that there
is an outer liquid core

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.760
and that there's an
inner core, as well.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.160
And then, obviously,
you could keep going

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.984
and think about all
the different densities

00:06:07.984 --> 00:06:09.400
within the mantle
and all of that.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.775
I won't go into
that much detail,

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:13.120
but I'll see you
in the next video.
