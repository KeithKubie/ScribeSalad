00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.440
- [Instructor] Jian obtained
a random sample of data

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.180
on how long it took each of 24 students

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.460
to complete a timed reaction game

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.160
and a timed memory game.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.170
He noticed a positive linear relationship

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.250
between the times on each task.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.470
Here is a computer output
on the sample data.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.940
So, we have some statistics calculated

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.800
on the reaction time, on the memory time.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.500
And then he had his
computer do a regression

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.520
for the data that he collected.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.790
And then we're told
assume that all conditions

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.480
for inference have been met.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.430
Calculate the test statistic
that should be used

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.910
for testing a null hypothesis

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.280
that the population
slope is actually zero.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.930
So pause this video and have a go at it.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110
All right, so let's just
make sure we understand

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.770
what is going on.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.590
So let's first think about the population.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.870
So I'll do that right over here.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.420
So in the population,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.660
there might be some true
linear relationships.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.700
So in theory,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.500
on our x-axis, we would
have our reaction time

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.740
and on our y-axis, you
have your memory time.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.830
If you were able to plot every
single possible data point,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.370
it might even be an infinite,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.280
or near infinite, (laughs)

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.570
so it would be very hard to do it.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.403
But if you were,

00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:17.870
if there was just some
truth in the universe,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.960
it says yes, there actually is

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.940
a positive linear relationship.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.620
And it looks like this.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.630
And you could describe that
regression line as y hat.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.910
It's a regression line.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.260
Is equal to some true population paramater

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.870
which would be this y intercept.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.330
So we could call that alpha

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.890
plus some true population parameter

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.650
that would be the slope
of this regression line

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.330
we could call that beta.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.260
Times x.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.300
Now we don't know what this
truth of the universe is

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.500
of the linear relationship

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.630
between reaction time and memory time.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.040
But we can try to estimate it.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.240
And that's what Jian is trying to do.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.010
So he's taking a sample of 24,

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.200
so samples

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.630
samples 24 data.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.400
Data points.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.180
And that's much easier to then,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.540
you can even visualize it
on a scatter plot like this.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.280
So you'd have one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.558
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:16.930
14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.080
You input those data points into computer

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.180
and it does a regression line.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.060
And it's trying to minimize
the squared distance

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.190
to all of these points.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.890
And so let's say it gets a regression line

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.400
that looks something like this.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.290
Where this regression line

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.730
can be described as some
estimate of the true y intercept.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.780
So this would actually be a
statistic right over here.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.040
That's estimating this parameter.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.760
Plus some estimate of the true
slope of the regression line.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.230
So this is just a statistic,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.300
this b, is just a statistic

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.270
that is trying to estimate
the true parameter, beta.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.030
Now when we went

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.110
and inputted these data
points into a computer,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.890
we got values for a and b right over here.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.410
A is equal to this, the
constant coefficient.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.370
And then the reaction coefficient,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.203
this is just telling us,

00:03:02.203 --> 00:03:04.430
hey, for every incremental
change in the reaction,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.180
how much would we expect
the memory time to change.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.720
Or for every change in x,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.400
how much would we expect
for a change in y.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.390
So this is actually our estimate

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.060
of the slope of the regression line.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.010
Now you could imagine,

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.510
every time you take a different sample,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.040
you might get a different
estimate of these things.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.510
And when we're doing
inferential statistics,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.900
we set up hypotheses.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.430
You set up a null and an
alternative hypothesis.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.230
And then null hypothesis
is always the no news here.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.270
And no news, when you're
dealing with regressions

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.160
is that even though you might suspect

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.490
there's a positive linear relationship,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.090
even though you might see
it in the data you got,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.820
it's for your null hypothesis,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.653
you wanna assume

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.430
that there is no positive
linear relationship.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.840
So our null hypothesis here

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.600
would be that the true slope
of the true regression line,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.850
this, the parameter right over here,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.690
is equal to zero.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.490
So beta is equal to zero.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.220
So our null hypothesis actually might be

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.500
that our true regression line

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.760
might look something like this.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.060
That what y is, is somewhat
independent of what x is.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.000
And that if you suspect

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.890
that there is a positive
linear relationship,

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.210
you could say something like,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.050
well, my alternative hypothesis

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.840
is that my beta is greater than zero.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.673
Or if you suspect

00:04:14.673 --> 00:04:15.850
that there's just some
linear relationship,

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.460
you don't know if it's
positive or negative,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.910
then you might say that the
beta is not equal to zero.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.020
But here it says he noticed or he suspects

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.480
a positive linear relationship.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.950
So this would be his
alternative hypothesis.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.940
But what you then want to do

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.030
to test your null hypothesis,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.390
which we've done multiple, multiple times,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.430
is find a test statistic

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.020
that is associated with
the statistic for b

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.540
that you actually got.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.250
Now ideally, you would take your b,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.270
you would take your b,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.330
and from that,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.420
subtract the

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.750
slope assumed in the null hypothesis,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.340
so the slope of the
regression line you get

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.675
minus the slope

00:04:55.675 --> 00:04:58.170
that's assumed from the null hypothesis.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.520
And then divide by the standard deviation

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.670
of the sampling distribution

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.610
of the slope of the regression line.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.050
And if you did this,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.010
you would get a,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.850
it would be appropriate to use

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.360
a z statistic over here.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.700
Now, the problem is,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.490
is that we don't know exactly what

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.440
the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution is.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.770
But we can estimate it.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.570
We can calculate

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.730
the slope that we got for
our sample regression line

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.180
minus the slope we're assuming
in our null hypothesis,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.430
which is going to be equal to zero,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.920
so we know what we're assuming.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.960
And we can calculate the standard error

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.660
of the sampling distribution.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.980
And in fact, our computer
has already done it for us.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.050
And this is an estimate of this.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.550
And we know what number that is.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.500
So we know what all of these numbers are,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.340
but if you're using an estimate

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.630
of the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution,

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.680
we've seen this before.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.810
When we've done inferential
statistics using,

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.810
for means, it is appropriate
to use a t statistic.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.160
But with that said, pause the video.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.400
What is this going to be equal to?

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.130
Well, this is going to be equal to

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.460
the slope for our sample regression line,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.640
we know it's 14.686

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.600
minus our assumed true
population parameter,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.820
the slope of the true regression line,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.630
well, we're assuming that it's zero.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.880
So minus zero.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.140
And then we divide that
by the standard error

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.140
which is going to be,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.170
we can use this as a standard error for b.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.170
And so this is divided by 13.329.

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:39.080
So it's just going to be
14.686 divided by 13.329.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.100
And if we assume,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.320
if we're doing a one sided test here,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.500
what we would then do
is take this t statistic

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.460
and think about the degrees of freedom.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.660
And then say, and then
calculate a p value.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.180
What is the probability
of getting a result

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.010
at least this far above
t is equal to zero,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.040
or what is the probability
of getting a t statistic

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.030
this high or higher

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.330
and that would be our p value.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.270
And if that's below some threshold,

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.440
that's hey, that's pretty unlikely.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.600
Then we would reject the null and

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.230
that which would suggest the alternative.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.010
But they're not asking
us to do all of that.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.070
They're just asking us to calculate

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.010
an appropriate test statistic,

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.210
which we have just done.
