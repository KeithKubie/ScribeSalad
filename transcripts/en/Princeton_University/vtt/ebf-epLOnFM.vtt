[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.720
SARAH CARSON: My dissertation
is titled "Ungovernable Winds,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.960
the Weather Sciences in South
Asia from 1864 until 1945."

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.080
GYAN PRAKASH: Sarah as
a student is everything

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.390
that one could hope
for and imagine.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.730
So when she came in, she came
in with great credentials.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.440
And she's kind of lived up
to all our hopes and more.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.360
SARAH CARSON: I started
to become interested

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.330
in this subject --

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.170
I think it's a convergence
of several interests

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.580
that I've harbored for a
long time, starting with --

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.140
well, I come from
a very conservation

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.540
and environmentally
inclined family

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.610
that does work in
environmental education.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.590
GYAN PRAKASH: Sarah's
work brings into view

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.970
how the environment had
always been actually

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.640
an important part
of India's history,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.680
but something that
was neglected.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.690
SARAH CARSON: My
dissertation looks

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.540
at the history of the Indian
Meteorological Department,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.760
using its records
and publications

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.690
to understand how scientists
employed by the state

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.950
tried to define and delimit
the atmospheric phenomena

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.420
above South Asia.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.050
These maps show that
rainfall was really

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.220
the primary concern of
meteorologists in this time

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.200
period.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.880
And they didn't map onto
political provinces,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.310
so they could be considered
more like ecological or

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.590
climatological units.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.470
I think I've been fortunate
to have picked a project that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.790
resonates with people from
lots of different interests

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.360
and backgrounds.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.480
And I think that
that's something that's

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.280
special about the weather.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.550
GYAN PRAKASH: I think
her work will showcase

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.410
the importance of environmental
history, both scientifically

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.150
but also in its popular form.
