00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.029
I don't have any of the traits we've talked about

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.442
in this lesson, but I'm not sure if I'm a carrier.

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:05.960
&gt;&gt; Well, there're a lot of recessive traits

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.680
out there that you could be a carrier for

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.340
that, we just haven't even had time to talk

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.390
about. Like hemophilia, phenylketonuria, Tay-Sachs disease and many more.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.290
&gt;&gt; How would somebody like myself, or somebody

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.090
else find out if they had any of these?

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.070
&gt;&gt; Well, you'd actually have to be tested for each of these

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.070
conditions individually. But there are genetic

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.750
reports from companies like 23andMe and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.900
Counsel that provide information on carrier status for many of these traits.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.750
&gt;&gt; So if you're comfortable, and if you know, why

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.150
don't you tell us if you have any monogenic traits.
