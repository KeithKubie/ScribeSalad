00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This looks like a good time to define the rest of the APIs for the constructors for patterns.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here I've defined literal and sequence to say they're going to return tuples

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where the first element is the operator, the second--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if it exists--is x, and then the final--if it exists--is the y.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Those are for the components that take an operand or two,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but dot and end of line don't, so I just defined dot to be a one element tuple.

00:00:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
See if you can go ahead and fill in the remainder of this API.
