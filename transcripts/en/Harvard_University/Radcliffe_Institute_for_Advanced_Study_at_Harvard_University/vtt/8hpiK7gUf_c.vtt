00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.946
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.946 --> 00:00:04.070
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.770
Thank you for being here.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.470
Thank you, Judy, the master
of the art of introductions.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.260
You make us all sound so
good and accomplished.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.020
It's quite remarkable.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.940
Also quickly would like to
thank Dean Lizabeth Cohen--

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.700
I think Liz is there--

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.850
for your leadership of
the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.680
The entire fellowship
program staff,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.220
especially Rebecca Haley--

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.640
thank you, Rebecca, for all
your administrative brilliance.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.440
And all the other
incredible people

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.540
top to bottom who collectively
make the Radcliffe

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.610
such a special place.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.160
All the fellows--
see you in the crowd

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.000
here-- thank you for your
collegiality, brilliance,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.930
and intellectual curiosity.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.260
You're all doing
incredibly amazing work,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.770
even though I wish someone was
working on a project on time

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.470
suspension, because
the time is really

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.740
going by way too quickly.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.130
But in the time that
we have this afternoon,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.770
I would like to tell a story.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.060
It's a story about
war and the challenges

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.890
of being African-American.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.800
It's a story about
race and democracy,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800
about history and memory.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.920
It's a story about hope
and disillusionment,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.500
about optimism and tragedy.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.530
It's a story that spans
almost two decades,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.700
from one World War to
the next, and features

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.060
as its central character
arguably the most significant

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.110
black intellectual
in American history.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.180
But it may be helpful
first to take you back

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.080
to a moment in October
of the year 2000.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.160
A young graduate
student just embarking

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.970
on research for a dissertation
on African-American soldiers

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.310
in World War I is
at the University

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.620
of Massachusetts Amherst.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.670
The papers of WEB Du Bois
are housed in the library's

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.070
special collections department.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.670
This graduate student had
very responsibly in advance

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.699
gone through the finding
aid and saw a reference

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.490
to Du Bois World
War I materials.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.180
He was intrigued.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.350
He goes to the library.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.010
He asks the archivist
to see this collection.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.280
He's expecting a few folders,
maybe even a whole box

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.960
if he's lucky.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.028
Instead, the archivist returns
with six microfilm reels.

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:31.510
Hmm.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.610
Now what could this possibly be?

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.924
He loads the first reel--

00:02:35.924 --> 00:02:37.340
for those of us
old enough to know

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.100
what microfilm reels actually
are; I'm dating myself,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.660
I'm not that young, sorry--

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.990
loads the reel and turns the
machine, and slowly forwards

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.220
the film to the first frame.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.077
And this is what he sees.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:58.660
Now if you haven't
figured it out yet,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.060
the young graduate
student is me.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.310
And what I was looking
at was the table

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.740
of contents of an
unpublished manuscript

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.400
by WEB Du Bois on the black
experience in World War

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.140
I. This was followed by
the actual manuscript--

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.340
as I kept reeling, followed
by the actual manuscript,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.920
along with all of Du
Bois' research materials

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.520
and correspondence
related to the project.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.490
Needless to say, I was shocked,
thrilled, and overwhelmed.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.290
As I began to immerse
myself in this archive

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.290
and learn more about it,
I realized that it was not

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.150
completely unknown.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.430
Some Du Bois scholars had
mentioned it in their works,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.430
with a few-- most notably,
historians Jennifer Keene

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.080
and David Levering Lewis--

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.050
actually exploring
its significance.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.750
But most people when I
tell them of Du Bois'

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.910
unpublished manuscript
are surprised

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.170
as I was that day
in October of 2000.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.700
Why this is the
case, given all that

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.730
has been written about Du Bois,
would be a fascinating story

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.300
to tell.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.560
So, Judy, I might need
another year at the Radcliffe.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.160
You're going to have to
hook me up, for real.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.900
Also, as you can
probably imagine

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.570
from just looking at the table
of contents, the manuscript

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.120
itself is truly fascinating.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.790
Piecing the manuscript
together and analyzing it

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.700
would make for another
fascinating project.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.923
So, two years, Judy?

00:04:23.923 --> 00:04:25.690
Huh?

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.090
You wish, all right.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.790
But I'm also fascinated with
the story behind this book.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.390
What happened?

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.260
Why did Du Bois write it?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.100
What was it about?

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.550
Why did he spend so
much time working on it?

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.060
Why did it remain
incomplete and unpublished?

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.720
Why is it important?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.340
So as best I can in the
next 40 minutes or so,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.090
let me tell you the story
of The Wounded World--

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:01.020
WEB Du Bois, African-Americans,
and the History of World War I.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.360
"From the branches of
the National Association

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.380
for the Advancement of Colored
People to WE Burghardt Du Bois,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.820
writer, scholar, seer,
on his fiftieth birthday,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.670
February 23, 1918.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.190
Given in affectionate
appreciation

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.990
of his great gifts,
and gratitude

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.420
for the consecration
of these gifts

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.510
to the service of his race."

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.950
So read the inscription on the
silver cup presented to Du Bois

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.350
at a New York civic
club gala celebrating

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.940
his half century of life.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.190
Born on February 23, 1868 in
Great Barrington, Massachusetts

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.660
to Mary Silvina, Du Bois
in his mind and heart

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.460
was truly destined to serve
his race a young prodigy,

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.680
throughout grade
school he attended

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.370
and graduated from Fisk
University in Tennessee

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.010
before moving back to
Massachusetts, where he earned

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.820
a second undergraduate degree
from some school called Harvard

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.500
University.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.040
He stayed at Harvard to
pursue a doctorate in history,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.390
briefly interrupted by a
two-year transformative stint

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.780
at the University of Berlin.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.850
And there's Du Bois right
there, second top realm.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.240
Returned back to Harvard, where
he completed his dissertation

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.810
in 1895 titled The Suppression
of African Slave Trade

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.060
in America, becoming the
first African-American

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.564
to obtain a Ph.D. From Harvard.

00:06:31.564 --> 00:06:32.980
He would quickly
establish himself

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.730
as black America's foremost
scholar and interrogator

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.790
of the race problem.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.700
In 1903, he published
what is widely

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.740
considered the
most important book

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.690
in the history of
African-American letters,

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.860
The Souls of Black Folk.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.990
Du Bois also helped
lay the groundwork

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.910
for what we now
commonly recognize

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.700
as the modern civil
rights movement.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.820
In 1905, he founded
the Niagara Movement

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.220
to challenge the accommodations
program of Booker T.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.710
Washington, and in 1909
helped co-found the NAACP,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.760
where he served as editor
of its magazine, The Crisis.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.220
On the eve of the
World War, in terms

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.990
of intellect and influence
Du Bois had few rivals.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.940
Du Bois closely
followed the World War

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.300
from the opening guns of August.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.290
"Yet in a very real sense
Africa is a prime cause

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.590
of this terrible
overturning of civilization

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.570
which we have lived
to see," he wrote

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.260
in his landmark 1915
Atlantic Monthly article,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.710
The African Roots of War.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.790
He pinpointed the origins of
the conflict in the competition

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.440
amongst the European
belligerence

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.400
for imperial control of
Africa and its people.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.120
France, England, and
Belgium all certainly

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.210
had blood on their hands.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.490
But thirsty for
global domination,

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.090
Germany, in Du Bois'
opinion, posed a grave threat

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.610
to the world's darker races.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.030
The Allies had to win.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.040
So when the United
States entered the war

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.030
in April of 1917,
Du Bois, unlike many

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.260
of his socialist friends in
and outside of the NAACP,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.210
was not opposed.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.940
He argued that it
presented an opportunity

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.360
for African-Americans to stake
claim to their citizenship

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.030
and bring meaning to
Woodrow Wilson's claim

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.980
that the world must be
made safe for democracy.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.260
Black people had
fought in the past,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.530
and now they would do
so again with hopes

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.299
that the two warring
ideals of being black

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.960
and of being American, that
Du Bois famously articulated

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.811
in The Souls of Black Folk,
would at last be reconciled.

00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:52.430
Du Bois threw himself
into the war effort,

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.630
encouraging African-Americans
as soldiers and civilians

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.260
to demonstrate their loyalty
on and off the battlefield.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.742
But white supremacy
tested his patriotism--

00:09:04.742 --> 00:09:06.450
along with other
African-Americans he had

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:11.370
to reckon with moments like the
unjust execution of 13 black

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.170
soldiers following a racial
shootout in Houston, Texas,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:22.530
and especially the East St.
Louis pogrom of July 1917,

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.870
which left hundreds
of black people dead .

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.700
While African-Americans
certainly

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.060
pleaded for Woodrow
Wilson to make America

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.350
safe for democracy,
they also demanded it,

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.980
as evidenced by the silent
protest parade in response

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.449
to the East St. Louis
pogrom, with Du Bois marching

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:43.990
in the front.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.060
So when Joe Spingarn,
former chairman of the NAACP

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.700
and one of Du Bois'
closest friends,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.460
approached him in
early June of 1918

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.090
with an offer to become a
captain in the War Department's

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.240
military intelligence
division, he

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.960
had a momentous and potentially
career-defining choice to make.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.700
Du Bois knew that
this appointment

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.740
would arouse suspicions.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.430
But he believed that,
as he wrote in a letter

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.310
to the director of the
military intelligence division,

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.910
his decision to accept
the offer reflected

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.020
"no inconsistency with
or change of attitude

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.890
from my life long
work and opinions."

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.940
Indeed, he viewed his attitude
as one of "far-reaching

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.010
patriotism."

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.350
But just to make sure no
lingering reservations existed

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.910
about his loyalty, he wrote
Close Ranks for the July

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.800
issue of The Crisis.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.800
The Great War represented
the crisis of the world,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.990
Du Bois began.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.270
He argued that however
distant the war seemed,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:02.080
black people had no ordinary
interest in the outcome.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.150
For this reason,
African-Americans

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.180
had to make their
allegiances clear.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.820
Let us not hesitate.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.860
Let us, while this war lasts,
forget our special grievances

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.010
and close our ranks
shoulder to shoulder

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.710
with our own white
fellow citizens

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.810
and the Allied nations that
are fighting for democracy.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.330
We make no ordinary
sacrifice, but we

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.780
make it gladly and
willingly with our eyes

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.980
lifted to the hills.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.220
Closed Ranks unleashed a
firestorm of criticism.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.310
The Boston civil
rights activist--

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.350
and one-time friend--

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.570
William Monroe Trotter
labeled Du Bois,

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.230
among other insults, a
rank quitter of the fight

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.090
for rights.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.750
From coast to coast, in
newspapers in barbershops,

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.790
many African-Americans branded
Du Bois as self-serving at best

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:04.260
and at worst a
traitor to the race.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.620
For a man who had committed his
life to the cause of freedom

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:13.110
and justice for black people,
no charge could be more cutting.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.690
The captaincy offer
ultimately crumbled,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.900
but the uproar and damage
to his radical credentials

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.365
left Du Bois deeply scarred.

00:12:22.365 --> 00:12:24.890
Du Bois' attempt to
strike a grand bargain

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.560
with the federal government
and American democracy

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.700
seem yet more misguided in light
of the US military's treatment

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.370
of black servicemen,
a history which

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.340
Judy touched upon which
I'll elaborate a little bit

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.590
more detail.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.200
Approximately 380,000
African-American soldiers

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.800
served in the racially
segregated United States Army.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.720
The majority of black
troops in France

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.810
unglamorously labored in
the services of supply,

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.420
loading and unloading
ships, digging ditches,

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.470
laying railroad tracks,
and burying dead bodies.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.390
The army reluctantly
agreed to the creation

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.720
of two black combat units,
the 92nd Division composed

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.060
of draftees and
the 93rd Division

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.060
made up largely black
National Guardsmen.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.270
While the 93rd Division compiled
a stellar combat record,

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:15.080
the 92nd Division became, as
Du Bois later described it,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.900
the storm center of
the Negro troops.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.320
Racist white commanders and
deliberate neglect from the War

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.110
Department doomed the
performance of the division

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.680
from the start, While its black
officers, Du Bois' shining

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.970
examples of Talented Tenth
manhood and racial leadership,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.680
endured humiliation
after humiliation.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.040
African-Americans could point
to several notable battlefield

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.340
triumphs and moments
of racial pride.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.960
But for most black
soldiers, the war

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.860
for democracy, that Du Bois had
so enthusiastically champion

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.650
devolved into a personal hell.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.850
As the end of the war neared, Du
Bois, his credibility tattered,

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.870
his leadership in question, sat
in the most precarious position

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.910
of his otherwise-illustrious
career.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.780
Then, quite unexpectedly,
an opportunity

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.980
presented itself, one
that would profoundly

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.355
impact Du Bois' life for
the next two decades.

00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:18.300
At the October, 1918 board
of directors meeting,

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:23.730
the NAACP proposed Du Bois
spearhead production of a book

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.850
on the history of the black
experience in the war.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.370
He leapt at the opportunity.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.150
The scholar in Du
Bois was intrigued.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:37.230
But more important, here
was a chance for redemption.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.570
As a way of demonstrating
his continued ability

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.000
to organize and
lead, he initially

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.850
hoped that the book would
be a collaborative effort.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.580
He had two co-authors in mind--

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.700
Carter G. Woodson,
confounder of the Association

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.310
for the Study of Negro
Life and History,

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.060
and Emmett J. Scott, the
former secretary to Booker T.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.600
Washington, who had recently
served as a special assistant

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.940
to the Secretary of War.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.470
But Du Bois' influence
had its limits.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.780
Woodson, arguably
the most prominent

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.310
African-American historian in
the nation next to Du Bois,

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.000
insisted on receiving sole
credit for the project.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.450
Scott, arguably the most
influential African-American

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.160
in the government
during the war,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.040
had plans to write his own book.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.040
At stake was the
right to call oneself

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.340
the historian of
the black experience

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.160
in the war and the
leadership stature

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.140
that went along with it.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.800
This was a fight that Du
Bois absolutely had to win.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.070
Undaunted, he set
his sights on France,

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.110
where, as he would later
write, the destinies of mankind

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.540
center.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.060
On December the
1st, 1918, Du Bois

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.110
departed from
Hoboken, New Jersey,

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.650
as part of the official
press delegation

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.770
accompanying President Woodrow
Wilson to the peace conference

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.611
at Versailles.

00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:07.320
Du Bois spent three
months in France.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.460
He organized a landmark
Pan-African Congress

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.800
in February of 1919.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.670
His principal mission, however,
was to conduct research

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.100
for the NAACP war history.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.130
He toured the battlefields
and saw the trenches

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.960
where soldiers of
the 92nd Division

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.080
fought until the
11th hour of November

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.710
the 11th as the armistice
went into effect.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.840
He visited the encampments
and experienced,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.020
as he recalled, a touch of war.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.610
Most important, he talked with
black soldiers and officers.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.870
With military intelligence
following his every move,

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:50.860
Du Bois absorbed tale after
tale of discrimination, slander,

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.590
and abuse inflicted
upon black servicemen

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.960
at the hands of
the American army.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.930
A longtime friend, Virgil
Boutte, served as his guide.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.480
Boutte was a captain
in the 92nd Division,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.060
who had been constantly
humiliated by his fellow white

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:13.069
officers, court-martialed on
false charges of inefficiency,

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.920
seriously injured in
combat, and placed--

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.680
despite his officer status--

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.540
in a segregated hospital ward
with regular enlisted men.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:28.089
He entrusted his diary to Du
Bois, where in one pained entry

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.880
Boutte scrawled,
"no nation on earth

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.360
has ever hated a group as
the Americans hate Negroes."

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.640
"Never in my life have I
heard such an astounding

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.670
series of stories," Du
Bois wrote from France

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:49.740
in a January, 1919 letter
to his NAACP colleagues.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.290
You have not the
faintest conception what

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.720
these men have been through.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.400
It is not only
astonishing, but it

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.460
will arouse every ounce
of sympathetic blood

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.350
in your veins.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.870
He knew what needed to be done.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.960
The task ahead was clear.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.340
His commitment had been steeled.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.670
"I can say solemnly and
without hesitation--

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.360
the greatest and most
pressing &amp; most important work

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.080
for the NAACP is the
collection writing

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.320
&amp; publication of the history
of the Negro troops in France."

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.650
Du Bois returned to the United
States enraged, embarrassed,

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.006
and determined.

00:18:32.006 --> 00:18:33.380
He could not help
but to question

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.480
if his decision to
encourage black people

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.950
to throw body and soul into the
war effort had been worthwhile.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.780
He channeled his
frustrations along

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.570
with the anguish of the
African-American servicemen

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.170
he encountered in France
into the postwar issues

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.760
of the crisis.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.820
In the May, 1919 issue,
he informed readers

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.070
about his mission
in France, exposed

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.170
the racism of the US
Army, and defended

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.290
the honor of black troops.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.530
The highlight, however,
was returning soldiers,

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.690
as his words would
serve as a rallying

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.200
cry for African-Americans
in the aftermath of the war.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.430
"We return.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.880
We return from fighting.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.270
We return fighting."

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.970
History would be Du
Bois' central battlefront

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.470
in the struggle over
the meaning of the war.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.500
"Most American
Negroes do not realize

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.720
that the imperative
duty of the moment

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.870
is to fix in history the
status of our Negro troops,"

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.660
he wrote in an editorial
announcing his plans

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.620
to produce the study of the
black experience in the war.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.280
To assist in this cause, he
tasked readers of The Crisis

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.970
to help in the compilation
of this history.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:52.690
Elsewhere, he specifically asked
black soldiers and officers to,

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.530
in his words, "see that
the editor of The Crisis

00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:00.900
receives documents, diaries, and
information such as will enable

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.470
The Crisis history of the
war to be complete, true,

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.670
and unanswerable."

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:11.860
Letters, diaries, photographs,
official military documents,

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:17.050
and personal memoirs quickly
flooded Du Bois' office.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.520
In a note to the boys
detailing his battles

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.920
with racism while
serving overseas,

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.010
Sergeant Charles Isum
of the 92nd Division

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.460
expressed his pleasure that
quote "someone has the nerve

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.420
and backbone to tell the
public the unvarnished facts

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.910
concerning the injustice,
discrimination,

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.300
and Southern prejudice
practices by the white Americans

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.980
against black
Americans in France."

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.500
Du Bois promised that his
book, tentatively titled

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.070
The Negro in the Revolution
of the 20th Century,

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.500
would appear by the fall.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.140
Black veterans like Charles
Isum hoped that Du Bois

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.000
would tell their story.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.830
Du Bois intended to
serve as their muse.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.450
Generating further
excitement, Du Bois

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.080
published a remarkable
article entitled

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.950
An Essay Toward a History of
the Black Man in the Great War,

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.100
a tantalizing preview of the
larger book he planned to write

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.430
and a preemptive
strike against attempts

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.950
to distort and marginalize
African-Americans

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.010
in the history and
memory of the war.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.020
He wrote, "there is
not a black soldier who

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.490
is glad he went, glad to
fight for France, the only

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:34.320
real democracy, glad to
have a new, clear vision

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.160
of the real inner spirit
of American prejudice.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.080
The day of camouflage is past."

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.160
Du Bois' certainty
would be severely tested

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.430
throughout the summer of 1919.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.940
From Washington, D.C.; to
Chicago; to Phillips County,

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.510
Arkansas, race riots
and full-scale massacres

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.540
exploded throughout the country.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.710
The number of
lynchings skyrocketed.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.580
Black veterans found
themselves quite literally

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.220
fighting for their lives.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.330
James Weldon Johnson
labeled these bloody months

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.420
the "red Summer."

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.840
The horror of the summer was
seared into Du Bois' memory,

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.380
as he would remember
1919 as a year of--

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:26.580
in his words-- "extraordinary
and unexpected reaction."

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.560
Du Bois used his
1920 book Darkwater

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.750
to reflect on the
war, its appalling

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.110
aftermath, and his
growing disillusionment.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.330
He minced no words.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.730
In a chapter titled The
Souls of White Folk,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.820
Du Bois wrote, "let
me say this again

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.300
and emphasize it and leave no
room for mistaken meaning--

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:50.440
the World War was primarily the
jealous and avaricious struggle

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.960
for the largest share in
exploiting darker races."

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.130
Du Bois also asked a
remarkable question--

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:03.090
"How great a failure
and a failure in what

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.080
does the World War betoken?"

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.690
On both a personal and
intellectual level,

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.280
it was a question
that he had to answer.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.080
Du Bois therefore
committed himself

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.420
to the NAACP war project.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.000
He devoted significant time
throughout much of 1920

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.630
and into 1922 to drafting
several potential chapters

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.220
for what he confidently
believed would

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.720
be the definitive history of
the black experience in the war.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.570
Still exhilarated from
his Pan-African Congresses

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.110
of 1919 and 1921,
he wrote chapters

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.240
on the experiences
of black troops

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.980
in the French and
British armies,

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.790
as well as a chapter musing on
the future of the black world

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.400
in the wake of the war.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.170
Du Bois' early
chapter drafts also

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.480
reflected an attempt
to try and find

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.900
redemptive value in the global
catastrophe and his place

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.490
in it.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:58.270
This was clear in a chapter
titled The Challenge, which

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.120
summarized the difficult
choices African-Americans

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.990
and himself faced in
supporting the war.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.340
"For the moment-- and
it was but a moment,

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.920
it passed, but for
a moment the country

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.300
seemed to rise to its
mightiest stature."

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.460
Addressing his
disillusionment, he

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.630
mused, "I have been
called bitter, I am bitter

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.750
but here I saw all
the hurts, the tears,

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:32.050
the pain as in one country
and that country was mine."

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.590
Du Bois was glad that at
least for this one brief

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.610
fleeting emancipatory
moment, he could call himself

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.490
an American, that
he and the race

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:47.590
"Could think with the nation
and not as a mere group.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.170
We could rise to
mighty selfishness.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.230
The nation, our
country, the allies

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:58.160
as champions of the little
hurt folk, democracy."

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.890
The only way he could
explain his delusion

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.880
was to plead temporary insanity.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.020
"We were mad-- that is
the only word for it,

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.720
we were mad and let it
not excuse us to say

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.950
that the madness was divine."

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.500
But he still refused
to completely admit

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.360
that he was wrong.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.140
"How in the end did all this
set with our inner problem?"

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.410
he pondered.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.600
"After all it was
not a mere bargain--

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.991
it was a moving wish."

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:29.400
Du Bois pressed ahead
to finish his book.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.580
He held out hope that despite
a lack of financial support

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.770
and numerous other
commitments and distractions--

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.410
future book projects,
Crisis editorials,

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.270
speaking engagements,
Pan-African Congresses,

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.180
a venomous feud
with Marcus Garvey--

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.140
it would soon be completed.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.230
But the worsening conditions
facing African-Americans

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.440
and peoples of African descent
throughout the diaspora

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.440
caused him to further struggle
with the war's individual

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.270
and collective meaning.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.020
The walls of caste segregation
seemed to only grow higher.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.020
Racial violence became
more and more horrific.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.840
The grip of Europe
on Africa, in spite

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.440
of his Pan-African
Congresses only tightened.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.520
And then there was
personal tragedy.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.680
In January of 1922, Du Bois
lost his closest friend

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.830
and the man who best
embodied the quest

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:28.682
to reconcile race and country,
Colonel Charles Young.

00:26:28.682 --> 00:26:30.640
Young was the
highest-ranking black officer

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.740
in the army and black
America's military hero.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.080
He had been unjustly
retired from active service

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.200
during the war for
dubious health reasons

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.290
to prevent him from
becoming a general.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.430
It broke his heart.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.310
The army reinstated him after
the armistice-- conveniently--

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.600
and assigned him to Liberia.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.280
He would die in a
Nigerian hospital.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.650
Over a year after his
death, Young's body

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.440
was finally returned
to the United States

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.070
and buried with full honors in
Arlington National Cemetery.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.620
But Du Bois could not
forgive the government

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.810
for what he described
in his words

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:16.326
the "inexcusable crime" of
sending Young to Liberia.

00:27:16.326 --> 00:27:19.970
"For if Charles Young's
blood pressure was too high

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.450
for him to go to France," Du
Bois wrote in an editorial,

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.130
"why was it not too
high for him to be

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.650
sent to the
even-more-arduous duty

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.590
in the swamps of West Africa?"

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.590
"God rest his sickened
soul," Du Bois concluded,

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:37.130
"but give our souls no rest
if we let the truth concerning

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.440
him droop overlaid with lies."

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.900
This ugly reminder
of the war's legacy

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.610
provided further validation
for the new title

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.980
Du Bois had by this time
given his book, The Black Man

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.560
and the Wounded World.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.680
As the title reflected, Du
Bois' initial conceptualization

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.950
of the war as a potentially
revolutionary moment

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.380
in the reconstruction
of global race relations

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.200
have evolved to an
interpretation of the conflict

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.220
as one of the darkest moments
in modern world history.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.160
The war was a global tragedy.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.440
This sense of the war
as tragic was not solely

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.760
about the incredible loss of
life and physical destruction.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.550
For Du Bois, it also had to
do with the strengthening

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.760
of white supremacy and
continued economic exploitation

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.820
of peoples of African descent.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.920
No surprise then that
he described the war

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.020
in the opening chapter
of his book manuscript

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:38.570
as "a Scourge, an evil, a
retrogression to Barbarism,

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:42.812
a waste, a wholesale murder."

00:28:42.812 --> 00:28:46.070
Du Bois' public
announcement in 1924

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.200
of The Black Man and
the Wounded World

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.870
sparked renewed public
interest in the book.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.930
Encouraged, he
began writing again.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:58.910
By 1926, he had drafted the
bulk of his envisioned chapters.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:04.740
The book finally seemed on
the verge of completion.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.710
But he needed help.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.490
He had a massive
manuscript that,

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.490
judged by his high scholarly
and artistic standards,

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.400
still required significant
work in revision.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.470
Without time and
editorial assistants,

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:20.680
he felt that he could
not complete the project.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.840
Seeking support,
he sent inquiries

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.110
to nearly every major
philanthropic organization--

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:29.200
the Rockefeller Foundation,
the Russell Sage Foundation,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.190
the Slater Fund, the Julius
Rosenwald Fund, the Carnegie

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.700
Endowment.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.320
If it was around,
I'm sure he would

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.350
have applied to the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:40.420
All have expressed
courtesy interest,

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.750
but all ultimately
offered their regrets.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:48.050
But beyond the practical
obstacle of financial support--

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:49.470
or lack thereof--

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:53.410
Du Bois faced an even bigger
and more daunting challenge--

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.380
himself.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.390
If the war he had
supported was indeed

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:01.140
a failure, as he pondered
as early as 1920,

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.770
a war that had no positive
outcome, then perhaps

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.070
his book languishing
and in limbo

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:11.106
was destined for a similar fate.

00:30:11.106 --> 00:30:14.480
Du Bois' sizable ego,
however, would not

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.000
allow for the possibility.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.160
As he agonized over what
to do with his book,

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.410
many of the same
veterans who had once

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.950
viewed Du Bois as a
savior now grew restless

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.530
and requested the return
of their personal letters,

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.350
photographs, memoirs,
and other ephemera

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.680
they had loaned him
so many years ago.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.950
James Johnson, a Harlem
attorney and former Sergeant

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:40.700
in the 92nd division,
wanted his stuff back.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.970
Du Bois, stubbornly
convinced his book would soon

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.790
be completed, refused.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.130
Eventually, the matter
will be returned to you,

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:53.000
Du Bois told Johnson
in a 1928 letter.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.500
It cannot be returned now and
I cannot set any exact date

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.040
as to when it can be returned.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.460
Johnson would have none of it.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.190
Assuming that he was,
in Johnson's words,

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.620
dealing with a
gentleman of honor who

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.190
would spare no effort in his
endeavor to keep his word,

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:15.100
Johnson respond to
Du Bois, I trust

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.790
that you will see the expediency
of an amicable adjustment

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:22.180
of this matter, thereby
saving all parties concerned

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.170
the needless expense, loss of
time, and further embarrassment

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.430
that proceedings to compel
compliance will entail.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.150
And Martha, I'm sure you know
where that is headed, right?

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.830
Facing the threat of a lawsuit
and public humiliation,

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.910
Du Bois somehow found the
time to locate Johnson's items

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:41.590
and return them.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:46.186
But the majority of black
veterans were not as fortunate.

00:31:46.186 --> 00:31:48.810
Du Bois may not have felt guilty
about his treatment of Johnson

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.570
and other black veterans,
but he certainly

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:55.170
harbored guilt about his
decision to support the war.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:58.920
In 1930, Du Bois participated
in a published discussion

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.520
for the magazine The World
Tomorrow on the war guilt

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.610
debate that was consuming
the historical profession.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:09.030
The debate-- if Germany was
solely responsible for the war

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:13.110
and if American
intervention was justified.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.750
In his reply to the
editor, he admitted

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.230
to being swept off my
feet during the World War

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.420
by the emotional
response of America

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.420
to what seemed to be
a great call to duty.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.270
The costs had been
immeasurably high.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:31.230
"Instead of a war to end war,
or a war to save democracy,

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:35.070
we found ourselves during
and after the war descending

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:38.130
to the meanest and most
sordid of selfish actions,

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:42.160
and we find ourselves today
nearer moral bankruptcy

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.740
than we were in 1914."

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:50.106
Then, surprisingly but with
a disclaimer, he admitted,

00:32:50.106 --> 00:32:55.670
"I am ashamed of my
own lack of foresight."

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.670
"And yet, war is so tremendous
and terrible a thing

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.950
that only those who
actually experience it

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.110
can know its real meaning."

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.120
Du Bois was willing to
acknowledge his error

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.430
in supporting the
war, but still sought

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.310
to rationalize his decision
by casting himself as one

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.290
of the war's countless victims.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:16.000
It was not his fault.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.625
Never content to
remain unproductive,

00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:19.780
Du Bois turned to
other projects,

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.570
including his most notable
published work of history,

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.760
Black Reconstruction.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.680
The war, however,
stayed on his mind.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.760
In a letter to Alfred Harcourt
proposing Black Reconstruction

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.450
in 1931, Du Bois
informed the editor

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:38.650
quote "I'm going to add
next year as a second volume

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:42.370
The Black Man and the Wounded
World, that is the part which

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.430
Negro troops took in the
World War and its significance

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.840
for the world today."

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.240
Harcourt responded to Du
Bois that the proposed study

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.580
on reconstruction
quote "promises

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.070
a really interesting book."

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:59.470
He made no mention of
the book on World War.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.620
Following the 1935 publication
of Black Reconstruction,

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.110
Du Bois again returned to
The Black Man and the Wounded

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.190
World.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:09.100
A glimmer of hope appeared
in March of that year

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.800
when he secured a $600 grant
from the Social Science

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.330
Research Council.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:16.570
By this time, Du Bois' politics
had moved further to the left

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.719
and he began to envision The
Black Man and the Wounded World

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:24.880
as an explicit lesson about
the horrors of modern warfare.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.739
A trip around the world in 1936
brought even greater clarity

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:35.139
to the new significance
of Du Bois' book.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:37.900
Thanks to a fellowship
from the Oberlaender Trust,

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:42.429
Du Bois spent seven quite
controversial months abroad,

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:48.170
first visiting Hitler's
Germany, then England, France,

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:55.179
Switzerland, Austria, Russia,
China, and finally imperial

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:57.160
Japan.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.180
He returned to the United
States in December of 1936,

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:06.510
having seen firsthand the
seeds of the next World War.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:11.000
The need for his book could
not have been more urgent.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.690
This was the moment.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:17.290
He needed people to see
that the still-open wounds

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:21.460
from the last World War,
infected and festering,

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.650
promised an
even-greater disaster

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.530
in the very near future.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.450
In his mind, it
was now or never.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.610
Hoping to finally
put the project--

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.530
along with the memory
of the war itself--

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.890
behind him, Du Bois reached out
to the American Philosophical

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:40.940
Society in March of 1937.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.540
"I began my work in this
field as a conventional study

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:48.490
of the Negro as a soldier
in the World War, he wrote."

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:51.910
But over time, he
explained, "the whole theme

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:55.690
has been expanding and
developing in my min,"

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:59.560
more especially since my trip
around the world in 1936.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.140
He now conceived the
book, in his words,

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.860
"on a much broader and
more important scale."

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.910
If only he could have time and
leisure, opportunity, to finish

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.310
this work, he
pleaded, "I think I

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:16.660
can do something which will have
influence on future knowledge

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.720
with regard to war
and colored people."

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.551
$7,500 would be
sufficient, he thought--

00:36:24.551 --> 00:36:27.850
that's quite a bit of
money at that time.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:32.170
The American Philosophical
Society denied his request.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:35.934
With this final rejection,
Du Bois, disheartened,

00:36:35.934 --> 00:36:38.350
grudgingly abandoned hope that
he would finish and publish

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:39.760
his book.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.460
Despite the investment
of almost 20 years,

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.970
despite a manuscript
of nearly 800 pages,

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.650
The Black Man and
the Wounded World,

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:51.460
Du Bois' epic history of the
black experience in the First

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.750
World War, would never
see the light of day.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:00.670
So this could very well
be the end of the story.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:05.820
But we are left with
the question of why.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:11.440
Why didn't Du Bois finish
The Black Man and the Wounded

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.930
World?

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.030
I would argue that
Du Bois suffered

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:20.110
from a sort of
intellectual shell shock

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:24.040
when it came to writing about
and rationalizing a war defined

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.640
by its irrationality.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.850
In his semi-autobiographical
1940 book, Dusk of Dawn,

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.870
he wrote, "in my
effort to reconstruct

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.540
in memory my thought and
the fight of the National

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.330
Association for the
Advancement of Colored People

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.550
during the World War,
I have difficulty

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.335
in thinking clearly."

00:37:43.335 --> 00:37:47.330
Now for those of us who
are familiar with Du Bois,

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.130
not being able to think
clearly is probably

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:52.660
something we wouldn't
associate with him.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:56.190
He go on to lament that the
whole history of the American

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.350
Negro and other black
folk in the World War

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.090
has never been written.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.880
He recalled his time in France
and the mass of documents

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.790
he had collected over the years.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.040
"They deserve
publication"-- he wrote--

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.700
"not simply as a part
of the Negro's history,

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:16.110
but as an unforgettable lesson
in the spiritual lesions

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.780
spiritual lesions
of race conflict

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.600
during a critical period
of American history."

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.960
By the 1940s, it was clear
that the spiritual lesions

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.150
left on the world by the First
World War had not healed.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:35.030
Du Bois' own wounds
had not healed either.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:39.020
In a 1941 letter regarding his
alma mater, Fisk University,

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.440
possibly taking a position
of support for American entry

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.050
into World War
II, Du Bois wrote,

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.440
"I have lived through one period
of deliberate and prolonged

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:53.840
propaganda for war and partially
succumbed to it" until I really

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.410
believed that the First World
War was a war to end war

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.410
and that the interests of
colored people in particular

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:04.010
were bound up in the
defeat of Germany.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.070
"I have lived to know
better," and my opposition

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.170
to war under any
circumstances has

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.670
been immeasurably increased.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.840
But even up to the
final years of his life,

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.300
Du Bois still sought to
understand why he had supported

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.710
the war in the first place.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.650
"I felt for a moment
as the war progressed

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.720
that I could be
without reservation

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:33.090
a patriotic American," Du
Bois wrote in an autobiography

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:37.410
posthumously published in 1968.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.590
"I am not sure that I
was right but certainly

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.690
my intentions were.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.580
I did not believe in
war, but I thought

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.850
that in a fight with
America against militarism

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.760
and for democracy we would be
fighting for the emancipation

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.530
of the Negro race.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.730
With the Armistice
came disillusion."

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:57.440
That disillusion
stayed with Du Bois

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:04.550
until his death on August
23, 1963 in Accra, Ghana.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:07.420
The war consumed Du Bois.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.240
It confounded him.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.160
He cannot make sense of it as
both a personal and historical

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.500
moment.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.850
He was unable to muster
the intellectual fortitude

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:21.170
and, dare I say, the moral
strength necessary to complete

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:22.720
his book.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.450
His failure embodied
the tragedy of the war

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:27.970
he struggled to write about.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:31.300
In this sense, The Black
Man and the Wounded World

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.927
was Du Bois himself.

00:40:33.927 --> 00:40:35.510
But we are also left
with the question

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:39.940
of why does this story matter.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.450
The easy answer is,
well, it's Du Bois.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:46.390
Anything about Du
Bois matters, right?

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.480
But I believe the story
goes beyond Du Bois

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.940
and reveals to us the
impact of World War I

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.430
on African-Americans,
how it exposed

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.850
the core tensions of
African-American identity,

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:00.310
and how it shaped the
history of racial struggle

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.260
in the 20th century.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.170
For Du Bois, the history of
World War I was not simply

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.060
an intellectual challenge--

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:11.320
it was a profoundly personal,
moral, and ethical challenge

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.670
as well.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.320
It still is.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.750
Du Bois understood that
the history of the war

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:20.110
was deeply bound with
the political status

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:23.500
of black people, the
future of democracy,

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.100
and the condition of the
world that we live in.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.050
It still is.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:32.020
So as we ask ourselves
100 years later what

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.900
was the significance of
the war, what did it all

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.820
mean, why is it
worth remembering,

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.720
Du Bois in the black
experience reminds us

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.860
that these questions
are not just academic.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.520
They are critical in
2017 to confronting

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:52.230
our current sick democracy,
and necessary to trying to heal

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.880
our still-wounded world.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.790
I cannot say for certain, but I
think Du Bois would have agreed

00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:59.760
with me.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.660
Thank you.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.760
[APPLAUSE]
