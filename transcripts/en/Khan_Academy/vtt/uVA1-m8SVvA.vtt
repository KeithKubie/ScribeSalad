00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.183
- [Instructor] What we're going to do

00:00:01.183 --> 00:00:03.420
in this video is talk
about two related ideas

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.380
that are really the
foundations of economics,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.810
the idea of scarcity
and the idea of rivalry.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.850
Now, in other videos,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.510
we do a deep dive into what scarcity is.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.920
But just as a review,
in everyday language,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.940
you could think of something is scarce,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.690
a good or a service is scarce

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.610
if there's not enough for everyone.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.680
Another way to think about it is

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.120
a scarce resource is one that is limited.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.533
It is a limited resource,

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.620
and there's not enough to go around

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.620
because there are potentially
unlimited wants from people,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.373
so potentially,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.373
potentially unlimited,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.460
unlimited wants.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.380
And we could think of a
lot of scarce resources.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.760
Oil would be a scarce resource.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.550
There's a limited supply of oil.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.160
And potentially, if oil were free,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.500
there's an unlimited amount of people

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.110
who would want to use that oil.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.030
And so a lot of economics is, well,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.540
when you have a scarce resource,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.470
like oil or land or housing,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.030
how do you allocate those
resources amongst people,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.110
people who are demanding those resources?

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.690
Now, rivalry is a related idea.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.450
When we think about the
everyday word rival or rivalry,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.760
you imagine multiple parties
competing for something,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.570
and that's essentially
getting pretty close

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.770
to the economics definition of it.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.830
Something is a rival
good or a rival resource,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.320
I'll just call it a rival good right now,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.640
if, when one person uses it,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.550
it limits the ability for
other people to use it.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.390
So one,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.900
one person

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.860
consuming it or using it,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.940
consuming it

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.763
limits ability,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.290
ability

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.780
for others,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.070
for others to use.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.730
And there's a lot of
examples of rival goods

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.510
and things that are both
scarce and rival goods.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.780
For example, if I were to
put a nice, delicious cake

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.930
that could only serve
four people in our office

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.170
here at Khan Academy, where
we have 80 or 90 folks work,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.090
well, you can imagine, that
cake's going to be a rival good.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.210
It's also a scarce good
because many people,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.110
many more people are
gonna want that cake than

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.610
the amount of cake we have.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.030
But when you look at what the
definition of a rival good is,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.270
every time I, if I eat the whole cake,

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.850
that's going to limit other
people's ability to use it.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.540
And economists will sometimes
create a spectrum of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.500
how rivalrous a good is.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.440
So, for example, let me draw
a spectrum right over here.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.850
So on this line,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.500
so on the left-hand side, I
will call this highly rivalrous,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.370
which is, they'll actually use that word,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.550
but I'll just call this rival goods.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.940
And then at the other
extreme here, I'll say non,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.170
non-rival,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.190
non-rival good.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.630
And at the left end,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.060
it's pretty easy to come up
with a bunch of rival goods.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.820
If you're living in a place
where housing is tight,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.540
where all of the housing is taken up,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.620
housing is often a rival good.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.780
I live in the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.640
And when a house goes on rent,
you'll have multiple people

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.660
who are competing for that
house, or if it's going for sale.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.220
And so when one person gets
it and gets to live there,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.720
well, that's going to make it hard

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.420
for other people to use it.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.990
You could imagine, you know, land

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.200
in a lot of urban areas is a rival good.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.310
You could imagine something
like, you know, a cake,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.560
especially if there's not
a lot of cake to go around

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.240
at a birthday party.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.860
Now, what would be the other extreme?

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.020
What would be a non-rival good?

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.580
Well, there are very few
perfectly non-rival goods,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.080
but there are things that are close to it.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.060
Because at least relative
to where people's,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.860
where people are trying to use it today,

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.840
it seems like there's almost
an unlimited supply of it.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.070
One example might be
something that's close.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.740
I'm not gonna put it
all the way at the end.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.740
I'm gonna put air,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.040
air to breathe

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.130
on Earth.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.630
Now, right now it's a non-rival good.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.640
When I take a deep breath,
it doesn't make it hard

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.170
for you to take another
simultaneous deep breath.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.320
And actually, let me put
a little qualifier here,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.110
simultaneously,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.720
simultaneously.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.800
That's actually a key
qualifier for a rival good.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.480
So, for example, a hammer
is also a rival good.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.120
Because if I'm using it right now,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.120
it becomes very hard for you
to use it simultaneously.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.670
Now, as I mentioned, air to breathe,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.430
if I take a deep breath right now,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.630
it doesn't make it any harder
for you to take a deep breath.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.460
But if you were to take a
extreme circumstance that,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.900
let's say that if we were in a closed room

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.500
with a limited supply of
oxygen, well, then the air

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.940
might become something
closer to a rival good.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.440
So let me put it this way,
air to breathe outside,

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.640
while here I'll put air in

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.140
airtight, or let me put oxygen
in an airtight container

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.790
or airtight room,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.480
oxygen

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.090
in airtight

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.750
room or maybe a room that
is running out of oxygen.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.730
Well, then every time I take
a breath, it's gonna make it

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.840
harder for you to take
a breath and vice versa.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.050
There's other things like,
well, roads are rival goods,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.450
especially if we're
talking about rush hour.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.460
So let me put this right over here.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.290
So let's call this the
roads during rush hour,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.780
roads during

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.260
rush hour.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.080
The more people that are on the roads,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.090
that it's gonna make it harder

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.800
for other people to use it simultaneously.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.740
It will get all this traffic.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.300
People won't even be able
to get on the highway 'cause

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.440
there's so much gridlock.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.850
But then you could imagine roads

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.860
in the middle of the
night are non-rival goods.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.020
If I decide to take a drive

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.900
at three in the morning on most highways,

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.050
it doesn't make it any
harder for another person

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.030
to take a drive on that
highway simultaneously.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.060
So let me put it over here, roads,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.220
roads at 3:00 a.m.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.220
in most places is closer
to being a non-rival good.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.680
So I will leave you there.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.850
These are ideas that we're going

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.890
to keep revisiting in economics.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.660
But it's good to have a
sense of what they mean,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.050
and then it'll inform how we think about

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.320
allocating these scarce
goods amongst folks

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.270
and thinking about how we allocate

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.753
these rival goods amongst various parties.
