00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.259
Sci-fi visionaries often paint alternate realities
with awesome biological and technological

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.150
advancements; flying cars, lightsabers, humanoid
robots.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.660
It’s all fun and games until we see a liquid
printing device that can make the real world...into,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.570
well, Westworld.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.560
We saw these visuals from MIT and wow.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.820
This is like some nerds saw the Westworld
intro and thought, I can do that.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.509
This is a new 3D printing process called Rapid
Liquid Printing.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.119
And like the robots in Westworld, spoiler
alert, this evolves how we think about this

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.119
technology.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.770
We’re all likely familiar with 3D printing
machines.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.860
We’ve got printers in many schools and libraries,
and even though they’re more widely accessible

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.630
than they were even five years ago: traditional
3D printing still has limitations in speed,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.970
quality, and overall size.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.010
They’re stationary, extrude plastic or metal
to build on platforms layer-by-layer, and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.600
are generally…

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.860
Slooooooooooooooooow…

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.390
They’re slow.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.510
Since the popularization of the 3D printer
in the last 15 years we’ve seen at-home

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.539
model-making, specialized auto parts, and
even shoes come out of these devices!

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:11.000
But making 3D thingamabobs ain’t easy, creators
have to build support structures to keep their

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.140
creations from collapsing, or add extra bits
that need to be cut off after printing.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.859
Not to mention all the moving parts of the
machinery itself!

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.380
Enter RAPID.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.380
LIQUID.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.380
PRINTING!

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.539
It’s faster, eliminates the support structures
and instead of a flat surface, the gel provides

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.909
360-degrees of suspension and support.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.679
The printer is essentially drawing in 3D space;
eliminating something else you might not have

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.310
thought of as well: gravity.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.479
Plus, it’s cool lookin’ and fast.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.119
According to my sources at Tested.com -- it
could take anywhere from 4 hours to TWO WEEKS

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.570
to print THIS!

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.200
The RLP printed a tabletop in 10 min.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.569
And speed is not the only thing that makes
this printer different.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.460
The real secret is in the liquid gel.Depending
on the gel’s composition creators can produce

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.819
high quality substances -- even metals.

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.290
The molding sets within the gel and hardens
thanks to the chemical curing agents already

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.040
inside the tank and boom.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.260
You can bust out a table.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.170
No long wait, no extra steps, easy peasy.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.400
And what’s best is that with a big enough
tank, there are no scale limitations for this

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.540
method!

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.440
You could even make something life-sized &lt;eyebrow&gt;.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.980
But really though, this design process isn’t
coming for Westworld, yet.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.780
Rapid Liquid Printers were made with customizable
furniture in mind, but ultimately they might

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.750
be the cornerstone to opening new production
prospects in automotive and aerospace industries,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.350
where fast, large-scale manufacturing is vital.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.030
But as cool as that is, can’t we all agree
we need robots fighting it out in an idyllic

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.260
western setting?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.360
Like, we just need that in our lives.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.810
If you like science in your day, don’t forget
to subscribe.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.510
And if you’re into going beyond a 3D model
and want to see scientists simulating brains

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.800
for robots , check out how these ones doing
it with a worm.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.050
Fun fact: The gel used in the tanks actually
has the consistency of hand sanitizer or hair

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.290
gel and takes up to an hour to make.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.390
Imagine, one sec you’re just doing your
hair, and next you’re revolutionizing 3D

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.480
printing.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.870
Thanks for watching
